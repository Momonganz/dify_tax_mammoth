It provides an analysis of options to improve the tax administration of investment income informat ion. The options considered are intended to reduce compliance costs for recipients of investment income and administrative costs for Government, while improving the administration of investment income to ensure that taxpayers’ tax obligations and social policy entitlements are calculated more accurately during the year. The changes are also likely to reduce compliance costs for payers of investment income that make payments to small numbers of recipients as they will be able to shift from paper returns to digital filing. Payers of investment inco me that make payments to large numbers of recipients are expected to have systems change costs initially and may have some ongoing cost increases, however, options to improve their ability to administer withholding taxes and to reduce some costs going forward have also been included in the options. The options were developed in the context of the wider tax policy framework of a clear and coherent broad-base, low-rate tax system. A key gap in the analysis is that Inland Revenue is not able to accurately forecast the administrative and compliance cost impacts of these proposals. Indications of the direction and order of magnitude of the impacts have been provided where appropriate. A further gap in the analysis is that Inland Revenue does not hold sufficient data to fully analyse the benefits of the proposals. For example, Inland Revenue does not know how many people receive dividend income and social policy payments, or how many people receive non- locked in PIE income and social policy payments. None of the policy options restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce incentives for small businesses to operate, or override fundamental common law principles.

Within these two themes are a significant number of proposals. To manage this large number of topics we have shifted the detailed analysis of each theme, and the component proposals within that theme, out of the Regulatory Analysis section and into two appendices. The body of the Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) still contains an overview of the options considered but the detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, impacts and recommendations is contained in the corresponding appendix. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo The consultation section of the RIS provides a summary of our consultation approach with the feedback received on each proposal set out in the corresponding appendix. 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Inland Revenue’s transformation programme 1. The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put taxpayers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 2. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 3. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 4. The amount of income New Zealanders earn from savings and investments is likely to grow over the coming years as the population is aging. People tend to accrue capital as they grow older and then become more reliant on their capital producing investment income as they leave the workforce. 5. There are a large number of payers of investment income, often making payments to small numbers of recipients. For example, 92% of the 16,600 interest payers who filed interest certificates with Inland Revenue for the 2015 tax year filed less than five certificates and 570,000 of the 573,000 registered companies in New Zealand as at 21 April 2016 had between one and ten shareholders. In contrast to this, some of the payers of investment income making payments to large numbers of recipients make payments to hundreds of thousands of recipients. 6. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 7. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 8. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunit y to review current policy, legislative and administrative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 9. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are 3 not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers of complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorit ies. 10. However, Business Transformation is far more than just updating a computer system. Rather, it is a chance to fundamentally improve the tax administration system with a view to: • Helping customers get it right from the start; • Making it harder to get into debt, and easier to get out; • Lowering the cost of engaging with the tax system; and • Embedding tax in existing business systems. 11. This RIS outlines options for improving the tax administration system as it relates to the provisio n o f income information fro m invest ment. Income from investment refers to interest, dividends, portfolio investment entity (PIE) income and income distributed by Māori authorities. PROBLEM DEFINITION Getting it right from the start 12. Inland Revenue wants to make it easy for taxpayers to get their tax obligations right the first time and wants to be proactive in helping them to do that. Addressing errors after the event imposes significant costs on both Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. It is more effective and efficient to consider what can be done to enable taxpayers to get their tax obligations and social policy entitlements correct during the year, in other words, to get it right from the start. This will reduce the chance of taxpayers having a tax or social policy debt at the end of the year, or from paying too much tax or not receiving their full social policy entitlement during the year. There are two issues with the administration of investment income that impede Inland Revenue’s ability to help customers get it right from the start. Issue one: detail and frequency of investment income information 13. Currently, Inland Revenue does not receive sufficiently detailed and frequent information about the investment income that taxpayers earn and the tax withheld or paid on that income. For interest and portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, Inland Revenue doesn’t receive information about the income taxpayers earned and the tax deducted from that income until after the end of the tax year. For dividends, Māori authority distributions and interest inco me that is exempt from RWT or subject to the approved issuer levy (AIL), Inland Revenue doesn’t receive information about the amounts received by recipients at all, unless it is specifically asked for. 14. This affects Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure taxpayers’ tax and social policy obligations/entitlements are correct during the year. For example, if Inland Revenue does not know how much investment income a taxpayer earns during the year, it will not be in a position to advise the taxpayer of the appropriate withholding rate to use. Further, it reduces Inland Revenue’s effectiveness in ensuring a taxpayer’s social policy entitlements, such as working for families, are correct during the year. Taxpayers who have not paid the correct tax or received the correct social policy entitlements during the year will need to square up at the 4 end of the year, resulting in a debt or refund. Often taxpayers are unaware of these obligations, resulting in Inland Revenue paying out more in social policy entitlements than it otherwise should and taxpayers paying less tax and social policy obligations than they should. Under the current rules it is also easier for taxpayers to ignore their tax and social assistance obligations, for example, by not declaring dividend income in their tax returns. As Inland Revenue gets no detailed recipient informat ion on this t ype of inco me, it would be difficult to identify and correct this. Issue two: Identifying information IRD numbers 15. Inland Revenue is not able to attribute income to a taxpayer if Inland Revenue does not have the taxpayer’s IRD number. Data shows that 20% of the end of year interest certificates that Inland Revenue receives do not include an IRD number. This means that this interest income will not be taken into account for tax and social policy purposes – potentially resulting in the IRD paying too much in social policy entitlements and/or the taxpayer paying too little in social policy obligations. Date of birth information 16. Another problem preventing Inland Revenue from helping taxpayers get it right fro m the start is that Inland Revenue does not have sufficient information to confirm so me taxpayers’ identities. In order to be able to ensure income is allocated to the correct taxpayer, Inland Revenue needs the taxpayer’s date of birth information in some circumstances 1 . Obtaining date of birth information would also enable Inland Revenue to associate information received from other Government agencies (for example, Customs information on passenger movements) with the correct taxpayer. 17. Having date of birth information will also help other Government agencies to use information that Inland Revenue shares with them by enabling them to match the information with the “customer” information in their own systems. Joint accounts 18. Inland Revenue is only provided with one IRD number for a joint bank account. The reporting of income information for joint investments lacks IRD number information for owners other than the owner treated as the primary owner by the investment provider. All the income from that account is allocated to the owner whose IRD is associated with the account. The joint account owners then may need to file tax returns to correct their tax posit ions. 1 Date of birth information may be necessary to identify taxpayers where two or more taxpayers have the same name, where no IRD number or an incorrect IRD number has been provided or where a change of name or address has occurred. 5 Identifying information for recipients of income subject to AIL and income that is treated as exempt 19. Inland Revenue does not receive any information on the recipients of income subject to AIL or that is treated as exempt, so is unable to check that the payment of AIL or the exempt treatment is appropriate. Compliance and administration costs 20. Inland Revenue wants to minimise the costs that taxpayers face complying with the tax system, as well as the costs to the government of administering the tax system. Greater use of electronic and internet-based technology is a key enabler to achieve these objectives. The Government also wants to leverage existing business processes – for example by aligning the provisio n of information with the payment of the income and the withholding of the tax. The following problems with the current system result in increased compliance and administration costs. Compliance costs for recipients of investment income Filing tax returns 21. The current process of filing a tax return can be cumbersome as taxpayers are required to gather information about the interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions they have received from payers during the year and include it in their tax return. Selecting a withholding rate 22. Currently, taxpayers need to have an indication of the income they will earn in the tax year in order to select an appropriate withholding rate. Often taxpayers will select a withholding rate and forget to change it as their circumstances change (or they may not realise that their income has reached a threshold that requires a higher tax rate), resulting in under or over taxation. Having to work out the appropriate withholding rate, update it as circumstances change, and file a tax return wherever an incorrect rate is used, entails significant compliance costs for taxpayers. This is a particular issue for PIE investments as usually the amount of tax paid by the PIE is a final tax. Social policy 23. Because Inland Revenue does not receive information throughout the year about the investment income of individual taxpayers, it is not able to calculate social policy payments during the year to reflect this income. This necessitates the need for an end of year square-up, which often results in hardship for people who have amounts to repay, or who received too little during the year when they needed the assistance. Compliance costs for payers of investment income End of year tax certificates 24. Payers of resident withholding income are currently required to provide end-of-year tax certificates to the recipients of the income – such as year-end interest certificates and PIE investor statements. These certificates set out the amount of income earned and tax deducted, which recipients can then include in their tax return. Providing these certificates imposes 6 compliance costs on payers of investment income which may be unnecessary if that information was already held by Inland Revenue and able to be viewed by the taxpayer. Certificates of exemption 25. Taxpayers holding certificates of exemption (“COEs”) from RWT are entitled to be paid interest and dividends without having any tax deducted by the payer. The holder of the COE is required to provide a copy to the relevant withholder and must inform the withholder if their COE is cancelled. Cancellations and issues of COEs in the previous quarter are published in the New Zealand Gazette each quarter. Taxpayers exempt under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, for example the Education Act, are entitled to an exemption without needing to obtain a COE. 26. The current exemption process involves compliance costs for payers as they need to: • receive exemption certificates from taxpayers; • check the appropriate New Zealand Gazette to see if the taxpayer’s certificate has been cancelled; and • assess whether the customer can appropriately claim to be exempt under non-tax legislation. 27. The New Zealand Gazette listing is only published quarterly so may lead to delays in recognizing a COE has expired and can also show a COE as expired even though it has been renewed from the first day of the following quarter. This frustrates payers of investment income and can lead to customer complaints where the renewed COE is removed because the Gazette list shows it has been cancelled. Compliance costs for payers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue Electronic filing 28. A number of withholding returns are paper based (with no option of electronic filing). For those returns that are able to be filed electronically, there is no electronic filing threshold to require payers of a certain size to file electronically. Paper filing is slower, more expensive in terms of compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue and more prone to errors. Error correction 29. Currently, payers of investment income are able to correct errors in a period by adjusting payments in a subsequent period (i.e. if a payer does not withhold enough tax from a payment of interest, it can withhold more tax from the next payment of interest). However, the ability to correct errors in subsequent periods is limited – for example, there is no abilit y to correct errors between tax years, or even during tax years for dividends where the error resulted in an underpayment of tax. The inability to correct errors in subsequent periods results in increased compliance costs as in order to correct the error, returns must be re-filed. 30. Errors also impose a monetary cost on investment income payers as they often bear the cost where they have under-withheld from a taxpayer in error, but will refund the taxpayer the money where they have over-withheld in error. Further, UOMI is payable to Inland Revenue at 8.27% pa on underpayments of tax, but receivable from Inland Revenue at 1.62% on overpayments. 7 31. Payers of investment income currently report summary information by period that matches the payment that they are making. This makes the correction of errors more difficult as an amount needs to be added or subtracted from a subsequent period in the event of an error. Some payers of investment income resolve this by calculating a year-to-date total and then deducting previous payments to determine their current payment obligation. OBJECTIVES 32. The main objective of the options is to simplify the tax system by making it easy to comply, and difficult not to, through making better use of investment income information to improve the administration of tax and social policy. The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: (a) Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. (b) Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance cost impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. (c) Sustainability of the tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes and enable the efficient administration of the social policies administered by Inland Revenue. 33. These criteria are weighted equally. 34. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with the recommended changes. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 35. Officials have developed options to address the above issues. These options have been organised under the themes described in the problem definition section, and are summarised below. Further detail on these problems and their associated options is contained in the appendices at the end of this document. Getting it right from the start Information on income More income information - options: 36. At present Inland Revenue does not receive investor level income information in relation to dividends, taxable Maori authority distributions and inco me that is exempt or subject to AIL. The following options were considered in relation to Inland Revenue obtaining more information from investment income payers. Further detail is contained in appendix A. 8 Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – payers to provide taxpayer specific information on the amount of income earned and tax withheld (if any) for dividends and taxable Maori authority distributions . This information will continue to be required for PIE income and interest. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo Recommendation 37. Option 2 was recommended over the status quo as receiving this information would help Inland Revenue make it easier for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations by prepopulating tax returns, more accurately determining social policy entitlements during the year, and correcting withholding tax rates. Identifying information for recipients of income subject to AIL and income that is treated as exempt 38. The following options were considered for obtaining the identity of recipients of exempt income or income subject to AIL. These options are further considered in appendix A. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo. Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – Identifying information obtained for exempt income and income subject to AIL. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo Option 3 – Identifying information obtained for exempt income and income subject to AIL, but carving out any information already provided under AEOI. Partially meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo 9 Recommendation 39. Option 2 was recommended over the status quo as receiving this information would help Inland Revenue ensure that the AIL and exemption regimes were being used appropriately. It would also enable Inland Revenue to proactively contact taxpayers incorrectly using these regimes to help them to get it right. 40. Option 3 was not recommended as investment income payers were clear during consultation that they wanted the information they provided under the withholding tax regimes to be kept separate from the information they provided under the FATCA and AEOI regimes. The investment income payers also noted that there were some types of investments and investors that they were not required to report on under those regimes so the income provided would be likely to be incomplete if used for other purposes. Frequency - options: 41. At present investor level income information, if required, is provided on an annual basis after the end of the relevant tax year. In order to fully realise the benefits mentioned above (paragraph 37), Inland Revenue needs to receive information more frequently than it does now. The options for provision of more frequent information are summarised below and outlined further in appendix A. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – provision of the information in the mo nth fo llowing the month in which the income was paid. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo, but a significant impact on PIEs. Option 3 – provision of the information on the 20 th of the month following the quarter in which the income was paid for interest, dividends and taxable Maori authority distribut ions. Provisio n of PIE informat ion remains at the end of the year (although by 15 May rather than 31 May for non-locked in PIEs and interest 2 as well as 6 monthly reporting of PIRs for all PIEs). Provision of details for recipients of interest inco me treated as exempt to be required yearly. Meets the main objective Fairness & equit y:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo, but potentially limits options for the future administration of social policy. 2 Note that for interest this will be a transitional measure, as from 1 April 2020 monthly reporting of taxpayer specific information will be required. 10 Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 4 – provision of the information on the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid for interest, dividends and taxable Maori authority distribut ions. Provisio n of PIE informat ion remains at the end of the year (although by 15 May rather than 31 May for non-locked in PIEs and interest 3 as well as 6 monthly reporting of PIRs for all PIEs). Provision of details for recipients of interest inco me treated as exempt to be required yearly. Meets the main objective Fairness & equit y:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo Recommendation 42. Option 4 was recommended over the other options as: • Obtaining more frequent information will make it easier for taxpayers to comply with their tax affairs – it would enable Inland Revenue to prepopulate taxpayers’ tax returns, adjust their social policy entitlements/obligations and work out the appropriate tax rate for them. It would also provide greater scope for reforming the administration of social policy. • It strikes a balance between benefits and compliance cost by not requiring addit io nal informat ion fro m PIEs given the co mplexit y of the systems changes that PIEs would need to make in order to provide information monthly and the limited utility of the PIE information during the year. 4 • Monthly information was preferred over quarterly information for the reasons set out in paragraph 108 in appendix A. • Bringing forward the year end detailed information for PIE income (and for interest income until interest information begins being reported monthly) will enable this information to be pre-populated at the end of the year before the personal tax summary process is completed. This means the income will be associated with the taxpayer and they will be able to see it in their online tax records. While PIE income is not included in taxable income unless the PIR selected by the investor is too low, it can be relevant for social policy and for calculating the appropriate PIR for future periods. Identifying information IRD numbers - options: 43. In order to encourage tax compliance, the following options were considered for increasing the provision of IRD numbers. More detailed analysis is contained in appendix A. 3 Note this is a transitional measure as explained in the above footnote. 4 Due to the volatile nature of PIE income and because a large amount of PIE income (locked-in) is not relevant for social policy purposes – see paragraphs 92 and 93. 11 Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo. Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – 45% non-declaration rate for all investment income types. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Option 3 – 45% non-declaration rate just for interest income. For PIEs, provision of an IRD number will be required to open a new account (subject to limited exceptions – see appendix A). Partially meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Recommendation 44. Option 3 was recommended over option 2 as it better balances the compliance costs imposed on the investment income payers with the level of non-declaration. As PIE non- declaration is a much smaller problem than interest non-declaration the requirement to provide an IRD number when initially making an investment will cap the level of non- declaration at around 2% (there will be work done to match IRD numbers to these non- declared investors by PIEs and Inland Revenue to further reduce the level of non-declaration). 45. Applying a 45% non-declaration rate for PIEs would also add complexity to the tax system. Non-declared recipients would need to file tax returns in order to get excess tax refunded (PIE tax is usually a final tax). In addition, PIE losses give rise to tax credits at the investors’ PIRs. A non-declared investor would get credits for any losses at 45% but, because they would be able to file a tax return, should not pay more than 33% tax on their PIE income. 46. We have not recommended a 45% non-declaration rate for dividends or Maori authorit y distributions due to capability concerns and because we are unable to determine the extent of the non-declaration problem in relation to these types of income until after we begin to receive detailed recipient information. This makes it very difficult to make a satisfactory analysis of the compliance cost versus the benefit at this stage. 12 47. Inland Revenue will work with payers of interest income to identify the IRD numbers of non-declared investors prior to the introduction of the increased non-declaration rate Date of birth information - options: 48. The following options were considered in relation to Inland Revenue obtaining date of birth information from investment income payers. Further detail is contained in appendix A. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo. Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – Date of birth to be provided if held by payer. Partially meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Option 3 – Date of birth requested by Inland Revenue where it is needed to data match. Partially meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Option 4 – Date of birth is required to be provided by the payer. Doesn’t meet the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Worse than the status quo Recommendation 49. Option 2 was recommended over the other options as it does not impose excessive compliance costs on payers of investment income by requiring them to provide information they do not hold. Further, it improves Inland Revenue’s ability to confirm taxpayers’ ident it ies by requiring date of birth information they do hold to be provided to Inland Revenue. Date of birth information is already collected by payers as part of “know your customer” processes for anti-money laundering purposes. 50. Option 3 was not recommended as: • It would be likely to involve significant ad hoc data requests as no IRD number is provided for 20% of interest certificates, which would require investment income payers to go back through their customer records. 13 • It would also involve additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue as it would add a further step of identifying the recipients that date of birth was needed for and requesting it from the various investment income payers. 51. Option 4 was not recommended as it would require investment income providers to collect additional information from a significant number of their lo nger term customers. This would be likely to be a very expensive process and would be unlikely to have a high level of success. If date of birth information was absolutely required this would then mean that investment income providers would either be non-compliant or would have to withdraw services from a number of their customers. While the option would be likely to get more information for Inland Revenue it would not be fair, simple or cost effective. Joint accounts - options: 52. Options for allocating income between owners of a joint investment are outlined below and described further in appendix A. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo. Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – The investment income payer splits the income and tax among the owners according to their ownership proportions, and passes this information on to IR, as well as details of each owner (i.e. name, address, IRD number and date of birth). Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Option 3 – The investment income payer informs IR that the taxpayers are operating a joint account, and provides income and identifying information on to IR. IR pre- populates their income by splitting the income and any tax credits evenly between the owners. Partially meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo Recommendation 53. Option 3 was recommended over option 2 as option 2 would impose significant compliance costs to require payers of investment income to obtain the ownership proportions from joint account owners. It would also cause system difficulties as investment income payers would need to split the calculations of the withholding tax on the income. Ownership proportions could also change during periods creating even more system difficulties. Investment income payers were also concerned that having to manage this would likely to cause them to have customer relationship problems. 14 Compliance and administration costs Compliance costs for taxpayers who are recipients of investment income 54. The compliance costs for the recipients of investment income are impacted by a number of the proposals discussed earlier in this document. Getting more information more frequently will allow Inland Revenue to associate the investment income with the recipients and will enable Inland Revenue to pre-populate the recipient’s tax records (see paragraphs 37 and 42). 55. Pre-populating the investment income information will reduce the compliance costs of the recipients of investment income by removing the need to gather their various end of year tax certificates and any dividend statements and Maori authority distribution statements received during the year in order to complete their tax return. This would make it easier for them to get their tax posit ion right. 56. More frequent information will also enable Inland Revenue to pro-actively correct withholding tax rates being used by recipients during the income year. This will help to reduce the size of the recipient’s tax bill or refund at the end of the year by making sure they are on an appropriate tax rate during the year. 57. The pre-population of investment income information will also enable Inland Revenue to make more informed adjustments to recipients’ social policy entitlements (getting information more frequently will be particularly helpful if changes are made to reduce the calculation period for social assistance). Compliance costs for payers of investment income End of year tax certificates – options: 58. It would be unnecessary to require payers of investment income to provide end of year certificates to their customers outlining the amount of income the customer had earned and the tax that had been withheld from that income if Inland Revenue was able to make this information available to the customers. Options for removing end of year tax certificates are outlined below and analysed further in appendix B. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo. Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – Remove the requirement for all investment payers to provide end of year interest certificates to their customers. Payers would still need to provide shareholder dividend statements, PIE investor statements and Māori authority distribution statements to their customers. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo 15 Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 3 – Remove the requirement for payers to provide end of year interest certificates to customers who have provided their IRD number. Payers must still provide shareholder dividend statements, PIE investor statements and Māori authority distribution statements to their customers (preferred). Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo. Recommendation 59. Option 3 was recommended over option two as requiring payers to provide end of year interest certificates to customers who have not provided their IRD number is important as it notifies the taxpayer that they are on the non-declaration rate and to file a return (thus helping them to pay the correct amount of tax). 60. Removing the requirement for payers to provide interest certificates to customers who have provided their IRD numbers will reduce compliance costs for payers and was considered appropriate on the basis that Inland Revenue would prepopulate the informat ion onto the taxpayer’s myIR account. In addition, where the interest is paid by a bank, the customers will usually be able to see their interest information on their bank statements or on internet banking services provided by the bank. It was not considered appropriate to remove the requirement to provide this information for other investment income sources such as dividends, because the receipt of the income is sporadic and the taxpayer won’t necessarily know when they are going to be receiving the income. Certificates of exemption – options: 61. In order to reduce compliance costs for payers of investment income, the following options have been considered for improving the process of checking whether a taxpayer has a valid certificate of exemption from withholding tax. These options are explored further in appendix B.

Option 3 was recommended as it would allow payers of investment income to easily ascertain whether a taxpayer was entitled to an exemption from RWT, representing a significant improvement over the status quo. Option 2 would be an improvement on the status quo but would have less of an impact on compliance costs than option 3 as investment income payers would still need to work out whether recipients claiming exemptions under other Acts should be treated as exempt. Compliance costs for payers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue Electronic filing – options: 63. To increase electronic filing of investment income returns, the following options are proposed. These options are summarised further in appendix B.

Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant Improvement on status quo Option 3 – Online filing compulsory for large payers only (i.e. those with more than a certain number of recipients they pay investment inco me to). Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Recommendation 64. Option 2 is recommended for the following reasons: 17 • It would ensure that everyone, other than those who are genuinely unable to access digital services, files online. Electronic filing is a very important enabler of the Business Transformation. • Statistics show that the majority of companies only have one or two shareholders, and the majority of interest payers only file one or two certificates (see appendix B for further detail), so compulsion is important or else there is a risk that a significant number of paper returns will be filed. • Currently most of the withholding tax returns must be filed on paper. It is likely that a significant number of investment income payers would simply continue to file on paper if they were not compelled to file digitally. Error correction – options: 65. In order to reduce compliance and administrative costs, the following options have been considered for improving error correction mechanisms: Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Option 2 – Unlimited error correction for all investment income types during a tax year, error correction subject to a threshold of the greater of $2,000 or 5% of annual tax liability (for the tax type in question) for correction between tax years. Tax subject of an error will be treated as due in the period in which it is corrected, resulting in no UOMI or penalties. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo Recommendation 66. Option 2 is recommended as it provides a flexible method for error correction that will reduce compliance and administrative costs, and will not punish payers where they have made a genuine error. Error correction (period reporting) – options: 67. As part of improving the ability to correct errors, the following options in regards to reporting requirements were considered: Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Option 2 – Year-to-date reporting Meets the main objective for some types of investment inco me Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  18 Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo 68. Option 2 is recommended for interest and PIE income because year to date reporting will work well for income types that tend to accumulate across the year such as interest income and PIE income however it will be less appropriate for income that occurs sporadically. 69. Option 1 (i.e. period by period reporting) is recommended for dividends and Maori authority distributions as these are likely to be one-off or sporadic transactions rather than accumulating returns across the income year. CONCLUSION 70. The recommended options under the above themes enable improved service delivery to individuals and lay a foundation for subsequent improvements to social policy. They do this while recognising that ‘one size cannot fit all’ and while maintaining New Zealand’s broad base low rate tax framework. They also enable compliance cost savings for recipients of investment income and payers of investment income to small numbers of recipients while officials recognise that the recommended options will give rise to some increased compliance costs (largely up-front costs) for payers of investment income to large numbers of recipients. The recommended options also enable administrative costs savings, CONSULTATION 71. Several forms of consultation have been undertaken in developing the options outlined in this statement. 72. In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University hosted a conference ent it led Tax administration for the 21 st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier through reducing both compliance and administration costs, while balancing increased voluntary compliance against the core tax policy objectives of raising sufficient revenue and ensuring fairness and efficiency. The main points made by attendees were to give people the ability to self-manage their tax affairs through improved services and more flexible legislative frameworks, the importance of involving businesses and others in the design of the rules and processes, the need to ensure that there is an overall net benefit to society of the changes not just a cost shift from Inland Revenue to businesses, and to ensure the continued maintenance of the current tax system whilst the reforms occur. 73. Following this conference the Government issued Making Tax Simpler – a Government green paper on tax administration which outlined the scope and direction of the review of the tax administration, and sought feedback on the problems taxpayers face with the current system. At the same time the Government released Making Tax Simpler – Better Digital Services a Government discussion document which identified the key role envisaged for digital services in the modernised tax administration system. 74. Feedback on these two documents informed Making Tax Simpler – Investment income information: a Government discussion document which was released for public consultation in early July 2016. In addition to the discussion document an on-line forum was established and companies were notified of the consultation and encouraged to provide feedback. Over 19 60 comments were made to the online forum and 32 written submissions were received. This public feedback has informed the development of the options presented in this statement. 75. The main theme from submissions was that the proposals to receive more frequent investment income information lacked justification. While submitters were supportive of providing the additional information, many submitters felt that there would be minimal benefit in adjusting social policy payments on a monthly basis given the low amount of investment income people receive, and the lumpy nature of investment income. Almost all submitters said that the benefits would be significantly outweighed by the compliance costs that the provision of more frequent information would impose. Many submitters were in favour of reporting the information annually, or quarterly if a more frequent reporting requirement were to be introduced. The themes raised in the submissions were not typically sector specific but instead similar themes were raised by a number of submitters. The main exception to this was that most of the banking industry was strongly of the view that 3 years implementation time from the date of enactment was needed to implement the changes. 76. The submissions received were largely from investment income payers, advisory firms and industry organisations. The major benefits of this project are expected to flow to the recipients of investment income. As such the tenor of the submissions may not reflect the wider reaction to the proposals. 77. More detailed feedback from consultation is provided in the appendices. DATA TO ADDRESS FEEDBACK FROM CONSULTATION 78. The below data highlights the benefits of the proposals: • In 2015 the interest income of at least 185,000 individuals was not taken into account for working for families purposes. 5 This resulted in the government paying out more in social policy entitlements than necessary - the exact impact of this cannot be quantified given WFF abatement rates depend on numerous factors. • It is estimated that $21 to 27 million of income tax per annum is forgone due to interest income not being correctly returned as income. This would be identified if the interest income was pre-populated. IMPLEMENTATION 79. It is proposed to include the recommended options in a bill to be introduced in February 2017. The proposals will apply from the following dates: 5 Based on 27,000 families who reported any investment income compared with the files from interest payers which showed 239,000 individuals (assuming just 2 individuals per family received interest income) received interest income and WFF. The number of people not declaring their investment income is likely to be higher than this given we are comparing families who declared their investment income (i.e. includes interest, dividends and some PIE income etc.) versus individuals earning interest income and receiving WFF. These figures also exclude the recipients of interest income that have not provided their IRD numbers to their interest payers If taxpayer specific information on dividends were collected, the level of non-declaration would be more apparent. 20 • 1 April 2018 - PIEs will be required to obtain the IRD number of new investors or alternatively a self-certification that they are non-resident and do not have an IRD number. • 15 May immediately following the end of the tax year will be the due date for filing the current detailed interest and PIE income information (excluding “locked in” schemes) for tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2018. • 1 April 2020 is the recommended application date for: • Investment income payers (other than PIEs) to provide detailed recipient information on the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income is paid. • Investment income payers to include date of birth information (if held) in the detailed recipient information they provide. • Joint ownership information to be provided by investment income payers. • AIL and exempt recipient information to be provided. • 45% non-declaration rate for interest income. • Inland Revenue to provide a database of valid certificates of exemption. • Recipients of investment income to have a certificate of exemption to be exempt from withholding taxes on investment income. • Removal of the legislation containing the requirement to provide end of year tax certificates to customers. • Changes to allow errors relating to prior years to be corrected in the next return (for errors meeting thresholds), as well as improvements to error correction during an income year. • Investment income payers will be able to elect to begin filing detailed recipient information on a monthly basis from 1 April 2019. 80. When introduced to Parliament, a bill commentary would be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 81. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed changes. The proposals will have a range of administrative implications for Inland Revenue from needing to be able to process the information that is received to analysing the information and being able to proactively use the information to adjust tax rates. The proposed changes will also improve compliance, support the ability to make future changes to the social policy regime and enable Inland Revenue to reduce the time taken by Inland Revenue staff to complete tasks by better associating income information with each taxpayer’s tax records. Overall the proposed changes are expected to reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 82. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes of the changes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a mult i-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 83. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes 21 identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 84. Also, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme a benefit management strategy has been developed and endorsed. The programme costs and benefit estimation approach is outlined in Appendix G of the November 2015 Programme Update and Detailed Business Case. The benefit management strategy provides the framework for managing benefits within the programme, and: • defines benefit components; • details how programme benefits will be quantified and measured; • documents how progress will be tracked; and • describes what governance arrangements will be in place. 85. Both internal and external stakeholders will be actively involved in the on-going assessment of timeframes, benefits identification and benefits realisation for each stage of the transformation programme. 22 APPENDIX A – GETTING IT RIGHT FROM THE START 86. In order for Inland Revenue to help taxpayers get their tax obligations right the first time, Inland Revenue needs: • More frequent and in some cases more detailed information on the investment income the investor receives; and • Identifying information where Inland Revenue is unable to establish the taxpayer’s identity. Status quo and problem definition – detail and frequency of investment income information 87. Currently, payers of investment income are required to deduct resident withholding tax (RWT) from interest and dividends when they are paid, and pay the RWT to Inland Revenue on the 20 th of the following month. For PIEs, tax is generally paid to Inland Revenue at the end of the month following the month that an investor exits the PIE, or the month following the end of the year for all other investors. 88. These payments are due on the same date that payers of investment income must provide summary information to Inland Revenue. This summary information shows the total investment income paid and RWT/PIE tax deducted by the payer. 89. Information on each recipient, such as the income earned by the recipient and the tax withheld from that, isn’t provided until: • after the end of the tax year for interest subject to RWT or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and portfolio investment entity (PIE) income; or • not at all for dividends, Māori authorities distributions and interest that is exempt or subject to AIL. 90. The provision of infrequent or in some cases no information means that Inland Revenue is unable to: • Pre-populate tax returns and personal tax summaries – currently information is received by Inland Revenue too late (or not at all) to pre-populate tax returns. Anyo ne filing a tax return has to gather information about the interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions they have received from payers during the year and include it in their tax return. Taxpayers with multiple investments can end up with dozens of different tax certificates that they need to keep track of to understand their tax posit ion. This is time consuming and, if information is missed out, can result in incorrect returns being filed. Payers provide the same information to their customers (and for interest to Inland Revenue) that the customers in turn provide to Inland Revenue if they file a tax return, which is inefficient. • Accurately determine people’s social policy entitlements/obligations during the year – social policy entitlements/obligations are based on estimates of income the taxpayer expects to receive for the relevant year. At the end of the year once the taxpayer’s income is finalised, the taxpayer needs to perform a square-up. This imposes compliance costs on taxpayers and may also result in hardship for people who have 23 amounts to repay, or who did not receive their full entitlement during the year. Further, people can find it difficult to estimate their taxable income (which is the basis for their social policy calculations) as the amounts treated as taxable income for some types of income may be different from the actual return on investment. For example, for PIE funds invested solely in New Zealand shares the income for tax and social policy purposes does not reflect the return on investment because capital gains on shares are not income for tax purposes, resulting in taxpayers who use ‘return on investment’ as a measure of income overestimating their income. Often recipients of investment inco me are not informed of their taxable income until after the end of the tax year. As they have to estimate income before the start of the tax year for social policy purposes they may have to rely on the information they received for the year 2 years before the year they are making their estimate for. Because Inland Revenue does not receive income information during the year, it cannot adjust the taxpayer’s social policy entitlements/obligations where the taxpayer’s actual inco me is different from their estimate. • Proactively correct errors and withholding tax rate choices – At the mo ment, a large proportion of taxpayers have tax withheld at the incorrect rate. 6 It is not uncommon for taxpayers to select a withholding rate and forget to change it as their circumstances change. For the majority of tax types, taxpayers can square this up at the end of the year. However, for PIEs it is especially important to ensure the correct rate is being used. This is because if a taxpayer has selected a higher rate than their correct rate, the excess tax withheld cannot be refunded. If a lower rate is selected, the income must be included in the taxpayer’s tax return and taxed at their marginal rate. This may result in more tax being paid than if the correct PIR had been selected as the top PIR is 28%, compared to the top marginal tax rate of 33%. As Inland Revenue does not receive investment income information during the year, it is unable to help taxpayers work out the appropriate tax rate for them, resulting in taxpayers being over or under-taxed. • Redesign the social policies that it administers – social policy schemes are currently based on estimates of annual income (i.e. working for families), or income from previous tax years (i.e. child support). It would be much better if these schemes could use shorter calculation periods and could be based on the actual income the taxpayer receives. Feedback from consultation – detail and frequency of investment income information 91. Submitters were generally supportive of providing more detailed information to Inland Revenue, however took issue with providing it more frequently. The majority felt that the costs of providing this information quarterly or monthly would outweigh the benefits. The general consensus was that as the majority of people do not receive much investment income, 6 In the 2015 tax year, 33% of taxpayers who filed an IR 3 or PTS had RWT withheld at a higher rate than their marginal tax rate, whereas 45% had RWT withheld at a lower rate. Of those taxpayers who did not file a return or PTS, 38% had RWT withheld at a higher rate than their marginal rate, and 37% had RWT withheld at a lower rate than their marginal tax rate. 24 the social policy benefits would be minor. 7 Many submitters favoured providing the informat ion annually as is the case now, or quarterly if a more frequent reporting requirement were to be introduced. 92. The provision of more frequent information for PIEs was especially controversial as many felt that reporting it on a more frequent basis would result in significant compliance costs but would not result in any meaningful social policy adjustments. PIE income can be volatile due to unpredictable movements in exchange and interest rates, and lumpy investment returns can mean that it can fluctuate from large positives to large negatives from month to month. Taking this income into account for social policy purposes would result in regular amendments to entitlements, making it difficult for people to budget and resulting in more work for the agencies responsible for managing social assistance. Further, given the nature of the PIE tax regime, taxpayers may have income for tax and social policy purposes despite not actually receiving any income 8 , or where they were in losses. 9 93. Submitters also outlined that wholesale PIEs and locked in PIEs should be exempt from the requirements to provide more frequent information, given there would be no social policy benefit in obtaining this information. 10 Options on obtaining more detailed investment income information 94. Two options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Require payers of investment income to provide taxpayer specific information to Inland Revenue (officials’ preferred option). Option 1 – status quo 95. Under this option the information provided by payers of investment income would remain unchanged. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 96. The status quo does not meet the main objective as currently Inland Revenue is unable to prepopulate investment income in tax returns, determine social policy entitlements or proactively correct tax rates with reference to the investment income earned by the taxpayer (as the information is received too late or not at all depending on the tax type). The status 7 Statistics show that the average amount of investment income a taxpayer with some form of social policy obligation or entitlement receives is $539 a year. This figure does not exclude income from locked in PIE funds such as KiwiSaver, which are excluded from social policy calculations, however, it does exclude any non- declared income that should be included in social policy calculations. 8 Due to the accrual nature of the financial arrangement rules and the foreign investment fund regime. 9 Foreign shares held by a PIE are taxed at 5% of their opening market value, regardless of whether the share price has gone up or down. 10 Clients of wholesale PIEs are not individuals, and locked-in PIE income is not taken into account for social policy purposes. 25 quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. Option 2 – require the provision of taxpayer specific information (preferred) 97. Under this option, payers would be required to provide the following information to Inland Revenue: 98. As shown in the above table, only some investment income payers would be required to provide more information. The key change proposed for all payers of investment income is how frequently that the information will need to be provided (see the next section). 99. Note that this table does not cover all the information that payers of investment income would need to provide. They would also need to provide information to help Inland Revenue identify the recipient of the income (such as date of birth, IRD number, name and address). This is discussed in the identifying information section at paragraph 109. Detailed recipient information will also be required for income that is exempt or subject to AIL. As obtaining Payer of investment income Information that will be required in the future Information already provided that will continue to be required Banks and other payers of interest The same information as currently required. Banks already provide the following information about individual taxpayers who are not exempt fro m RWT or have income subject to AIL: • The income earned • The tax withheld. PIEs The same information that is currently required. Like banks, PIEs already provide individual taxpayer information regarding income earned and tax paid. Companies Information about individual recipients regarding income earned and tax withheld, including any imputation credits attached to dividends. Currently Inland Revenue only receives summary informat ion fro m co mpanies (i.e. total dividends paid and tax withheld for all taxpayers, not broken up by taxpayer). Only summary information is provided. Maori authorities Similar to companies, except instead of dividend and imputation credit information, information will be required on Māori authority distributions and any Māori authority credits attached to those distribut ions. Only summary information is provided. 26 this information is more about determining the identity of the taxpayer in order to determine whether the payment or AIL/exempt income is appropriate, as opposed to using the information for tax and social policy purposes, it has been discussed under the identifying information section. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as receiving taxpayer specific information helps Inland Revenue make it easier for taxpayers to comply with their obligations, for example, by prepopulating tax returns, more accurately determining social policy entitlements and proactively correcting tax rates. It also creates opportunities for the Government to consider how best to deliver and administer social assistance. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it makes it easier for Inland Revenue to proactively correct people’s tax rates and determine their social policy entitlements. This ensures that more people are taxed at a rate appropriate for them, and receive the correct entitlements – reducing the disadvantage that people unaware of the tax rules face in dealing with the tax system. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While it would help to reduce the compliance costs of taxpayers by prepopulating tax returns and more accurately determining social policy entitlements/obligations, the provision of more information would increase compliance costs for investment income payers at least initially while systems were set up. There is not expected to be any significant long-term increase in compliance costs as they are providing information they already hold. For Inland Revenue this change would reduce administrative costs as more income information would be able to be automatically associated with the recipient’s tax record. Inland Revenue expects be able to process the addit ional information for minimal cost due to the work being undertaken in the Business Transformation programme. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it would improve Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure tax and social policy payments were correct the first time around. Options on obtaining more frequent investment income information 100. Four options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Payers to provide invest ment inco me informat ion in the mo nth fo llowing the month in which the income was paid – this is aligned with the process of paying the income and withholding tax and for monthly filers will occur at the same time as summary returns are currently provided. • Option 3: Payers to provide investment income information by the 20 th of the month following the quarter in which the income was paid for interest, dividends and taxable Maori authority distributions. Provisio n o f PIE information remains at the end of the year (although by 15 May rather than 31 May for non-locked in PIEs and 27 interest 11 as well as 6 monthly reporting of PIRs for all PIEs). Payers o f interest income that has been treated as exempt must provide recipient information yearly. Payers of interest income that are required to remit tax to Inland Revenue less often than quarterly will be required to provide information to Inland Revenue on a quarterly basis but will still remit the tax less frequently. • Option 4: Payers to provide investment income information by the 20th of the month following the month in which the income was paid for interest, dividends and taxable Maori authority distributions. Provision of PIE information remains at the end of the year (although by 15 May rather than 31 May for non-locked in PIEs and interest as well as 6 monthly reporting of PIRs for all PIEs). Payers of interest income that has been treated as exempt must provide recipient information yearly. Payers of interest income that are required to remit tax to Inland Revenue less often than monthly will be required to provide information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis but will still remit the tax less frequently. Option 1 – status quo 101. Under this option, the frequency that payers of investment income would be required to provide information to Inland Revenue would not change. This means that taxpayer specific information would not be provided to Inland Revenue until after the end of the tax year (for interest and PIE income) or not at all (for dividends, Māori authorities distributions and interest that is exempt or subject to AIL). Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 102. The status quo does not meet the main objective as information is not received often or early enough to enable Inland Revenue to help people to get their tax right from the start (i.e. tax returns cannot be prepopulated and social policy entitlements and tax rates cannot be proactively corrected during the year). Furthermore, it means that the Government cannot reconsider how best to administer and deliver social assistance. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. Option 2 – month following the month the income was paid 103. Under this option, detailed investment income information would be provided to Inland Revenue on the 20 th of the month following the month the income was paid for interest, dividends and Maori authority distributions 12 , and the end of the month for PIE income. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as receiving information earlier would make it easier for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations. 11 15 May end of year reporting for interest is a transitional measure to get the information earlier to facilitate pre-population until monthly reporting comes in from 1 April 2020. 12 Note that currently summary information on Maori authority distributions is not provided until after the end of the tax year. 28 • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as all taxpayers are treated equally and a reasonable time period is given to provide the information. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as providing this information monthly to Inland Revenue would reduce compliance costs for recipients and administration costs for Inland Revenue, however, it would necessitate extensive upfront system changes for larger payers. It would be especially burdensome on PIEs to report investor level information monthly, as opposed to only when an investor exits the fund. This is because PIEs’ systems are only set up to perform tax calculations at the end of the year for non-exiting investors and run a number of year end processes at the same time. Running monthly tax calculations would necessitate a significant system redesign to decouple the tax calculations from the other year end processes. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While receiving information more often improves Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure customers get their tax affairs right from the start, the volatility of PIE income means that more frequent adjustments to social policy entitlements to take into account this income would be unhelpful. Option 3 – quarterly tailored approach 104. Under this option, payers of investment income would be required to provide information on the 20 th of the month following the quarter in which the income was paid for interest (including interest subject to AIL), dividends and taxable Maori authorit y distribut ions. PIE information would not have to be provided until the end of the year (although by the 15 th of May as opposed to 31 May for PIEs where the funds are not locked in). All PIEs would be required to provide Inland Revenue with the PIRs of their investors every 6 months. Payers would be required to provide contact details yearly for recipients of income that was treated as exempt. 105. PIEs were excluded from the monthly reporting requirement because the volatile nature of PIE income (see paragraph 92) means that taking this income into account on a regular basis would be unhelpful. Another factor to take into account is the fact that PIE income from locked in PIEs such as KiwiSaver funds are not taken into account when calculating social policy obligations and entitlements. In addition, a number of PIEs have included their tax calculation in their year-end processes so would need to redesign these processes in order to run the tax calculation more frequently. 106. The requirement to provide yearly recipient information for recipients of income that has been treated as exempt is to allow Inland Revenue to check that this treatment was appropriate. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as receiving information earlier would make it easier for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo. Whilst PIEs will have less onerous reporting obligations, this is warranted given the issues outlined in paragraphs 92 and 93. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as it will reduce compliance costs for recipients and administration costs for 29 Inland Revenue. However, providing this information more frequently would result in an upfront cost to change systems, although is not expected to result in significant ongoing compliance costs given payers are providing information they already hold. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as receiving the information more frequently better allows Inland Revenue to prepopulate tax returns and adjust social policy obligations. However, receiving information quarterly would mean that adjustments to social policy would be made on a 3 month lag (see further explanation in paragraph 108) compared to receiving the information monthly. Option 4 –monthly tailored approach (preferred) 107. Under this option, payers of investment income would be required to provide information on the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid for interest (including interest subject to AIL), dividends and taxable Maori authority distribut ions. PIE information would not have to be provided until the end of the year (although by the 15 th of May as opposed to 31 May for PIEs where the funds are not locked in). All PIEs would be required to provide Inland Revenue with the PIRs of their investors every 6 months. Payers would be required to provide contact details yearly for recipients of income that was treated as exempt. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 4 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as receiving information earlier would make it easier for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations. • Fairness & equit y: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as taxpayers in similar circumstances are treated in similar ways – i.e. companies would no longer receive preferential treatment as they would be required to provide taxpayer specific info at the same time as interest payers.. Whilst PIEs will have less onerous reporting obligations, this is warranted given the issues outlined in paragraphs 92 and 93. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. Providing this information more frequently would result in an upfront cost to investment income payers making payments to large numbers of recipients as they will need to make changes to their systems. The ongoing compliance costs for these payers to large numbers of recipients are not expected to be material given payers will use their systems to generate the information. This will, however, depend on whether automatic checks and reconciliations are built into the systems or continue to be done manually as is the case now. Investment income payers making payments to small numbers of recipients will be likely to have reduced compliance costs as they will be able to file their returns digitally. Administrative costs will also reduce. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the frequency of the receipt of the information under this option would best help customers get it right from the START. 30 Monthly vs quarterly argument 108. Monthly reporting is favoured over quarterly reporting for the following reasons: • Quarterly reporting would limit Inland Revenue’s ability to redesign how social policy is delivered as it makes it more difficult to align income received with any potential changes to social policy income calculation periods. • Quarterly reporting will result in a delay of at least 3 months as the reporting is done after the end of the quarter and the income calculation for social policy is completed before the start of the period – i.e. if social policy was also calculated quarterly the quarter April – June couldn’t be part of July’s social policy adjustment as the information wouldn’t be reported until 20 July and the calculation would have to have been completed by 1 July. With monthly reporting, the information for April and May would have been received and would be taken into account in the July adjustment. Investment income reporting and social policy calculations are based on the 31 March income year so offsetting the quarters would lead to a number of other issues and costly reconciliations. • The key compliance cost is the initial system changes required to enable more frequent reporting. Provided these changes are made with a view to automating checks and reconciliations as much as possible then the ongoing period by period costs will be significantly less than the costs large investment income payers incur with their current year end processes. One large financial institution noted in their submission that the difference in compliance costs between quarterly and monthly reporting “would be marginal as systems changes would be needed either way”. • Monthly reporting aligns with the business process of paying the tax to Inland Revenue. Currently Inland Revenue receives payments monthly but no detailed information so has no way of knowing who the tax is attributable to until the end of the year. The change would mean that Inland Revenue would get detailed information relating to the payment with the payment. Status quo and problem definition - Identifying information IRD numbers/increased non-declaration rate 109. Inland Revenue has difficulty attributing income to a taxpayer if Inland Revenue does not have the taxpayer’s IRD number. Around 20% of the interest certificates received by Inland Revenue do not contain the recipient’s IRD number. For other inco me types this is a lot lower – for example only 2% for PIE income. 110. Currently, taxpayers are not incentivised to provide their IRD number to Inland Revenue as the non-declaration rate, the rate that applies to taxpayers who do not declare their IRD number, is too low. The non-declaration rate is: • 33% for interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions over $200, and • 28% for portfolio investment entity (PIE) income. 111. These rates equal the top marginal tax rates for the respective income types. As a result, these rates do not incentivise taxpayers on the top marginal tax rate to provide their IRD number. Further, taxpayers with social policy entitlements or obligations may have much higher effective tax rates (taking into account abatement of entitlements or additional 31 obligations) and may realise that by not providing their IRD number, it is unlikely that their investment income will be taken into account when social policy entitlements/obligations are calculated. This may mean they receive more social assistance or pay less in child support and student loan repayments than they should. Example Date of birth information 112. Currently Inland Revenue receives the recipient’s IRD number (if held by the payer), name and address information only as identifying information. Date of birth information can help Inland Revenue determine the IRD numbers of non-declared taxpayers. Some people use multiple spellings or versions of their name and it isn’t uncommon for two or more people to have the same name. People can also give incorrect IRD numbers by mistake. Date of birth informat ion can also help to identify these people. Example Joint accounts 113. Each of the owners of a joint investment is taxable based on their share of ownership of the investment. It is important to accurately allocate the income to each owner to ensure that their tax and social policy obligations and entitlements are correctly calculated. 114. Currently Inland Revenue is only provided with one IRD number and contact details for a joint account. This makes it hard to allocate income between the owners. Unless all joint account owners file tax returns, tax is withheld at the tax rate chosen by the owner whose IRD number is associated with the account. This can result in the income being over or under taxed where the owners are on different marginal tax rates or an inappropriate rate is chosen. Example Laura is a single mother with sole custody of her two children. She earns $50,000 a year and has a student loan. She invested some money from an inheritance which returns her $5,000 income a year. She has not provided her IRD number to her investment income payer. As a result, Laura would receive $1,352 per year more in working for families than otherwise entitled, and pay $600 less off her student loan per year than otherwise required, if she does not return this income Jenny and her mother Jane have the same surname and live at the same address. Jenny hasn’t given her interest payer her IRD number, but her mother has supplied hers. There is a risk that Jenny’s investment income could be matched with her mother’s Inland Revenue records. Inland Revenue could allocate their income to the right accounts if their dates of birth were provided by their investment providers. David and Danielle have a joint account earning $2,000 income a year. David is on a 33% marginal tax rate, whereas Danielle is on a 10.5% rate. Because David’s IRD number is associated with the account, Danielle’s share of the income is taxed at 33%, rather than 10.5%, and Danielle has to file a tax return to claim back the additional $225 tax that is withheld. 32 Identifying information for AIL and exempt income 115. Inland Revenue does not receive any information on the recipients of income subject to AIL, so is unable to check that the payment of AIL is appropriate. A person may have elected to have AIL apply to their investment when they are a non-resident for tax purposes and ma y have forgotten to change back to RWT on their return to New Zealand. Getting AIL information will enable Inland Revenue to check whether other information indicates that a recipient being treated as subject to AIL is actually a New Zealand tax resident. 116. Inland Revenue also receives no information on the recipients of exempt income. This means that Inland Revenue is unable to check that recipients of income that is treated as exempt are actually eligible for this treatment. While other proposals such as providing a certificate of exemption database will help payers of investment income to determine whether recipients are validly being treated as exempt, the provision of recipient information for income that has been treated as exempt will enable Inland Revenue to proactively check compliance in this area and advise payers and recipients if exemptions are being invalidly applied. Feedback from consultation – IRD numbers/non-declaration rate 117. The discussion document proposed raising the non-declaration rate in order to encourage the provision of IRD numbers. While some submitters supported this proposal, the majorit y of submitters were strongly opposed to this. The main points raised by submitters were: • The costs to implement the changes would be substantial. • The 45% rate will be too high for the majority of taxpayers who do not have significant social policy entitlements/obligations to justify a 45% rate. For the majority it would be a penal rate that would punish the unsophisticated. • The non-declaration rate isn’t the solution to what is essentially a data matching problem. A better solut ion would be to require an IRD number to be provided before the investor could use their account. • The aim of a withholding tax system should be to achieve payment of the recipient’s expected income tax liability on an annual basis – no more. Increasing the non- declaration rate seems contrary to the policy behind business transformation as it would result in more taxpayers filing returns at the end of the year to claim back the excess tax. • Retirement savings PIEs should not be subject to a 45% non-declaration rate as this type of PIE income is not taken into account for social policy purposes. Further, overpaid PIE tax on retirement savings which are subsequently recovered when the individual files a return would be unlikely to be returned to the taxpayer’s retirement account. • This proposal would increase compliance costs for financial institutions as they would be the first port of call for complaints. • This proposal shifts the costs of policing IRD numbers from investors and Inland Revenue to payers of investment inco me. • Wholesale PIEs should be exempt from applying the increased non-declaration rate as it would be unnecessary for them to incur the cost to build it into their system when it is unlikely to ever apply given the type of investors who invest in wholesale PIEs (i.e. superannuation funds and other sophisticated non-individual investors). 33 • The non-declaration rate should not apply to investors who legitimately do not require IRD numbers, such as non-residents and exempt persons. • Taxpayers taxed at the non-declaration rate should not be able to receive PIE losses cashed out at 45%. Feedback from consultation – date of birth information 118. The provision of date of birth information to Inland Revenue was supported where payers held that information. There was a consensus that this should be a legislative requirement in order to overcome any privacy concerns. Feedback from consultation – joint accounts 119. Submitters were supportive of providing identifying information of joint account owners where payers of investment income held that information. Payers cautioned that they would be unable to split the income between the joint investors. Feedback from consultation – AIL and exempt income 120. The majority of submitters did not support providing this information for the following reasons: • System amendments would be required to provide this information. • AIL information will be provided under the AEOI reporting requirements when these come into effect. • The information will not be used for auditing non-compliance, rather than prepopulating returns or adjusting social policy payments, so could be provided annually. Options in relation to obtaining IRD numbers 121. Three options have been considered to make changes to the non-declaration rate to increase the provision of IRD numbers to Inland Revenue. The options are: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: 45% non-declaration rate for all investment income types. • Option 3: 45% non-declaration rate just for interest income. For PIEs a taxpayer would need to provide their IRD number before the PIE would allow them to open an account, but a 45% non-declaration rate would not apply. For companies and Maori authorities, the non-declaration rate would remain at 33% (preferred option). Option 1 – status quo 122. Under this option the non-declaration rate would remain unchanged. 34 Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 123. The status quo does not meet the main objective as the non-declaration rate is too low to encourage taxpayers to provide their IRD numbers. Where Inland Revenue does not have a taxpayer’s IRD number, it is unable to help the taxpayer get it right from the start, for example by prepopulating investment income. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. Option 2 – 45% non-declaration rate for all types of investment income 124. Under this option, the non-declaration rate would be increased to 45% for interest, dividends, Māori authority distributions and PIE income. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as increasing the non- declaration rate to 45% encourages taxpayers to provide their IRD numbers, which helps Inland Revenue simplify the tax system by prepopulating income and proactively correcting withholding rates and social policy payments. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it treats all taxpayers equally. The status quo could be seen as unfair as a 45% non- declaration rate applies to income from salary and wages, but not to investment income. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. A 45% non-declaration rate will reduce Inland Revenue’s administrative costs in determining a taxpayer’s identity, as more taxpayers will provide their IRD number. However, compliance costs will increase for payers who will need to set their systems up to withhold tax at 45%. This is especially burdensome for companies (whose systems are set up to withhold tax at only one rate as all dividends have tax withheld at 33%) and for Māori authorities (due to administrative and system constraints). • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While the tax system is more sustainable where income can be allocated to the correct taxpayer, a 45% rate would overtax people who did not have social policy ent it lements or obligations and they would be required to file an annual tax return to ensure the income is taxed at the correct rate. It would also increase the complexity of the tax system as non-declared recipients of PIE income would have to file tax returns in order to get the excess tax back. In addition it would mean that PIE losses could get refunded at 45% whereas recipients could file tax returns to ensure their PIE income was taxed at no more than 33%. Option 3 – 45% non-declaration rate for interest, new account restriction for PIEs (preferred) 125. Under this option, the non-declaration rate would be increased to 45% for interest income. For PIEs a taxpayer would need to provide their IRD number before the PIE would allow them to open an account, but a 45% non-declaration rate would not apply. There would be exceptions for investors that certify they are non-resident, who provide their tax identification number from the country in which they are resident, and who don’t have an IRD number. For companies and Maori authorities, the non-declaration rate would remain at 33%. 35 126. A 45% non-declaration rate was considered appropriate for interest income as 20% of the recipients of this income have not provided their IRD number. Further, interest is the largest form of investment income. Inland Revenue will work with payers of interest income to identify the IRD numbers of non-declared investors prior to the introduction of the increased non-declaration rate. 127. It was not considered appropriate to impose a 45% non-declaration rate on PIE income because: • The increased compliance costs for payers would not be justified as only 2% of recipients of PIE income have not provided their IRD number. • It would create issues for retirement savings and losses as identified in feedback received (see paragraph 117). • It would be inappropriate for wholesale and locked-in PIEs (see paragraph 117). 128. A 45% non-declaration rate was not considered favourable for companies and Māori authorities due to systems constraints (see analysis on option 2). We have not recommended that the provision of an IRD number is a requirement for all new investments in companies as we are unable to determine the extent of non-declarat ion problem until we receive detailed recipient information. If future data shows non-declaration to be a problem, then a measure will be considered. This will also provide companies with sufficient time to get used to the proposed increased reporting requirements (which will represent a significant change for companies given they currently do not report taxpayer specific information at all), before addit ional requirements are imposed. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option partially meets the main objective as compliance with the tax system is not encouraged for taxpayers with income not subject to the increased non-declaration rate or rule for new accounts (i.e. dividends and Māori authority distribut ions). • Fairness & equity: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While it gives preferential treatment to companies and Māori authorities, it does improve non-declaration measures for interest and PIE income. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo. While there will be transitional compliance costs for interest payers who need to set up their systems to withhold tax at 45%, Inland Revenue’s costs associated with determining a taxpayer’s identity will reduce. Payers of other types of investment income will not have increased costs under this proposal. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where income, tax and social policy payments can be allocated to the correct taxpayer and where the withholding tax system, as far as is appropriate, withholds tax at a rate that approximates the taxpayer’s final tax liability. Options on obtaining date of birth information 129. Three options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: 36 • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Date of birth information to be provided if held by the payer (officials’ preferred option). • Option 3: Date of birth information is requested from the payer if it is needed by Inland Revenue for data matching. • Option 4: Date of birth information is required to be provided by payers Option 1 – status quo 130. Under this option, the current rules would stay the same – that is, investment income payers would not be required to provide their clients dates of birth, even if they held them. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 131. The status quo does not meet the main objective as not receiving date of birth information may hinder Inland Revenue’s ability to identify taxpayers – therefore preventing Inland Revenue from helping that taxpayer get their tax affairs correct from the beginning. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. Option 2 – date of birth to be provided if held (preferred) 132. Under this option, payers of investment income would be required to provide date of birth information provided it was held by the payer of the investment income. In other words, the payer would not need to actively obtain date of birth information from its customers. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option partially meets the main objective as receiving date of birth information for some taxpayers will improve Inland Revenue’s ability to identify those taxpayers, and therefore put Inland Revenue in a better position to help customers get their tax affairs right from the start. This option does not fully meet the main objective as date of birth information would not be provided in some circumstances where it was needed (i.e. where Inland Revenue needed it to confirm a taxpayer’s identity, but it was not held by the payer). • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it improves equity by improving Inland Revenue’s ability to identify taxpayers. • Compliance & administration: This represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it reduces administrative costs by making it easier for Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers, and has minimal impact on compliance costs as it only asks investment income payers to provide information they already hold. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as while date of birth information is received for some taxpayers, it is not received for all taxpayers that it is needed for. While financial institutions collect date of birth information from customers as part of their Know Your Customer processes (anti money laundering), they may not hold date of birth information for customers that began investing with them before these processes were required. The tax system 37 is more sustainable where income can be matched to the relevant taxpayer, as otherwise the person could be receiving social policy payments that they are not entitled to, or paying less in social policy obligations than required. Option 3 – date of birth to be provided on request if needed 133. Under this option, payers of investment income would only be required to provide date of birth information (provided it was held by the payer of the investment income) where Inland Revenue identified that it was needed for data matching and made an information request. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option partially meets the main objective as Inland Revenue could request and would receive date of birth information for some taxpayers. This would improve Inland Revenue’s ability to identify those taxpayers, and therefore put Inland Revenue in a better position to help customers get their tax affairs right from the start. This option does not fully meet the main objective as date of birth information would not be provided in some circumstances where it was needed (i.e. where Inland Revenue needed it to confirm a taxpayer’s identity, but it was not held by the payer). • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it treats all investment income payers equally. • Compliance & administration: This option is worse than the status quo as it requires Inland Revenue to go through additional processes to identify situations where the additional date of birth information is required and then prepare information requests (the date of birth information may not just be useful for Inland Revenue data matching but may also assist with cross Government information sharing which could mean the need for the information was not discovered until sometime later). Investment income payers would then have to process the large information requests (with 20% of interest certificates non-declared the requests would be large). These additional processes would give rise to much higher compliance and administrative costs than requesting the information as part of the regular reporting process. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as while date of birth information is received for some taxpayers, it is not received for all taxpayers that it is needed for. The tax system is more sustainable where income can be matched to the relevant taxpayer, as otherwise the person could be receiving social policy payments that they are not entitled to, or paying less in social policy obligations than required. Option 4 – date of birth to be provided 134. Under this option, payers of investment income would be required to provide date of birth informat ion. This would mean that the payer would need to actively try to obtain date of birth informat ion fro m its customers where the payer does not already hold that information. 38 Assessment against objective and criteria – option 4 • Main objective: This option does not meet the main objective as requiring payers to provide date of birth information even when they did not hold it would make it extremely difficult for payers to comply. • Fairness & equity: This option is about the same as the status quo as it improves equity by improving Inland Revenue’s ability to identify taxpayers but it is unfair as it makes it extremely difficult for payers to be compliant. • Compliance & administration: This is worse than the status quo as while it reduces administrative costs by making it easier for Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers, it would have a significant impact on compliance costs as it asks investment income payers to provide information they do not hold and that they would be likely to have great difficulty in getting from some customers. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option is worse than the status quo as while date of birth information is received for some taxpayers, it is not received for all taxpayers that it is needed for and it makes payers non-co mpliant. The tax system is more sustainable where income can be matched to the relevant taxpayer, as otherwise the person could be receiving social policy payments that they are not entitled to, or paying less in social policy obligations than required. It is also more sustainable where requirements are reasonably able to be complied with as making ordinarily compliant participants in the tax system non-compliant can negatively affect their willingness to constructively engage with the tax system going forwards. Options in relation to joint accounts 135. Three options have been considered for allocating income between joint investment owners. The options are: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: The investment income payer splits the income and tax among the owners according to their ownership proportions, and passes this information on to Inland Revenue, as well as identifying details for each owner. 13 • Option 3: The investment income payer informs Inland Revenue that the taxpayers are operating a joint account, and provides details of all account owners. Inland Revenue prepopulates their income based on equal shares (officials’ preferred option). Option 1 – status quo 136. Under this option there would be no changes. This means that inco me fro m a jo int account would only be allocated to the owner whose IRD number is associated with the account and each owner would need to file a tax return to square this up at the end of the year. 13 As was mentioned above Inland Revenue currently only receives one IRD number for a joint account. IRD numbers and contact information would be required for all owners of the account. 39 Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 137. The status quo does not meet the main objective as it imposes an unnecessary requirement on joint account owners to file a tax return. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. Option 2 – payer splits by ownership proportion 138. Under this option, the investment income payer would split the income and tax wit hheld among the owners of the joint investment in accordance with their ownership proportions, and pass this, as well as identifying information for each owner, on to Inland Revenue. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as income and tax would be correctly prepopulated provided joint account owners informed their investment payer of their ownership proportions. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more equitable where information is pre-populated for taxpayers. This is because taxpayers who are unsophisticated or who cannot afford a tax agent are not disadvantaged. • Compliance & administration: This option is worse than the status quo as it would impose compliance costs on payers to gather the ownership proportions from the investors and would result in expensive and complicated changes to payers’ systems to enable the calculation of tax at split rates. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where income and tax is prepopulated for taxpayers. Option 3 – Inland Revenue prepopulates equal shares (preferred) 139. Under this option, the investment income payer will inform Inland Revenue that the taxpayers are operating a joint account, and provide details of all account owners. Inland Revenue prepopulates their income based on the assumption that the investment is held in equal shares. This would be correct for a significant number of joint accounts. Where this is not the case, the investors will need to inform Inland Revenue of their share of income as part of the annual tax return process. As wit h the status quo, tax would be withheld at one rate, so a square up would be required where the taxpayers were on different marginal rates. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option partially meets the main objective as the income would be prepopulated correctly where the investment was held in equal proportions (this is the most common ownership proportion). The taxpayers may still have an end of year debt or payment obligation though as tax would still be withheld at one rate. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as prepopulating tax returns ensures unsophisticated taxpayers are not disadvantaged. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. Compliance costs are reduced relative to the status quo as not all joint investment owners will need to square up at the end of the year. However, owners who do not hold the investment in equal shares or who are on different marginal tax rates will be required to perform a square up. 40 • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While the tax system is more sustainable where information is prepopulated, a square up will be required if the investors do not own the investment equally, and if they are on different marginal tax rates. Options in relation to contact details of recipients of income subject to AIL or treated as exempt Identifying information for recipients of income subject to AIL and income that is treated as exempt 140. The following options were considered for obtaining the identity of recipients of exempt income or income subject to AIL. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo. Doesn’t meet the main objective Option 2 – Detailed recipient information obtained for exempt income and income subject to AIL. Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo Option 3 – Detailed recipient information obtained for exempt income and income subject to AIL, but carving out any information already provided under AEOI. Partially meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo 141. Three options have been considered for obtaining the identity of recipients of exempt income or income subject to AIL The options are: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: The investment income payers provide detailed recipient information for investment income subject to AIL (on New Zealand issued debt) or treated as exempt to Inland Revenue. • Option 3: Investment income payers to provide detailed recipient information for investment income that is exempt subject to AIL (on New Zealand issued debt), but carving out any information already provided under AEOI. 41 Option 1 – status quo 142. Under this option there would be no changes. This means that Inland Revenue would not receive any recipient information in respect of investment income that has been subject to AIL or treated as exempt. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 143. The status quo does not meet the main objective as recipients of investment income may be subject to an incorrect tax regime which will result in any tax that is being deducted being deducted at too low a tax rate. The recipients would then be required to file tax returns to correct their tax positions. Option 2 – payer provides recipient information for investment income subject to AIL or treated as exempt (preferred option) Under this option, the investment income payer would provide recipient information to Inland Revenue for investment income that was subject to AIL (on New Zealand issued debt) or was treated as exempt. Recipient information would include name and contact detail information, but also the income earned and tax withheld (if any). Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 (preferred option) • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as Inland Revenue would be able to use the information to check that the recipients are validly being treated as subject to the applicable tax regime and could proactively inform the payer and the recipient if they were not. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it treats all taxpayers equally. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as while it would reduce administrative costs by improving Inland Revenues auditing function, it would impose some compliance costs on payers to provide the additional information, however, it would be similar information to the information provided for RWT and NRWT and should be able to be gathered using similar processes. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where taxpayers are taxed under the right tax regimes and at rates that approximate their actual tax liability. By limiting the AIL information to New Zealand issued debt this also means that investment income payers will not be asked for information that they cannot get or would have significant difficulty providing. Option 3 – payer provides recipient information for investment income that is exempt or subject to AIL (but carving out information required to be provided under AEOI) 144. Under this option, the investment income payer would provide recipient information to Inland Revenue for investment income that was subject to AIL (on New Zealand issued debt) or was treated as exempt, however information already provided under AEOI would not need to be provided again. Recipient information would include name and contact detail information, but also the income earned and tax withheld (if any). 42 Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as Inland Revenue would be able to use the information to check that the recipients are validly being treated as subject to the applicable tax regime and could proactively inform the payer and the recipient if they were not. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it treats all taxpayers equally. • Compliance & administration: This option is worse than the status quo. During consultation officials were told that determining the information provided under AEOI and only providing the information not provided would entail higher compliance costs than just providing all AIL information. Officials were also told by financial institutions that they did not want to combine the reporting for FATCA and AEOI with the reporting proposals for investment income. As the information is already held by the investment income payer, it would be easier to provide all the information at once. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where taxpayers are taxed under the right tax regimes and at rates that approximate their actual tax liability. By limiting the AIL information to New Zealand issued debt this also means that investment income payers will not be asked for information that they cannot get or would have significant difficulty providing. 43 APPENDIX B – COMPLIANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS 145. Inland Revenue wants to minimise the costs that taxpayer face complying with the tax system, as well as the costs to the government of administering the tax system. This is a key theme of Business Transformation as was outlined in the Green Paper. In relation to investment income, the following are areas where compliance and administration costs could be reduced: Status quo and problem definition - compliance costs for taxpayers Filing tax returns 146. The current process of filing a tax return is cumbersome as taxpayers are required to gather information about the interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions they have received from payers during the year and include it in their tax return. Taxpayers with multiple investments can end up with dozens of different tax certificates that they need to keep track of to understand their tax position. This is time consuming and, if information is missed out, can result in incorrect returns being filed. Selecting a withholding rate 147. Currently, taxpayers need to have an indication of the income they will earn in the tax year in order to select an appropriate withholding rate. Often taxpayers will select a withholding rate and forget to change it as their circumstances change (or they may not realise that their income has reached a threshold that requires a higher tax rate), resulting in under or over taxation. This problem is exacerbated for PIE income as tax on PIE income is final. This means that if a rate higher than the correct rate is selected, the tax cannot be refunded. If a lower rate is selected, the income must be included in the taxpayer’s tax return and taxed at their marginal rate, which may be higher than the top PIE rate of 28%. For other income types, a tax return must be filed where an incorrect withholding rate is used. 14 Having to work out the appropriate withholding rate, update it as circumstances change, and file a tax return wherever an incorrect rate is used, entails significant compliance costs for taxpayers. Example Social policy 148. Because Inland Revenue does not receive information throughout the year about the investment income of individual taxpayers, it is not able to calculate social policy payments during the year to reflect this income. As a result, a square-up calculation needs to be made at the end of the year when a person’s income is finalised. This imposes compliance costs on 14 Provided the amount of income taxed at an incorrect rate exceeds $200. Jack graduated university three years ago. While at university he had a marginal tax rate of 10.5%. This was the rate he used when he set up his bank account and KiwiSaver account. He is now on a 33% marginal rate and has forgotten to update his rate for his bank account and KiwiSaver account (which is a PIE). He must file a tax return to pay the extra tax that should have been withheld from his interest and PIE income. His PIE income will be taxed at 33%, despite the fact that the PIE top rate is only 28%. Depending on the investment income Jack earned, this could result in a sizeable tax bill. 44 taxpayers and may also result in hardship for people who have significant amounts to repay, or who received too little during the year when they needed the assistance. Example Feedback from consultation – compliance costs for taxpayers 149. Submitters supported in principle the idea to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by prepopulating returns, proactively advising of withholding rates and adjusting social policy ent it lements/obligat ions. However they noted that a balance should be struck between compliance costs on payers and benefits to taxpayers. Inland Revenue should not strive for a utopia of having every taxpayer’s tax and social assistance obligations perfect every time, all of the time. A “close enough is good enough” approach should be taken. Status quo and problem definition - Compliance costs for payers of investment income End of year tax certificates 150. Payers of resident withholding income are currently required to provide end-of-year tax certificates to the recipients of the income – such as year-end interest certificates, shareholder dividend statements, PIE investor statements and Māori authority distribution statements. These certificates set out the amount of income earned and tax deducted, which recipients can then include in their tax return. Payers also provide interest and PIE information to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year. In other words, Inland Revenue receives the same information twice in some instances. This is inefficient. Providing end of year certificates also imposes compliance costs on payers of investment income which would be unnecessary if that information was already held by Inland Revenue and able to be viewed by the taxpayer during the year. Certificates of exemption 151. Taxpayers holding certificates of exemption (“COEs”) from RWT are entitled to be paid interest and dividends without having any tax deducted by the payer. The holder of the COE is required to provide a copy to the relevant withholder and must inform the withholder if their COE is cancelled. Cancellations and issues of COEs in the previous quarter are published in the New Zealand Gazette each quarter. Taxpayers exempt under other Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, for example the Education Act, are entitled to an exemption without needing to obtain a COE. 152. The current exemption process involves compliance costs for payers as they need to: • receive exemption certificates from taxpayers; • check the appropriate gazette to see if the taxpayer’s certificate has been cancelled; and Will and Eden have 4 children, earn $50,000 and $30,000 a year respectively, and both have student loans. During the year they received and invested a sizeable inheritance which returned them $10,000 inco me in the income year. As Will and Eden did not include this income in their estimated income for the year they would have an end of year liability of $3,592, consisting of $2,392 working for families repayments and $1,200 in student loan repayments. 45 • assess whether the customer can appropriately claim to be exempt under non-tax legislation. Feedback from consultation – compliance costs for payers of investment income Feedback from consultation - End of year tax certificates 153. Feedback was mixed on the proposal to remove the requirement for payers to provide end of year tax certificates to interest recipients who had provided their IRD number. About 40% of submitters supported removing the requirement, and the other 60% felt it should stay. 154. A common view was that the end of year tax certificate was necessary to enable taxpayers to verify the information that Inland Revenue held about them. Taxpayers have an obligation to confirm the correctness of their tax position under our self-assessment tax system, and the end-of-year tax certificate enables taxpayers to do that. Without the end of year tax certificate, taxpayers would have to go back to their bank statements to determine this for themselves, which would be significantly more difficult. Some investment income payers also felt that compliance costs would not decrease from removing this requirement as systems had already been set up to provide the certificates. Even if the requirement were removed, investors may continue to request end of year certificates. Feedback from consultation – certificates of exemption 155. The discussion documents proposed introducing a searchable database of certificates of exemption from withholding tax, to enable payers of investment income to confirm that a customer was entitled to an exemption from RWT. It was also proposed that organisations exempt from RWT under other Acts would be required to apply for a certificate of exemption, and thus would be included on the database. 156. All submitters were in favour of having a certificate of exemption database. Some submitters cautioned that this proposal should not result in the removal of the requirement for investors to send a copy of their certificate of exemption to their investment income provider. Absent this requirement, costs for payers could increase as they would need to check all of their customers against the database to determine whether or not they were entitled to an exemption from RWT. Submitters were also supportive of requiring organisations exempt from RWT under other Acts to apply for a certificate of exemption. Options – compliance costs for payers of investment income Options – end of year tax certificates 157. Three options have been considered to reduce compliance costs for payers of investment income through making changes to the end-of-year tax certificate requirements: • Option 1: Status quo • Option 2: Remove the requirement to provide end of year interest certificates. • Option 3: Remove the requirement to provide end of year interest certificates to customers who have provided their IRD numbers. Option 1 – status quo 46 158. Under this option, payers of investment income would continue to be required to provide end of year tax certificates to all taxpayers. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 159. The status quo does not meet the main objective as it complicates the tax system by requiring the same information to be provided to Inland Revenue twice. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. Option 2 – removal of requirement to provide end of year interest certificates 160. Under this option, the requirement for payers to provide end of year interest certificates to their customers would be remo ved. Payers would still need to provide end of year certificates to recipients of PIE income, as well as certificates to recipients of dividends and Maori authority distributions when they were paid, and could continue to provide end of year interest certificates if they wished. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as it simplifies the tax system to some extent by removing the provision of duplicated interest income information. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as it treats taxpayers in similar circumstances in similar ways. While this option is inequitable in a sense as payers of dividends, PIE income and Maori authority distributions must continue to provide end of year tax certificates, this is arguably appropriate because the end of year tax certificate acts as a reminder to taxpayers that they have received this income. The regularity of interest income often means the taxpayer is already aware of when they are due to receive the income. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it reduces compliance and administration costs relative to the status quo as payers of investment income do not need to provide end of year tax certificates to recipients of interest income and Inland Revenue does not receive the same information twice. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. The tax system is more sustainable where costs are reduced, however under this option end of year interest certificates would not be provided to customers who have not provided their IRD number. Providing these certificates is important for these taxpayers as it acts as a reminder to file a return thereby allowing the taxpayer to claim back tax that has been over withheld as a result of the non-declaration rate applying. Option 3 – removal of requirement to provide end of year interest certificates to customers who have provided their IRD number (preferred) 161. Under this option, the requirement for payers to provide end of year interest certificates to their customers would be removed for customers who had provided their IRD number. Payers would still need to provide end of year interest certificates to customers who had not provided their IRD number, in order to remind them to file a tax return (so that they would not be taxed at the non-declaration rate). Payers would still need to provide end of year 47 certificates for PIE income and would still need to provide certificates to recipients of dividends and Maori authority distributions when they were paid. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option meets the main objective as it simplifies the tax system to some extent by removing the provision of duplicated interest income information where the taxpayer has provided their IRD number to the payer. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as it treats taxpayers in similar circumstances in similar ways. While this option is inequitable in a sense as payers of dividends, PIE income and Maori authority distributions must continue to provide end of year tax certificates, this is arguably appropriate because the end of year tax certificate acts as a reminder to taxpayers that they have received this income. The regularity of interest income often means the taxpayer is already aware of when they are due to receive the income. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it reduces compliance and administration costs relative to the status quo as payers of investment income do not need to provide end of year tax certificates to recipients of interest income who have provided their IRD numbers, and Inland Revenue does not receive the same information twice. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where compliance and administrative costs are kept to a minimum. Options – certificates of exemption 162. Two options have been considered to reduce compliance costs for payers of investment income by improving the process for checking whether a taxpayer is entitled to be exempt fro m wit hholding tax: • Option 1: Status quo • Option 2: Certificate of exemption database and require payers exempt under other acts to obtain a certificate of exemption Option 1 – status quo 163. Under this option, payers of investment income would continue to be required to check the New Zealand Gazette to determine whether a taxpayer’s certificate had been cancelled, and would still have to assess a taxpayer’s eligibility to be exempt under non-tax legislat ion. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 164. The status quo does not meet the main objective as the current certificate of exemption process is complicated and hard for payers of investment income to comply with. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. 48 Option 2 – certificate of exemption database and require payers exempt under other acts to obtain a certificate of exemption (preferred) 165. Under this option, Inland Revenue would establish a searchable database of certificates of exemption. This would enable payers of investment income to confirm the status of a COE holder via a simple search, and could reduce the risk of people incorrectly claiming RWT exempt status. It would also mean that taxpayers would no longer need to provide copies of their certificates to payers; however, they would still need to inform the payer that they are exempt. Taxpayers exempt under other acts would also be required to apply for a certificate of exemption, so that they were included on the database. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets this objective as it simplifies the tax system by making it easier for investment income payers to determine whether a taxpayer is eligible for an exemption from withholding tax. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as all payers of investment income will be able to use the database, and all taxpayers who are exempt will be included on it. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While it would reduce compliance costs for payers of investment income relative to the status quo, it would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue who would need to administer the database. This increase in administration costs would be likely to be offset as having a database will result in Inland Revenue spending less on auditing whether recipients that are being treated as exempt are entitled to be treated as exempt. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it helps to increase transparency over who is entitled to be treated as exempt. Status quo and problem definition – compliance costs for payers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue Electronic filing 166. Further, a number of withholding returns are paper based (with no option of electronic filing). For those returns that are able to be filed electronically, there is no electronic filing threshold to require payers of a certain size to file electronically. Paper filing is slower, more expensive in terms of compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue and more prone to errors. Error correction 167. Currently, payers of investment income are able to correct errors during the tax year that arise fro m the payer withho lding too litt le tax 15 . This only applies to interest and income subject to NRWT, not to New Zealand dividends. In relation to errors arising from the payer 15 Section RA 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 49 withholding too much tax, errors can be corrected during the year for interest, dividends, Maori authority distributions, and income subject to NRWT 16 . 168. Payers are not able to correct errors during the year where the payer does not withhold enough RWT from a dividend. Nor are payers able to correct errors between tax years for any type of investment income. The inability to correct errors between years impacts heavily on PIEs, given PIEs generally only pay tax at the end of the year. 169. The current approach to error correction imposes significant compliance costs and administrative costs on Inland Revenue because instead of correcting the error in the next period by reducing or increasing the amount of the withholding, payers must re-file returns from the previous period. Errors also impose a monetary cost on investment income payers as they bear the cost where they have under-withheld in error from a taxpayer, but will refund the taxpayer the money where they have over-withheld in error. Further, UOMI is payable to Inland Revenue at 8.27% pa on underpayments of tax, but receivable from Inland Revenue at 1.62% on overpayments. 170. Currently, investment income payers report information for each individual period (i.e. interest payers provide summary information to Inland Revenue every month). This makes the correction of errors difficult as an amount needs to be added or subtracted from a subsequent period in the event of an error. Feedback from consultation – compliance costs for payers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue Feedback from consultation – electronic filing 171. The discussion document sought feedback on options to encourage investment income payers to file online. 172. Submitters were of the view that Inland Revenue should consult with the industry in order to determine an appropriate threshold above which investment payers must file electronically. It was suggested that over time, all information should be provided electronically. Feedback from consultation – error correction 173. The discussion document proposed that investment income payers should be able to self-correct errors below the higher of: • a simple dollar value threshold, or • a percentage threshold based on the amount of withholding tax paid. 174. Submitters were also asked what they felt would be an appropriate threshold. 175. Submitters were supportive of the approach to use both a simple dollar threshold as well as a percentage threshold for correcting errors. The majority felt that there should be no dollar limit on errors that could be corrected during the tax year. 16 Section RA 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 50 Options – compliance costs for payers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue Options – electronic filing 176. Three options have been considered to increase the electronic filing of investment income returns: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Online filing compulsory for all, with the ability to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption. • Option 3: Online filing compulsory for large payers only. Option 1 – status quo 177. Under this option there would be no threshold or mechanism to compel payers of investment income to file electronically. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 178. The status quo does not meet the main objective as the provision of information via paper channels makes it more difficult for Inland Revenue to prepopulate tax returns and adjust social policy payments. Option 2 – compulsory for all, with the ability to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption (preferred) 179. Under this option, it would be compulsory for all investment income payers to file electronically, however there would be the ability to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption, for example, where a payer was not able to access digital services or where the costs of electronic filing would be prohibitive. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets this objective as electronic filing enables the provision of more frequent information which facilitates pre-population as well as social policy and tax rate adjustments. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo. While this option is fair in a sense as all investment income payers are treated equally, it could be seen us unfair as it compels small payers to also file online even though they do not have the same resources at their disposal as large payers. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo. While this option may involve some upfront compliance costs for payers who have not previously filed electronically, it will reduce compliance costs long term because of the efficiencies of online filing when compared to paper filing (for example, recipient information could be pre-populated in the online form for subsequent returns for payers to small numbers of recipients and the information would be able to be submitted at the touch of a button rather than having to post a form to Inland Revenue). Administrative costs for Inland Revenue will also reduce given the amount of paper forms it would have to process would dramatically reduce. 51 • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where information is received in a cheaper, faster and more efficient manner. Option 3 – online filing compulsory for large payers only 180. Under this option, it would be compulsory for investment income payers who withhold above a certain amount of RWT a year (i.e. $50,000) to file electronically. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 • Main objective: This option partially meets this objective as electronic filing enables the provision of more frequent information which facilitates pre-population as well as social policy and tax rate adjustments. This option would leave a large number of payers to determine whether they wanted to file electronically or not. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as it treats taxpayers in similar circumstances in similar ways. There could be a slight unfairness at the margins of the threshold, but this occurs whenever a threshold is implemented. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo. This option will result in a reduction of compliance and administration costs when compared to the status quo as it will compel larger payers to file online. However it will not result in as great a reduction as option 2 as there will still be a large number of payers filing one or two certificates. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a partial improvement on the status quo as it ensures more people provide their information to Inland Revenue in a manner that is cheaper, faster and more efficient. The improvement in sustainability is not as great as the improvement under option 2. Options – error correction 181. Two options have been considered to improve error correction mechanisms for payers of investment income. • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Unlimited error correction for all investment income types during the tax year, error correction subject to a threshold of the greater of $2000 or 5% of the annual tax liability for correction between years. Option 1 – status quo 182. Under this option there would be no changes to the error correction mechanisms currently available. In other words, there would be no ability to correct errors between years, but some ability to correct errors during the year. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 183. The status quo does not meet the main objective as having to re-file a return in order to correct an error can result in unnecessary complexity. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. 52 Option 2 – unlimited error correction during the year, threshold for correction between years (preferred) 184. Under this option, payers of investment income would have no limit on the size of genuine errors that could be corrected in a subsequent period, provided the period in which the error arose and the period in which it was corrected were in the same tax year. Where the error period and the correction period were in different tax years, the error could only be corrected where it was less than $2000 or 5% of the payer’s annual withholding tax liability. Tax payable as a result of a genuine error will be treated as due in the period in which it was corrected. This means that no UOMI or penalties will accrue on the error amount. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets this objective as more flexible error correction makes it easier for payers o f invest ment inco me to comply wit h their withho lding obligations. • Fairness & equity: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as all payers of investment income will have the same error correction mechanisms available to them. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as more flexible error correction lowers compliance costs for investment income payers as they do not have to re-file previous periods. This also lowers administrative costs for Inland Revenue as Inland Revenue staff no longer need to process the re-filed return. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where payers are able to correct genuine errors easily and without penalty. Options – error correction (period reporting) 185. In order to improve payers ability to correct errors, the following options in regards to reporting requirements were considered: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Year-to-date reporting Option 1 – status quo (preferred for dividends and Maori authority distributions) 186. Under this option there would be no changes to the reporting method – payers would continue to report information for the period. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 187. The status quo does not meet the main objective for income that accumulates over time such as interest or PIE income as filing information for each period makes it more difficult for payers of investment income to correct errors. The status quo does however work well for sporadic payments such dividends and Maori authority distributions. The status quo has not been assessed against the criteria as it is the option against which all other options are assessed. 53 Option 2 – Year-to-date reporting (preferred for interest and PIE income) (preferred) 188. Under this option, payers of investment income would report their information on a year-to-date basis. This means that, for example, reporting for the month of June would include the total reported for the entire tax year (i.e. April to June), as opposed to just the figures for June. This is most applicable to types of income that accumulate over time such as interest and PIE income Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option meets this objective for interest and PIE income as it facilitates improved error correction, which makes it easier for payers of investment inco me to comply with their obligat ions. • Fairness & equity: This option is about the same as the status quo as payers of investment income in similar circumstances continue to be treated equally. • Compliance & administration: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as compliance costs are reduced for investment income payers where error correction is made easier. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as the tax system is more sustainable where tax compliance is made easier. 54 Regulatory Impact Statement Demergers Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address the problems with the tax treatment of demergers. The current tax treatment does not align with the economic substance of the relevant demerger. A demerger describes a situation where a corporate group splits off part of itself and distributes that part to its shareholders. The effect of a demerger is that companies which were grouped under a single shareholding are separated into two different shareholdings (initially held by the same shareholders), so they can be dealt with separately. Demergers can have real economic benefits. Generally the full value of the shares in the demerged company is a dividend for the shareholder because (subject to certain exceptions)a dividend includes any transfer of value from a company to a shareholder that is caused by the shareholding. The current tax treatment of demergers is a problem because a demerger is in substance the division of a corporate group rather than a distribution of income. This issue has been raised by the New Zealand Shareholders Associat ion as an urgent issue which requires a legislative solut ion. Due to this urgency, the focus of the proposed solution is more narrowly focussed on demergers of Australian listed companies. A limitation of the analysis is that Inland Revenue has not yet consulted more widely on the detail of the proposed demerger regime. This was to ensure that the amendments sought by the private sector can be enacted as early as possible. However, officials intend to undertake further targeted consultation with the private sector on the detail of the demerger regime. Changes arising from this consultation can be incorporated into the proposals before the introduction of the bill. A further limitation is that it is not possible to accurately quantify the size of the problem, as the number and size of Australian demergers varies from year to year and Inland Revenue does not record the income returned by New Zealand shareholders on such demergers. However, it is understood that recent high profile demergers of Australian listed companies could have impacted thousands of New Zealand shareholders. Peter Frawley Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 October 2017 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. A demerger, or spin-off, is where a corporate group splits off part of itself and transfers that part to its shareholders. This can occur by the parent company distributing an existing subsidiary to its shareholders, or by an operating company transferring part of its own business to a new subsidiary, and then distributing that subsidiary to its shareholders. 2. The effect of a demerger is that companies which were grouped under a single shareholding are separated into two different shareholdings (initially held by the same shareholders), so they can be so ld separately. 3. A demerger is generally undertaken by a corporate group when it believes its constituent parts would perform better if separated. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as where the group is valued at less than the sum of its parts. Accordingly demergers can have genuine economic benefits. Current tax treatment of demergers 4. A demerger involves the transfer of value from the company to its shareholders (being the distribution of the shares in the demerged company) that is caused by their shareholdings. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) the full value of the shares in the demerged company is generally a dividend for the shareholder. This is because the Act defines a dividend (subject to certain exceptions) as any transfer of value from a company to a shareholder that is caused by the shareholding. 5. Shareholders are therefore liable to pay tax on the full value of the shares in the demerged company when a demerger occurs. This is despite the fact that the value of their two shareholdings should be approximately the same as their previous one shareholding, as the underlying assets are unchanged. Furthermore, the amount of the dividend is usually very large, as it will equal a significant percentage of the corporate group’s total market value. 6. A demerger can be often be structured to prevent dividend taxation (in whole or part) by arranging a share repurchase or a liquidation. 7. A New Zealand company which intends to demerge could “buy-back” a portion of it s shares from shareholders, with the shareholders receiving shares in the demerged company as the consideration. This would not be characterised as a dividend provided the amount was less than the company’s paid up share capital (referred to as “available subscribed capital”, or ASC, for tax purposes). 8. It is also possible to structure a demerger as a liquidation of the holding company in order to prevent dividend taxation. In this case the holding company would be liquidated and the shareholders would be provided with the holding company’s assets – being shares in the two demerged companies. An amount equal to any net capital gains (realised and unrealised) plus the ASC of the distributing company is excluded from being a dividend. 9. Further, a dividend arising from a demerger involving a non-resident company will only be taxable if the shareholder is not subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. If the New Zealand shareholder is subject to the FIF rules the investment will be taxed under the fair dividend rate (FDR) which is a tax on 5 percent of the value of the investment. As dividends are not separately taxed under the FDR method demergers are also not subject to tax. Generally, a shareholder in a non-resident company is not subject to the FIF rules when 2 they are a natural person whose total offshore shareholdings (not including shares in Australian listed companies) cost $50,000 or less. 10. The FIF rules do not apply to most Australian listed companies, which are instead taxed similarly to New Zealand shares. This means that under the current rules, demergers from Australian listed companies will be taxed as a dividend, in the same way that a New Zealand demerger would. Problem definition 11. The current tax treatment is a problem because a demerger is in substance the division of a corporate group rather than a distribution of income. Following the demerger, the shareholders still have the same proportionate interests in the same underlying assets. Although the demerger is taxed as a dividend, economically there is no distribution of income or underlying assets by the corporate group. 12. This issue has been raised by the New Zealand Shareholders Association (NZSA) as an urgent issue which requires a legislative solution. Officials agree that an urgent solution is desirable so that New Zealand shareholders involved in any upcoming demergers are not faced with an unfair tax bill due to the operation of the current law. Demerger regimes internationally 13. Australia, the UK, the US and Canada all have regimes which exempt qualifying demergers from dividend taxation. These regimes are generally subject to numerous restrictions to ensure that they only apply to demergers and cannot be used to effect a tax-free distribution of income to shareholders or a sale of the companies. For example, the foreign regimes apply only when active businesses are being divided. They usually also include specific anti-avoidance provisions. 14. Australian demergers are generally excluded from being a dividend either under: • Australia’s specific demerger regime; or • because the demerger is treated as a return of share capital for Australian tax purposes. Scale of the problem 15. The current tax treatment raises issues for demergers of both New Zealand and foreign companies. However the problem is particularly acute for demergers by listed Australian companies. This is because: • New Zealand companies can often structure their demerger so that no dividend arises; and • shares in other foreign companies are more commonly subject to the FIF rules which ignore dividends. 16. Listed Australian companies, however, often have several thousand New Zealand shareholders that are taxable on any dividends received, but they do not structure their demergers to be efficient for New Zealand tax purposes. For example, approximately 13,000 New Zealand shareholders were affected by the BHP/South 32 demerger in 2015, while about 9,000 New Zealand shareholders were affected by the NAB/Clysdale demerger in 2016. 3 Dividend taxation for Australian demergers can seem particularly unfair for New Zealand shareholders, as Australian shareholders are not usually taxable on the demerger. OBJECTIVES 17. The main objective is to align a demerger’s tax treatment with its economic substance. This will improve economic efficiency and ensure that New Zealand shareholders are not inappropriately taxed on the full value of their shares in the demerged company. 18. All options are assessed against the main objective and the following criteria: • Economic efficiency – the proposed changes should align the tax treatment of demergers with their economic substance. This will improve the economic efficiency of the tax system. More particularly, it will ensure that the tax treatment does not incentivise shareholders to sell their shares in a company which is about to demerge (or disincentivise them fro m acquiring such shares). • Integrity of the tax system – the proposed changes to the demerger regime should not create opportunities for abuse. What is in substance the distribution of income should not be able to be structured as a tax-free demerger. • Fairness and equity – the proposed changes should improve the fairness of the tax system, by ensuring that shareholders are not taxed on a demerger when they have not derived any income in economic substance. 19. In this context, officials consider that the most weight should be given to meeting the objectives of fairness and equity, and the integrity of the tax system. Further, as the scope of the proposed change gets broader, there will be an increase in fairness and equity at the expense of integrity of the tax system. This is because a broader regime could lead to gaps in the law which require the development of provisions that prevent abuse of the regime. Officials consider that the solution should not be so broad as to create opportunities for abuse, and should be targeted at the arrangements which are actually causing problems in practice. 20. The constraint in relation to the proposal is as follows: • Timeliness – it is important to have a legislative solution as soon as practicable. The private sector has asked for an urgent response, and officials have indicated that changes are proposed for the first tax bill of 2017. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 21. Officials have identified four options to address the problem: • Option 1 – The status quo • Option 2 – A full demerger regime, which applies to both New Zealand and foreign companies • Option 3 – A limited demerger regime, which only applies to Australian listed companies • Option 4 – A middle ground between the above two options, which would apply to all demergers by foreign listed companies (or potentially a subset of them) 4 Option 1 22. Option 1 is the status quo. Shareholders would continue to be taxed on demergers as a dividend. Assessment against criteria – option 1 23. The status quo does not meet the main objective. Shareholders would be taxed on demergers even though in economic substance they had not received any income. 24. Economic efficiency. The status quo does not meet the economic efficiency criterion. Shareholders will be incentivised against owning shares in companies which are in the process of demerging. 25. Integrity of the tax system. The status quo meets the integrity criterion. As shareholders are taxed on dividends arising from demergers there is no opportunity to demerge to access a tax free gain that should be taxable. 26. Fairness and equity. The status quo does not meet the fairness criterio n. Shareholders will have to pay tax even though they have not economically received any income. This will make them worse off than other investors who will not have to pay tax. Option 2 27. Option 2 would introduce a full demerger regime, which applies to both New Zealand and foreign companies. Assessment against criteria – option 2 28. This option is the most conceptually pure approach, as demergers by New Zealand and foreign companies should be taxed the same way from a policy perspective. This optio n meets the main objective, as it would ensure that genuine demergers are not unfairly taxed as a dividend. This would align the tax treatment of all genuine demergers (whether by a New Zealand or foreign co mpany), with their economic substance. Economic efficiency 29. Option 2 is a significant improvement over the status quo, as there would be no tax consequences which arise from holding shares in a demerged company. There would no longer be any incentives against owning shares in a company which is in the process of demerging. Integrity of the tax system 30. Option 2 is worse than the status quo. This option would have the greatest integrit y risk, as New Zealand companies could attempt to explo it the regime to effect an in-substance distribution of income. For example a company could transfer cash or liquid assets to a subsidiary, and demerge that subsidiary by distributing it to its shareholders. The subsidiary could then be liquidated under the current law, thus providing all of the cash and/or liquid assets to the shareholders tax-free. The foreign demerger regimes referred to above have all included extensive anti-avoidance provisions to prevent such abuse. Therefore it is important 5 that any comprehensive demerger regime be carefully drafted so that it only applies to demergers that do not effect an in-substance distribution of income to shareholders. Fairness and equity 31. Option 2 is a significant improvement over the status quo, as it would ensure that shareholders of demerged companies do not become liable to pay tax on the value of the demerged shares despite there being no in-substance change in their shareholding. Constraints 32. A full demerger regime would be complicated and time consuming to develop, particularly concerning the anti-avoidance provisions required to prevent abuse of the regime. Such a regime could definitely not be developed in time for the first omnibus tax bill of 2017, or possibly the second. Consequently officials consider that option 2 is not feasible given the time constraints. Option 3 33. Option 3 is a limited demerger regime, applying only to Australian listed companies. This option would exclude any demerger by a listed Australian company from dividend taxation provided the demerger was excluded from dividend taxation in Australia under either Australia’s demerger regime or its return of share capital rules. Assessment against criteria – Option 3 34. While not as conceptually pure as option 2, this is a pragmatic approach that would address the demergers that have been causing issues in practice without needing to be nearly as complex as a full demerger regime. This meets the main objective. Economic efficiency 35. This option would improve economic efficiency, by aligning the tax treatment of a qualifying Australian demerger with its economic substance. As demergers by listed Australian companies are the problem for most shareholders, option 3 would address the issues faced by shareholders in practice. Integrity of the tax system 36. The Australian demerger regime already has rules designed to prevent it being used to effect a distribution of income. Accordingly, officials are comfortable with excluding any demerger from New Zealand dividend taxation where the Australian demerger regime applies to it. 37. In relation to the return of share capital method, New Zealand already has similar rules to Australia that exclude a return of shareholder capital from being a dividend. However these rules require there to be a repurchase by the company of its own shares, while the Australian rules do not. Consequently New Zealand’s dividend exemption often does not apply to an Australian demerger that is structured as a return of share capital (as such demergers often do not involve a repurchase of shares). 6 38. The requirement to repurchase shares is not a significant policy difference between New Zealand’s dividend exemption and the Australian exemption – the more important point is that they both exclude a return of shareholder capital from dividend taxation. Therefore we do not see any integrity issues if the demerger dividend exclusion also applies to a demerger by a listed Australian company that is treated as a non-dividend return of share capital under the Australian tax rules. 39. On this basis, we consider that option 3 is equal to the status quo as it maintains the integrity of the tax system. Fairness and equity 40. Based on past history this option would improve fairness and equity for most of the taxpayers who are taxable on demergers, namely shareholders in listed Australian companies. However it would result in shareholders in New Zealand companies and shareholders in other foreign companies who are not subject to the FIF rules remaining potentially taxable on any demerger dividends. Accordingly it would mean that shareholders in some companies were not taxable on a demerger (i.e. shareholders in listed Australian companies) while shareholders in other companies were. Consequently the differential treatment of shareholders under this option does result in some horizontal inequit y. 41. However New Zealand companies have in the past been able to structure their demergers so dividend taxation does not arise. In addition, the problem of demerger taxation does not seem to be problematic in practice for shareholders in other foreign companies. Consequently this lack of fairness across shareholders does not seem to be so significant in practice. Constraints 42. Option 3 is the least resource intensive of the options, and so it could be implemented the fastest. In particular, the Australian demerger regime already includes anti-avoidance rules designed to prevent abuse. Accordingly the regime could leverage off those rules, by restricting the New Zealand dividend exclusion to demergers by listed Australian companies that are not treated as a dividend under Australian tax legislation. This would significantly simplify the necessary legislation and thus the time required to develop it. This option is the only one which would be able to be included in the first 2017 omnibus tax bill. 43. Accordingly this option best accommodates the current constraints. Option 4 44. Option 4 would introduce a limited demerger regime applying to all demergers by foreign listed companies. This regime would be a broader solution to the issue than option 3, as it would also cover (in addition to shareholders in listed Australian companies) New Zealand shareholders that are not subject to the FIF rules (generally natural persons with foreign investments costing less than $50,000) who invest in foreign companies outside of Australia. Assessment against criteria – Option 4 45. This option is not as conceptually pure as option 2, as it would only address demergers of foreign companies. This option is a pragmatic approach that would address the demergers 7 that can cause issues in practice without needing to be as complex as a full demerger regime which includes New Zealand companies. It would however be a wider approach than option 3, which is targeted at Australian listed companies only. This option can therefore be considered a middle ground between options 2 and 3. This option meets the main objective. Economic efficiency 46. This option would increase economic efficiency compared with the status quo due to the broader scope of its dividend exclusion for demergers. This option would be a larger improvement than option 3 but not as large as option 2. However as noted above, it is Australian demergers that are causing the problems in practice. Consequently the increase in economic efficiency and fairness over option 3 does not seem to be significant. Integrity of the tax system 47. This option also poses an increased risk to the integrity of the tax system compared with option 3 (but not option 2) due to its broader reach. However foreign-listed companies would not structure their demergers specifically to avoid New Zealand tax. Consequently this increased risk could be largely mitigated with some anti-avo idance provisio ns. Fairness and equity 48. This option is an improvement over the status quo for shareholders in demerged foreign listed companies, as it would prevent dividend taxation in genuine demerger situations. This option could result in shareholders in New Zealand companies remaining potentially taxable on a demerger. However, in practice New Zealand companies usually structure demergers so dividend taxation does not arise. Consequently this lack of fairness across shareholders does not seem to be so significant in practice. Constraints 49. Option 4 would be more complex than a regime limited to listed Australian companies (option 3). This is because the regime would need to distinguish between genuine foreign demergers and demergers that are an in-substance distributions of income (which should be taxed in New Zealand) to shareholders. As the regime would apply to demergers by companies in multiple jurisdictions, it could not simply use one country’s existing anti- avoidance rules (as can be done for a demerger regime limited to Australian listed companies). Option 4 would therefore be more time consuming to develop than option 3 (although less so than option 2). While this impact on constraints is not fatal to option 4, there is a significant risk o f officials being unable to develop legislat ion for option 4 in time for the first 2017 omnibus tax bill. Fiscal costs 50. Option 3 will have a fiscal cost, as New Zealand shareholders will no longer derive income on the demerger of Australian listed companies. This fiscal cost is the lowest out of the three options other than the status quo, as option 3 has the narrowest scope and the lowest integrity risk. 51. It is impossible to accurately estimate the fiscal cost, as the number and size of Australian demergers varies from year to year and Inland Revenue does not record the income 8 returned by New Zealand shareholders on such demergers. Officials do not anticipate a material impact on tax revenue baselines. CONSULTATION 52. The Treasury has been consulted and agree with Inland Revenue’s recommendations. 53. Formal consultation has not yet taken place; however the issue was originally raised by the NZSA and the Securities Industry Association. Accordingly officials are aware of the views of the private sector on this issue. 54. The NZSA supports the introduction of a limited demerger regime which excludes all demergers by foreign listed companies from dividend taxation (option 4). However the NZSA focussed on the issues caused by Australian demergers in their correspondence with us, and officials’ interactions with the private sector indicate that option 3 would also be well- received given the timeliness of the solution, and the fact that it would address the private sector’s primary concern in practice (demergers by listed Australian companies). 55. Inland Revenue has not yet consulted more widely on the proposals. However, officials intend to undertake further targeted consultation with the private sector on the detail of the demerger regime before introduction of the first omnibus taxation bill in 2017. Details to be decided through the consultation process include: • how the available subscribed capital in the distributing company is to be divided between the original share in the distributing company and the newly held share in the demerged company; and • how the cost base of the original share in the distributing company is to be divided between the original share in the distributing company and the newly held share in the demerged company. 56. This consultation will include the NZSA, the Securities Industry Association, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and the New Zealand Law Society. Changes arising from this consultation can be incorporated into the proposals before the introduction of the bill. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 57. The following table summarises the consideration of the options from the regulatory analysis section above. Within the overview table the following symbols are used:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo 9 Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Does not meet the main objective Option 2 – Full demerger regime Meets the main objective Economic efficiency  Integrity of the tax system  Fairness and equity  Does not meet constraints Option 3 – Limited demerger regime applying to Australian listed companies Meets the main objective Economic efficiency  Integrity of the tax system  Fairness and equity  Meets constraints Option 4 – Middle group applying to all demergers by foreign listed companies Meets the main objective Economic efficiency  Integrity of the tax system  Fairness and equity  Does not meet constraints 58. Option 2 increases the economic efficiency and fairness of the tax system by the greatest amount. However it is not feasible given the time constraints. 59. Option 3 increases economic efficiency and the fairness of the tax system, but its narrower scope means it does so by less than option 4. Option 3 best meets the criteria of maintaining revenue integrity, although its advantage over option 4 in this regard is not that significant. Accordingly the choice between option 3 and option 4 is essentially a trade-off between increased efficiency and fairness (option 4) versus reduced time for implementation and integrity risk (option 3). 60. Officials consider the reduced time for implementation and integrity risk of option 3 outweighs the increase in economic efficiency and fairness of option 4. In this regard, option 3 would address the demergers that are causing the problems in practice. Accordingly option 4’s increased economic efficiency and fairness would not be a significant benefit. It is notable that the private sector has focussed on the problems with the tax treatment of Australian demergers, rather than demergers by foreign companies generally. This shows that the economic and efficiency gains of option 3 are perceived as being sufficient to address the pressing issues with demergers. 61. Option 3 best meets all the criteria given the constraints. Therefore Inland Revenue recommends the introduction of a limited demerger regime. This would exclude demergers by listed Australian companies from giving rise to a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes, provided the demerger is not treated as a dividend for Australian tax purposes (under either Australia’s demerger regime or under its return of share capital rules). 10 IMPLEMENTATION 62. Changes to introduce a limited demerger regime would require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in the first quarter of 2017. We propose that the recommended option apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 tax year. This is something we intend to consult on with the private sector however. 63. The detail of the demerger regime will need to specify how the available subscribed capital and the cost base of the original share in the distributing company is to be divided between the original share in the distributing company and the newly held share in the demerged company. It should also provide that the newly held share is held on the same basis as the original share (for example, it should be held on capital account if the original share is held on capital account). These and other details will be finalised following further consultation. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 64. New Zealand demergers do not in practice lead to unfair tax treatment for shareholders, and shareholder of foreign companies (excluding Australian listed companies) are generally subject to the FIF rules. Therefore the problem is mainly confined to Australian-listed companies and the recommended option is expected to be a permanent solution which resolves this issue in practice. It is not expected that a broader demergers regime will be needed in the future. 65. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTTP). The GTTP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 66. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would be prioritised in the context of the current Tax Policy Work Programme, and any proposals would go through the GTTP. 11 Regulatory Impact Statement Insurance businesses and the controlled foreign company rules Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address the concern raised by tax practitioners in relation to the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules and the ability for insurance companies to qualify for the active income exemption in relation to their offshore insurance businesses. The concern relates to the inability of new offshore active insurance companies acquired or established by New Zealand resident insurers after 30 June 2009 to pass the active business test in the CFC rules and their preference for specific active business test rules for insurance companies. However, those who expressed concern acknowledged that owing to competing priorities on the Government’s tax policy work programme and limited policy resources, a short term fix would be better than the status quo. The preferred option is that a short term fix should be implemented so that overseas active insurance businesses acquired or established after 30 June 2009 are accorded the same treatment under the CFC rules as those acquired or established before 30 June 2009. The problem to be addressed is relevant only to a small number of taxpayers, namely, licensed insurers who are required to have financial strength ratings and have interests in active offshore insurance businesses. We are unable to estimate the number of insurers that may set up active insurance businesses in other jurisdictions in the future, so the analysis in this RIS is based on the New Zealand-based insurance companies that are currently attributing income under the CFC rules and the CFC disclosure data indicates that the CFC income relates to an insurance business. This is a very small subset of the number of licensed insurers, but we have discussed this problem wit h tax practitioners that represent some of these companies. Owing to time constraints, we did not consult more widely, for example, by way of an officials’ issues paper. However, the tax practitioners we did consult represent the majorit y of those affected. None of the policy options would impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 22 June 2016 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules 1. New Zealand’s international tax rules provide a framework for taxing non-residents who earn New Zealand income and New Zealand residents who earn foreign income. The CFC and foreign investment fund (FIF) regimes apply to New Zealand residents investing in foreign companies; the CFC regime applies when the foreign company is effectively controlled by New Zealand residents, and the FIF regime applies when it is controlled by non- residents. These regimes attribute overseas income arising from CFCs and FIFs back to the New Zealand shareholder, even if no distributions (for example, a payment of a dividend) are made to the shareholder. 2. Before 2009, taxpayers did not have to return attributed income in respect of their interest in a CFC if the CFC was resident in a “grey list” country. The grey list comprised eight countries that were thought to have broadly comparable tax systems to our own. Income earned in a grey list country was exempt and income earned in other countries was subject to tax. 3. Following extensive public consultation, the Government passed legislation to reform the international tax rules in 2009. The main changes to the CFC regime included the repeal of the grey list and the introduction of an “active business test”. Under the active business test, if less than 5 percent of the CFC’s gross income is passive income, the active business test is passed and no income is attributed to the New Zealand shareholder. If the test is failed, only the passive income (such as, highly mo bile inco me such as interest, rent or royalties) is attributed to the shareholder. 4. The purpose of the active business test is to reduce tax and compliance costs associated with calculating and attributing small amounts of passive income and to ensure that New Zealand businesses that expand offshore by operating subsidiaries in foreign countries can compete on an even footing with foreign competitors operating in the same country. This means, for example, that a New Zealand-owned manufacturing plant in China would generally face the same tax rate as other manufacturers operating in China. 5. Owing to the complexity of the rules, on-going maintenance is required to ensure that they continue to work as intended. Since 2009, the Government has enacted a number of remedial changes to ensure that the policy intent of the reform continues to be met. This regulatory impact statement (RIS) considers the most recent issue that has been raised in discussions between officials and tax practitioners who have experience with both the CFC rules and insurance businesses. 6. In short, the issue concerns the treatment of insurance income as passive income under the CFC rules. While this is a necessary feature to protect the integrity of the CFC rules and the active business test, it means that New Zealand insurance companies with active offshore insurance businesses are required to attribute this income under the CFC rules unless they have applied for and are issued a determination by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) that deems the CFC to have passed the active business test. However, this determination is only available if the CFC was controlled by a New Zealand insurance company and carried out an insurance business in its country of residence before 30 June 2009. 2 Insurance companies 7. Under the CFC rules, income from insurance is considered to be passive income and therefore must be attributed to the New Zealand shareholder. As a result, New Zealand insurance companies with foreign subsidiaries operating active insurance businesses in foreign markets do not pass the active business test and are required to attribute income back to New Zealand under the CFC rules. 8. Initially, the Government did not intend to introduce special rules for financial inst itutions (including insurance companies) as it did not believe that there were CFCs that would use them. However, consultation revealed that there were at least so me insurance companies that would. 9. Because of a number of constraints, including the complexity of the issues involved in drafting special rules for financial institutions (including insurance companies), it was not possible to do so at the same time the active income exemption was introduced. 10. As a result, a transitional measure was introduced which allows the Commissioner to issue a determination under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This measure allows a New Zealand insurance company to pass the active business test in relation to an offshore active insurance business if it can demonstrate that the offshore insurance business is an active business. The determination facility was not made available for other types of financial institutions because the boundary between active and passive income is less apparent. 11. One of the requirements that must be met for the Commissioner to be able to issue a determination is that before 30 June 2009, the offshore insurance business must have been controlled by a New Zealand resident and it must have operated a business of insurance in its country of residence. This date requirement was deemed necessary as the determination facility was only intended to be a transitional measure until further work could be completed on extending the active business test to financial institutions more generally. 12. The financial institution work was due to be taken forward in the second phase of the international tax review, alongside the work on non-portfolio FIFs 1 , and offshore branches. Legislation for the extension of the active income exemption for non-portfo lio FIFs was enacted in 2012 and work on the application of the active business test to financial institutions would have followed the work on offshore branches, but other priorities took precedent. 13. The problem with the 30 June 2009 requirement is that as the date becomes more historical, more CFCs that are active insurance businesses are unable to qualify for the active business test determination. It creates an uneven playing field between active offshore insurance businesses that were in existence prior to 30 June 2009 and those established since then. Insurance companies looking to expand offshore face greater tax and compliance costs than those faced by competitors with already-established operations. 14. This runs counter to the purpose of the active business test, which is to reduce tax and compliance costs associated with calculating and attributing passive income and to ensure that New Zealand businesses (in this case insurance businesses) that expand into offshore markets 1 A non-portfolio FIF is a FIF where the shareholder’s ownership interest is more than 10% but less than 50%. 3 through foreign subsidiaries can compete on an even footing with competitors (including New Zealand insurers with pre-existing operations) operating in the same country. Scale of the problem 15. The scale of the problem is very small, as it only affects New Zealand licensed insurance companies that are required to have a current financial strength rating given by an approved rating agency who also happen to have an income interest in an active insurance business overseas. Further, the problem of not being eligible for the active business test determination is relevant only to those with offshore active insurance subsidiaries acquired or established after 30 June 2009. 16. According to public information on the financial strength ratings of licensed insurers from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, there are approximately 75 licensed insurers that have a current financial strength rating; some of these insurers will be solely focused on the New Zealand market and will not have offshore operations. It is unknown how many of these purely domestic insurance companies will look to expand offshore in the future. 17. We are aware that only a very small number of these licensed insurers with financial strength ratings are currently attributing income under the CFC rules. Of these we estimate that only some of them would be eligible for an active business test determination under section 91AAQ, if it were not for the 30 June 2009 ownership requirement. The reason for this is that not all CFCs owned by New Zealand insurers are active insurance businesses and so income is being attributed in line with the policy intent of the active business test. 18. Overall, the amount of New Zealand tax at stake is also likely to be very small, because under the CFC rules, the taxpayer is provided a foreign tax credit for income tax paid overseas in relation to the CFC income against their New Zealand income tax liability. If the foreign tax credit exceeds or is equal to the New Zealand income tax liability, there is no tax to pay. 19. However, owing to confidentiality concerns we are unable to publicly state the number of insurance companies affected by the problem. OBJECTIVES 20. The main objective is to ensure the CFC rules result in the correct amount of income being attributed to a New Zealand taxpayer who has an inco me interest in a non-resident company. In particular, this means ensuring that inco me fro m an active business is not required to be attributed under the CFC rules. The underlying policy intent of the active business test is to minimise tax and compliance costs associated with attributing income under the CFC rules, so that New Zealand businesses operating in offshore markets through foreign subsidiaries can compete on an even footing with competitors. 21. All options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the fo llo wing criteria: (a) Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. 4 (b) Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance cost impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. 22. Although both criteria are important, the fairness and equity criterion is more important than the efficiency of compliance and administration, for small movements in the latter. 23. In addit ion, the options must be considered against constraints on the time and resources available to the Government. These constraints form part of the trade-offs when evaluating the available options. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 24. Officials have identified three options to address the problem: • Option 1: the status quo • Option 2: remove the 30 June 2009 requirement from the determination provision • Option 3: introduce rules that extend the active business test to financial inst itutions, including insurance companies. 25. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the identified options. Option 1 26. This option would maintain the status quo. CFCs that were controlled by a New Zealand resident and operating an insurance business in their country of residence before 30 June 2009 would continue to be eligible for a determination, but no offshore insurance businesses that commenced or were purchased by a New Zealand resident after this date would be eligible to apply. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 27. The status quo does not meet the main objective because the CFC rules (and in particular, the active business test) do not apply equally to New Zealand-resident insurance companies wit h interests in offshore insurance businesses. The active business test does not apply to some insurance businesses solely because of when they were acquired or established rather than whether or not they are actually active businesses. This results in so me New Zealand residents with an insurance business CFC having attributed foreign income while others do not. 28. This option is not fair and equitable as it creates an uneven playing field between two otherwise identical insurance businesses where the only difference is when the two businesses were acquired. In the most extreme case, one day could be the difference between being eligible for an active business test determination and being required to calculate, attribute, and pay New Zealand tax on CFC income. 29. This option does not minimise compliance impacts on taxpayers nor administrative costs borne by Inland Revenue. This is because this option imposes significant compliance costs on active insurance businesses simply because they were acquired or established after 30 5 June 2009, but there are also administrative costs in considering determination applications for those that were acquired or established before 30 June 2009. Option 2 30. This option would retain the ability for insurance companies to apply for an active business test determination in relation to an offshore active insurance CFC under section 91AAQ, but would remove the requirement that the active insurance business must be owned by a New Zealand resident before 30 June 2009. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 31. This option meets the main objective because the CFC rules would apply equally to New Zealand-resident insurance companies with interests in offshore insurance companies, as long as they meet the requirements for being an active insurance business. This means that active insurance businesses would be able to pass the active business test and would not be required to attribute income under the CFC rules, which conceptually is the correct result under the CFC rules. 32. In terms o f fairness and equit y, this option is an improvement on the status quo because New Zealand insurers that control offshore active insurance companies would be able to pass the active business test (by applying for a determination) regardless of when those offshore insurance companies were acquired or established. This creates a level playing field in terms of compliance costs and tax costs for New Zealand licensed insurers with active insurance subsidiaries overseas. It also creates a more level playing field for those with active insurance businesses when compared with more generic active businesses. 33. Regarding the efficiency of compliance and administration, this option is an improvement on the status quo because it reduces the compliance costs faced by active insurance businesses. Although there are some addit ional administrative costs involved in considering an application for an active business test determination, officials consider that these are outweighed by the compliance cost benefits. This is because a determination is able to be issued for more than one income year at a time and Inland Revenue already has the necessary processes in place to issue these determinations, so would be able to capitalise on existing knowledge required to consider applications. 34. Overall, this option represents an improvement on the status quo. Although this option is not necessarily a larger improvement on the status quo than option 3 it is still an improvement over the status quo and can be executed in the light of current resource constraints. Furthermore, implementing option 2 would not prevent option 3 fro m being considered or implemented at a later date if it is found to be necessary and resource constraints permit. Option 3 35. This option would introduce specific rules for financial institutions (including insurance companies) to enable them to pass the active business test when their CFCs are engaged in an active business. This option would require the significant use of resources to design effective rules that are able to distinguish between active income and passive income for financial inst itutions, which is inherently more difficult than for other types of businesses. In addit io n, 6 the determination facility in section 91AAQ would no longer be required, so would be removed altogether under this option. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 36. This option meets the main objective because it would enable the CFC rules to correctly attribute income to the New Zealand shareholder when the CFC is an active insurance company or another type of financial institution. 37. This option is a significant improvement on the status quo in terms of fairness and equit y. Like option 2, New Zealand insurers with interests in offshore active insurance companies would be able to pass the active business test regardless of when those offshore insurance companies were acquired. This creates a level playing field in terms of compliance costs and tax costs borne between New Zealand licensed insurers with active insurance subsidiaries overseas. Option 3 is also an improvement on the status quo for other types of financial institutions with active offshore businesses, as it would no longer matter what type of business the active business is to determine whether income needs to be attributed under the CFC rules. 38. Regarding the efficiency of compliance and administration, the effect of this option is mixed and overall, it is a slight improvement on the status quo. In terms of administration costs, while it would remove the need for Inland Revenue to issue determinations, designing active business test rules for financial institutions would be a complex undertaking and would require a significant use of resources. Specific active business test rules for financial inst itutions would naturally be complex, which means that taxpayers would incur compliance costs in complying with them and these compliance costs might not be substantially less than under the status quo. 39. Although overall this option might be an improvement on the status quo, it is not considered desirable at this time. It would meet the main objective and would be an improvement over the status quo in most criteria, but it would also require significant resources to develop a comprehensive package of amendments to accurately identify the boundary between passive and active income in relation to insurance companies and other financial institutions. This option would take much longer to progress than option 2. In addition to option 3 being a very complex undertaking, we believe it would impact very few taxpayers beyond the small number of insurance companies identified for the purposes of option 2. The tax policy work programme is set by the Government with reference to the Government’s priorit ies. Given other work already scheduled on the Government’s tax policy work programme and limited policy resources, trade-offs would need to be made to progress option 3. CONSULTATION 40. The problem analysed in this RIS was independently raised by some tax practitioners. These tax practitioners have experience with the CFC rules and how they apply to insurance companies. 41. In general, these tax practitioners noted that option 3 would be the preferred and more sustainable solution in the longer term, but also agreed that at least in the interim, option 2 would be preferable to the status quo. They understood that competing priorities and limited resources mean option 3 is not a feasible option in the short term in the same way that option 2 is. 7 42. Owing to time constraints, no wider consultation was undertaken, for example, in the form of an officials’ issues paper. 43. Only a very small number of these licensed insurers with financial strength ratings are currently attributing income under the CFC rules and we estimate that only some of these would be eligible for an active business test determination if it were not for the 30 June 2009 ownership requirement. Based on the taxpayers we were able to identify in this exercise, we believe the tax practitioners we consulted represent the majority of those most affected by the problem analysed in this RIS. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 44. The table below summarises our analysis of the options. Within this table the following symbols are used:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1: status quo Does not meet the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Overall comment: Does not meet the main objective or criteria Option 2: remove 30 June 2009 requirement Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Overall comment: Improvement on the status quo Option 3: introduce an active business test that is specific to financial institutions Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Overall comment: Improvement on the status quo, but not feasible in the short to medium ter m owing to limited resources and competing priorities on the Government’s tax policy work programme. 45. Inland Revenue prefers option 2 which is to remove the 30 June 2009 ownership requirement from the active business test determination provision for the following reasons: 8 • It achieves the main objective to make the CFC rules apply on a consistent basis and, in particular, to ensure that active insurance businesses are able to pass the active business test. • Competing priorities mean that there is insufficient space on the Government’s tax policy work programme to implement option 3 at this time. Implementing option 3 would require substant ial policy resource and time because of the complexit ies in determining the boundary between active and passive income in relat ion to financial inst itutions. Trade-offs would need to be made to progress option 3. In addition, option 3 would affect a very small number of taxpayers relative to the resources required to implement it. • The implementation of option 2 would not preclude option 3 from being considered and, if appropriate, implemented at a later date. IMPLEMENTATION 46. Legislative changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be required to implement option 2. These amendments could be included in the bill which is scheduled to be introduced later this year. 47. No systems changes would be required to implement option 2. However, it would require the use of the Commissioner’s resources to consider applications for a determination. There are processes in place to issue determinations for active insurance businesses already, so the implementation of option 2 would just be an extension of these existing processes. As the relevant group affected by the issue is relatively small (licensed insurers in New Zealand that are required to have a current financial strength rating and also have offshore active insurance businesses), the existing processes should be able to be appropriately managed. 48. The implementation of option 2 has the effect of reducing compliance costs for affected parties as they would no longer be required to calculate and attribute income under the CFC rules. Some of these compliance cost benefits would be offset by compliance costs associated with completing an application for a determination under section 91AAQ. However, it is important to note that the determination is able to be issued for more than one income year at a time (currently they tend to be issued for two income years), so this means that determination-related compliance costs would not need to be borne every year. 49. In implementing option 2, Inland Revenue would be required to update forms and communication material to ensure that licensed insurance companies are aware that they may be eligible for a determination that deems them to have passed the active business test in the CFC rules in relation to offshore insurance businesses. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 50. Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation 9 are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 10 Regulatory Impact Statement Lloyd’s of London – tax simplification Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to simplify tax compliance for Lloyd’s of London in connection with income earned from its proposed New Zealand term-life insurance business. Term-life insurance is directed at life risk only and does not contain provisions for policyholder savings. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains rules that require non-resident life insurers to file and pay tax in relation to their New Zealand business. As Lloyd’s trades as syndicates, these rules result in each Member of Lloyd’s that does business in New Zealand having to apply for an Inland Revenue number and file annual tax returns. This would impose considerable compliance costs on Lloyd’s in terms of calculating taxable income and paying tax at the Member’s correct marginal tax rate. Inland Revenue would also face increased administration costs as the requirements of the Income Tax Act would generate over time a significant increase in the volume of life insurer returns that are processed and audited for tax compliance. These outcomes give rise to efficiency concerns. The analysis in this RIS is constrained by the fact that the problem and preferred solution is limited to Lloyd’s and its authorised New Zealand agents. There are wider issues concerning the treatment of life insurance sold by life insurers, including reinsurance. Given current priorities on the Government’s tax policy work programme, these wider issues have not been considered in depth. Taxpayer confident ialit y provisio ns prevent Inland Revenue from disclosing the expected value of Lloyd’s life insurance business in New Zealand. In terms of scale, the current law as it applies to Lloyd’s syndicates produces compliance costs and costs on Inland Revenue that are out of proportion to the tax revenue at issue. As the proposal affects life insurers only, consultation was limited to the Financial Services Council, the representative body for New Zealand life insurers. Inland Revenue considers that level of consultation fairly reflected the nature of the issue under consideration and those affected. Brandon Sloan Senior Policy Advisor, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 October 2016 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Llo yd’s of London (Lloyd’s) has regulatory approval to write term-life insurance business in New Zealand. While taxpayer confidentialit y provisions prevent Inland Revenue from disclosing the expected value of Lloyd’s life insurance business in New Zealand, it is a minute fraction of total life insurance premium income sold in New Zealand. 1 This business is expected to add capacity rather than substituting existing life insurance policies sold by New Zealand life insurers. 2. Lloyd’s is an insurance market, not an insurance company. It is an institution where Members of the Society of Lloyd’s, both corporate and individual, join together in syndicates to insure risk. These syndicates have different market specialisations and risk profiles. Over time the underwriting activity attracted capital from outsiders in a subscription market, signifying that a series of underwriters would assume shares of risk. Members are required to be United Kingdom tax residents under Lloyd’s governance rules. 3. Lloyd’s unique structure means that any amount of business in New Zealand would require each Members of a syndicate to obtain Inland Revenue numbers and file tax returns in New Zealand with material compliance and administration implications. The problem arises because the Income Tax Act rules for non-resident life insurers are designed with companies in mind rather than the syndicate approach used by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s advises that its life syndicates in 2015 had 282 members, including 125 companies, 66 individuals and 91 partnerships. By way of comparison, Inland Revenue currently processes 58 returns from 34 life insurers. 4. The current law would generate a significant increase in the number of complex life insurance tax returns received by Inland Revenue for what would be very small amounts of tax relating to each return. 5. Under current law, non-resident life insurers are required to complete tax returns for income (less allowable deductions and losses) for life insurance policies that are: • offered in New Zealand; or • offered or entered into in New Zealand. 6. Non-resident life insurers can apply to Inland Revenue to file and pay tax as if they were New Zealand tax residents to the extent of their New Zealand business. Compliance by non-residents with these rules is generally excellent. 7. A different set of rules apply to non-resident general insurers (non-life insurers). Income from general insurance business that is attributed to New Zealand is deemed to be 10 percent of the gross premium. No deductions are allowed and responsibility for returning the tax falls on a hierarchy of New Zealand persons (typically the insurer’s agent or the insured’s broker). There are well-established practices in the general insurance industry to ensure compliance with New Zealand’s tax obligations. 1 There are 34 established life insurers operating in New Zealand, with the five largest comprising 75 percent of the life market. Total premium income is close to $2.6 billion (2015). 2 8. Llo yd’s has requested a legislative change that would allow income from New Zealand term-life insurance business sold by Lloyd’s to be treated in a similar manner to general insurance premiums. The effect of the requested change shifts the tax compliance obligations fro m Llo yd’s syndicates to Llo yd’s New Zealand authorised agents. Lloyd’s have established practices that ensure its New Zealand authorised agents comply with the obligations required by the Income Tax Act and Tax Administration Act 1994. 9. The purpose of the requested legislative change is not to provide a tax concession but improve the efficiency of tax system by significantly reducing compliance and administration costs. 10. Inland Revenue has considered whether there is a good case for changing the way that tax is calculated for life insurance sold by Lloyd’s. The current legislative settings for offshore life insurers require the calculation of taxable income after adjusting for allowable deductions and losses. The rules ensure accuracy and the tax paid reflects the economic activity that has a connection with New Zealand. The trade-off is the cost of compliance on taxpayers and, for Inland Revenue, the increased volume of returns that could result. 11. There are also additional tax compliance complexities created by the way that profit is recognised by Lloyd’s for each syndicate. Typically, the profits from insurance business are not fully recognised until the end of a three-year reporting cycle based originally on the period of time it took a 17 th century ship to sail around the world. Consider the description below. While this reporting cycle is supported by annual interim reporting, this pattern of financial reporting does not translate well into income year concepts used in tax law and the administrative and compliance systems that hinge off that concept (such as audit, disputes and collections). Description of Lloyd’s three-year reporting cycle Member X underwrites on syndicate 123 for the 2014 year-of-account. In November 2014, the syndicate’s managing agent gives a 12-month binding authority to a Lloyd’s authorised agent in country Z. Premium and claims relating to that binding authority might be processed in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but all are allocated for 3-year accounting to the 2014 year-of-account. The managing agent maintains the premiums trust fund into which all premium is received and for which claims and other expenses are paid. No profit or loss is struck for the 2014 year-of-account at the end of 2014 (or at the end of 2015). Instead, the balance of the fund is carried forward until the end of 2016 (the 36-month point for that syndicate for that year of account). This allows time for claims to arise and liabilities to be quantified. The profit or loss for the year-of-account is struck at the 36-month point. The syndicate “declares” the result of the 2014 year of account in 2017 and “distributes” the profits of that syndicate to its Members at that time in proportion to their participation on the syndicate. A loss will result in a cash- call to Members to make up the deficit. 3 OBJECTIVES 12. The main objective is to simplify the way tax is collected on term-life insurance business carried on by Lloyd’s in New Zealand in order to improve the overall efficiency o f the tax system. 13. All options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the fo llo wing criteria: • Efficiency of compliance – the options should minimise compliance costs on Lloyd’s of London. • Efficiency of administration – the options should minimise administration costs for Inland Revenue and the government. • Sustainability – the options should maintain the integrity of the income tax base and perceptions o f fairness. 14. This RIS is solely concerned with Lloyd’s and there is no intention to review the tax treatment of non-resident life insurers generally. The reason for considering a specific set of rules for Lloyd’s syndicates recognises its unique governance and the need for the tax system to work efficiently within current tax policy settings. 15. There are constraints on what is practically achievable by Inland Revenue and Lloyd’s. These constraints create trade-offs when considering the available options. For example, there is a trade-off between sustainability and efficiency. Sustainability considers perceptions of fairness and the integrity of the tax system. The accuracy of each option is therefore an important policy consideration in terms of a taxpayer’s tax liability should bear a close relat ionship to profitabilit y. The life insurance industry is no exception to this. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 16. Four options are considered in this RIS. They are: • Option 1 (status quo) – Llo yd’s Members return tax on their New Zealand life insurance business. • Option 2 (treat Llo yd’s syndicates as a single taxpayer) – Treat all Lloyd’s syndicates that carry on life insurance business in New Zealand as one taxpayer. • Option 3 (special presumptive tax rule) – Establish a special tax rule that imposes tax on the gross premiums of Lloyd’s term-life insurance products. 17. The impact of each option is discussed below. None of the options have social, cultural or environmental impacts. All of the options considered are expected to be largely fiscally neutral relative to the status quo. Option 1 – Status quo 18. This option would maintain the status quo. Lloyd’s Members would be required to obtain Inland Revenue numbers and meet their obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts. 4 Efficiency of compliance 19. Lloyd’s Members who carry on life insurance business in New Zealand would be required to obtain Inland Revenue numbers and file annual tax returns. It is estimated that compliance with the current law could over time create the need to produce a significant number of reasonably co mplex annual tax returns. 2 Each return would be for a very small sum of revenue. For Lloyd’s, the current treatment of non-resident life insurers would impose considerable practical difficulties and compliance costs and act as a barrier to enter the New Zealand life insurance market. Efficiency of administration 20. Inland Revenue currently processes 58 tax returns from 34 established life insurers operating in New Zealand. Faced with a significant increase in the volume of tax returns fro m Lloyd’s syndicate Members, Inland Revenue would need to divert resource and time to manage the associated increase in return volume. 21. Inland Revenue is also concerned that the interaction of the Inland Revenue Acts and Lloyd’s three-year financial reporting cycle gives rise to practical difficulties. The four-year time bar, which prevents Inland Revenue from increasing tax assessments (except in the case of tax avoidance), would make it difficult to maintain adequate audit and control across all of Lloyd’s syndicate Member’s profits (or losses) from business emerging over the three-year business cycle. Sustainability 22. Given the estimated value of New Zealand business that Lloyd’s expects to sell, the amount of income tax for each Member’s return is expected to be low. Tax would be payable on the basis of the Member’s marginal tax rate (for companies 28% and individuals between the range of 10.5% to 33%). This option ensures, however, that both resident and non- resident life insurers face the same rules and preserves perceptions about the fairness of the tax system. 23. The status quo, however, is arguably inefficient as it creates compliance and administration costs that are likely to exceed the value of any tax payable from the sale of Lloyd’s term-life insurance in New Zealand. The efficiency of the tax system is therefore a concern. Option 2 – Treat Lloyd’s syndicates as a single taxpayer 24. This option would involve a legislative change that would treat Lloyd’s syndicates as a single taxpayer for the purposes of the non-resident life insurance rules. Tax would be calculated on the basis of income less allowable deductions and losses, and would require the completion of an annual return. In this respect, tax liabilities would be correlated to profits from Lloyd’s syndicates’ life insurance business in New Zealand. 2 Lloyd’s has 2,100 underwriting Members, including 325 individuals, over 700 partnerships and over 1,000 companies. The figure above assumes the potential for all Members (not just those described in paragraph 3) underwriting life risk in New Zealand. 5 Efficiency of compliance 25. This option removes the need for Lloyd’s Members to individually obtain Inland Revenue numbers and file annual tax returns. Instead, one annual tax return would be prepared for Lloyd’s business activity in New Zealand. Preparation of the tax return and associated compliance would be undertaken in the United Kingdom. This would involve compilation of syndicate activities and associate consolidation of information to meet New Zealand’s tax laws. While this option offers some cost efficiencies for Lloyd’s, it is still compliance intensive due to the need to consolidate information across multiple syndicates. Efficiency of administration 26. This option reduces the number of returns that Inland Revenue would be required to process. Practical concerns remain, however. The return would be an amalgam of syndicate activity and would be complex to audit and verify the correctness of any tax position in those returns. The problem with Llo yd’s three-yearly financial reporting and its interaction with the four-year time bar and tax administration system generally is not addressed. Sustainability 27. This option ensures that both non-resident and resident life insurers face the same rules. In this regard, the option protects the integrity of the tax base and perceptions about its fairness. Option 3 – Special presumptive tax rule 28. This option involves a legislative change that would change the calculation of tax payable from the sale of Lloyd’s life insurance products in New Zealand. 29. Instead of calculating tax using the approach described in options 1 and 2, a presumptive tax would be applied to the gross premiums earned by Lloyd’s for any term-life product sold in New Zealand. The tax rate applicable to this income would be 28%, consistent with the current rate of company tax. The presumptive tax would be calculated on the basis of 10 percent of gross premiums. This approach is used for the taxation of general insurance sold by non-resident insurers to the New Zealand market. Tax would be calculated and paid by Llo yd’s handful of New Zealand authorised agents. Efficiency of compliance 30. This option would change the way that tax is calculated and returned by Lloyd’s syndicates that carry on business in New Zealand. It shifts the cost of compliance from Lloyd’s Members to Lloyd’s New Zealand-resident agents. Lloyd’s advises that their agents would be suitably prepared to comply with the proposed legislation under this option. 31. Part of the cost savings for Lloyd’s is a result of the simplified calculation of tax and shifting tax compliance obligations to Lloyd’s authorised agents. For this latter group, the cost of compliance is not anticipated to be significant as option 3 is effectively an extension of its tax compliance in connection with Lloyd’s general insurance products. There would be a need for Lloyd’s authorised agents to maintain records regarding the split between sales of life and non-life insurance. 6 Efficiency of administration 32. This option would not significantly increase the number of returns that Inland Revenue is required to process. The option would be consistent with income-year concepts used by the tax system, and Inland Revenue’s audit and control systems. Sustainability 33. Option 3 is a pragmatic response to the problem and protects the integrity of the income tax base. 34. It, however, raises a question of fairness if the option produces a tax advantage to Llo yd’s that is not available to other life insurers. 35. To ensure the integrity of the tax system and perceptions of fairness, Inland Revenue considers that the deemed rate of taxable income should be reviewed periodically. This is discussed in more detail under the heading “Monitoring, evaluation and review”. 36. This option is not as accurate as options 1 and 2 for calculating tax that should be paid by Lloyd’s in connection with its New Zealand term-life insurance business. There is a risk that treating 10 percent of gross premiums as reflecting Lloyd’s profit from New Zealand would either overstate or understate taxable income. At least initially, it is likely that tax paid on Lloyd’s business activity in New Zealand would be higher than what would otherwise be payable under the status quo or option 2. This is a trade-off for simplifying Lloyd’s tax compliance. 37. It is relatively uncommon to have specific rules in the Income Tax Act for a specified group of taxpayers. In this particular case, the use of a syndicate structure for insurance does not fit within the conventional taxation rules for life insurance business. Tax and regulatory authorities in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere recognise that Lloyd’s does not fit within normal frameworks or rules. There are several examples of special rules and administrative arrangements to ensure proper compliance with regulators and the payment of taxes. 3 CONSULTATION 38. Inland Revenue wrote to the Financial Services Council (FSC) seeking its views on option 3. The FSC is the industry representative group for most insurers operating in New Zealand. 39. Private sector consultation was limited to the FSC as the matters discussed in this RIS solely concern a new life insurer entering the New Zealand market. No other private sector groups with an interest in this issue were identified. The scale of the issue did not warrant extensive consultation using the generic tax policy process. 3 For example, provisions in the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010 and the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the Financial Services Providers (Exemption) Regulations 2010. In a New Zealand tax context, there were specific provisions that were largely directed at Lloyd’s underwriters – former sections 210 and 210A of the Income Tax Act 1976. In Australia, provisions concerning Lloyd’s are found with the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 and the Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998. 7 40. The FSC’s comments on option 3 and Inland Revenue’s response are set out below: • Option 3 could provide a competitive advantage to a new entrant. The FSC noted that the current rules require all life insurers whether New Zealand resident or not to comply with the same rules to ensure that a tax concession is not available to a particular life insurer. Inland Revenue is reasonably confident that the proposed presumptive tax provides a reasonable proxy of profitability and, given the niche markets that Lloyd’s syndicates’ intend to operate, the risk that option 3 provides Llo yd’s wit h an unfair competit ive advantage is considered to be low. This will be the subject of regular monitoring. • Whether option 3 should apply to all non-resident life insurers including reinsurers. The proposal for Lloyd’s raises broader questions relating to the basis on which life insurance business by, and wit h, non-resident life insurers are taxed. Inland Revenue agrees that the proposal raises the possibility for wider consideration of the treatment of life insurance and life risk sold by life insurers, but notes a potential for fiscal risk. The priorit y o f any future work on these matters would be considered as part of the tax policy work programme. • There are a number of technical issues with option 3, particularly relating to its detail. These issues relate to who bears the liability for tax, the type of life insurance product the option would apply to, and the frequency of any review of the deemed rate of taxable income on which option 3 is based. The technical matters raised in submissions confirmed the need to confine option 3 to the sale of term-life insurance policies and that the deemed amount of taxable income of 10 percent be reviewed. As discussed, the obligation to calculate and pay tax would fall on Lloyd’s New Zealand authorised agents. 41. The overall message fro m consultat ion was an acknowledgement a compliance problem exists and we infer that the FSC reluctantly accepts option 3. The FSC did not express any outright opposition to option 3. 42. Lloyd’s was also consulted and supports option 3. 43. Inland Revenue also sought comment from the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. Both note that the costs imposed by the current law (status quo) are disproportionate to the tax revenue at issue. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 44. The table “summary of options and analysis” belo w summarises the assessment of each option described in this RIS. The following symbols are used to describe if the option improves on or is worse than the status quo.  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo 8 Table 1: summary of options and analysis Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Does not meet the main objective Option 2 – Treat Lloyd’s syndicates as a single taxpayer Meets the main objective in part. Efficiency of compliance  Efficiency of administration  Sustainable  Option 3 – special presumptive rule Meets the main objective Efficiency of compliance  Efficiency of administration  Sustainable  45. Inland Revenue supports option 3. This is because out of all the options, it represents the greatest improvement over the status quo. 46. Option 3 may not be fiscally neutral when contrasted against the status quo or option 2. It is possible that option 3 could over or underestimate the amount tax that would be payable. This is a trade-off for the expected compliance and administration cost savings that do not arise under the other options. IMPLEMENTATION 47. Legislative change to the Income Tax Act and possibly the Tax Administration Act are necessary to implement option 3. These amendments would be included in the first omnibus taxation bill for 2017. 48. The changes would apply to term-life insurance sold by Lloyd’s syndicates on and after 1 April 2017 to align with Lloyd’s proposed entry into the New Zealand life insurance market. 49. When introduced into Parliament, a Commentary on the bill will be released explaining the amendments. Further explanation about their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin series, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 50. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. 51. The proposed change aligns with Inland Revenue’s existing technology and business systems. Addit io nal informat ion may be sought from affected Lloyd’s authorised New 9 Zealand agents as to the breakdown of premiums from Lloyd’s life and non-life insurance products. 52. Lloyd’s will work with affected New Zealand authorised agents to ensure they are informed about the practical day-to-day impact of the changes. Lloyd’s advises that its New Zealand authorised agents are generally familiar with the rules that apply to the sale of Lloyd’s non-life insurance products and the proposed legislative change is an extension of those rules. Lloyd’s authorised agents would be expected to prepare the same IR4 returns as currently required. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 53. In general, post-implementation reviews are a feature of the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. 54. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 55. If the Government adopts option 3, Inland Revenue recommends that the presumptive tax be reviewed in 2020 to assess its on-going suitability and whether it broadly reflects Lloyd’s syndicates’ profit based on financial reporting evidence for the period 2017-2019 and projected future profitability. Notwithstanding accuracy matters, if the compliance and administration savings are sufficiently material, unders and overs in tax payable are likely to be tolerated. Compliance cost implications for Lloyd’s authorised agents would also be considered as part of the review in 2020. 10 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Proposed changes to PAYE and GST Agency disclosure statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to improve the administration of PAYE and GST. The options considered are intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses and administrative costs for Government, while improving the administration of PAYE and social policy and ensuring the rules are robust. The options were developed in the context of the wider tax policy framework of a clear and coherent broad-base, low-rate tax system. It is challenging to accurately forecast some of the costs (including compliance, and administrative costs) for the options due to information not being available or difficulty in estimating likely behavioural changes. Equally, it is difficult to determine the number of taxpayers who may be impacted by the proposals as various factors may influence the decision to adopt a proposal. Instead, indications of the direction and order of magnitude have been provided where appropriate. None of the policy options restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce incentives for small businesses to operate, or override fundamental common law principles.

To manage this large number of topics we have shifted the detailed analysis of each theme, and the component proposals within that theme, out of the Regulatory Analysis section and into a set of three appendices. The body of the RIS still contains an overview of the options considered but the detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, impacts and recommendations is contained in the corresponding appendix. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo The consultation section of the RIS provides a summary of our consultation approach with the feedback received on each proposal set out in corresponding appendix. 5 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Inland Revenue’s transformation programme 1. The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 2. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 3. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 4. The ways in which individuals work has changed with different types of employment and working arrangements. The New Zealand workforce has become more casualised as permanent employment has become less common, and temporary, casual and contract work has become more prominent. Other trends include part-time and temporary workers increasingly holding multiple jobs, and more self-employment and small businesses. Many of the current tax policies and administrative processes were designed for an era when New Zealand’s workforce was more strongly characterised by salary and wage earners in permanent full-time employment arrangements. 5. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 6. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 7. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunity to review current policy and legislative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 8. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are 6 not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers of complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorit ies. 9. However, Business Transformation is far more than just updating a computer system. It is a lo ng-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system, and will re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. A new operating model and new systems will be the catalysts for these changes. 10. PAYE and GST are key components of the New Zealand tax system. This regulatory impact statement outlines options made possible by modernisation of the New Zealand revenue system, for improving the administration of PAYE and GST. Problems with PAYE and GST and their magnitude 11. PAYE raises 37% of tax revenue. In addit ion PAYE processes are used for the payment of the ACC earners’ levy, so me child support obligations, student loan repayments, emplo yer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT), payroll giving and KiwiSaver contributions (of both employers and employees). 12. PAYE income information is used to assess entitlements for tax credits, to determine child support obligations and to determine whether benefit entitlements from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and compensation entitlements from the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) have been overpaid. Compliance costs 13. PAYE imposes compliance costs on more than 194,000 New Zealand employers. Because of the absence of economies of scale it is generally accepted that PAYE imposes higher per employee compliance costs on small employers than on larger ones. If this is considered to be unfair thresholds and subsidies are mechanisms which can be used to differentiate obligations or offset costs. On the other hand such subsidies and thresholds impose costs on society in general and taxpayers specifically. From a dynamic perspective they can be seen as encouraging the growth of small business relative to other investments, although in this context it is appropriate to note that employers are not necessarily businesses. Non-profit organisations, individuals, clubs and societies can all have obligations as an emplo yer. The role for thresholds and subsidies is considered further in many of the options canvassed in this regulatory impact statement. 14. For the smallest employers (1 – 5 employees) the most recent compliance cost survey (2013) identified the median hours spend on PAYE as 12 hours a year. The PAYE legislation is prescriptively written. It requires PAYE information to be provided on a monthly basis which prevents employers and the government benefiting from using business software to integrate PAYE obligations into normal business processes, such as paying staff. 7 Estimates made for Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation business case suggest that using modern digital services could reduce PAYE compliance costs on small employers (1-5 emplo yees) by between 15% and 40%. 15. PAYE information is currently required monthly, by the 5 th of the following month for the largest employers and by the 20 th of the following month for all other employers. Although PAYE information is provided for each employee it is aggregated across the pay periods in the month to provide monthly totals. Impact on individual employees 16. The aggregated and delayed nature of current PAYE information enables errors to perpetuate across multiple pay periods and limits Inland Revenue’s ability to identify and work with employers to rapidly correct them. In turn this affects individual employees who can have PAYE over or under-withheld or can incur additional student loan deductions or child support or Working for Families’ debt. As an example almost 19,000 student loan borrowers were required to make addition deductions in the year to June 2015 because they were on the wrong tax code. 17. The aggregated and delayed nature of current PAYE information also limits opportunit ies to improve the future operation of social policy for example by reducing the period over which social policies such as Working for Families are assessed. A shorter assessment period could allow assistance to better match periods of need. PAYE rules 18. The existing tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance has a tendency to result in over-withholding of PAYE, which gives rise to fairness concerns. 19. Different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products currently have different rules on what is to be done when there is a legislated rate (or threshold) change during a pay period or if there is rate (or threshold) change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. This creates complexity and confusion for employers, which adds to compliance costs. GST 20. GST raised 36% of tax revenue in the year to June 2015. Around 640,000 persons and businesses are registered for GST. The time and costs they incur in complying with their GST obligations and the cost of administering GST could be reduced and efficiency improved if more use was made of electronic services in interaction with Inland Revenue. OBJECTIVES 21. The Government is committed to making positive changes to reduce the time and costs to emplo yers of meeting their tax obligations, it also seeks more useful and timely PAYE information to improve the administration of social policy and support wider 8 improvements to public services. The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: a. Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. b. Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. c. Sustainability of tax and income-related social policy system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent, coherent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes and should enable more timely policy changes. d. Basis for improved social policy and other government services: options should support the more effective use of income information in the delivery of social policy and improved information sharing between government agencies to deliver better public services. 22. These criteria are weighted equally. It is acknowledged however that judgements are affected by the weight given to different aspects for example ‘Fairness and equity’ involves consideration of both the employers who may benefit from a subsidy or incentive and of taxpayers who must pay for it. 23. Impacts on employees are considered, from a systems perspective under ‘Sustainability of the tax and income-related social policy system’ and under ‘Basis for improved social policy and other government services’. This later criterion is only used in respect of PAYE information. 24. Fiscal impacts are identified where relevant. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. REGULATORY ANALYSIS 25. Officials have developed options to address the above issues. These options have been grouped into the following three key themes: A. Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes B. Getting it right fro m the start (addit ional PAYE information) C. Making the PAYE rules work better. 26. Each of these themes and the options under them are summarised below. Further detail on the issues and options under each theme is contained in the appendices. 9 27. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used.  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo A. Using Digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes 28. Currently businesses and other employers need to manage their PAYE obligations as separate processes which stand-alo ne from the management of business as usual. Elsewhere businesses, organisations and individuals are increasingly harnessing the power of software to automate, integrate and facilitate processes. 29. Maintaining the current PAYE processes would deny employers the opportunity to take advantage of modern digital services to reduce compliance costs by integrating PAYE requirements into business processes. Integrating tax requirements into business processes, such as providing PAYE information at the time emplo yees are paid, would also reduce administrative costs and lay the basis for improved service provision to employees from Inland Revenue and wider government. 30. Using digital services to reduce compliance and administrative costs and improve the quality of government services is crucially dependent on the nature and quality of the PAYE- related services offered in payroll software and options are considered to ensure payroll software facilitates the provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process. 31. To maximise available compliance and administrative savings and reflect the fact that PAYE and related deductions belong to employees and then the Crown, PAYE and related deductions should also be remitted on payday. Options for changing when remittance of PAYE and related deductions are due are considered. 32. Options for encouraging and targeting the uptake of digital services are also considered in this section as is the use of thresholds to differentiate obligations between larger and smaller employers. 33. The final proposal in this section examines options for reducing the costs associated with filing GST returns. Options and Analysis 34. The proposals to address the issues identified are: • PAYE information at the time of the business process • Provision of PAYE information through payroll software • Remit PAYE and related deductions on payday • PAYE - encouraging the take-up of digital services and targeting assistance • PAYE thresholds 10 • GST – Introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns PAYE Information provision at time of business process 35. To improve processes for the provision of PAYE information officials have considered a number of options. These options centre on whether or not employers are required to provide information at the time of the business process, for example providing information about income and deductions on payday 1 . The options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A -1. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo – where the legislation requires PAYE information on a monthly basis regardless of the employers pay cycle. 2. Voluntary provisio n of PAYE informat ion at time of business process Fairness and equity  Compliance and administration  Sustainability  Basis for improved social policy  3. Require PAYE informat ion on payday 2 and other PAYE information 3 no later than payday. For emplo yers below a threshold and not using payroll software the due date would allow for returns to be posted.

Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Basis for improved social policy  1 There would be a minimum period of a week; employers who pay daily would not be required to provide information more than weekly. 2 Due date would be day after payday. 3 About new and departing employees 4 Due date would be the day after payday 5 About new and departing employees 11 Recommendation 36. Option three, requiring PAYE information on payday from all employers would represent a significant improvement on the status quo and rates highest on the criteria related to the sustainability of the tax and income-related social policy system and the extent to which it creates a foundation for future improvements to social policy. It reflects the proposition that this information is available at this point in time as a result of the employer paying staff and could therefore be provided to Inland Revenue at little additional cost. 37. Officials however recommend option 4. Option 4 would require pay-period PAYE informat ion to be provided on payday above a threshold and at month end fro m those below the threshold and fro m those with an exemption because they are unable to access digital services. This option balances the interests of employers with small payrolls who may not derive the benefits associated with the use of payroll software against the wider system benefits that are available from payday filing of PAYE information. Facilitating provision of PAYE information through software 38. The Commissioner can prescribe the content and format for electronic forms. The options considered below centre on whether or not payroll software should: • only be able to be used to provide PAYE information on payday 6 , even in circumstances where the emplo yer is below a payday filing threshold and could chose to file with a later due date, and • be required to offer services which employers can chose to use to advise of new and departing employees when they are added to or removed from the payroll. 39. The options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A -2. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Status Quo – leave it to the market to decide whether - Payroll software can be used to file with a later due date (by small employers) - Software offers the opportunity for employers to advise Inland Revenue of new and departing employers at the time they are added to or removed from the payroll. 2. Require payroll software to: - Only offer payday filing of PAYE income and deduction information. - Offer services which employers can choose to use to report new and departing employee information at the time they arrive or leave. Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Basis for improved social policy  6 The payroll software will not automatically provide the information, all transmissions must be authorised by the employer’s representative. 12 Recommendation 40. Officials recommend option 2 which requires payroll software providers to only offer payday filing and to offer a service to notify IR when new employees are added or removed from the payroll. This option best supports the objectives of reduced compliance and administrative costs and provides the best basis for subsequent improvements to social policy. Remit PAYE and related deductions on payday 41. Officials have considered three options to address opportunities in relation to PAYE remittance and its integration into business processes and the use of digital services. These options focus on whether the timing and process of remitting PAYE should be required to be aligned with: • the business process of paying employees, and • the timing and process of providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue. 42. It is noted that those employers who are not required to align PAYE remittance with the process of paying their employees under the below options will be able to remit PAYE on payday on a voluntary basis should they wish to take advantage of integrating all PAYE obligations with their business processes. 43. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-3. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo – employers are allowed to hold PAYE and related deductions until they are required to remit them to Inland Revenue either once or twice a month. 2. Align the remittance of PAYE with the business process of paying staff for all employers. Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  3. Align the remittance of PAYE with the business process of paying staff for emplo yers above a threshold and payroll intermediaries, and retain delayed PAYE remittance for employers below the threshold. Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  13 Recommendation 44. Officials recommend option 3 as it balances the benefits of aligning PAYE (and related deductions) remittance with the business process of paying employees and the consideration of the impact payday remittance may have particularly on small businesses and not-for-profit organisations. Officials acknowledge that retaining the status quo while allowing employers who chose to do so, to remit on payday, would avoid the negative impacts that requiring payday remittance could have. PAYE encouraging the uptake of digital services and targeting support 45. Government has identified a major role for digital technology in making tax simpler and a key focus will be working with the software industry to ensure the deployment of high quality user friendly services. A payroll subsidy currently exists to encourage small businesses to outsource their PAYE obligations. Officials have considered options to encourage digital uptake and target support. The options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-4. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo – leave the payro ll subsidy threshold where it is. 2. Reduce the payro ll subsidy threshold to better target the subsidy. Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Foundation for improved social policy  3. Repeal the payroll subsidy Fairness and Equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability   Foundation for improved social policy  Recommendation 46. Option 3 addresses the concerns about eliminating distortions and weights fairness to the tax payer higher than option 2. 47. Officials recommend option 2 to reduce the payroll subsidy threshold to better target the subsidy and reduce the potential for it to distort decisions about whether or not to use a listed payroll intermediary (eligible for the subsidy) or to purchase payroll software or other services (ineligible). PAYE thresholds 48. Because of the absence of economies of scale PAYE obligations impose higher per employee compliance costs on small employers than on larger ones. Although not without costs of their own thresholds are a mechanism through which obligations and entitlements can be differentiated to mitigate the higher compliance costs and to target support. 14 49. Officials have considered four options for a PAYE threshold to apply to the following obligations and entitlements: • The obligation to file PAYE information electronically • The obligation to file PAYE information on payday • The obligation to remit PAYE and related deductions on payday • Eligibility for the payroll subsidy 50. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-5 Options Comparison to status quo 1. Status quo thresholds which relate to the above obligations and entitlements as follows: $100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT 7 for electronic filing- but no payday filing obligation. $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT threshold for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and for PAYE information by 5 th of following month. $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT as the threshold for the payroll subsidy. Change to threshold requires legislative amendment. 2. One PAYE threshold for all obligations and entitlements at $100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT.

Status quo: $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT threshold for frequency of twice monthly remittance. $50,000pa of PAYE and ESCT for electronic filing. All employers to submit PAYE information on payday. No payroll subsidy. Threshold able to be changed by Order-in-Council following consultation. Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Foundation for improved social policy  7 Employer’s superannuation contribution tax. 15 Recommendation 51. The analysis of the options depends on the importance ascribed to the various obligations, particularly the importance of payday information compared to the value put on payday remittance of PAYE. 52. Because it balances the objective of receiving PAYE information earlier against small businesses’ concerns about the cash flow impact of earlier remittance officials recommend option 2 to introduce a single threshold at $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to determine the following obligations and entitlements: • The obligation to file PAYE information electronically • The obligation to file PAYE information on payday • The obligation to remit PAYE and related deductions on payday • Eligibility for the payroll subsidy • The threshold able to be changed in future by Order in Council following consultation: GST – Introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns 53. Currently there is no electronic filing threshold for the filing of GST returns. To address uptake of electronic services for GST in the future and its benefits officials have considered two options. 54. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-6. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo – All taxpayers can choose to file their GST returns electronically or on paper. 2. Introduce a framework for the setting of an electronic filing threshold for GST returns. Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  3. Introduce a non-electronic filing penalty set at $250 as part of the framework under option 2. Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  16 Recommendation 55. Officials recommend options 2 and 3 to introduce a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for the filing of GST returns by Order-in-Council in the future and a non-electronic filing penalty set at $250 as part of this framework. 56. Combined option 2 and 3 recognise the benefits of reduced compliance and administrative costs and reduced transcription errors that can be realised through electronic filing. The option acknowledges the relatively high level of uptake of electronic filing for GST returns under current Inland Revenue services and provides a mechanism to introduce a threshold if electronic filing does not continue to increase. 17 B. Getting it right from the start Provision of date of birth information and contact details for all new employees 57. Because new employees are not always set up correctly from the start, or as near as possible to the start of their employment PAYE compliance and administrative costs are higher than they need to be and employees can incur social policy debt and be subject to incorrect PAYE withho lding. 58. The recommended requirement that payroll software should offer employers the opportunity to forward new employee details as soon as they are added to the payroll and before they are first paid will contribute to reducing these problems. Current tax processes are however out of step with modern approaches to identity confirmation in not seeking date of birth information and in not taking the opportunity to update contact details at the time employment changes. The options also consider whether employers should be able to pass on information such as contact details already gathered from the employee. 59. Officials have considered two options which are summarised below and set out in more detail in Appendix B-1. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo: No date of birth information and contact details only from those in or eligible for KiwiSaver and no ability for employer to pass on information already gathered fro m an emplo yee. 2. Require date of birth and contact detail information for all new employees and enable employers to pass on information already gathered. Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Foundation for improved social policy  Recommendation 60. Officials recommend option 2 to require date of birth and contact information for all new employers while allowing employers to pass on information already gathered from an employee for their own purposes. 18 C. Making the PAYE rules work better Tax treatment of holiday pay 61. The tax treatment of holiday pay differs depending on whether it is paid as a lump sum (in which case it is treated as an extra pay), or whether it is included in an employee’s regular pay or paid in substitution for an employee’s ordinary salary or wages when annual paid holidays are taken (in which case it is treated as salary or wages). 62. Holiday pay paid in advance as a lump sum is currently taxed as an extra pay. This has a tendency to result in over-withholding of PAYE. Anecdotally, it is common for employees in some industries to work longer hours in the lead up to Christmas, which can exacerbate the over-withholding caused by using the extra pay formula. This, combined with receiving no income during the following weeks when the holiday is taken, may make things difficult for the employee financially. 63. While employees are able to obtain a refund for any over-withheld tax following the end of the tax year, the fact that it can adversely affect employees’ adequacy of income around the period the holiday is taken gives rise to fairness concerns. 64. Officials have considered a number of options, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in Appendix C-1. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo 2. Require employers to deduct PAYE from holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  3. Retain the ability for employers to tax holiday pay paid in advance as an extra pay, but allow employers the option of deducting PAYE as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Recommendation 65. Officials recommend option 3, as it strikes the best balance between fairness and compliance cost considerations, and it is the most sustainable option. 19 Application of legislated rate changes 66. Different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products have different rules on what is to be done when there is a legislated rate (or threshold) change during a pay period or if there is rate (or threshold) change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. The rates (or thresholds) that apply are sometimes based on the pay date, sometimes pay period end-date or pay period start-date, while sometimes apportionment applies. This creates complexity and confusion for employers when there is a rate (or threshold) change, which adds to compliance costs. 67. Officials have considered a number of options, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in Appendix C-2. Options Comparison to status quo 1. Retain the status quo 2. Alignment based on pay date Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  3. Alignment based on pay period end-date Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  4. Alignment based on pay period start-date Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  5. Alignment based on apportionment Fairness and equity  Compliance and administrative costs  Sustainability  Recommendation 68. Officials recommend option 2 because it would simplify the transitional process the most for employers when a legislated rate or threshold change occurs (thus resulting in the largest reduction in compliance costs), and it would be the most sustainable option. CONCLUSION 69. The recommended options under the above themes enable material compliance and administrative cost savings, enable improved service delivery to individuals and lay a foundation for subsequent improvements to social policy and wider government services. They do this while recognising that ‘one size cannot fit all’ and while maintaining New Zealand’s broad base low rate tax framework. 20 CONSULTATION 70. Several forms of consultation have been undertaken in developing the options outlined in this statement. 71. In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University hosted a conference entitled Tax administration for the 21 st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier through reducing both compliance and administration costs, while balancing increased voluntary compliance against the core tax policy objectives of raising sufficient revenue and ensuring fairness and efficiency. The main points made by attendees were to give people the ability to self-manage their tax affairs through improved services and more flexible legislative frameworks, the importance of involving businesses and others in the design of the rules and processes, the need to ensure that there is an overall net benefit to society of the changes not just a cost shift from Inland Revenue to businesses, and to ensure the continued maintenance of the current tax system whilst the reforms occur. 72. Following this conference the Government issued Making Tax Simpler – a Government green paper on tax administration which outlined the scope and direction of the review of the tax administration, and sought feedback on the problems taxpayers face with the current system. At the same time the Government released Making Tax Simpler – Better Digital Services a Government discussion document which identified the key role envisaged for digital services in the modernised tax administration system. 73. Feedback on these two documents informed Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document which was released for public consultation in early November 2015. In addition to the discussion document an on- line forum was established and employers and GST registered persons were notified of the consultation and encouraged to provide feedback. Over 1,000 comments were made to the online forum and more than eighty written submissions were received. This public feedback has informed the development of the options presented in this statement. 74. Submissions from representative bodies, large employers and employers already using payroll software noted one-off compliance costs to upgrade software, but were generally supportive of further integration of PAYE processes into payroll software. Submissions from employers not using payroll software and from smaller employers were largely opposed to providing PAYE information at the time of the business process as they did not want to have to adopt software and/or were concerned about the potential for higher compliance costs from more frequent filing. 75. Submissions on the proposed changes for GST supported allowing GST registered persons to file directly from their accounting software, a change that does not require legislative amendment but were generally opposed to the proposal that there be a threshold above which GST registered persons would have to file electronically. 76. Further details on the response to consultation are provided for each measure set out in the appendices. 21 IMPLEMENTATION 77. The discussion document consulted on three implementation options for the potential obligation to report PAYE information at the time of the business process: • a voluntary-first approach with the potential for subsequent compulsion after a critical mass had adopted the new way of submitting PAYE information; • a review approach that would establish a timetable for a review but would not establish new obligations until after the new digital PAYE services were in operation and had been reviewed; or • a legislated approach where the initial legislation would establish a lead-in period by the end of which employers would be required to provide information at the time of the business process. 78. The majorit y of submissions on the implementation approach supported the voluntary-first approach with some support for the review approach. Feedback in response to other questions and discussions with some software providers suggests however, that in the absence of a legal requirement for employers to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process, it will be difficult to ensure that software providers update their systems and services. 79. The voluntary-first and review approaches would also postpone the realisation of benefits and potentially delay the timeframe for the introduction of the changes to social policy which depend on disaggregated and more timely PAYE information. 80. Accordingly a legislated approach to implementing a timeframe for the changes to PAYE is proposed. The approach will initially be permissive and allow employers to adopt the new ways of providing PAYE information and remitting PAYE and related deductions, but the legislation will include a timeframe by the end of which employers will be required to provide pay-period PAYE information. Employers at, or above, the threshold will be required to provide the information electronically. 81. Having regard to the timetable for the introduction of Inland Revenue’s new START system, and taking into account feedback from large employers about their requirement for 1 to 3 years to plan, schedule and implement the changes, it is proposed that the recommended options will be included in a bill to be introduced later in 2016 and enacted before Parliament rises for the general election in 2017. The recommended options will apply as set out below: • 1 April 2018 is the date from which it will be permissible for employers to submit PAYE information and remit PAYE and related deductions on payday. • 1 April 2018 is the effective date for the proposed changes to the PAYE rules. • 1 April 2018 is the date at which the eligibility threshold for the payroll subsidy would change. • 1 April 2019 is the date from which employers with an obligation to do so, will be required to submit pay-period PAYE informat ion on payday. • 1 April 2019 is also the date from which any employers required to do so would remit PAYE and related deductions on payday. 22 MONITORING EVALUATION AND REVIEW 82. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a mult i-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 83. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 84. Also, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme a benefit management strategy has been developed and endorsed. The programme costs and benefit estimation approach is outlined in Appendix G of the November 2015 Programme Update and Detailed Business Case. The benefit management strategy provides the framework for managing benefits within the programme, and: • defines benefit components; • details how programme benefits will be quantified and measured; • documents how progress will be tracked; and • describes what governance arrangements will be in place. 85. Inland Revenue has commissioned a regular survey of compliance costs. This survey is being redeveloped in the context of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme and will survey SMEs, individuals and larger employers with a specific focus on the impact of change. 86. Both internal and external stakeholders will be actively involved in the on-going assessment of timeframes, benefits identification and benefits realisation for each stage of the transformation programme. 23 Appendix A APPENDIX A - USING DIGITAL SERVICES TO INTEGRATE TAX REQUIREMENTS INTO BUSINESS PROCESSES Status Quo and problem definition There are just over 194,000 employers in New Zealand with PAYE obligat ions. • Thirt y seven percent of total tax revenue comes from PAYE ($25,760 million) 8 • PAYE system is also used to collect: o Student loan repayments $795 million 9 o Child Support payments $286.5 million 10 o KiwiSaver emplo yee contributions $3,214 million 11 o KiwiSaver employer contributions $2,017 million 12 o Payroll giving $2.1 million 13 Currently businesses and other organisations employing staff including not for profit organisations, central and local government 14 agencies, clubs, societ ies and individuals, need to attend to their PAYE obligations on timetables set by the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Filing returns and making payments are separate stand-alone processes. Employers must deduct PAYE and related deductions from an employee’s salary or wages each payday and provide aggregated informat ion 15 for each employee about income paid and deductions made to Inland Revenue once a month. PAYE information is due on the 5 th of following month for the largest employers (those with over $500,000 a year of PAYE and employers superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)) and on the 20 th of the following month for all other emplo yers. Employers must pay (remit) the PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue. The largest emplo yers remit twice monthly on the 20 th for deductions made between the 1 st and the 15 th and on the 5 th of the following month deductions made between the 16 th and month end. All other emplo yers remit their PAYE and other deductions wit h their PAYE informat ion on the 20 th of the following month. Employers with more than $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT must file their PAYE information 16 electronically. Despite this a significant number of Inland Revenue’s PAYE processes and requirements involve paper forms, or electronic forms which cannot be directly populated from a payroll software system but must be manually completed. 8 Year to March 2016 9 Year to June 2015 10 Year to June 2015 11 Year to March 2016 12 Year to March 2016 13 Year to March 2015 14 In addition to their obligations as an employer the Ministry of Social Development, ACC and Inland Revenue also have PAYE obligations when they pay taxable benefits and entitlements. 15 For each employee the information is aggregated across the pay-periods in the month to provide monthly totals. 16 The IR 348 EMS and the IR 345 EDF 24 Appendix A PAYE imposes compliance costs on employers. It is generally accepted that per employee compliance costs are highest for small employers. Inland Revenue’s 2013 survey of small and medium enterprise (SME) compliance costs identified median PAYE including KiwiSaver, compliance costs for micro employers (1-5 staff) of $827 per annum and $1,350 per annum for small employers with between 6 – 19 staff. If these costs are extrapolated across the all employers in these segments PAYE compliance costs for micro and small employers amount to over $171 million per annum. Data limitations and sample size suggest however that the figures should be regarded as indicative and ranged + 30% ($120 million to $223 million). Administrative costs for PAYE are comparatively low at an estimated $0.25 per $100 of PAYE. There is however potential for reduction in administrative costs as a significant number of Inland Revenue staff are currently engaged in error correction and other remedial work. The status quo also imposes costs on employees. PAYE information about income and deductions is currently aggregated across a month and is not received until the month follo wing. This means that Inland Revenue is unable to ensure that deductions are correctly set up from the start of employment and limits its ability to subsequently intervene if things start to go wrong. As a result employees can end up paying additional student loan deductions or incur child support, or Working for Families’ tax credit, debt. The aggregated and delayed nature of current PAYE information also limits opportunities to improve the future operation of social policy, for example by reducing the period over which social policies such as Working for Families are assessed. A shorter period of assessment could allow assistance to better meet periods of need. In March 2015 the Government released Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration which set out these ideas. A consultation document on social policy which will set out how these changes might work is scheduled for release in 2017. In addit ion, the delayed remittance of PAYE and related deductions denies individuals the timely application of their student loan repayments and KiwiSaver contributions and delays the onward passage of child support payments. Options The proposals to address these issues are: 1. Require PAYE information to be provided at the time of the business process 2. Facilitating the provision of PAYE information through software 3. Remitting PAYE at time of the business process 4. PAYE – encouraging the take-up of digital services and targeting support 5. Use of thresholds to vary obligations 6. GST – Introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns 25 Appendix A 1. PAYE information at the time of the business process Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate and integrate processes. Digital systems provide the opportunity to eliminate calculation and transcription errors and to seamlessly transmit data from the customer to Inland Revenue at the time of the business process. This could improve accuracy and timeliness, reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for improved social policy. New and departing employee information Under the status quo information is not received about new employees until the month following when they are first paid and processing time with Inland Revenue’s current system means that it is often more than 6 weeks after a new employee is first paid that Inland Revenue may identify a problem with their deductions and get back to the employer. These delays may require the employer to make adjustments, which incurs compliance costs, and may impose debt or additional payments, such as higher student loan repayments, on the emplo yee. For example in the year ended 2015 more than 18,700 student loan borrowers incurred additional student loan deductions which could have been avoided if they had been on the correct tax code. These additional deductions generally lifted the repayment rate from 12% of salary to 17%. If employers provided information about new employees when they were first added to the payro ll and before they were first paid, it would allow Inland Revenue to respond in near real-time to assist the employer to set the new employee up correctly from the outset. However in small businesses the process of adding employees to the payroll does not necessarily occur as a discrete process prior to staff being paid. New staff details are added as part of completing the first pay. New staff in large organisations can also be added to the payroll immediately prior to payment and while there might in theory be time for an emplo yer to send information to Inland Revenue and action a near-real time response from Inland Revenue, in reality the payroll staff will often have other priorities. Pay period information Integrating the provision of PAYE information relating to income and deductions with the process of paying staff would improve timeliness and by eliminating transcription and reducing calculation errors, should improve the quality of the information. Integrating PAYE obligations to report income and deductions with the payday process would provide Inland Revenue with pay period information on 17 , or close to, payday. At present employers must calculate PAYE income and deductions for each payday but are then required to aggregate it for each employee into monthly totals. Disaggregated (pay period) information provided sooner would enable Inland Revenue to intervene more quickly to improve the accuracy of PAYE withholding, for example by suggesting a special tax code to someone at risk of being overtaxed because their secondary tax code has taken them into a higher tax bracket. It would also enable Inland Revenue to better monitor the income assessments made by employees for social policy entitlements such as Working for Families and to intervene with 17 Some employers pay staff daily; in all options for change, a minimum period of a week is proposed. 26 Appendix A more confidence when it appears that customers are at risk of being underpaid or of incurring year-end debt. In the year to June 2014 52,000 families were either over or under paid by more than $500 and while some of this will reflect changes in family arrangements rather than changes in income, the redevelopment of systems to support Working for Families customers requires accurate, timely PAYE information. Pay period PAYE information provided sooner would provide the opportunity for Inland Revenue to reduce the square up period for Working for Families from a year to a shorter period which could enable assistance to better match periods of need. Pay-period information provided sooner would also improve the effectiveness of information sharing with Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation to identify fraud and overpayment. Finally if pay period information on income and deductions was available to other Government agencies in near real-time it could lay a foundation for further service improvements. Consultation Feedback from employers on providing PAYE income and deduction information on payday was mixed. Large employers and representative bodies generally support the further integration of PAYE requirements with payroll software, agreeing that after the one off cost of change there should be compliance costs savings. Similarly a number of smaller employers currently using payroll software were supportive of the proposed changes. Most respondents found it hard to estimate the magnitude of the savings although they were usually assessed as relatively modest. Submitters who supported further integration of PAYE with payroll software wanted a simple method for correcting payroll errors. Other submitters considered that an updated means of filing through Inland Revenue’s website would make electronic and/or payday filing more attractive to small employers. However many submitters who responded on the on-line forum opposed the change either because they did not use payroll software or because they were concerned that the changes would increase compliance costs because of the requirement for more frequent filing. Options Several options to integrate PAYE information with business processes were considered. A voluntary-first approach would amend the legislation to allow employers to choose to file on payday if it suited them. If a significant number of employers demand the service software providers could be expected to update their payroll systems to offer it and payday filing might subsequently be required from all employers. Feedback from large employers identified however that unless changes are required by legislation their often overseas based software providers may not update their systems. Limited consultation with software providers servicing small employers in the New Zealand market reinforced these concerns. Requiring all employers to provide pay period information on payday would maximise the benefits available from earlier PAYE information and would lay the best foundation for subsequent improvements to social policy. This option would not require employers to calculate additional information as the PAYE information is required to calculate the pay. The option would however require the information to be provided more often (each payday). Under this option it is proposed that the due date for those above a threshold would be the 27 Appendix A day after payday and for those below the threshold and not using payroll software, it would be set allowing time for the receipt of posted returns. The option of requiring pay-period PAYE information to be provided on payday 18 by employers above a threshold, with other emplo yers required to provide the same information but able to choose to do so, on a monthly basis, reflects the fact that emplo yers filing PAYE information on paper could incur additional compliance costs from payday filing. This option would allow larger employers and other users of software to benefit from the proposals to integrate the provision of PAYE information with the process of paying staff while not imposing more frequent filing on small employers. Bringing the date for monthly filing forward from the 20 th to a date after month end which allows for the receipt of posted returns is designed to minimise delay while recognising that it will take time for employers, who chose to continue to file using paper, or who can’t access digital services, to complete their month end processes and mail the information to Inland Revenue. In all options other than the status quo it is intended that simple payroll errors would be able to be self-corrected in a subsequent period. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out on the next page. None of the options have fiscal impacts. 18 Due date the day after payda y. 28 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax and income related social policy system Basis for improved social and other government services 1. Retain status quo: the legislation requires PAYE information on a monthly basis regardless of the employers pay cycle. The status quo denies opportunity to employers who want to benefit from integration of tax and business processes. Overall compliance and administrative costs higher than they would be under other options. PAYE information underpins much of the income-related social policy system - the status quo is inflexible and limits policy options. PAYE information would still be aggregated and received from employers in the following month. 2. Voluntary provision of PAYE information at time of business process Better than status quo Would enable employers to decide although if payroll software providers do not upgrade the choice is illusory. Better than status quo Employers whose software providers have updated their systems could benefit. The administration may have to cater for both approaches over a long period. No better than the status quo The system will have to cater for those who chose the status quo as so will remain inflexible. No better than status quo Redesign of social policy cannot assume that PAYE information will be available on a pay period and more timely basis. 3. Require pay period PAYE information to be filed on payday and other PAYE information 19 no later than payday from all employers. For employers below a threshold, not using payroll software, the due date is proposed as a date which allows for the receipt of posted returns. For others the due date is the day after payday. 20 No better than status quo The payday filing obligation is imposed on all employers. Those using manual systems could incur increased costs which will raise fairness concerns. Better than status quo Compliance costs for many employers should reduce although costs on small employers not filing electronically could increase due to payday filing requirement. Administration costs will decrease. Significantly better than status quo All employers providing pay period information and filing on payday will improve the flexibility of the tax and income related social policy system Significantly better than status quo Pay period information on payday from all employers would provide significant improvements over the status quo in the management and future improvement of social policy delivery. 4 Require pay period PAYE information on payday and other PAYE information no later than payday above a threshold and at month end for those below threshold or exempt. 21 The due date for those below the thresholds and not us ing software would allow for the receipt of posted returns. Significantly better than status quo Permits employers to choose options which should reduce compliance costs without imposing pay period filing on small employers. Better than status quo Following a one off compliance cost to upgrade software, compliance and administrative costs lower than status quo. Better than status quo All employers providing pay period information will improve the flexibility of the system but not as much as option 3. Better than the status quo An improvement over the status quo. Does not provide payday information near payday for all employees but is a stepping stone towards that objective. 19 About new and departing employees. 20 Employees who are required to provide their own PAYE information because their employer has not deducted PAYE (including IR56 taxpayers) would be required to provide PAYE information after the end of the month in which they receive the payment(s). The due date would allow for postage of a return. 21 Employees who are required to provide their own PAYE information because their employer has not deducted PAYE (including IR56 taxpayers) would be required to provide PAYE information after the month in which they receive the payment(s). The due date would allow for postage of a return. 29 Appendix A Recommendations Officials recommend option 4 – require the provision of pay period PAYE information on payday and other PAYE information no later than payday above a threshold, and require the same information from those below the threshold and from those unable to access digital services, but allow them to choose whether to provide it on payday or at month end, allowing time for posting a return. This option balances the interests of small employers, with regard to compliance costs, against the wider system benefits available from universal payday filing The status quo must change if employers who are using payroll software or an updated IR website are to benefit from being able to provide information as part of their business process. The current requirement is that regardless of when an employer pays employees the PAYE informat ion must be provided on a monthly basis. The option of leaving it to employers to choose whether to provide PAYE information on payday or on the current basis would not ensure that payroll software providers update their packages and services to support payday filing, which would undermine the benefits. Option 3, requiring PAYE information from all emplo yers at the time of the business process is also a substantial improvement on the status quo. It would maximise the benefits available from earlier PAYE information but may impose addit ional compliance costs on employers who do not use payroll software. For a discussion of threshold levels under option 4, number of employers affected and mechanisms to change the threshold see the discussion of thresholds in section A-5 (page 40). 2. Facilitating provision of PAYE information through payroll software Provision of PAYE information through payroll software would maximise compliance and administrative cost savings and by facilitating payday reporting would maximise the opportunities for improved service provision 22 to employees. Consultation The option of requiring employers to use payroll software was however discounted before consultation. This judgment was informed by the sheer number of very small employers and by the significant opposition to the prospect of being required to use software from those who responded to consultation on Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services a Government discussion document which identified the major role proposed for digital technology in making tax simpler. Many of those who responded on the online forum, to the Making Tax Simpler - Better administration of PAYE and GST similarly indicated that they considered that they were ‘just too small’ to justify the cost 23 of payroll software. 22 Both in terms of accurate PAYE withholding and management of social policy obligations and entitlements such as student loan deductions, child support, Working for Families Tax credits. 23 In financial terms and in the psychological cost of change. 30 Appendix A PAYE income and deduction information At present if payroll software is used to populate electronic versions of the PAYE information return (the employer monthly schedule) the software must meet a prescribed format. The material that can be prescribed covers content and format but not due dates 24 . If all emplo yers, or emplo yers above a threshold, are required to provide PAYE information about income and deductions on payday, payroll providers will need to update their software to remain co mpliant. The approaches to payday filing set out above do however leave grey areas around software being used by employers which are under the electronic filing threshold for whom the due date would allow time to post a return. In the absence of a specific requirement that payroll software must be used to file income and deduction information on payday, payroll providers may experience pressure fro m emplo yers under the relevant threshold, to take advantage of the later due date available to small emplo yers. For the reasons set out in the previous section, provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process should provide compliance cost savings to users of payroll software and there will be administrative cost and social policy benefits if all payroll software is used to submit PAYE information about income and deductions on payday. Provision of employee information at the time they are added to or removed from the payroll As set out in the previous analysis feedback to consultation identified that it would not always be practicable to require employers to provide information about new employees before they were first paid and about departing employers when they are removed fro m the payro ll. For this reason officials have recommended that the obligation is to provide such information no later than the next return of PAYE income and deduction details. Despite it not being practicable to legislate for, there was considerable support from employers for the option of sending new employee details to Inland Revenue before they are first paid and getting confirmation or otherwise, back in near-real time. There was also support for the proposal that the employer could use their payroll software to notify Inland Revenue of a departing employee mid pay period enabling Inland Revenue to automatically de-link the employee fro m the emplo yer. Due to the current delays in the provision and processing of PAYE information de-linking can take months which can result in employers being contacted repeatedly about employees who have ceased employment. The options considered below include leaving it to the market to decide whether: - employers can use their payroll software to advise Inland Revenue of new and departing emplo yees at the time they are added to or removed from the payroll; - employers can source payroll software which allows small employers to take advantage of a later due date for fil ing PAYE informat ion. The alternative option would require all payroll software to: - offer the capability of advising Inland Revenue when employees are added or removed from the payroll; - only offer payday filing of PAYE income and deduction information (no later filing date option regardless of the size of the employer). Neither of the options has fiscal implications. 24 The due dates for PAYE returns are set out in the legislation Sections RD 22 (2); RD 22(2B) and RD22 (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 31 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax and income related social policy system Basis for improved social and other government services 1. Status Quo – leave it to the market to decide whether: - Pay roll software can be used to file with a later due date (by small employers) - Software offers the opportunity for employers to advise Inland Revenue of new and departing employers at the time they are added to or removed from the payroll. Employers below the relevant threshold using payroll software may be able to take advantage of a due date which allows time to post a return. Employers could choose whether to use software which can advise Inland Revenue of new and departing employees at the time of the business process. The constraint would be whether an employer can source the feature they want in the software they use. Compliance and administrative costs may be higher/slower to reduce than under option 2. Outcome dependent on the choices that software providers and employers make. To the extent that fewer employers report PAYE information at the time of the business process (on payday and when employees are added to and removed from the payroll) the quality of services provided to individuals may be reduced. 2. Require payroll software to: - Only offer payday filing of PAYE income and deduction information. - Offer services which employers can choose to use to report new and departing employee information at the time employees are added to or removed from the payroll. Better than the status quo Employers can have confidence that software offering digital services which integrate with business processes will be available. However employers below the threshold using software who wish to file PAYE information with a later due date are denied the option. All employers using payroll software would be provided with the option of providing details of new and departing employees at the time of the business process. Significantly better than the status quo Compliance and administrative costs lower than under the status quo because more employees will be set up correctly from the start or near start of employment. Better than the status quo Option 2 will obtain pay period information on payday for more employees which improves the flexibility of the system compared to the status quo. Significantly better than the status quo If all employers who use payroll software are filing income and deduction information on payday it will improve the services that can be offered to their employees. Similarly, if all employers using software can choose to inform Inland Revenue of employee details at the time of the business process then the services offered to their employees should improve. 32 Appendix A Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – Require payroll software to: - Only offer payday filing of PAYE income and deduction information. - Offer services which employers can choose to use to report new and departing employee information at the time employees are added to or removed from the payroll While the status quo, leaving it to the market, would theoretically maximise the choices available to employers it may require employers to change their processes on more than one occasion and would reduce the likelihood that all new employers choosing payroll software would chose a service or product which should minimise their compliance costs. In addition the status quo is likely to be more costly to administer, due to slower identification of errors and as a result, would mean less accurate withholding and less effective administration of social policy. 3. Remit PAYE and related deductions on payday Employers deduct PAYE (and related deductions, such as child support, student loan and KiwiSaver) fro m their emplo yees’ salary or wages each payday. The employer holds the withheld amount in trust for the Crown until it is passed on to Inland Revenue, once or twice a month, to meet the employee’s tax (and some other) liabilities. Large employers and software intermediaries pass on withheld amounts twice monthly on the 20 th of the month and the 5 th of the following month. Employers who have below $500,000 of PAYE and ESCT a year remit PAYE once a month on the 20 th of the month following the PAYE source payment to the employee. The delayed remittance results in a separate PAYE payment and reconciliation process for employers which adds to their PAYE compliance costs. However, employers get the benefit of any interest on the withheld amounts until they pass them on to Inland Revenue. 25 Some other amounts that are part of the employer monthly schedule system (for example KiwiSaver emplo yer contribut ions) are passed on in the delayed remittance process. In addition, the delayed remittance results in employers that are in financial difficulties and default on their PAYE remittance obligations only being able to be identified and provided with support on a delayed timeframe. Integrating PAYE remittance as well as PAYE information with the employer’s business process of paying their employees would realise a number of benefits. It could reduce compliance costs in particular for employers using payroll software and reduce administrative costs. It would also reflect the fact that the deducted amounts do not belong to the employer, but are passed on to Inland Revenue to meet the employees’ tax (and some other) liabilities. It could also reduce employer defaults. However, these benefits have to be weighed against the disadvantages of aligning PAYE remittance with the business process of paying employees. In particular employers using 25 For many small employers the retention of these deductions is used as working capital. 33 Appendix A manual or paper systems may have increased compliance costs because of an increased frequency in PAYE payments to Inland Revenue. Emplo yers would lo se the advantage of reducing interest on borrowings they use to fund their business they would otherwise incur or earning interest on the PAYE deductions they hold for a while before passing them on. In particular small businesses’ cash flow may be adversely impacted. Assessments of the magnitude of this impact range from a one off $2.85 million additional interest cost on emplo yers 26 to $175 million 27 . Payroll intermediaries have been identified as a particular case where there could be adverse impact from a requirement for payday remittance. Legislation currently provides that employees using payroll intermediaries must pass on PAYE and related deductions to the intermediary on payday. This enables the intermediaries to earn interest on those deductions until payment to Inland Revenue is due. Officials have been advised that interest earned in this way is a significant part of payroll intermediaries’ revenue stream (one payroll intermediary advised it is about 40%) and in its absence the over 23,000 employers who use them may experience higher fees. Consultation The majority of those who responded to consultation were opposed to requiring employers to align the remittance of PAYE with the business process of paying employees and the process of providing PAYE information provision. The main concern was that they saw it negatively affecting businesses’ cash flow and the ability to offset some of the cost of employers’ PAYE obligations would be lost. Additionally, there were concerns that more frequent payment could increase compliance costs and there would be reduced time for error correction. A few submitters supported aligning the process of paying emplo yees wit h emplo yers’ PAYE obligations (PAYE remittance and provision of PAYE information) because they expect this to reduce compliance costs and to have the potential to help reduce PAYE payment default. Options Officials have considered three options in relation to PAYE remittance: • Option 1: Retain the status quo with delayed remittance of PAYE once or twice mo nthly. • Option 2: Require all employers to remit PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue at the time they pay their employees. • Option 3: Require employers above a threshold and payroll intermediaries to remit PAYE and related deductions at the time they pay their employees and emplo yers below the threshold retain the delayed remittance of PAYE. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. It is noted that employers who are not required to remit PAYE when they pay their emplo yees under any of the below options will still be able to do so on a voluntary basis 26 Assuming a once only cost and a $100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT threshold. 27 This estimate was made in response to consultation and is assumed to not involve a threshold and to assume employers borrow to fund every PAYE payment. 34 Appendix A should they wish to take advantage of integrating all PAYE obligations with their business processes. Some employers pay their employees daily. Officials considered whether PAYE deducted on daily payments should be required to be remitted on a payday basis. However, on balance this was discounted. It is considered that a minimum frequency of a week should apply to PAYE remittance. This means that employers who pay their employees daily and may be required to remit PAYE on a payday basis can aggregate the withheld PAYE on daily payments to employees to remit them to Inland Revenue on a weekly basis. Under options 2 and 3, employees who are responsible for providing their own PAYE information and remitting their own PAYE and related deductions because they receive gross payments from their employer(s) (including IR56 taxpayers) would have to remit their PAYE and related deductions on a monthly basis by the same due date as for the provision of PAYE information. 35 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax and income related social policy system Fiscal 1. Retain the status quo allowing delayed remittance of PAYE once or twice monthly. Depending on the option chosen for the provision of PAYE information, this option may result in additional PAYE remittance due dates separate from the due date for PAYE information for some or all employers, which may increase compliance costs and risk. The possibility of timely assistance for employers in risk of defaulting on PAYE (and related deductions) is limited. No impact. 2. Require all employers to remit PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue at the time they pay their employees. Worse than status quo Could impose additional compliance costs specifically on small employers who already incur higher PAYE costs per employee. In particular some small businesses and small not-for profit organisations may experience cash flow difficulties. Better than status quo Realises compliance cost reduction if aligned with business and PAYE information provision processes for employers using business software. Increases compliance costs for businesses using manual or paper processes (likely very small businesses). Significantly better than status quo Employers that have difficulties with meeting PAYE remittance obligations are identified faster and support can be provided faster. No revenue impact. No fiscal impact. Cash-flow benefit for the Crown of $1,040 million in the first year and $55 in the following. 3. Require employers above a threshold and payroll intermediaries to remit PAYE and related deductions at the time they pay their employees and employers below the threshold to remit PAYE when they provide PAYE information in the following month. No better than status quo Takes into consideration cash flow impacts on small employers. The cash flow impact on those above the threshold will depend on the threshold (see threshold section) Small employers which may be adversely affected by the impact on payroll intermediaries are entitled to the payroll subsidy. Significantly better than status quo Realises compliance cost reduction if aligned with business and PAYE information provision processes for employers using business software, but allows small businesses who are more likely to use manual or paper processes to remit PAYE once a month. Significantly better than status quo Employers that have difficulties with meeting PAYE remittance obligations are identified faster and support can be provided faster. No revenue impact. No fiscal impact Cash impact for the Crown depends on the level of the threshold (see section on thresholds) 36 Appendix A Recommendations Officials recommend option 3 – Require all employers with yearly PAYE and ESCT at or above a threshold to remit PAYE on payday and employers below the threshold to remit PAYE in the following month when they provide PAYE information. This will reduce compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue while considering cash flow implications for small businesses and other small organisations. Officials acknowledge however that retaining the status quo while allowing those emplo yers who wish to, to remit PAYE on a payday basis, could avoid some of the negative impacts associated with option 3. For a discussion of threshold levels and number of employers affected see the section on thresholds in A-5 on page 40. 4. PAYE – encouraging the take-up of digital services and targeting support Government has identified a major role for digital technology in making tax simpler. The development and delivery of high quality digital services which are user friendly and intuitive will play a key role in encouraging the uptake of digital services and in the realisation of the associated benefits. Consultation A significant number of those who responded to consultation suggested that to encourage digital uptake Inland Revenue should make payroll software freely available. Others suggested that some form of subsidy should be provided to offset the cost of switching or updating software and still others commented favourably on the existing payroll subsidy with some suggesting that the value should be increased. Inland Revenue provided tools In a world of rapidly changing technology the option of Inland Revenue developing its own basic payroll software and making it freely available has been discounted. Even basic payro ll software is complex and does much more than calculate tax and related obligat ions. To become a provider of payroll software would be a distraction from Inland Revenue’s core focus on tax and social policy. In addition employers who begin by using a basic package often subsequently seek additional services; these employers would be better served by starting with an upgradable product or service. Instead Inland Revenue will update and modernise the tax and social policy focused calculators on its website and will modernise the electronic services that allow for the filing of PAYE informat ion through its website. These changes do not require legislative change and are not further analysed below. 37 Appendix A Subsidy The option of offering a subsidy or tax credit to encourage small employers to adopt payroll software has been discounted. As noted earlier the possibility of requiring all employers to adopt payroll software has also been discounted. In a market where a significant number of free trials are already available a subsidy may reduce the incentives on software providers to use price or free offerings as a way of stimulating demand. Payroll subsidy A ‘payroll subsidy’ has existed since 2006. The subsidy pays $2 per employee for each pay- run for a maximum of 5 employees. The payroll subsidy was introduced to encourage small businesses to outsource their PAYE compliance obligations to approved third parties (listed payroll intermediaries). The subsidy is only available to employers who use listed payroll intermediaries. The payroll subsidy has the objectives of making tax compliance easier for small business to give them more time to run their business and to improve the overall operation of the PAYE system. To reduce administrative costs the subsidy is paid to the payroll intermediary rather than to the employer. There are currently 20 listed payroll intermediaries some of whom make free payroll services available to small employers and not for profit organisations. While not primarily designed to encourage an employer to adopt digital services the subsidy has the effect of increasing electronic filing because although employers using payroll intermediaries may be below the electronic filing thresho ld payroll intermediaries are required to file PAYE information electronically. Almost 90% of the approximately 23,200 employers who currently use the payroll subsidy are under the existing electronic filing threshold of $100,000 of PAYE and emplo yers superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The case for the payroll subsidy is strongest for small employers who bear higher PAYE compliance costs per employee and where there is less likely to be a division of duties or any specialist knowledge of payroll. In 2009 the payroll subsidy threshold was however lifted from $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. The threshold for eligibility for the payroll subsidy was lifted because it was linked to the threshold for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and related deductions and this threshold was lifted to reduce cash flow pressure on business in the context of the global financial crisis. At the $500,000 a year threshold almost 98% of employers are eligible for the payroll subsidy. Given its objectives the threshold for the payroll subsidy is currently too high and is unfair to the taxpayers who fund it. Payroll is about much more than meeting tax compliance obligations and the market for payroll products and services has many available offerings at a variety of price points. In this context there is concern that the subsidy may be offsetting core costs of doing business and that it might distort emplo yers’ decisio ns about whether to use a listed payroll intermediary or purchase payro ll software products or services. Officials have considered the following options • Options 1: retain the status quo and make no change to eligibility for the payroll subsidy. • Option 2: reduce the threshold for eligibility to the payroll subsidy. • Option 3: repeal the payroll subsidy. 38 Appendix A Officials’ analysis of the options is set out on the next page. For a discussion of possible thresholds see section A-5 (page 40). 39 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax and income related social policy system Basis for improved social and other government services Fiscal impact 1. Status quo – no change to payroll subsidy The subsidy was originally designed to help small businesses , which incurs higher PAYE compliance costs per employee than large business. The current threshold makes almost 98% of employers eligible so does not target assistance to small business Considered in the context of incentivising electronic filing the payroll subsidy is not equitable because it only subsidises one form of electronic filing – use of a listed payroll intermediary. At the current threshold the subsidy is available to offset compliance costs for the majority of employers. To the extent that it is easier for Inland Revenue to deal with listed payroll intermediaries (professional managers of payroll) than it would be to deal with the employers individually the current threshold reduces Inland Revenue’s administration costs. The subsidy only supports one type of payroll product or services and could therefore lead to tax driven choices between payroll products and services. The payroll subsidy indirectly incentivises business to file digitally and using a payroll intermediary means no option of a later due date. Digital pay period filing provides the best basis for improved administration of PAYE and social policy because it provides information in the nearest to real-time. 2. Reduced threshold for eligibility to payroll subsidy Significantly better than the status quo A reduced threshold would reinstate the original intent and target assistance to small employers who bear relatively higher costs. This change would also reinstate a measure of fairness for the taxpayers who are providing the subsidy. No better than the status quo While a lower threshold would exclude larger employers they could reasonably be expected to have staff that have knowledge of payroll. To the extent that those excluded from the subsidy have payroll knowledge Inland Revenue’s administrative costs are unlikely to be affected. Better than the status quo While it would apply to fewer employers than under the status quo the subsidy still only supports one type of payroll product or service and could therefore lead to tax driven choices between payroll products and services. No better than the status quo Employers above the proposed thresholds who would lose the subsidy would not have the option of returning to paper filing so there should not be material impact on the date of filing. Positive Reduced threshold reduces expenditure estimated at between $3.1m and $6.3m over four years from 2016/17, depending on the threshold. 3. Repeal payroll subsidy Better than the status quo The payroll subsidy is currently available to a very wide range of employers which is unfair to taxpayers who fund it. The subsidy only benefits employers who choose to outsource their payroll obligations to a listed payroll intermediary. Worse than the status quo The repeal of the subsidy could increase compliance costs for employers on whose behalf it is currently paid. If small employers lacking knowledge begin to manage their own payroll administration costs may increase. Significantly better than the status quo The tax system will no longer incentivise one type of payroll service over another. Worse than the status quo. In the absence of the subsidy some current users of listed payroll intermediaries may cease to use them. This may reduce the amount of PAYE information received on, or the day after payday. Positive Reduction in expenditure of $8.1 million over 4 years from 2106/17. 40 Appendix A Recommendations While the option of repealing the payroll subsidy would remove a potentially distortionary intervention from the payroll market officials recommend option 2 – reduce the threshold for the payroll subsidy. This recommendation reinstates the original policy intent to target assistance to small business (employers) and reduces the likelihood that the subsidy could distort decisions between using listed payroll intermediary or purchasing payroll software or a payroll service. 5. PAYE Thresholds Because of the absences of economies of scale PAYE obligations impose higher costs on small emplo yers. Thresholds are a mechanism through which obligations can be differentiated to mitigate the higher relative compliance costs and to target support. However thresholds are not costless. In the case of PAYE thresholds will generally result in higher administration costs 28 and may limit, or at least slow down, the services that could otherwise be delivered to individual employees. Thresholds have been considered for the following PAYE obligations. Where relevant the existing threshold is noted on the right. Obligation Existing threshold • file PAYE information electronically Employers with $100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT or more and payroll intermediaries. • file PAYE information on payday Payday filing would be a new obligation. • remit PAYE and related deductions on pay day Emplo yers that withho ld less than $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT 29 currently submit informat ion and remit PAYE on the 20 th of the following month. Emplo yers that withhold $500,000pa or more of PAYE and ESCT 30 submit information by the 5 th of the following month and remit PAYE twice monthly on the 20 th and the 5 th of the following month. • eligibility for the payroll subsidy Emplo yers that withhold less than $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT are eligible for the payroll subsidy. Prior to 2009 a single threshold ($100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT) existed for the following obligations and entitlements: 28 Than would exist if the obligation fell on all employers. 29 And payroll intermediaries. 30 And payroll intermediaries. 41 Appendix A • electronic filing of PAYE information; • the due date for PAYE information; • the obligation to remit PAYE and related deductions twice monthly; • those below the threshold were entitled to the payroll subsidy A return to a single threshold for PAYE obligations would reduce complexity for employers and simplify administration. In addit io n many of the recommended obligations are interconnected and a consistent approach would maximise the available compliance cost and administrative benefits. For example if information reporting and payment of PAYE and related deductions both occurred on payday and were derived from the same data, without the need for it to be aggregated over a month, or split between twice monthly payments, the task of reconciliation should be simplified and the current commo n problem of a mismatch between the PAYE payment and the PAYE information should reduce. Consultation Feedback was sought on the proposal that the existing electronic filing threshold should be reduced to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. Feedback from the online consultation was generally opposed to a reduction in the threshold while written submissions expressed mixed views. Options A number of options have been considered. An option that was discounted was basing the threshold on staff numbers. Although this might appear easier for employers to understand it would be hard to operationalise. Many businesses employ part-time or casual staff and, if an employee number threshold was based on numbers at a point in time, it could add complexity as obligations would come and go as employee numbers fluctuated around the threshold. If instead the obligation was based on average numbers of emplo yees over a year, or on full time equivalents, it would be no easier for an employer with variable staffing to estimate than a threshold based on dollar value of PAYE and ESCT. Inland Revenue currently notifies emplo yers when they have crossed the existing threshold. All of the options, other than the status quo, provide that the threshold could in future be reduced by Order-in-Council fo llo wing consultation wit h affected parties. This would allow the threshold to be changed to reflect changed business practice, for example further increases in the use of digital channels. The threshold could also be reviewed if changes elsewhere in the public service increased the benefits that would derive from receiving pay period information digitally on payday. Officials have considered the following options. Option 1 – the status quo which has no threshold for payday filing but provides: • A threshold of $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT for electronic filing • A threshold of $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT for provision of PAYE information by the 5 th of the following month, all other employers have until the 20 th of the following month. • A threshold of $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and related deductions, other employers have until the 20 th of the following month. • Employers with less than $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT are eligible for the payroll subsidy. 42 Appendix A These thresholds are established in legislation and can only be changed by amending legislation. Option 2 – a threshold of $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to determine: • The obligation to file PAYE information electronically • The obligation to file PAYE information on payday • The obligation to remit PAYE and related deductions on payday • Eligibility for the payroll subsidy The level of the thresholds to be subject to future change by Order-in-Council following consultation with affected parties. Option 3 – a threshold of $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to determine: • The obligation to file PAYE information electronically • The obligation to file PAYE information on payday • The obligation to remit PAYE and related deductions on payday • Eligibility for the payroll subsidy The level of the thresholds to be subject to future change by Order-in-Council following consultation with affected parties. Option 4 – status quo for remittance and a lowered threshold for electronic filing with all employers having to submit PAYE information on payday and: • A threshold of $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and related deductions, other employers have until the 20 th of the following month • A threshold of $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to determine the obligation to file PAYE informat ion electronically • The $50,000 a year threshold will also set a later due date for PAYE information on payday, which allows time after payday for a return to be posted by below the threshold not using payroll software The level of the thresholds to be subject to future change by Order-in-Council following consultation with affected parties. Options compared The graphs on the next page present the $50,000pa and $100,000pa of ESCT and PAYE thresholds visually showing how the dollar based thresholds map to employer size. The emplo yer size categorisation has been used by Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 31 and is defined as follows: micro (1-5 employees); small (6-19); small-medium (20-49); medium (50 -99) and large (100+). The graphs are based on the maximum employee numbers included in 2015 employer monthly schedules. Wage increases would be expected to increase the numbers over each threshold by the proposed effective date of 2019. 31 The Small Business Sector Report 2014, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. 43 Appendix A Number of employers caught by a $100,000 per year of PAYE and ESCT threshold Number of employers caught by a $50,000 per year of PAYE and ESCT threshold The numbers of employers and in some cases employees, affected by each option is presented in the following table.

Status Quo: $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT for twice monthly remittance, employers below the threshold entitled to payroll subsidy. $100,000pa for electronic filing; No obligation for payday filing of information. Option 2. PAYE threshold at $100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT for: • Payday filing of information • Payday remittance • Electronic filing • Those below eligible for payroll subsidy. Option 3. PAYE threshold at $50,000pa of PAYE and ESCT. • Payday filing of information • Payday remittance • Electronic filing • Those below eligible for payroll subsidy. Option 4. Status quo $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT for twice monthly remittance All employers provide PAYE information on payday $50,000pa of PAYE and ESCT for electronic filing. No payroll subsidy. Provision of PAYE information 5,400 employers provide PAYE information by 5 th of following month. 188,800 employers have until the 20 th of following month. 25,000 employers (12.9%) would be required to provide PAYE info on payday by the threshold; plus 46,200 below the threshold who use payroll software = 71,200 employers (36.6%) employing 86% of employees. 44,800 employers (23.1%) would be required by the threshold to provide PAYE on payday, plus 36,400 below the threshold using payroll software = 81,200 employers employing almost 90% of employees. 194,200 employers (100%) would be required to file PAYE information on payday, representing 100% of employees. Remittance of PAYE 5,400 employers required to remit twice monthly. 25,000 employers required to remit on payday. 44,800 employers required to remit on payday. 5,400 employers required to remit twice monthly. Electronic filing of PAYE information 25,000 employers required to file electronically (a total of 130,000 currently file electronically many of them below the threshold). 25,000 employers required to file electronically. 44,800 required to file electronically. All but approximately 6,000 already file electronically. 44,800 required to file electronically, this would require 6,000 mor e employers to adopt electronic filing. Eligibility for payroll subsidy 188,800 employers eligible for payroll subsidy. 169,200 employers eligible for the payroll subsidy. 2,400 employers currently receiving the subsidy would lose 149,400 employers eligible for payroll subsidy. 4,900 employers receiving the subsidy would lose it. No employers eligible for payroll subsidy. 23,200 employers lose entitlement to the subsidy. 45 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of the tax and income- related social policy system Basis for improved social and other government services Fiscal 1. Status quo Only the largest employers are required to remit PAYE more often than monthly and all but the largest are eligible for the payroll subsidy. All employers provide PAYE information in the following month. Multiple thresholds can impose higher compliance costs as obligations change progressively. Multiple thresholds impose higher administrative costs than a single threshold would. The need for legislative amendment to change the threshold reduces the flexibility of the tax and social policy system. Delayed provision of PAYE information does not provide a basis for improved social and other services. 2. One PAYE threshold $100,000pa of PAYE and ESCT Better than the status quo This option supports payday filing and remittance which should reduce costs for those using software. The threshold exempts the majority of micro and small employers from payday filing and remittance requirements but allows them the choice of whether to use the new systems. Significantly better than the status quo All but 2.7% of employers over this threshold are already using payroll software and should experience a decrease in overall compliance costs compared with the status quo. Administration costs should reduce. Significantly better than the status quo Threshold would see pay period information reported on payday for majority of employees. Order-in-Council to change the threshold allows for more flexibility. Better than the status quo PAYE information received on payday is the best basis for improved services. This option is better than the status quo and although it does not require as many employers to file PAYE information on payday as options 3 or 4 does it would result in payday filing for 87% of employees. Greater targeting of the payroll subsidy would save $3.1 million over four years from 2016/17. 46 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of the tax and income- related social policy system Basis for improved social and other government services Fiscal 3. One PAYE threshold $50,000pa of PAYE and ESCT No better than the status quo This threshold would require 44% of small employers (5 -19 staff) to remit PAYE on payday. This requirement may impact negatively on fairness Better than the status quo While significant compliance cost savings should be available to the employers from using payroll software the one off costs and cash flow impacts may adversely impact on small employers. Inland Revenue should benefit from administrative savings. Significantly better than the status quo As above Significantly better than the status quo This option would require PAYE information on payday from employers employing almost 90% of employees. Greater targeting of the payroll subsidy saves $6.3 million over 4 years. 4. $500,000pa of PAYE and ESCT for frequency of remittance $50,000pa of PAYE and ESCT threshold for electronic filing, all employers required to file PAYE information on payday. Payroll subsidy repealed. No better than the status quo. Does not require payday remittance. The lower threshold for electronic filing would impact on approximately 6,000 employers; many others below this threshold are already filing electronically. The requirement for payday submission of information may negatively impact on fairness for small employers using manual systems Better than the status quo Compliance costs savings should be available to all employers who can access digital services. While this potential exists there will be costs to upgrade and some employers will continue to use manual systems and will incur increased compliance costs as a result. Administrative costs should reduce compared to the status quo but they may be higher than under option 2 because of the receipt of more paper schedules. Significantly better than the status quo As above Significantly better than the status quo This option would require PAYE information to be submitted on payday for 100% of staff. Saving of $8.1 million over four years from 2016/17. 47 Appendix A Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – The PAYE threshold is set at $100,000 and applies to: • The obligation to file PAYE information electronically • The obligation to file PAYE information on payday • The obligation to remit PAYE and related deductions on payday; and • Eligibility for the payroll subsidy The level of the threshold to be subject to future change by Order-in-Council following consultation with affected parties. This recommendation balances the Government’s interest in earlier PAYE information against small employers’ concerns about cash flow and one-off compliance costs. Other options balance these objectives differently. Option four does not change the status quo on remittance which recognises the concern expressed by employers on this matter, but places greater emphasis on earlier receipt of PAYE information by requiring payday submission of PAYE informat ion by all emplo yers. 6. GST –Introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns GST registered persons and businesses are required to file GST returns based on their self- assessment with Inland Revenue. The filing frequency is according to the taxable period, which can be one, two or six months depending on the amount of taxable supplies made in any 12-mo nth period or in some cases on the period elected. 32 At present GST returns can be filed electronically and on paper. There is no electronic filing threshold for the filing of GST returns. Nevertheless electronic filing uptake for GST returns has been increasing steadily over the last years and is expected to continue to increase. 65% of all GST returns were filed electronically in 2015, with the highest uptake of 82% for large businesses (annual turnover above $24,000,000). Digital technology plays a major role in making tax simpler. Effective, timely and accurate GST administration can best be achieved through electronic transfer of information. Electronic filing is faster, cheaper in terms of compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue and less prone to errors, in particular if filed directly from business software. As part of Business Transformation the tax system will be transitioned from the current system to the new START platform in different stages. GST is the first tax type to be moved to START in 32 Under the new GST rules for non-resident suppliers of remote services, suppliers of these services that are subject to GST will have quarterly taxable periods from 1 April 2017. 48 Appendix A stage 1 (expected transition date for GST into the new START system is in the first half of 2017). It is expected that electronic services offerings under START will change and improve. This will likely influence uptake for electronic GST return filing in the near future. For example, feedback on a pilot Inland Revenue undertook trialling the filing of GST returns directly from customers’ accounting software indicates that this new service is meeting taxpayers’ needs. Officials consider it appropriate to monitor uptake of electronic filing for GST returns under the services in START and develop a threshold meaningful for GST return filing under the new platform. In developing the below options officials have therefore discounted the setting of an electronic filing threshold at this stage. Options Officials have considered the following options: • Option 1: Retain the status quo. • Option 2: Introduce a framework that allows for an electronic filing threshold to be set for the filing of GST returns by Order in Council. A limited exemption is available for taxpayers for which electronic filing would cause undue compliance costs. • Option 3: Introduce a non-electronic filing penalty of $250 as part of the framework under option 2. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 49 Appendix A Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Fiscal 1. Status quo with no threshold above which taxpayers are required to file GST returns electronically. All GST registered persons and businesses can choose whether to file GST returns electronically or on paper. Compliance and administrative costs depend on the level of uptake of voluntary electronic GST return filing within the new START system. 2. Introduce a framework that allows for an electronic filing threshold to be set for the filing of GST returns by order-in- council. No better than status quo. Fairness and equity will be considered when the level of the threshold is set. Significantly better than the status quo. Compliance and administrative costs are lower than under the status quo. Better than the status quo. Electronic GST returns are processed faster. No impact. 3. Introduce a non- electronic filing penalty of $250 as part of the framework under option 2. Better than the status quo The level of penalty is consistent with existing thresholds for larger businesses such as the late filing penalty for GST returns and the existing minimum non- electronic filing penalty in relat ion to PAYE. Significantly better than the status quo. Encourages taxpayers to file electronically when required and recovers the additional costs of administering paper returns. Better than the status quo. Encourages taxpayers to file electronically when required which enables faster processing of GST returns. No impact at this stage – may have impact when a threshold is set and implemented in the future. 50 Appendix A Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 and 3 – introduce a framework that allows for an electronic filing threshold to be set for the filing of GST returns in the future and for a non-electronic filing penalty set at $250 as part of this framework. This option acknowledges the benefits that can be realised through electronic filing and the relatively high uptake of electronic filing for GST returns under current Inland Revenue services. It provides a mechanism however that allows for the introduction of a threshold by Order-in-Council should uptake of electronic services need to be further encouraged. 51 Appendix B APPENDIX B - GETTING IT RIGHT FROM THE START 1. Provision of date of birth information and contact details from all new employees Status quo and problem definition All new employees complete an IR330 declaration with their name, IRD number, tax code and declaration of eligibility to work in New Zealand. All new employees who are KiwiSaver members or eligible for KiwiSaver enrolment must also complete a KS2 which similarly requires details of name and IRD number and in addition, their KiwiSaver status and contact details (physical address, phone number(s) and email). Many of these employees will already have provided so me o f this informat ion to their employer as part of the employee induction process. Employers complain that PAYE compliance involves too many pieces of paper and large employers report that they can spend considerable time assisting employees when Inland Revenue has been unable to confirm an individual’s identity. Inland Revenue lacks current contact details for a significant number of individual tax payers and receives PAYE deductions for thousands of individuals where there is an incorrect IRD number. Despite attempts to resolve these situations if the individual does not respond to a request made via their employer, to contact IRD, the confusion can persist. Sorting out instances where identity has been confused imposes considerable compliance costs on employers and on Inland Revenue. If in future, as was suggested in Making Tax Simpler a Government green paper on tax administration, all individuals have to interact at some level with Inland Revenue the importance of certainty about identity will increase. One option to improve the operation of the tax and social policy system is to require that when individuals start new employment date of birth information is provided to Inland Revenue and that contact details are provided for all employees 33 . Date of birth information would help Inland Revenue confirm identity where an error had been made with the IRD number, where names were the same or where a different form of a name was being used. Updated contact details would assist Inland Revenue to stay in touch with individual customers. Many employers already collect date of birth information for their own purposes. It is for example required if an employer is to auto enrol a young employee in KiwiSaver and is also required if the employer intends to cease making employer contributions to KiwiSaver when the employee turns 65. Date of birth information can be a sensitive topic; it is however widely used in health care, by utility companies and financial institutions to help verify 33 At present contact details are provided by those who are KiwiSaver members or are eligible for KiwiSaver membership. This is the overwhelming majority of employees. 52 Appendix B identity. Although provision of date of birth information via the employer was not universally supported in consultation it received majority support. There was also considerable support for enabling employers to provide details of new and departing emplo yees from their payroll systems. An option which was discounted because of the compliance costs involved was requiring employers to verify date of birth and contact details for example by sighting a drivers licence or passport (for date of birth) and utility bills (for address). Another option that has been discounted is relying on the individuals to contact Inland Revenue directly with date of birth informat ion. Where Inland Revenue detects a mismatch between an employee name and IRD number the individual is requested, via the employer, to contact Inland Revenue but often this does not happen. The options that have been considered to modernise the PAYE system include allowing employers to provide contact details and date of birth information to Inland Revenue which they have collected for their own purposes and not requiring that tax specific information such as an IRD number, tax code, KiwiSaver status and declaration of entitlement to work in NZ is provided on a particular form. It is however intended that the employer must be able to demonstrate that the information was sourced from the employee. It is intended that for those who prefer to use paper, Inland Revenue forms will still exist, if possible combining the IR33 (tax code declaration form) and KS2 (KiwiSaver deduction form). Officials’ analysis of the following options is set out below: Option 1 • Status quo – employers not required to collect/provide date of birth information for new employees nor are they required to provide contact details for all new employees. Option 2 • In addition to existing information employers required to collect/provide date of birth information and contact details to Inland Revenue for all new employees. • Employers are able to pass on contact detail and date of birth information which they collect for their own purposes but must be able to demonstrate that they have collected their emplo yee’s IRD number, tax code and declaration of entitlement to work in New Zealand from the employee. Neither option has fiscal implications. 53 Appendix B Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of the tax and income- related social policy system Basis for improved social and other government policy 1. Retain the status quo: No date of birth information, contact details only from those in or eligible for KiwiSaver and no ability for emplo yer to pass on information already gathered from an emplo yee. Employers are required to act as the middleman between Inland Revenue and an employee when identity cannot be confirmed and this imposes considerable compliance costs. The current rules require employers to collect multiple forms from new employers for IRD and in some cases emplo yers have to transcribe them and pass the information on to Inland Revenue. Incorrect IRD numbers and out of date contact details impose considerable administrative costs. The quality of contact and identity information currently held in the tax system for emplo yees is not sufficient to support modernisat ion. To the extent that identity or contact information is incorrect Inland Revenue and other agencies will be unable to contact taxpayers to offer improved services. 2. Require date of birth and contact detail information for all new employees and enable employers to pass on informat ion already gathered. Better than the status quo Better than the status quo Option 2 requires the employer to source and/or pass on additional information however for emplo yers using payroll software the compliance costs should be outweighed by being able to send the information already gathered for their own purposes from the payroll system and/or from reduced rework. Administrative costs will be reduced by better identity and contact information. Significantly better than the status quo Obtaining date of birth information for new employees and contact details for all new emplo yees will contribute to the sustainability of the tax system. Significantly better than the status quo. Delivery of improved services is dependent on sound identity and contact information for individual taxpayers and this option should deliver improvements. 54 Appendix B Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – that date of birth information and contact information is provided for all new employees, with employers having the ability to pass on to Inland Revenue information they have already collected for their own purposes. Option 2 best supports improved delivery of social policy and is consistent with modern approaches to identity verification. With the recommended simplification of forms the proposals should not impose significant additional compliance costs even on employers using paper based systems. Employers using payroll software should experience a reduction in compliance costs. 55 Appendix C APPENDIX C - Making the PAYE rules work better 1. Tax treatment of holiday pay Status quo and problem definition The tax treatment of holiday pay differs depending on whether it is paid as a lump sum (in which case it is treated as an extra pay), or whether it is included in an employee’s regular pay or paid in substitution for an employee’s ordinary salary or wages when annual paid holidays are taken (in which case it is treated as salary or wages). When holiday pay is paid in advance as a lump sum (for example, where an employee takes four weeks’ annual leave and receives a lump sum payment of holiday pay covering the four weeks in advance), it is currently taxed as an extra pay. This tends to result in PAYE being over-withheld, as it tends to essentially over-tax the leave payment by using the employee’s marginal rate, and under-tax the payments made in each of the subsequent periods that have only part of the earnings. Anecdotally, it is common for employees in some industries to work longer hours in the lead up to Christmas, which can exacerbate the over-withholding caused by using the extra pay formula. This, combined with receiving no income during the following weeks when the holiday is taken, may make things difficult for the employee financially. While employees are able to obtain a refund for any over-withheld tax following the end of the tax year, the fact that it can adversely affect employees’ adequacy of income around the period the holiday is taken gives rise to fairness concerns. Options We have considered the following options: • Option 1: Retain the status quo. • Option 2: Require employers to deduct PAYE from holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. • Option 3: Retain the ability for employers to tax holiday pay paid in advance as an extra pay, but allow employers the option of deducting PAYE as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. Under options 2 and 3, similar treatment would also be extended to salary or wages paid in advance. 34 This would ensure consistent tax treatment for conceptually analogous situations. Our analysis of the options is set out on the next page. 34 Under current law, salary or wages paid in advance are an extra pay under the PAYE rules. 56 Appendix C Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Fiscal 1. Retain the status quo Extra pay tax treatment tends to result in PAYE being over-withheld when holiday pay is paid in advance, which can adversely affect employees’ adequacy of income around the period the holiday is taken, giving rise to fairness concerns. The existing law should ensure that employees in similar situations receive consistent treatment, but this is undermined by the reportedly common practice of employers applying an alternative tax treatment. Treating holiday pay paid in advance as an extra pay is simpler for employers doing their payroll manually, thus minimising their compliance costs. It is reportedly common practice to apply the alternative approach of deducting PAYE as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates for end of (calendar) year holiday pay paid as a lump sum. This indicates a lack of buy-in to the appropriateness of extra pay tax treatment, which suggests that the status quo is not sustainable. No impact 2. Require employers to deduct PAYE from holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates Significantly better than the status quo This option would give rise to greater withholding accuracy than extra pay tax treatment, with the same amount of PAYE being withheld as if the employee had received their leave payment and their normal salary or wages payment in their normal pay cycle. Worse than the status quo More complicated for employers to apply than treating the payment as an extra pay, due to the need, when future payments are made in the pay periods to which the leave relates, to calculate PAYE based on all earnings for the pay period less PAYE already collected for the pay period. This will occur for pay periods that are not taken entirely on leave, but partially taken on leave and partially worked in. In our view, this makes the alternative method too complex to be suitable for employers who do their payroll manually to be required to use. No better than the status quo Due to the high compliance costs this option would impose on employers who do their payroll manually, non-compliance from these employers would likely be a significant issue. This would undermine the integrity of the tax system and would not be sustainable. No impact 3. Retain the ability for employers to tax holiday pay paid in advance as an extra pay, but allow employers the option of deducting PAYE as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates Better than the status quo This option would give rise to greater withholding accuracy than extra pay tax treatment for employees of employers who chose to use the new method, with the same amount of PAYE being withheld as if the employee had received their leave payment and their normal salary or wages payment in their normal pay cycle. However, optionality would mean there would be inequities between employees in similar situations as a consequence of their employers using different methods. Worse than the status quo Employers still have the option to use the simpler extra pay tax method. However, optionality could introduce additional complexity and confusion for employers. Better than the status quo This option would be sustainable as it would not force the use of the new (more complicated) method on employers who consider that the compliance costs are too high, while allowing those employers who are already using the alternative method (or who wish to do so) because they consider that extra pay tax treatment is unfair on their employees to lawfully do so. No impact 57 Appendix C Consultation Feedback from payroll software providers on the tax treatment of holiday pay in the Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST consultation was that extra pay tax treatment in the case of holiday pay paid in advance (for example, where an employee takes four weeks’ annual leave and receives a lump sum payment of holiday pay covering the four weeks in advance) results in over-withholding. Their argument is that this tax treatment essentially over-taxes the leave payment by using the employee’s marginal rate, and under- taxes the payments made in each of the subsequent periods that have only part of the earnings. They argue that more accurate withholding outcomes are achieved if PAYE is deducted as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. A few other submitters suggested it was common practice to apply this alternative approach for end of (calendar) year holiday pay paid as a lump sum. According to one submission, it is common for employees in some industries to work longer hours in the lead up to Christmas, which can exacerbate the over-withholding if the extra pay formula is used. The majorit y o f submitters commenting on the PAYE rules, more generally, were of the view that if, in a post-Business Transformation world, everyone will be required to under-take an annual income tax square-up, withholding accuracy should become less important and simplicity of the PAYE rules more important. 35 Recommendation We recommend retaining the ability for employers to tax holiday pay paid in advance as an extra pay, but allowing employers the option of deducting PAYE as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates (option 3). While the status quo minimises employers’ compliance costs, it is unfair due to the tendency of extra pay tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance to result in over-withholding. It could be argued that, if any over-withholding is to be squared-up at the end of the tax year, simplicity for employers should trump withholding accuracy. However, we consider that over-withholding on holiday pay paid in advance is something that nevertheless warrants addressing, given that there are particular concerns about employees being financially disadvantaged over the Christmas holiday period. The alternative method (option 2) has policy merit in that it does produce more accurate withho lding outcomes, so would improve fairness. However, in our view, the addit ional compliance costs it would impose on employers who do their payroll manually make the alternative method unsuitable for them. While there may be concerns that the optionality afforded by option 3 could introduce additional complexity and confusion, as well as equity concerns around some employees being disadvantaged relative to other employees as a consequence of their employers using different methods, we do not consider that these concerns are large enough for us to support the retention of the status quo. We consider that the status quo is not sustainable going 35 Making Tax Simpler – a Government green paper on tax administration set out the Government’s idea of potentially requiring all individuals to undertake an annual square-up of income tax. 58 Appendix C forward due to a lack of buy-in to the appropriateness of extra pay tax treatment for holiday pay paid in advance. 2. Application of legislated rate changes Status quo and problem definition Different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products 36 have different rules on what is to be done when there is a legislated rate (or threshold) change during a pay period or if there is rate (or threshold) change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. The rates (or thresholds) that apply are sometimes based on the pay date, sometimes pay period end-date or pay period start-date, while sometimes apportionment applies. This creates complexity and confusion for employers when there is a rate (or threshold) change, which adds to compliance costs. Options We have considered the following options: • Option 1: Retain the status quo. • Option 2: Align the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made. • Option 3: Align the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social po licy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the pay period end-date (for those payments that relate to a specific pay period). • Option 4: Align the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the pay period start-date (for those payments that relate to a specific pay period). • Option 5: Align the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are based on apportioning the payment between the old and new rates and thresholds. This would only apply to those payments that relate to a specific pay period and are made during the pay period. Payments not related to a specific pay period would have the rates and thresholds that are in force on the date the payment is made applied. Payments made 36 PAYE-related social policy products include the ACC earners’ levy, student loan deductions, the minimum employee KiwiSaver contribution and the compulsory employer KiwiSaver contribution. 59 Appendix C after a date on which a rate or threshold change comes into force that relate to a pay period that ended before the change would have the previous rate or threshold applied. Our analysis of the options is set out on the next page. 60 Appendix C Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Fiscal 1. Retain the status quo The accuracy of PAYE withholding depends on the circumstances. Having different rules for different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products creates complexity and confusion for employers when a legislated rate or threshold change is made. Having different rules for different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products means there is a lack of coherence and makes it likely that employers will get things wrong, which is not conducive to sustainability. No impact 2. Alignment based on pay date Better than the status quo PAYE withholding accuracy would be increased in most circumstances but reduced in some circumstances due to the removal of apportionment. Significantly better than the status quo This option would simplify the transitional process the most for employers when a legislated rate or threshold change occurs, thus it would result in the largest reduction in compliance costs. Significantly better than the status quo This option would improve coherence and make it more likely that employers will get things right, both of which are conducive to sustainability. No impact 3. Alignment based on pay period end- date Worse than the status quo PAYE withholding accuracy would be reduced in some circumstances due to the removal of apportionment. Better than the status quo This option would simplify the transitional process for employers relative to the status quo, but the different rules for payments that do not relate to a specific pay period would likely mean some confusion would remain amongst employers. Better than the status quo This option would bring about some improvement in coherence but the continued misalignment with employer reporting of income and the tax year in which it is assessable in for the employee, both of which are based on pay date, would not be conducive to sustainability. No impact 4. Alignment based on pay period start- date Worse than the status quo PAYE withholding accuracy would be reduced in most circumstances. Better than the status quo This option would simplify the transitional process for employers relative to the status quo, but the different rules for payments that do not relate to a specific pay period would likely mean some confusion would remain amongst employers. Better than the status quo This option would bring about some improvement in coherence but the continued misalignment with employer reporting of income and the tax year in which it is assessable in for the employee, both of which are based on pay date, would not be conducive to sustainability. No impact 5. Alignment based on apportionment Better than the status quo Apportionment would produce the most accurate PAYE withholding outcomes in some circumstances but it would produce less accurate withholding outcomes than a pay date-based approach in others. Worse than the status quo Apportionment is the most complicated option and would increase compliance costs for employers doing their payroll manually. Better than the status quo This option would improve coherence but its relative complexity would likely mean that employers will get things wrong. No impact 61 Appendix C Consultation Responses to the Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST consultation strongly supported alignment. The majority of submitters favoured a pay date-based approach. Recommendation We recommend that the rules in the Inland Revenue Acts about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE- related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made (option 2). Aligning the rules would simplify the transitional process for employers when a legislated rate (or threshold) change occurs, thus reducing compliance costs. We consider that an approach based on pay date is the preferable option for alignment, for the following reasons: • not all payments relate to a specific pay period; • the pay date determines in which reporting period PAYE-related information is submitted to Inland Revenue; and • it will improve PAYE withholding accuracy for pay periods spanning two tax years, and pay periods ending in one tax year for which payment is not received until the next tax year, when there is a change in tax rates or thresholds, because employment income is treated as derived by an employee when it is received. While there is a trade-off in that option 2 will reduce PAYE withholding accuracy in some circumstances (for example, when there is a legislated tax rate change mid-tax year part way through a pay period longer than a month), it will improve it in other more common circumstances. 62 Regulatory Impact Statement Requiring non-resident IRD number applicants to have a New Zealand bank account Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options on whether to continue with the requirement for offshore persons to open a New Zealand bank account before they are issued with an IRD number. Officials have been provided evidence from a range of stakeholders that the bank account requirement is making it difficult in a number of cases for people to comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. We have anecdotal evidence of the impact of this restriction but are unable to determine the full extent of its impact on the New Zealand tax system and wider economy. Targeted consultation was undertaken with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association and the New Zealand Law Society, who represent the majority of those affected by the requirement. All respondents have welcomed the review. There was no support for the status quo and all submitters supported reform. Evidence of further examples where the bank account requirement is causing difficulties has been provided. Peter Frawley Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 30 November 2016 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Introduction of the bank account requirement 1. A law change effective from 1 October 2015 requires all offshore persons to provide evidence of a current New Zealand bank account before an IRD number can be issued to them. This requirement was brought in as part of a suite of initiatives announced in Budget 2015 related to property transactions and to assist Inland Revenue in enforcing compliance with these rules. 2. The Budget 2015 property changes included: • Requiring all parties to a property transaction to provide an IRD number to Land Information New Zealand as part of the transaction process (unless subject to an exemption) • Requiring all offshore persons to provide evidence of a functioning New Zealand bank account before obtaining an IRD number • The two year bright-line test for sales of residential property • Residential land withholding tax 3. The bank account requirement has proved to be difficult to comply with for a number of offshore persons. As these offshore persons find it difficult or impossible to comply with the requirement, they are unable to get an IRD number, and in many cases to account for their New Zealand tax liability. 4. The bank account requirement can also affect sales of New Zealand property owned by offshore persons. Land Information New Zealand requires an IRD number to be provided for all property transfers, unless the transfer is subject to an exemption. This is one of the Budget 2015 property changes noted above. 5. A number of offshore persons may require an IRD number to be processed urgently or without delays, in order to meet their New Zealand tax obligations on time. An “offshore person” 6. For the purposes of the bank account requirement an “offshore person” includes both individuals and non-individuals. 7. An individual is an offshore person if they are: • not a New Zealand citizen and do not hold a residence class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009; or • a New Zealand citizen who is outside New Zealand and has not been in New Zealand within the last 3 years; or • a holder of a residence class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009, who is outside New Zealand and has not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months. 8. A non-individual, such as a company or a trust, is an offshore person if they are 25% or more controlled or owned by an offshore person. 2 Identity verification 9. At the time the bank account requirement was introduced, the Government considered that requiring offshore persons to have a New Zealand bank account would provide Inland Revenue with confidence that it knew who it was dealing wit h by requiring the identit y verification rules in the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (“AML Act”) to apply to all offshore persons applying for an IRD number, whether for the reason of transactions involving New Zealand property or any other reason. 10. Currently when a non-resident or offshore individual (form IR742) or non-individual (form IR744) applies for an IRD number, they must provide the Co mmissio ner with the following information: • Their names • Date of birth for individuals • Type of organisation for non-individuals • Photographic identification for individuals • Proof of their current address, or the most recent previous address • Contact details • Proof of any intended activity in New Zealand for individuals • Overseas taxpayer ident ificat ion number • Business description and code for non-individuals • Copy of a certificate of incorporation for companies • A copy of certificate of registration, trust deed or agreement, or equivalent overseas constituting document for entities other than companies • Details of the stock exchange listing for companies listed on a stock exchange • Names, addresses and IRD numbers of shareholders, directors, partners and trustees (as applicable) • Proof of a fully funct ional New Zealand bank account, or proof that customer due diligence has been completed by a New Zealand reporting entity under the rules in the AML Act 11. Individual offshore persons applying for an IRD number, who are in New Zealand at the time of applying, must personally present their identity documents for verification at an Inland Revenue office, New Zealand Automobile Association, or Kiwibank. Offshore persons not in New Zealand at the time of applying for an IRD number can apply by post or electronically. Those applying for an IRD number on behalf of non-individual offshore applicants, do not need to personally present their identity documents for verification and can apply by post or electronically. 12. Inland Revenue from time to time reviews its identity verification procedures, and changes them as may be required. This is done to ensure that the procedures remain robust and fit for purpose to keep pace with any developments. Another review is currently underway, with the particular focus on: 3 • Individual IRD number applicants who are not in New Zealand at the time of applying for an IRD number, and • Non-individuals 13. Under the current anti-money laundering (AML) rules, financial institutions are required to perform customer due diligence and report suspicious transactions. The proposed Phase 2 of the AML measures will require a wider range of professionals, including New Zealand lawyers and conveyancers, to conduct customer due diligence on their clients. The Anti-Money Laundering and Countering of the Financial Terrorism Amendment Bill is expected to be implemented by 2020. 14. There are a limited number of exceptions from the bank account requirement. They are: • When a person requires an IRD number only because they are a non-resident supplier of goods and services under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; • When a reporting entity under the AML Act has conducted customer due diligence procedures for the offshore person. 15. The bank account requirement has also been simplified for non-resident seasonal workers (for example, workers who come from Pacific countries to pick fruit). They can use the NSW 1 tax code for the first month of their employment, even though they may not have an IRD number and/or a New Zealand bank account. After that month, an IRD number must be provided for the NSW tax code to continue to apply, and a bank account is then required. 16. During the last year, Inland Revenue has been approached by a number of organisations and individuals raising concerns with the current bank account requirement. The submitters advised that due to the difficulties associated with the opening of a bank account, offshore persons are unable to get an IRD number and, in turn, comply with their New Zealand tax liabilities. 17. In the March 2016 report on the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill, which brought in the exceptions to the bank account requirement, the Finance and Expenditure Committee noted that it is aware of some practical difficulties with the bank account requirement. The Committee also noted that officials have undertaken to continue to work on solutions, whether legislative or operational, to address practical difficulties and unintended consequences. 18. A review of this requirement has been included in the recent refresh of the Tax Policy Work Programme. As part of the review, Inland Revenue has consulted with interested parties. Issues with the bank account requirement 19. Inland Revenue has received a large vo lume of feedback from affected persons on the issues caused by the bank account requirement for obtaining an IRD number. There have been many cases where offshore persons have faced difficulties obtaining a bank account in 1 NSW tax code has a deduction of 10.5%. Ordinarily, if no IRD number is provided, a “no-notification” tax deduction rate of 45% applies. 4 New Zealand, which stops them from getting an IRD number, and complying with their New Zealand tax obligations. 20. The issues that have been brought to officials’ attention can be generally divided into the following categories: • New Zealand banks are unwilling to issue bank accounts to offshore persons • There can be delays for offshore persons in obtaining a New Zealand bank account • The compliance costs of obtaining a New Zealand bank account are high Banks unwilling to issue bank accounts 21. Banks are in a number of instances unwilling to open a bank account for people who are predominantly based overseas and who are not going to have on-going business with the bank. Opening an account for such persons is not cost-effective for the bank, as the cost of customer due diligence outweighs the benefits the bank may get from having them as a customer. Delays in obtaining New Zealand bank accounts 22. Officials have been provided with a number of examples demonstrating that it can at times take between 4 to 6 months before a New Zealand bank account is issued to an offshore person. Compliance costs 23. New Zealand banks and a number of submitters advised Inland Revenue that to open a bank account in New Zealand, personal presence here is required. In a number of cases, this can include having to fly to New Zealand from other parts of the world. Scale of the problem 24. Between October 2015 and September 2016, Inland Revenue has issued the following quantum of IRD numbers: • 101,646 IRD numbers for offshore/non-resident 2 individuals • 1,582 IRD numbers for offshore/non-resident non-individuals • 102,307 IRD numbers for resident individuals • 93,781 IRD numbers for resident non-individuals 2 Offshore refers to offshore persons under the definitions in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this RIS. Non-resident refers to persons who are not New Zealand tax resident. These definitions are not identical so it is possible to be an offshore person without being a non-resident and vice versa. As offshore persons and non-resident applicants are required to complete the same IRD number application form it is not possible to isolate the applicants who are offshore persons. 5 25. 4,512 of offshore/non-resident applications by individuals were sent back as they did not provide all of the required information. 26. Where all required information is not provided on the form, Inland Revenue first contacts the applicant by phone, email or post. In most cases when a contact is made, the issue is either resolved over the phone, or the applicant provides a copy of what is required. The overwhelming majority of the 4,512 applications that were sent back are attributed to the absence of a New Zealand bank account. Some of these applications could have been successfully resolved at a later stage. 27. Officials were advised by so me large accounting firms that in a number of cases offshore persons decided not to apply for a New Zealand bank account at all, due to perceived difficulties associated with obtaining it. As a result, they had also not applied for an IRD number. The number of offshore persons affected in this way has not been provided to officials. Therefore, the total number of offshore applicants who experienced difficulties with the bank account requirement is likely to be greater than 4,512. OBJECTIVES 28. The main objective of the review is to resolve in an efficient way the issues arising fro m the current requirement for offshore persons to have a New Zealand bank account before they can be issued with an IRD number. 29. All options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the fo llo wing criteria: (a) Robustness of the identity checks: The Commissioner should be satisfied with the identity of the offshore person applying for an IRD number. (b) Economic efficiency: People should not be prevented from complying with their tax obligations or completing commercial transactions by being unable to get an IRD number. (c) Efficiency of compliance and administration: The options should, to the extent possible, minimise compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 30. There is a trade-off between criteria (a) and (b) as preventing an IRD number being issued to the person until certain information is available can restrict the person’s ability to comply wit h their New Zealand tax obligations. While these criteria must be balanced against each other it is most important that these requirements do not prevent compliance with New Zealand tax obligations or affect property sales. Criterion (c) is linked to criterion (b), as compliance with tax obligations can be undermined if the costs of compliance are perceived as high. 31. A constraint on the potential options is that Inland Revenue is not, and does not intend to become, an AML agent in its own right. 6 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 32. Officials have identified four options to address the problem: • Option 1 – The status quo • Option 2 – Providing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with a discretion to issue IRD numbers to offshore persons who do not have a New Zealand bank account • Option 3 – Making further exceptions to the requirement for specific categories of offshore persons • Option 4 – Removing the requirement for an offshore person to have a New Zealand bank account before they can be issued with an IRD number Option 1 33. Option 1 is the status quo. Offshore persons would continue to be required to hold a functioning New Zealand bank account to obtain an IRD number. Assessment against criteria – Option 1 34. Option 1 does not meet the main objective. 35. Robustness of the identity checks. Option 1 meets this criterion. The Co mmissio ner can continue to rely on the customer due diligence processes undertaken by New Zealand banks before a bank account is issued to an offshore person. 36. Economic efficiency. Option 1 does not meet this criterion. In excess of 4,500 offshore persons had difficulties with or were unable to obtain an IRD number in the year to September 2016, which adversely affected their compliance with New Zealand tax obligations and affected sales of New Zealand property. 37. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Optio n 1 does not meet this criterion. A number of offshore persons are incurring high costs and suffering delays in getting a New Zealand bank account. As Inland Revenue is relying on the processes operated by financial institutions the administration costs are low. Option 2 38. Option 2 would retain the bank account requirement but introduce a Commissioner’s discretion to issue IRD numbers to offshore persons who do not have a New Zealand bank account. The key principle guiding the exercise of discretion would be that the Commissioner is satisfied as to the offshore person’s identity. Assessment against criteria – Option 2 39. Option 2 meets the main objective. It will allow the Commissioner to effectively deal with instances where issues with the bank account requirement arise. 40. Robustness of the identity checks. Option 2 meets this criterion. The Commissioner will only issue IRD numbers where she is satisfied with the identity of an offshore person. 7 41. Economic efficiency. Option 2 is better than the status quo. It will give the Commissioner sufficient flexibility to deal on a timely basis with a range of different cases where she has confidence in the identity of a person. Although a number of offshore persons who are unable to open a New Zealand bank account could get an IRD number if the Commissioner is satisfied with their identity, there would continue to be other offshore persons who are unable to get an IRD number when discretion was not exercised. 42. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 2 is better than the status quo for compliance costs, but worse than the status quo for administrative costs. Overall, we consider Option 2 the same as the status quo. Offshore persons’ costs would reduce as they would be able to apply for the Commissioner’s discretion instead. Administratively, Inland Revenue would have to allocate additional resources to consider the exercise of the discretion on a case-by-case basis. These additional administrative costs are not significant. Option 3 43. Under Option 3, the bank account requirement would be retained but there would be further exceptions to the requirement for specific categories of offshore persons. Candidates for exceptions would be offshore persons or groups of offshore persons in relation to whom the risk result ing fro m not complying with the AML requirements is low. This would be an extension to the limited exceptions already in place. Assessment against criteria – Option 3 44. Option 3 does not meet the main objective, as the exceptions process is not efficient to address issues of offshore persons who urgently need an IRD number. 45. Robustness of the identity checks. Option 3 meets this criterion. The Commissioner can continue to rely on the customer due diligence processes undertaken by New Zealand banks before a bank account is issued to an offshore person. Offshore persons subject to an exception may not be subject to the customer due diligence processes of a bank or another financial institution. Instead, the Commissioner will rely on her own identity checks. 46. Economic efficiency. Option 3 is an improvement on the status quo, but not as good as Option 2. Offshore persons who qualified for an exception would be able to obtain an IRD number. There would be no change for offshore persons who did not qualify for one of the exemptions. 47. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 3 is slightly better than the status quo. Although offshore persons who qualified for the exemption would have their compliance costs reduced by no longer being required to open a New Zealand bank account, there would be no change for offshore persons who did not qualify for an exemption. The following implications may result: • Legislating for every single instance would be highly resource-intensive and result in complex rules as cases where difficulties arise are wide-spread. As legislative changes require time to be implemented, it may not suit offshore persons experiencing difficulties with the bank account requirement who need a more urgent response. • There would be an increase in administration costs due to Inland Revenue having to confirm whether an offshore person claiming to meet an exemption actually did so. 8 Option 4 48. Option 4 is to remove the requirement for an offshore person to have a New Zealand bank account before they can be issued with an IRD number. Assessment against criteria – Option 4 49. Option 4 meets the main objective. The remo val of the bank account requirement would address the difficulties that offshore persons experience with it. 50. Robustness of the identity checks. Option 4 does not meet this criterion. It does not ensure that the Commissioner’s identity processes remain robust, as the Commissioner will not be able to rely on the customer due diligence checks performed by financial institutions. 51. Economic efficiency. Option 4 is a significant improvement on the status quo. Offshore persons who could not open a New Zealand bank account would be able to obtain IRD numbers and comply with their New Zealand tax obligations and complete commercial transactions. 52. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 4 is a significant improvement over the status quo. As a New Zealand bank account would no longer be required, offshore persons will not have to be present in New Zealand for the purposes of opening a bank account, and will be able to get an IRD number in a timely manner. Compliance costs for offshore persons will be reduced. Compliance costs for banks will also be reduced as they will no longer have to consider opening accounts for offshore customers who have no other need for a New Zealand bank account. Administration costs will be reduced as Inland Revenue will no longer have to consider whether an offshore person has a functional bank account, and will also not have to consider arrangements where offshore persons are unable to comply with tax or commercial obligations due to being unable to get a bank account and an IRD number. CONSULTATION 53. In August and September 2016 targeted consultation was undertaken with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association and the New Zealand Law Society. 54. All submitters have welcomed the review. There was no support for the status quo and all submitters supported reform. Evidence through further examples where the bank account requirement is causing difficulties was provided. Some submitters preferred the removal of the bank account requirement, while others supported the option of Commissioner’s discretion and/or further exceptions. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 55. The following table summarises the consideration of the options from the regulatory analysis section above. Within the overview table the following symbols are used:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  Same as the status quo 9  Worse than the status quo Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Does not meet the main objective Meets the robustness of identity checks criterion Meets economic efficiency criterion Meets efficiency of compliance and administration criterion Option 2 – Commissioner discretion Meets the main objective Robustness of identity checks  Economic efficiency  Efficiency of compliance and administration  Option 3 – Specific legislative exemptions Does not meet the main objective Robustness of identity checks  Economic efficiency  Efficiency of compliance and administration  Option 4 – Removing requirement for bank account Meets the main objective Robustness of identity checks  Economic efficiency  Efficiency of compliance and administration  56. Two options meet the main objective (Options 2 and 4), and two do not (Options 1 and 3). Option 2 is better than Option 4 because the robustness of identity checks is better maintained under Option 2. Officials therefore, on balance, recommend Option 2. 57. Since the introduction of the status quo officials have been made aware that the bank account requirement is making it difficult for people to comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. Option 2 will reduce these costs while also allowing for the robustness of the identity checks to be maintained. 58. Option 3 is not preferred. Although it will improve the situation for so me offshore persons who cannot open a New Zealand bank account, the exceptions process is lengthy and is not suited for offshore persons who need an IRD number urgently. It will also not resolve the issue for offshore persons who do not qualify for an exception. 59. Although Option 4 rates higher than other options on the efficiency criteria, it is not preferred at this time as the robustness of identity checks will be reduced. However, as indicated in the Monitoring, Evaluation and Review section of this RIS, once the second phase of the AML legislation is implemented officials will seek approval to review the bank account requirement again. Such a review may result in a recommendation to remove the bank account requirement. IMPLEMENTATION 60. Changes to provide the Commissioner with discretion to issue IRD numbers where she is satisfied with the identity of the offshore person would require an amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. This amendment would be included in the next available omnibus 10 tax bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2017. This change would apply from the date of enactment of that bill. 61. This change would reduce compliance costs for offshore persons. It may increase administrative costs. These costs are not expected to be significant. 62. The bill commentary and a Tax Information Bulletin article after enactment will explain the changes. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 63. In general, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Opportunities for external consultation are built into various stages of the process. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment will be considered for inclusion in the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 64. The scheduled Anti-Money Laundering and Countering of Financing of Terrorism Amendment Bill, promoted by the Minister of Justice, will extend customer due diligence obligations to a wider range of professionals. This is also known as the second phase of AML legislation. It is anticipated that there will be a lead-in period before the amendments are fully implemented, with professionals such as lawyers, conveyancers, accountants, real estate agents, and dealers in some high value goods becoming registered entities on a rolled-out basis by 2020. 65. Following the enactment and the implementation of the scheduled Anti-Money Laundering and Countering of Financing of Terrorism Amendment Bill by 2020, officials will seek approval to review the bank account requirement again. 11 Regulatory Impact Statement Tax treatment of petroleum mining decommissioning Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address a problem with the tax rules for decommissioning expenditure incurred by petroleum miners. Petroleum mining decommissioning incurs significant expenditure near or after the end of production at which point there will be little or no assessable income. The tax rules for petroleum mining allow decommissioning expenditure to effectively be offset against inco me fro m previous periods, rather than carried forward as a loss against future income (which would be the standard treatment in the absence of these specific rules). A key assumption is that some variant of industry specific rules will continue to ensure that petroleum mining is not disincentivised by it s tax treatment. Officials have worked closely with the petroleum mining industry and other government departments to develop the proposals in this RIS. This consultation is commensurate with the nature of the issue and the parties concerned. A key constraint on our analysis relates to determination of fiscal cost estimates for each option. Because petroleum decommissioning expenditure is already deductible and eligible to be spread-back the cost of decommissioning is already incorporated into the fiscal cost estimates. Unless otherwise noted, the proposals considered in this RIS are expected to have, at most, a timing effect on the total cost to the Crown of decommissioning. These forecasts, however, are influenced by a number of factors that are unable to be reliably determined at this time. These factors include: • the regulatory standard for the level of decommissioning required, which is still being determined by the government; • the timeframe for decommissioning of the various existing rigs which is currently estimated to occur between 2018 and 2046; • any new exploration discoveries or changes in technology that extend field life; • estimates of decommissioning costs including how this changes over time because of better information, changes in technology and environmental regulat ions; and • changes in estimated oil and gas prices and the effect this has on economically recoverable reserves. Peter Frawley Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 October 2016 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current tax treatment 1. The tax rules for petroleum mining split the life of a field into two distinct phases, namely exploration and development. “Exploration” is generally done under a prospecting or explorat ion permit 1 and involves looking for oil and gas reserves that can be extracted in commercially feasible quantities, whereas “development” is done under a mining permit and involves the extraction of oil or gas for commercial production. 2. “Exploration expenditure” is deductible when incurred whereas “development expenditure” is spread over either seven years or under the reserve depletion method which spreads the deduction over the remaining life of the field. Changing this tax treatment is not within the scope of the current project. 3. The petroleum mining tax rules apply equally to onshore and offshore installations 2 . However, onshore installations can be decommissioned at a significantly lower cost. Furthermore petroleum miners with onshore installations typically have income from more than one source. Because of these factors onshore petroleum mining has never utilised the spread-back provisions. While onshore petroleum mining would continue to be able to access the same rules (including the proposals in this RIS) as offshore petroleum mining it is not considered further in the analysis in this regulatory impact statement (RIS). 4. A petroleum miner will incur significant decommissioning expenditure before relinquishing their mining permit. Decommissioning is what happens to wells, installations and surrounding infrastructure when a petroleum field reaches the end of its economic life. Offshore decommissioning usually involves: • the plugging and abandoning of wells; • removal of equipment; and • the complete or partial removal of installations and pipelines. Policy 5. The policy underlying the current tax rules recognises that this expenditure is an unavoidable consequence of the production process and that industry specific timing rules should allow deductions for this expenditure to effectively be offset against income derived in earlier periods. 6. In the absence of industry specific tax rules a petroleum miner may pay tax in earlier periods then incur decommissioning expenditure which would be carried forward as a loss to 1 It can also be done under a mining permit where a petroleum miner is seeking to expand production within a field that has already entered commercial production. 2 The decommissioning tax rules have always applied to both onshore and offshore decommissioning. The tax treatment of development expenditure was aligned from 2008 to reflect modern drilling and oil and gas extraction techniques making the previous boundary unsustainable as offshore wells could be situated just on the onshore side of the boundary. 2 future periods. Unless the petroleum miner has income from other sources, such as a separate field, this loss would never be utilised. Officials recognise that this would be inappropriate and would discourage petroleum exploration and development or could encourage a petroleum miner to decommission a field that still contained economically recoverable reserves to ensure that any deductions could be offset against the higher income amounts that are derived in earlier years of a field’s life 3 . 7. To address this issue, the petroleum mining tax rules allow a petroleum miner to request that the Commissioner reopen earlier tax years to claim a deduction for decommissioning expenditure incurred “because of the relinquishment of the permit”. This process is referred to as a “spread-back”. Expenditure is spread-back to the previous year to the extent taxable income was returned and if the expenditure exceeds the amount of profit the remainder is carried back another year and so on. 8. This can be illustrated by the following example: Tax year 2012 2013 2014 2015 Without spread-back Operating profit 60 50 40 30 Decommissioning 100 Total profit 60 50 40 -70 Tax paid (28%) 16.8 14 11.2 0 Loss Carried Forward -70 After spread-back Total profit 60 20 0 0 Tax payable 16.8 5.6 0 0 Less tax paid -16.8 -14 -11.2 0 Refund 0 8.4 11.2 0 Problems with current tax treatment Significant problems 9. The petroleum mining decommissioning tax rules have never been applied as no offshore installations have been decommissioned in New Zealand. The petroleum mining industry has started planning for future decommissioning in recent years and have been working with officials; a number of issues have been identified. 10. The primary concern of the petroleum mining industry is the effect of section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007) which prevents the Commissioner from refunding an amount of tax if more than four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which an income tax return was filed. The spread-back does not have an equivalent limit, so the Commissioner could reassess a period from more than four years previous to create a credit balance. However, section RM 2 would then prevent the Commissioner refunding this credit balance to the petroleum miner. 11. There are two possible practical consequences of this restriction: 3 Generally output from a field peaks in early years of production and slowly declines. This results in higher profits and tax payments in earlier years than in later years as the field approaches the end of its life. 3 i. The petroleum miner is unable to get a refund for the full amount of their decommissioning costs spread-back despite the existing policy that they should be able to. ii. The petroleum miner may decommission the field earlier than they otherwise would to ensure they have sufficient profits within the four previous years to fully cover the cost of decommissioning. 12. To the extent the second path is chosen, and the industry has advised this is what would occur, this four year restriction would have no impact on the amount of tax deductions 4 offset against taxable income but would reduce the amount of oil and gas extracted. The Crown Minerals Act 1991 requires the Crown to assess and agree with a petroleum miner as to whether the maximum economic recovery of a field has been reached and cessation of production can occur. If tax deductions for decommissioning costs cannot be effectively utilised this would be factored into the Crown’s assessment. Premature decommissioning would result in lost revenue to the Crown in the form of foregone royalties and corporate taxes. 13. A number of other issues and uncertainties also arise with the existing rules. These could be resolved within the existing policy and are explained further below. Other problems 14. There are two qualifying criteria for triggering the spread-back of decommissioning expenditure under the current rules, depending on the type of expenditure or loss, these are “in a tax year in which a petroleum miner relinquishes a permit” and “because of the relinquishment of the petroleum permit”. While the first is often clear on timing the second is less so and when combined they create uncertainty in a number of situations such as: • A wide variety of expenditure will be incurred because of the relinquishment of the permit, including planning for decommissioning before drilling has commenced which may be 40 years before the permit is eventually relinquished. It is not clear whether expenditure has to be within a reasonable time period of the permit relinquishment. • A petroleum miner may undertake activities that look like decommissioning but are not directly linked with the relinquishment of a permit. It is not clear whether this expenditure would ever qualify for the spread-back. • A petroleum miner may decommission a well several years before relinquishing the permit. It is not clear whether this expenditure would qualify when incurred or whether it would have to wait until the permit was relinquished. • A petroleum miner may decommission a well and surrender acreage within a permit area without relinquishing the entire permit. It is not clear whether this expenditure would qualify for the spread-back until the entire permit was relinquished. 4 For example, a petroleum miner that is subject to the four year limit is generating sufficient income to cover operating costs but with only a small profit. If this situation continued into future periods, each year the additional operating profit would be less than the effectively foregone deduction for decommissioning so it would make economic sense to decommission even if, in the absence of tax, production could continue for several more years. In this example the refund for decommissioning would be identical but tax on profits would be reduced. 4 15. As well as decommissioning development wells a petroleum miner will incur expenditure on abandoning exploration wells. These exploration wells may have been drilled before, during or after commercial production and may or may not have resulted in a discovery of petroleum reserves that are commercially extractable 5 . It is officials’ view that expenditure on abandonment of exploration wells is not eligible to be spread-back but this is not clearly articulated in the legislation and some petroleum miners consider it is currently available. 16. When an exploration well is subsequently used for commercial production the cost that was previously deducted is added back and spread over a number of future years 6 which puts it in the same posit ion as if it was originally drilled as a development well. If the permit is relinquished any undeducted costs are intended to be able to be spread-back. However, an error in the rewrite from the Income Tax Act 2004 to the Income Tax Act 2007 introduced an incorrect cross reference so that only expenditure on an exploration well that is used for commercial production but not expenditure on a development well is eligible for the spread- back. 17. It is officials’ view that the spread-back is a mechanism for generating a payment to the taxpayer rather than altering the amount of tax originally payable in that earlier period. Accordingly, when a petroleum miner spreads-back expenditure they should not be entitled to credit use of money interest (UOMI). However, unlike other equivalent sections 7 , there are no specific provisions confirming that UOMI is not payable when a petroleum miner spreads- back expenditure. Opportunities in amendment 18. Historically, there were a number of spread-back provisions, for both income and expenditure, in the Income Tax Act. Officials view such spread-backs as an outdated approach that results in high compliance and administration costs. Many spread-back provisions have been removed as part of previous reforms and there are no remaining provisions that spread-back expenditure equivalent to the petroleum decommissioning rules. 19. Officials view the need to amend the petroleum mining rules as an opportunity to modernise the decommissioning rules in a manner that is broadly consistent with existing policy but reduces compliance and administration costs. Scale of the problem 20. As noted above, the petroleum mining rules apply to both offshore and onshore installations. However, onshore installations can be decommissioned at a relatively low cost and are typically operated by petroleum miners who have income from other sources. Accordingly, the decommissioning rules, and any problems associated with them, typically only apply in practice to offshore installations. 21. Offshore installations in overseas jurisdictions normally cost between NZ$100 million and NZ$1 billion to decommission. The lower end of this range generally incorporates 5 The global industry average success rate for exploratory wells is around 1 in 6. 6 Either 7 years or under the reserve depletion method. 7 See for example section 120PA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which states no UOMI is payable when a credit for a supplementary dividend is carried back to create a refund in an earlier period. 5 FPSO 8 installations, through to smaller unmanned fixed platforms with larger manned fixed platforms at the higher end. New Zealand has examples of all types. The number of offshore decommissioning projects in other jurisdictions has increased over the last decade; however, large scale decommissioning is not yet commonplace. Over the coming decade, more decommissioning projects are expected to commence, which will lead to improvements in best industry practice and will help refine estimates of what decommissioning costs can be expected, with the possibilit y o f reduced costs. 22. Under current settings the Crown may be liable to pay up to 42 percent of decommissioning costs as tax and royalty rebates to operators. The four year limitation does not arise for royalties which are handled through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment. This RIS only considers the tax consequences of decommissioning, which are limited to the tax rate applying to the petroleum miner which for all current petroleum miners is the company tax rate of 28 percent. As the spread-back (and the refundable credit in option 3) are linked to the petroleum miners’ tax rate any future increases or decreases in the corporate tax rate would result in the same change in the tax cost to the Crown of decommissioning. 23. In addition to the size of the installation, two other main factors influencing the cost of decommissioning are: • New Zealand’s distance from where decommissioning vehicles are typically located (often in Singapore or the North Sea) which means mobilisation costs are higher than for other jurisdict ions; and • the age of the rig being decommissioned as older rigs were typically built with less planning towards eventual decommissioning 9 . 24. There are currently four offshore producing petroleum operations in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone and a fifth offshore operation in the territorial sea 10 . Decommissioning of these existing offshore installations has yet to occur, but the first offshore decommissioning project could commence as early as 2018. 25. Although there are only five operations these are typically operated by joint ventures of several different taxpayers 11 , each of which would be affected by these proposals. In addition further taxpayers are in the exploration phase or may enter the exploration phase in the future. These petroleum miners may subsequently enter the production phase and eventually decommission. 8 Floating Production, Storage and Offloading units – dedicated vessels attached via anchor chains to the seabed and removable lines to the oil wells. Once a field is exhausted the FPSO can be moved to a new location. 9 Overseas jurisdictions tend to require modern installations or structures to be fully removed except in circumstances where the installation was constructed prior to 1998 or where safety or environmental risks require the infrastructure to remain. New Zealand has examples of rigs constructed before and after this date. New Zealand’s decommissioning requirements and how they relate to specific installations are still being determined. 10 The territorial sea covers the area up to 12 nautical miles from land while the exclusive economic zone covers from 12 to 200 nautical miles. 11 For example one particular field is a joint venture of five operators. 6 26. The most recent Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment estimate of the cost of decommissioning the existing offshore installations is $2,200 million between 2019 and 2046. At a 28% tax rate the tax cost would be $616 million 12 . These amounts are already refundable under the current law. 27. The options in this RIS would not affect the cost of decommissioning or the deductibility of those costs. The options could have a minor impact on timing of tax payments and refunds which could have some behavioural impacts on production and, therefore, tax payments. These impacts are difficult to quantify for the reasons provided below: • the regulatory standard for the level of decommissioning required, which is still being determined by the government; • the timeframe for decommissioning of the various existing rigs which is currently estimated to occur between 2018 and 2046; • any new exploration discoveries or changes in technology that extend field life; • estimates of decommissioning costs including how this changes over time because of better information, changes in technology and environmental regulations; and • changes in estimated oil and gas prices and the effect this has on economically recoverable reserves. OBJECTIVES 28. The main objective is to modernise the tax rules that apply to petroleum mining decommissioning. 29. All options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the fo llo wing criteria: (a) Neutrality: the tax rules should not influence a petroleum miner’s decision about when to decommission (b) Fairness and equity: the tax rules should reflect the income and expenditure profile of the petroleum mining industry but should not otherwise provide a concession not available to other taxpayers (c) Efficiency of compliance and administration: the impacts on taxpayers of compliance with the rules and administrative impacts on the government should be minimised as far as possible 30. The neutrality and fairness and equity criteria are equally weighted as it is important that petroleum mining is not disincentivised by the tax system but it is equally important that the petroleum mining industry is not provided with tax concessions that create an advantage over other industries. 12 This estimate does not factor in any tax refunds that may not be available due to the four year limit or insufficient tax being paid in previous periods. For the reasons set out elsewhere in this RIS officials do not expect either of these factors to provide a significant impediment to the amount of tax refunds available to petroleum miners from decommissioning. 7 31. While efficiency of compliance and administration is an important factor it is secondary to the other two criteria as the costs and any inefficiencies arising from them are smaller than inefficiencies arising from the first two criteria. 32. There are no relevant constraints to this analysis. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 33. Officials have identified five options to address the problem: • Option 1 – The status quo • Option 2 – Amendments to the spread-back provision • Option 3 – Introduce a refundable credit • Option 4 – Introduce an environmental restoration account • Option 5 – Allow deductions for provisions 34. There are no social or cultural impacts associated with any of the identified options. There may be an environmental impact from any one of the options to the extent they create or remove incentives or disincentives for petroleum mining. 35. We consider that the options would have no material impact on fiscal costs or revenue. The options consider the timing of deductions and there would be no change in the ultimate treatment of decommissioning expenditure – it would continue to be deductible. Options 1 to 3 would allow a deduction at the end against income previously returned whereas options 4 and 5 would allow the same deduct ions (or at least a proxy for them via provisions) against income as it is returned. Therefore, options 4 and 5 would have a higher fiscal cost than options 1 to 3. However, it is difficult to estimate the extent that this would occur. To the extent the existing four year limit accelerates decommissioning, removing this would raise revenue; but this is not considered significant given the other uncertainties in the forecasts which are explained in paragraph 27. Option 1 36. Option 1 is the status quo. The spread-back provision would be retained, including the four-year refund limitation. Assessment against criteria – option 1 37. The status quo does not meet the main objective. Spread-backs are considered an outdated approach that has high compliance and administration costs. Previous reforms have not introduced any new spread-back provisions for a long time and many have been remo ved. 38. Neutrality. The current rules do not meet the neutrality criterion. They encourage a petroleum miner to decommission earlier than they otherwise might and to relinquish a permit earlier than they otherwise might. 39. Fairness and equity. The current rules do not meet the fairness and equity criterion. The four year refund limit disincentivises petroleum mining because of the industry specific 8 income and expenditure profile. It also provides a concession not available to other industries by potentially paying UOMI on spread-backs when no UOMI is paid in other spread-back situations. The petroleum mining industry considers abandonment costs of exploration wells can be spread-back which, if allowable, would be concessionary compared to other industries where current period losses from non-profitable ventures cannot be spread-back against profits from previously profitable ventures. 40. Efficiency of compliance and administration. The current rules do not meet the efficiency of compliance and administration criterion. The current rules require prior assessment periods to be reopened which requires manual intervention by Inland Revenue staff. This may also impose higher compliance costs on petroleum miners who will have to account for refunds from various periods that have previously been finalised. Option 2 41. Option 2 is to amend the status quo. This would retain the spread-back but would remove the four year refund limitation and make other clarifying amendments to address the problems in paragraphs 14 to 17 consistent with the existing policy. These include clarifying when the spread-back is available, that the spread-back is not available when an exploration well is abandoned and that no UOMI is payable when the spread-back results in a refund in prior years. Assessment against criteria – option 2 42. Option 2 does not meet the main objective. While the amendments would clarify the legislation so that its application is consistent with the policy intent the spread-back would be maintained which, as covered in option 1, is not a modern approach to tax compliance and administration. 43. Neutrality. Option 2 is an improvement over the status quo. The amendments would remove the incentives and disincentives present in the current rules. 44. Fairness and equity. Option 2 is an improvement over the status quo. The amendments clarify a number of issues that could be concessionary towards petroleum miners. 45. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 2 is worse than the status quo. It would have all the problems of the status quo plus removing UOMI from refunds from prior periods would require manual intervention 13 to override the standard treatment. Option 3 46. A refundable credit has a very similar effect to a spread-back under option 1 and 2. The difference is that qualifying decommissioning expenditure would generate a refundable tax credit in the petroleum miner’s current income tax return instead of requiring the Commissioner to reopen prior periods to reassess and reduce previous tax liabilities already paid. The refund would be limited to the amount of income tax paid in prior years. 13 Manual intervention would be required under Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer system. The replacement system – START – will be operational by the time these changes would be enacted. It is not confirmed what the process would be for this; however, it would still be a variation from the standard treatment. 9 47. Unlike the spread-back mechanism, there are a number of refundable credits already in the ITA 2007 14 . Most relevant is a refundable credit for mineral mining which relates to rehabilitation expenditure at the end of mining operations. Officials see many similarities between rehabilitation by mineral miners and decommissioning by petroleum miners and there would also be many similarities between how refundable credits would work for the two industries 15 . This option would also incorporate the same clarifying amendments covered in option 2 above. Assessment against criteria – option 3 48. Option 3 meets the main objective. The refundable credit mechanism would broadly align with other credits already available and would be consistent with the policy intent of the petroleum mining rules. 49. Neutrality. Opt ion 3 is an improvement over the status quo. The rules would remove the incentives and disincentives present in the current tax rules. 50. Fairness and equity. Opt ion 3 is an improvement over the status quo. The rules would include clarification of a number of issues that could be concessionary towards petroleum miners. Providing a refundable credit recognises the different income profile of petroleum mining but does not otherwise provide a concession not available to other industries. 51. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 3 is a significant improvement over the status quo. It would remove the need for any interaction between Inland Revenue and petroleum miners regarding reopening prior assessment periods. In comparison with options 4 and 5, it would also reduce the focus on verifying provisions for decommissioning with Inland Revenue at any point prior to claiming the refundable credit. Option 4 52. An environmental restoration account would allow a petroleum miner to make a payment into an account operated by the Commissioner based on provisions for decommissioning. Provisions are an accounting deduction for expenditure or loss expected to be incurred by the person in a future period and allow a more conservative accounting profit to be recorded to reflect deductions that would have otherwise arisen in a later period. Generally accounting provisions are not deductible for tax purposes. Amounts deposited into this account would be deductible when paid and the petroleum miner could withdraw them from this account at a later date to satisfy decommissioning expenditure when it was incurred. Modest interest on the account balance would be paid in the meantime. 53. This option would be closely based on existing provisions for environmental restoration accounts in subpart EK of the ITA 2007. Existing environmental restoration accounts are not industry specific and can be available whenever the necessary criteria are met. An example of a current use of an environmental restoration account would be a taxpayer operating a landfill. 14 A list of refundable credits is in section LA 6(1) of the ITA 2007 15 Further detail on how refundable credits for mineral miners operate can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 26, No 4, May 2014. http://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/a/e/aee2f96e-f5c6-4b1f-ae75-e951c8bae62e/tib- vol26-no4.pdf 10 54. Environmental restoration accounts were also proposed for rehabilitation expenditure for mineral mining in the October 2012 Taxation of specified mineral mining officials’ issues paper 16 . However, upon considering feedback from submitters, which was strongly opposed particularly because of the negative cash flow impact of making deposits into the account, this was replaced by the refundable credit mechanism covered by option 3. Assessment against criteria – option 4 55. Option 4 meets the main objective. The proposal is consistent with rules that already apply to similar restoration processes. 56. Neutrality. Option 4 is an improvement over the status quo. The rules would remove the incentives and disincentives present in the current rules. 57. Fairness and equity. Option 4 is an improvement over the status quo. The amendments clarify a number of issues that could be concessionary towards petroleum miners. 58. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 4 is worse than the status quo. Petroleum miners are likely to strongly oppose this option because it would have a significant negative cashflow impact on them. It would also incur administration costs as the Commissioner would have to operate the appropriate accounts. Option 5 59. As with other industries, petroleum miners create accounting provisions for expenditure or loss they expect to incur in a future period. This option would allow a petroleum miner to claim a deduction based on accounting provisions for decommissioning expenditure that is expected to be incurred in a future period. Although a petroleum miner would commit themselves to decommissioning expenditure once they started the development phase the cost of decommissioning would be spread over the expected life of the field so that the timing would align with the income derived. 60. When this option is discussed it is usually referenced back to the Privy Council decision in C of IR v Mitsubishi Motors 17 which was a case regarding the deductibility for tax purposes of provisions created upon the sale of new cars based on prior history of warranty claims. Assessment against criteria – option 5 61. Option 5 meets the main objective. Prior returns would not need to be reopened. 62. Neutrality. Option 5 is an improvement over the status quo. The option would remove the incentives and disincentives present in the current rules. 63. Fairness and equity. Option 5 is worse than the status quo. Petroleum miners would be eligible for deductions for expenditure based on provisions which is a treatment not available to other industries. With the international focus on removing concessions for the fossil fuel industry this would be likely to be very controversial. 16 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2012-ip-mineral-mining/overview 17 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 11 64. Efficiency of compliance and administration. Option 5 is an improvement over the status quo. It would remove the need to reopen prior periods. However, basing deductions on provisions would likely increase the focus on ensuring these were correct, which would be more difficult than verifying expenditure incurred. CONSULTATION 65. Because decommissioning consideration is being undertaken concurrently by various government departments an interagency petroleum decommissioning working group was formed including Inland Revenue, the Treasury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment, the Ministry for the Environment and other departments. Officials have discussed details of the current rules and proposed changes wit h this group and its members, who have not raised any concerns. 66. Officials also undertook targeted consultation with the petroleum mining industry and their advisors during August and September 2016. This consultation proposed that the current spread-back be replaced by a refundable credit. 67. Submitters were all in favour of replacing the current spread-back (which is subject to the 4 year refund limitation period) with a refundable credit. The two common themes in submissions were around not limiting the refund to tax previously paid by an entity – this limit already exists in the status quo, and allowing a refundable credit for abandonment costs – where the industry disagrees with officials and considers that a spread-back is already available. A number of other more minor changes have also been incorporated as a result of the consultation. Officials have extended their recommendations to include tax paid by a petroleum miner before joining a consolidated group and to allow a refundable credit for certain abandonment provided that is done as part of decommissioning a production well. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 68. The following table summarises our consideration of the options from the regulatory analysis section above. Within the overview table the following symbols are used:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Does not meet the main objective Option 2 – Amendments to the spread-back Does not meet the main objective Neutrality  Fairness and equity  Efficiency of compliance and administration  Option 3 – Introduce a refundable credit Meets the main objective Neutrality  Fairness and equity  Efficiency of compliance and administration  12 Option 4 – Introduce an environmental restoration account Meets the main objective Neutrality  Fairness and equity  Efficiency of compliance and administration  Option 5 – Allow deductions for provisions Meets the main objective Neutrality  Fairness and equity  Efficiency of compliance and administration  69. Options 3, 4 and 5 satisfy the main objective of ensuring that the petroleum mining decommissioning rules are appropriate. 70. Officials recommend option 3 as it is the only option that provides an overall improvement on the status quo (option 1). This is for the following reasons: • Option 1 is not sustainable as it has a number of uncertainties and inappropriate outcomes that both disincentivise petroleum mining and provide concessions not available to other industries. Option 3 is preferable over option 2 as it would result in lower compliance and administration costs from not having to reopen prior periods to include all or part of the decommissioning costs that could not be included in the original return and would not require manual intervention of UOMI calculations. • While option 3 provides a treatment not available to most other industries this reflects their unique income profile and is not an unjustified concession. • Option 3 is preferable over option 4 as it would result in lower compliance costs from the petroleum miner not having to make upfront payments into an account operated by the Commissioner before the expenditure is incurred. It would also result in lower administration costs from the Commissioner not having to operate this account. • Option 3 is preferable over option 5 as it corrects the issue arising from significant expenditure at or near the end of the production process without providing a concession that is not available to other industries (being able to claim a current period deduction for expenditure that will be incurred in a future period). IMPLEMENTATION 71. Changes to introduce a refundable credit for petroleum decommissioning expenditure would require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments would be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2017. 72. These amendments would apply equally to all petroleum miners, including those that are already in production as well as those still in the exploration phase who need to plan for future decommissioning. The bill containing these amendments would be expected to be enacted before the first offshore installation begins decommissioning which may occur in 2018. As no petroleum miners have decommissioned an offshore installation in New Zealand this timeline would ensure that the new rules apply equally to all petroleum miners. 73. These changes would not impose significant compliance costs on petroleum miners as the primary change would be to include decommissioning expenditure in the relevant period’s income tax return rather than calculating this amount and requesting it be included in previous 13 years’ assessments. Depending on how the petroleum miner accounts for refunds from prior periods the change may also reduce compliance costs of recording these refunds. 74. The bill commentary and a Tax Information Bulletin publication upon enactment to explain the changes would be required. Minor systems changes would also be required to START to allow petroleum miners to obtain a refund in a current income year that exceeded tax paid in that year. However, these changes have previously been implemented in FIRST and would be incorporated into START for the mineral mining industry, so replicating these for petroleum mining is not expected to be a significant cost and would be met within existing baselines. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 75. Inland Revenue would closely monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes once income tax returns including decommissioning start being prepared – with the first possibly to be in the 2018-19 income year. 76. In general, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Opportunities for external consultation are built into various stages of the process. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be considered for inclusion in the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 14 Regulatory Impact Statement Taxation of Employee Share Schemes Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to improve the framework for taxing employee share schemes (ESS). In some circumstances, the current tax rules can result in over-taxation; in others they result in under-taxation. The options considered in this Regulatory Impact Statement seek to address these issues. To analyse the options for taxing ESS, tax policy officials gathered case-based evidence of the range of commercial practices that currently exist. We researched the historic basis of the existing law. We then identified areas where the current law is deficient in light of our broad-base, low-rate taxation framework. Having identified areas where the law is deficient and unclear, we undertook an analysis of the optimal taxation framework for taxing ESS and tested possible solutions against that framework. In considering various options, we considered quantitative data where it was available. Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive statistics on how widespread employee share schemes are and what form they take. There is also no comprehensive data on the tax treatment of these schemes. So while we know ESS are an important form of remuneration, we cannot be sure of the number of employees participating in different types of schemes or how much remuneration is provided through ESS. Accordingly, officials are also unable to provide quantitative estimates of the costs and benefit of maintaining the status quo. To address this limitation, in some cases we had to look to Australia for data. We made some adjustments to the Australian data to attempt to more accurately reflect the New Zealand environment. Peter Frawley Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 28 November 2016 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Overview 1. Employee share schemes (ESS) – arrangements providing shares and share options by companies to employees – are an important form of employee remuneration in New Zealand and internationally. Although the commercial design and the accounting treatment of these plans have evolved considerably over recent decades, the tax rules applying to them in New Zealand have not been comprehensively reviewed during that period and are now out of date. 2. ESS can have beneficial economic effects (in terms of aligning employee and shareholder interests, promoting financial literacy and allowing cash poor companies to attract top emplo yees) and it is important that the tax rules do not raise unintended barriers to their use. In some circumstances, the current rules can result in over-taxation; in others they result in under-taxation. There is no comprehensive data to quantify the size of this problem. Status quo 3. The taxation of ESS is governed by the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). Framework for taxing employee share schemes 4. Broadly speaking, there are two potential frameworks for taxing ESS: • a neutral tax framework consistent with New Zealand’s BBLR tax policy settings. Under a neutral tax framework, the tax treatment of employment income paid in shares should be consistent with the taxation of employment income paid in cash. That is, ESS should not be at a tax advantage or disadvantage compared to a cash salary; or • a concessionary framework where ESS are offered tax incentives. ESS are offered to help align incentives of employees with those of the firm and to improve general employee engagement. Given these positive effects, it is sometimes suggested that these schemes should benefit from tax incentives. 5. The current framework for taxing employee share schemes is mixed, and in some cases, unclear. Generally speaking, most ESS are intended to be taxed under a neutral tax framework. However, there are inadvertent tax benefits associated with some schemes that make them more attractive than other types of schemes, or equivalent cash salary (notably the recharacterisation of labour income as tax-free capital income). In addition, the current law contains a deliberate, narrow tax exemption and deemed notional interest deduction for widely-offered schemes. Treatment of employees’ income 6. Employee share schemes may be divided into three general categories: • Unconditional ESS – which provide shares or options to emplo yees free from further conditions. • Conditional ESS – where the shares or options received by employees are subject to future emplo yment condit ions. 2 • Options and option-like arrangements – options allow employees to purchase shares in their employer at a predetermined time in the future for a predetermined price (“strike price”). Option-like arrangements are in the form of a share purchase, but have terms and conditions (often based on the price of the shares) and other features that make the arrangement similar in economic effect to an option. Option-like arrangements often have employment conditions in addit io n to the price conditions. 7. Unconditional and conditional ESS are currently taxed as follows. Employees are taxed when they acquire the shares. In the case of a conditional scheme, the shares are commonly given to a trustee to hold until the condition is met. This is treated as acquisition by the employee. The taxable income is the difference between the value of the shares at that time and the price they pay for them. If employees pay full market value for the shares, then no taxable income arises. At the other extreme, if employees are given shares for no consideration, then the full market value of the shares is taxable income. 8. Wit h share options, employees are given a right to purchase shares at some future date for a set price (the strike price). This right itself may be subject to the satisfaction of a future condition. In that case, the options are often referred to as “vesting” when the condition is met. An employee will exercise the option if the shares’ value at the future date exceeds the strike price – the option effectively allows them to acquire the shares at a discount. If the strike price exceeds the shares’ value the employee will not exercise their option. When an employee receives an option, employment income equal to the value of the option is received and that income should be subject to tax. 9. Under current rules, no tax is paid when the option is issued or vests. An employee participating in a share option plan is taxed only if and when the option is exercised. The difference between the market value of the shares at exercise and the strike price is taxable income. This approach is tax at exercise. 10. A number of employee share schemes make use of interest-free loans. Interest-free loans provided to employees by their employer are generally subject to FBT. However, FBT is not payable in respect of an interest-free loan provided by an employer to enable an emplo yee to purchase the employer’s shares, provided certain criteria are satisfied. The FBT exemption is appropriate because it ensures the tax treatment of the interest-free loan is the same as if the employer had charged interest, but paid the employee extra salary to meet the interest cost. Treatment of employers 11. Under current law there is no explicit deduction for a company that provides shares to an employee at a discount. However, there are structures that can be adopted by employers to achieve a deduction. While we do not have comprehensive data on the use of these structures, we understand they are very widespread. Widely-offered schemes 12. The ITA currently provides a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered employee share schemes. 13. There are two main tax benefits available under the concessionary regime: 3 • Exemption for employee: The value of a benefit received by an employee under a concessionary scheme is not taxable to the emplo yee. • Deemed interest deduction for employer: The employer company is given a deemed deduction of 10% notional interest on loans made to employees to buy shares. This is additional to any deduction for actual interest incurred on money borrowed to finance the scheme. There is not intended to be any deduction for the cost of acquiring shares, although we understand in practice many co mpanies have structures in place to achieve unintended deductions. 14. Another benefit under the concessionary regime is that interest-free loans made under a qualifying employee share scheme are automatically exempt from fringe benefit tax (FBT). 1 Start-up companies 15. There are currently no special rules for ESS offered by start-up companies, although they face particular practical barriers to offering ESS. 16. As stated above, they may have difficulties valuing employee share scheme benefits. They also may not have sufficient cash at the employee and employer level to fund tax imposed on the grant or vesting of shares, or the exercise of options. 17. While similar problems can exist for any unlisted companies, more mature companies can generally put in place mechanisms to deal with them. Start-ups are especially affected by these problems because they lack the cash to pay the tax on behalf of employees and their shares are very difficult to value using orthodox methodologies. Reporting and administrative requirements 18. There are currently no specific reporting requirements for emplo yers o ffering, or employees participating in, employee share schemes. While employers offering the tax- exempt schemes discussed above must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue initially for approval, there are no on-going reporting requirements with respect to these schemes. 19. From 1 April 2017, emplo yers will be required to include employees’ ESS benefits in the employer monthly schedule (EMS) (whether they elect to withhold PAYE or not). However, this amendment does not require the employer to provide specific details of the share scheme benefits provided. 20. The current lack of reporting raises a number of issues: • it is difficult to know whether employers and employees understand and are complying with their share scheme tax obligations; • employees may not have sufficient information to complete their tax return; and • there are no comprehensive statistics on how widespread employee share schemes are and what form they take. 1 The majority of employee share scheme loans are exempt from FBT. 4 Other government interventions/programmes 21. The New Zealand Government is committed to removing barriers to offering these schemes – especially for start-ups. Recent changes to the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 exempt many ESS from the requirement to offer a prospectus to employees. This was seen as a major simplification measure and was welcomed by the business community. In the course of our consultation it was mentioned as a step which was likely to increase the use of ESS. Problem definition 22. As discussed above, in some circumstances the status quo results in over-taxation and, in others, under-taxation. There are also significant administrative and compliance costs associated with the status quo. There is no comprehensive data to quantify the size of this problem. Current impediments and potential over-taxation 23. The current system impedes the use of ESS in a number of ways. These problems can be particularly relevant for start-up companies. • There is considerable uncertainty about how the current tax rules apply to employees and employers, which may deter firms from offering these schemes. • The costs to employers of providing shares to employees are not explicitly deductible. Non-deductibility creates a disincentive to using employee share schemes. • Unlisted, and in particular start-up, companies may have difficulties valuing employee share scheme benefits. • Start-up companies may not have sufficient cash-flow at the employee and employer level to fund tax payments triggered by the vesting or receipt of illiquid shares. Potential under-taxation 24. The current treatment of some sophisticated employee share schemes can result in taxable employment income being treated as tax-free capital gains and so escaping taxation. This undermines the fairness of the tax system. These sophisticated employee share schemes can provide a significant amount of untaxed employment income for some high income earners. Root causes of these problems 25. The root causes of these problems are: • that New Zealand does not tax capital gains, but does tax labour income. This creates incentives and opportunities for people to recharacterise labour income as tax-free capital gains. These transactions are possible where tax rules are unclear or contain loopholes; • the tax law relating to ESS is out of date, ambiguous and has not kept up with commercial developments – the legislation was enacted in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has not been comprehensively reviewed since then. Therefore, there is 5 scope for employers/employees to avoid tax on what is essentially remuneration for services. Quantifying the costs and benefits of the status quo 26. Employee share schemes are fairly widespread in New Zealand businesses. Large listed companies use them, as do start-up companies and medium sized privately-held companies. There are different types of schemes: high value schemes offered to a small group of senior executives, moderate value schemes offered to a wider range of managers and low value schemes offered to all employees. Some companies offer more than one type of scheme. 27. However, there is no comprehensive data on employee share schemes in New Zealand. KPMG has recently published a survey of NZX listed companies suggesting that 78% of NZX 50 Index companies offer at least one employee share scheme. 2 The New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF) also published a report into the use of employee share schemes by New Zealand start-up companies. Of the 50 companies that responded to their survey, 88% currently have a specific provision in their shareholders’ agreement/constitution allowing them to offer employee share schemes. 3 28. So officials know ESS are an important form of remuneration, but cannot be sure of the number of employees participating in different types of schemes or how much remuneration is provided through ESS. Accordingly, officials are also unable to provide quantitative estimates of the costs and benefit of maintaining the status quo. 29. The table below lists the costs and benefits of the status quo based on anecdotal evidence. Costs of status quo Benefits of status quo Lack of legislative certainty increases compliance and administrative costs. Examples of legislative uncertainty include: whether the law currently requires a widely- offered scheme to have a loan and what the “acquisition” point is for shares. Rules have been in place for 40 years so companies have bedded in ESS arrangements. Maintaining the status quo avoids companies and Inland Revenue having to incur the costs associated with changing schemes and systems. Efficiency costs as employers structure arrangements to provide tax-free capital gains instead of providing taxable labour income – this may result in an inefficiently high amount of ESS income. Some private sector advisors and companies argue being able to access capital gains tax-free adds to incentive effects and allows companies to more easily attract skilled workers. Unnecessary transaction costs to implement complicated tax-driven structures to achieve tax-free gain/a deduction for the employer when one would not otherwise be available. Equity costs – people who are able to participate in ESS and obtain tax-free capital gains are advantaged versus those who can only earn taxable salary and wages. There is a cost to Government revenue as some labour income currently goes untaxed (this is mitigated to some extent by the lack of deduction at the employer level). 2 https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/02/NZ-Employee-Share-Schemes-Brochure-Feb-2016.pdf 3 http://www.nzvif.co.nz/assets/publications/ESOP-Survey-Report.pdf 6 OBJECTIVES 30. The main objective of this reform is to modernise and improve the taxation of ESS so it is simple, efficient and fair. 31. All options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the following five criteria: • Neutrality – this means that the imposition of tax should not affect the form in which employees are paid. Tax neutrality is a core part of New Zealand’s general BBLR approach to taxation. Tax neutral treatment of the employment income means, as much as possible, we should tax all types of employee remuneration, whether paid in cash or shares or other assets, consistently; and ensure that taxation does not distort remuneration decisions. This ensures employees are remunerated in the most economically efficient (rather than the most tax efficient) form. An alternative approach would be to provide tax concessions for employee share schemes. In our view, is only appropriate to consider tax concessions if there are positive externalities associated with an activity – that is positive benefits to wider society, not just benefits captured by the parties to the arrangements. Because there is no evidence that ESS provide positive externalities the best tax policy framework for ESS is one that is neutral. • Equity – to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. In particular: i. employees paid in shares should not have a tax advantage compared to employees receiving cash salary and wages; and ii. employers paying employees in shares should not be disadvantaged compared to employers paying cash. • Compliance costs – compliance costs to businesses and employees should be minimised as much as possible. • Administrative costs – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as much as possible. • Integrity – options should safeguard the tax system against tax avoidance and evasion. The options should also contribute to a coherent set of rules for taxing labour income. Constraints 32. We were also constrained in terms of the administrative options we were able to consider because of Inland Revenue’s current Business Transformation programme. Trade-offs 33. There are trade-offs between the various criteria. 7 34. In particular, there is a trade-off between minimising administrative and compliance costs, and increasing the integrity and equity of the system. In the case of executive level schemes, more weight is placed on increasing equity and integrity than minimising compliance costs. This is because there are often high levels of remuneration being provided through these schemes and compliance costs are relatively smaller as a proportion of the remuneration being provided. This high level of benefit also makes integrity and equit y relatively more important. 35. In the case of the widely-offered schemes, there is a trade-off between neutrality and minimising compliance costs (see table 3 below). In these schemes compliance costs had a higher weighting than neutrality because of the low level of benefits that are able to be provided through the schemes and the feedback we received from submitters as to how increased compliance costs would affect them. Potential compliance costs for these schemes are high as a relative proportion of benefits provided through the scheme. In some cases submitters indicated the compliance costs associated with removing the tax exemption and requiring employers to return these amounts on the employer monthly schedule would outweigh the amount of benefit provided, meaning the schemes would no longer be viable. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 36. There are three areas of reform covered in this regulatory impact analysis: 1. Taxing emplo yees’ inco me 2. Allowing deductions for employers’ costs 3. Tax exempt ion for widely-offered schemes 37. Within each of these areas, the practical options for reform that may wholly or partly achieve the main objective are exclusively regulatory. 38. In the following paragraphs, we outline the options for reform we considered. Each topic has a corresponding table where we analyse each option by reference to the five criteria we identified in paragraph 31 and the main objective in paragraph 30. 39. Within the tables, the following symbols are used to assess each option against the status quo:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo 40. None of the options identified in any of the areas have social, environmental or cultural implications. 8 Taxing employees’ income 41. The options we considered are as follows: 1. Option A – status quo: this option is summarised in paragraphs 6 to 10. Essentially shares are taxed when they are acquired by an employee (or trust), even if they have not yet been earned or they are subject to an arrangement that protects employees from suffering an economic loss if the share price declines. Options are taxed on exercise. In both cases, the assessable income is the market value of the shares at the time they are acquired (including through the exercise of an option), less any amount paid for them. 2. Option B – tax employee on grant: this would involve taxing an employee on the value of the arrangement when they enter into it. For example, when an option is granted to an employee or when an employee is promised shares under an ESS if they perform services for a certain period of time. 3. Option C – tax employee when the shares vest: this involves taxing employees when they have done everything they have to do to earn the shares and they hold them on (essentially) the same basis as other shareholders (including not having any protection from suffering an economic loss if the share price declines). Under this option, employees are taxable on the market value of the shares at the time they vest, less any amount they pay for the shares. Consistent with existing law, options would be taxed when they are exercised (even if the options themselves have vested at an earlier date). The assessable income would be the market value of the shares at the time they are acquired through the exercise of the option, less any amount paid for them. 4. Option C2 – same as Option C above, but tax options when they vest, not when they are exercised. An option vests when an employee has done everything they have to do to earn it and it can no longer be forfeited. An option may vest some time before it is (or is able to be) exercised. Under this option, the assessable income would be equal to the value of the option on the date it vests, estimated using an option valuat ion model (such as the Black-Scho les-Merton model), rather than when the option is exercised on the value of the shares at that time less any amount paid for them. 5. Option D – tax employee when they sell the shares: tax could be imposed on shares at the time they are sold. The assessable income would be equal to the proceeds of sale less any amount the employees paid to acquire the shares. This means employees will have the cash to pay the tax and the market value will be more easily established. 9 Table 1 - Taxing employees’ income Neutrality Equity Minimises compliance costs Minimises administrative costs Integrity Assessment against main objective Fiscal impact Option A – status quo ESS benefits taxed differently from cash salary and other in-kind benefits. Taxation of shares at grant is not consistent with taxation of options on exercise. ESS benefits are often tax advantaged. Significant compliance costs associated with uncertainty of the law.

Valuation issues and tracking vesting may increase compliance costs for some segments of the market. These costs will largely fall on businesses. We do not expect start-up companies to face significantly higher compliance costs as a result of this option. Better than the status quo The law will be clearer and more certain, which reduces administrative costs.

The options we considered are as follows: 1. Option A – status quo: no specific statutory deduction, but employers generally structure their ESS to achieve a deduction. Deductions are generally achieved by the employer (a) paying employees a deductible bonus which is used to buy the shares (or repay a loan used to buy the shares); (b) making a payment to an ESS trust which is used to buy shares for the employees; or (c) making a “recharge” payment to a parent company to procure the parent company to provide shares to the subsidiary company’s employees. Deductions are for the actual cash costs incurred and are generally deductible when paid (although in some cases the payment may be spread over the term of the ESS or deductible on a deferred basis). 2. Option B – matching deduction: emplo yers would be ent it led to a statutory deduction equal in timing and quantum to the employees’ income. 3. Option C – following International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS): IFRS requires companies to recognise an expense association with the provision of options or shares under an ESS. The expense is generally calculated at the date of grant and spread over the term of the ESS. 11 Table 2 - Allowing deductions for employers’ costs Neutrality Equity Minimises compliance costs Minimises administrative costs Integrity Assessment against main objective Fiscal impact Option A – status quo The provision of ESS benefits may be non- deductible. If they are deductible, the deduction does not generally match the employees’ income. This is inconsistent with the way the cost of cash salary and wages are treated. The lack of statutory deduction for ESS benefits means employers are disadvantaged vis-à- vis paying cash salary. To achieve deductions they have to incur costs to structure around this issue.

Rules around employment remuneration not coherent. Does not meet the main objective Likely to significantly reduce revenue 12 Tax concessions for widely-offered schemes 43. The options we considered are as follows: 1. Option A – status quo: complex legislation allowing shares to be provided tax-free to employees so long as they pay no more than $2,340 to buy them over a three year period and all employees are entitled to participate on an equal basis. A number of other criteria must be met. Employers are entitled to a deemed deduction equal to 10% of any loans provided to employees to purchase shares under a qualifying scheme. Currently employers are able to claim unintended deductions for amounts contributed to trusts to purchase shares. 2. Option B – repeal tax concessions for widely-offered schemes: remove tax exempt schemes – all employee share schemes treated the same for tax purposes. 3. Option C – retain and modernise widely-offered schemes: as well as improving some of the ambiguous drafting, the current limit on the amounts employees can pay for their shares could be increased to take account of inflation since the threshold was last increased. In addit ion: a. the scheme could be relaxed so it only has to be offered to 90% of employees (rather than 100%); b. an upper limit would need to be placed on the exempt benefit to employees; c. the deemed interest deduction should be removed; d. it should be made clear that any deduction for the cost of providing shares under the scheme is to be denied; e. the legislation could clearly state that a loan is only mandatory to the extent that employees have to pay something for the shares; and f. the requirement for the scheme to be “approved” by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) should be replaced by a registration requirement. 13 Table 3 – Tax concessions for widely-offered schemes Neutrality Equity Minimises compliance costs Minimises administrative costs Integrity Assessment against main objective Fiscal impact Option A – status quo ESS benefits are exempt from tax, whereas comparable salary is not.

Consultation is an important part of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Tax policy officials undertook numerous discussions with stakeholders before releasing an issues paper for formal public consultation. Submitters had six weeks to submit on the issues paper. Twenty seven submissions were received. Thirteen were from corporates, seven were from industry bodies and seven were from professional services firms. After submissions were received, officials met with a number of submitters to discuss their submissions. As a result of submissions, it became apparent there were specific issues that would benefit from further consultation. Officials released a subsequent consultation letter and allowed a further four weeks for submissions. During this time, officials again met with a number of submitters to help inform their further submissions. Eighteen further submissions were received. Six were from corporates, three were from industry bodies and nine were from professional services firms. The analysis of options to improve the framework for taxing ESS was significantly informed by submissions received. 45. As an overall observation, submitters were not generally in favour of the proposals to change the tax treatment of ESS benefits in the hands of emplo yees. This is to be expected. Some submitters have argued that the reforms tax capital gains. While ESS benefits might sometimes look like capital gains because employees are being paid in shares, the reality is that this is just another form of employment income and should be taxed as such. The proposals isolate employment income and tax that. They ensure that all employment income is treated the same and will reduce opportunities to substitute non-taxable gains for taxable salary. The proposals do not prevent employees from ever being able to hold their shares on capital account and receive gains tax-free. They simply ensure that employees are taxed on the value of the shares they receive when those shares are payment in-kind for services. Once the employee owns the shares like any other investor they can derive tax-free capital gains. 46. Some submitters also advocated for a concessionary framework, rather than the neutral tax framework described above. For the reasons already explained, we did not support a concessionary framework. 47. Submitters were generally in favour of providing a statutory deduction for providing ESS benefits, but some disagreed with the proposed basis for those deductions. 48. As a result of consultation, officials made a number of changes to the proposals including: a. recommending retaining and modernising the widely-offered tax exempt schemes – based on concerns about compliance costs; b. clarifying when the new rules will and will not apply to common commercial structures – based on some confusion about the border between holding shares as an employee and holding them just like any other shareholder; and c. extending the transitional/grandparenting arrangements – to address concerns that the proposed transitional arrangements were not long enough for companies to implement new arrangements and to take account of longer terms schemes. 49. Based on feedback from submitters, we have also recommended considering a second stage of ESS reforms to consider whether it is feasible and desirable to design a start-up deferral regime which would address issues of cash flow and liquidity for early stage companies. 15 50. Tax policy officials consulted with other government agencies – specifically The Treasury, a number of units within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and Callaghan Innovation. 51. Tax policy officials also contacted officials in Australia, the United Kingdom and South Africa to gain insights into the way they tax ESS. This has provided us with some useful guidance in terms of areas where New Zealand’s rules are consistent with the treatment in those jurisdictions and where we recommend deliberately departing from the approach in other jurisdictions for so me reason – for example, because our tax policy settings are different (for example, we do not have a comprehensive capital gains tax) or because there are particular aspects of the laws of these jurisdictions that officials report are problematic. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 52. Based on the analysis above, the table below summarises the conclusions of the regulatory impact analysis.

In summary, the proposed package involves aligning the taxing point of ESS with when the employee has earned the shares and generally holds them like other shareholders, allowing employers a matching deduction and modernising the widely-offered tax-exempt schemes. 54. It is difficult to quantify the direction or size of the fiscal impacts from this combined package relative to baseline estimates since there is no New Zealand data on the amount of inco me fro m ESS. However, on balance the proposals are expected to raise revenue of $30 million per annum once fully phased in. IMPLEMENTATION 55. The preferred options will primarily require changes to the ITA. 56. Officials recommend any legislative changes be included in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in early 2017 and should generally apply, unless otherwise stated, from enactment. 57. Transitional rules are very important to ensuring the reforms are fair and give companies and employees an opportunity to update their schemes. However, there is also a need to prevent opportunities for tax structuring. We consulted extensively on transitional rules as part of the consultation on the policy proposals. 58. In broad terms, the transitional rules proposed give companies six months post- enactment where the old law still applies, so they can update their schemes with the benefit of looking at finalised legislation. 59. Specifically, for ESS benefits issued in the ordinary course, there will be: a. open-ended grandparenting for ESS existing before the issues paper was released in May 2016 if there is a taxing point under the existing law (the “old taxing point”) before the 6 month period ends; and b. grandparenting for other schemes where the old taxing point falls within that 6 month period and the new taxing point occurs before a sunset date of 1 April 2022. 60. The transitional rules have been designed to minimise compliance costs for businesses and employees in moving to the new rules. 61. Otherwise the new rules should apply from the date of enactment. 17 62. When introduced into Parliament, a commentary on the bill will be released explaining the amendments and further explanation of their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 63. Inland Revenue will administer the proposed changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. 64. Inland Revenue has completed an impact assessment of the policy proposal and is confident that it has the capacity to provide the administrative measures necessary to implement these reforms. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 65. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. 66. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 67. Because there is no quantitative data on the use of ESS to provide remuneration, it will not be possible to judge the effect of the proposals either on the amount of ESS benefits provided in the economy or on the amount of tax collected on ESS benefits. 18
2 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template Status quo Current tax and transfer settings Personal income tax 1. Ideally, a tax system should be designed to raise revenue as efficiently as possible while contributing to distributional objectives. New Zealand is generally regarded as having a relatively efficient and ‘low distortion’ tax system as it is broad-based with relatively low rates. 2. Personal income tax is levied using a progressive rate structure from 10.5% up to 33%. Table 1 shows the rate structure. Table 1: Structure of personal income tax rates Bracket ($) Rate 1-14,000 10.5% 14,001-48,000 17.5% 48,001-70,000 30% 70,001+ 33% 3. Personal taxes are not indexed for inflation or wage growth. Rates and thresholds were last changed in October 2010. Tax credits 4. The progressive rate structure is supported by social assistance through tax credits delivered via the tax system. These consist of payments made either weekly, fortnightly or in lump sum at the end of the year administered by Inland Revenue. Table 2 shows the suite of credits.

Working for Families tax credits provide targeted assistance to increase family income to support families to raise their children and provide incentives to move off benefits and into work. This is achieved through a combination of conditions on entitlement and income thresholds above which entitlement begins to abate. Payment rates are automatically revised to increase the degree of targeting when prices have increased by five percent since the last revision. 6. Some families are entitled to multiple credits (for example, the Family Tax Credit and In-Work Tax Credit). However, only the Family Tax Credit is available to beneficiaries. Benefits 7. The benefit system has three tiers of assistance: • The first tier is the main benefits, providing a basic income for people who are not able to support themselves through paid work, which are income tested (except for the Emergency Benefit and Jobseeker Support Student Hardship which are both income and cash asset tested). • The second tier is additional assistance paid to people in particular situations or with on-going costs. For example, low-income people may be eligible for the assistance whether or not they receive a main benefit. This tier of assistance is mostly subject to income testing and may be subject to cash asset testing. This tier of benefits includes the Accommodation Supplement which is discussed further below. • The third tier is both income and cash asset tested and provided generally to people in hardship (whether on benefit or not) as one-off grants such as Special Needs Grands or may continue over a relatively short period. Such assistance includes the Temporary Additional Support which is discussed further below. Housing assistance 8. Further assistance is provided in the form of targeted accommodation subsidies. The Accommodation Supplement is paid to eligible private renters, boarders and homeowners. Maximum levels of assistance (maxima) are set for different areas. As with Working for Families, the supplement is abated as income increases. 9. The maxima and areas were most recently updated in 2006, based on 2003 rents. Unlike Working for Families, the Accommodation Supplement is not indexed. 10. Eligible people in social housing pay an Income-Related Rent which limits the amount of rent that low-income tenants pay to no more than 25 percent of their net income. This rental payment is then topped up by the Income-Related Rent Subsidy paid to the registered housing provider (Housing New Zealand or a Community Housing Provider) which covers the balance between the tenant’s rental payment and the market rent of the property. This subsidy abates much more steeply with income than the Accommodation Supplement. 11. Temporary Additional Support is also available for those who cannot meet essential living costs from their income and other resources. While available for a maximum of 13 weeks, clients with ongoing shortfalls may reapply. Temporary Additional Support abates dollar-for-dollar as income increases. Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template | 5 Fiscal strategy 12. Tax changes must be considered as part of the Government’s wider fiscal strategy. The Government has stated the following as shorter-term priorities: • maintaining rising OBEGAL surpluses over the forecast period so that cash surpluses are generated and net debt begins to reduce in dollar terms; • reducing net debt to around 20 percent of GDP in 2020; • if economic and fiscal conditions allow, beginning to reduce income taxes; and • using any further fiscal headroom to reduce net debt faster. 13. The fiscal strategy also includes long-term fiscal objectives for the next ten years, including to reduce net debt to within a range of 0 to 20 per cent of GDP. Future operating surpluses and operating revenues need to be consistent with this objective. 14. A family incomes package will impact on the fiscal outlook, including on the Crown’s operating balance, revenues, expenses and net debt. As such, it needs to be consistent with the fiscal strategy. Packages considered had a fiscal cost in the range of $1-3 billion per annum, which was expected to be most likely to be consistent with the fiscal strategy. Problems with current tax and transfer settings Work incentives 15. Personal income tax rates were last changed in 2010. Since that time, median income has increased from $40,000 to $48,000. 1 Incomes across the distribution have also increased. 2 16. As incomes increase, the marginal tax rates individuals face also increase. This has the effect of weakening work incentives by reducing the rewards of extra work received by the worker. High Marginal Tax Rates (MTRs) can also encourage people to structure their affairs to reduce their tax obligations. 17. In particular, where the median income earner in 2010 faced a MTR of 17.5 percent, they now face 30 percent. New Zealand’s labour force participation rate is relatively high. However, if income tax thresholds are not adjusted periodically, work incentives could be diminished over time. 18. The interaction of tax and targeted transfers means some taxpayers face abating assistance. Abatement can push effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) considerably higher than statutory MTRs. This reduces the rewards of extra work even further. 1 Statistics NZ: Earnings for people in paid employment. 2 Ministry of Social Development: Household Incomes in New Zealand: trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2015. 6 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template 19. Around 11 percent of individuals face EMTRs higher than 33 percent. 3 Once entitlements are fully abated, EMTRs will return to statutory tax rates. This suggests high EMTRs, and so poor work incentives, will generally affect those on low to middle incomes. 20. Table 3 provides a decomposition of EMTRs for individuals with income between $14,000 and $60,000. Table 3: EMTR decomposition for the $14,000 to $60,000 taxable income range Those having: $14k - $48k taxable income $48k - $60k taxable income EMTR Number of individuals EMTR Number of individuals No transfers abating 17.5 520,000 30 244,000 Independent Earner Tax Credit abating 30.5 89,000 - - Working for Families abating 40 68,000 52.5 32,000 Accommodation Supplement abating 42.5 44,000 55 \*suppressed Working for Families and Accommodation Supplement abating 65 16,000 77.5 13,000 Note: Excludes benefits, student loans repayments and ACC 21. Over time, high MTRs may cause problems for New Zealand in maintaining its tax base, enhancing its productivity and maintaining or improving its living standards. 3 Modelled using Taxwell. Abatement parameters considered include Independent Earner Tax Credit, Working for Families, and the Accommodation Supplement. Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template | 7 Reducing financial hardship 22. The tax and transfer system is highly redistributive and is designed to provide assistance to those in financial hardship. Average incomes at each decile have grown since 2010, as shown in Table 4 below. Table 4: Real equivalised household incomes: decile boundaries (2015 dollars) P10 P20 P30 P40 P50 median P60 P70 P80 P90 2010 17,029 20,710 25,846 29,747 34,042 39,157 45,260 53,015 66,919 2011 16,332 20,249 24,200 28,455 32,943 38,411 45,778 54,129 69,551 2012 17,678 21,211 25,908 29,955 33,538 39,289 46,335 55,402 70,824 2013 17,805 21,368 26,045 30,078 34,224 41,713 48,714 56,117 71,611 2014 17,897 21,395 26,110 30,869 35,874 42,325 49,240 59,496 75,878 2015 18,608 22,605 27,143 31,993 36,625 42,503 49,296 58,876 74,707 Source: Ministry of Social Development: Household Incomes in New Zealand: trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2015 23. However, increases in the cost of housing have in some cases outstripped income growth. As a result, some groups have seen declines in after-housing-costs, or ‘residual,’ income over the last ten years particularly in some geographic areas. 4 24. Recipients of the Accommodation Supplement have seen their residual incomes fall on average by eight percent since 2006. Some groups, such as beneficiaries, have seen steeper declines. Around 40 percent (approximately 120,000) of recipients spend more than half of their income on housing costs. This indicates housing-related stress. Objectives 25. Changes to personal taxes and transfers involve trade-offs among key objectives of: efficiency/growth, equity, fiscal integrity, ease of compliance/administration, and fiscal cost. There is no perfect or optimal tax and transfer system, and any tax structure will incorporate value judgments. The Government’s main objectives for the Budget 2017 package are: • improving work incentives; and • improving incomes for those in financial hardship. The Government also has a secondary objective of simplifying the system where possible. 4 Ministry of Social Development: Household Incomes in New Zealand: trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2015 8 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template 26. To achieve the stated objectives, a set of criteria has been established to assess the options. These are: • Impact on work incentives/employment outcomes: the extent to which the option will promote incentives (or remove disincentives) to take up and enter employment, or to increase the number of hours worked, with a focus on helping lower and middle income earners. • Impact on residual incomes: Low equivalised 5 residual income is used as the primary indicator of financial hardship. This measures income after housing costs and is adjusted for the size of the household supported by the income. Although not a perfect measure of hardship, the residual income measure recognises that housing costs are a significant proportion of most budgets, and similar quality housing can vary in cost among different areas. It therefore more closely resembles the resources available to a household to purchase other necessities than measures that focus solely on income. • Administrative complexity: A secondary consideration is improving ease of administration where there are no or minor impacts on the above criteria and cost. 27. Other key considerations within the context of this package were: • how quickly a package could take effect – Ministers expressed a strong preference towards options that could be fully implemented within a year of Budget 2017; and • the cost of a package – the fiscal range for the full package was $1-$3 billion per year for the forecast period. Options and impact analysis Options considered 28. As previously mentioned, options considered for inclusion in Budget 2017 were limited to those that could feasibly be implemented in the short term and were consistent with the fiscal strategy. Non-regulatory responses were not considered feasible and were not analysed further. 29. The broad options identified were: • changes to tax thresholds; • reprioritising Independent Earner Tax Credit; and • increasing targeted assistance. 30. The list of options was narrowed through discussion with Ministers with reference to the objectives to allow more thorough exploration of preferred options. Tax thresholds 5 Equivalisation is a process that adjusts income to reflect the needs of the household it supports. For example, if a two-person household and a five-person household both have taxable incomes of $50,000, the former will have a higher equivalised income than the latter. Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template | 9 Table 5: Multi-criteria analysis – tax thresholds Objective Consistent? Recommended? Improves work incentives Very consistent Yes Improves incomes for those in financial hardship Consistent Simplifies the system Neutral 31. Options for adjusting tax thresholds were presented, with a focus on alleviating work disincentives caused by the 30 percent rate for middle-income earners, and improving incentives to enter work. Analysis indicates modest labour supply increases and that at least 1.4 million families would benefit from the adjustments. However, it is recognised that targeted payments would likely have a larger impact on income adequacy. 32. While changes to tax rates could be used to improve work incentives, they are less well targeted than threshold changes. That is, to alleviate pressure on the same target group, rate changes are more costly, with more spill-over benefits for higher income earners, than threshold changes. Rate changes were considered a less effective means of achieving the same objectives as threshold changes, and were not explored further. Reprioritising Independent Earner Tax Credit Table 6: Multi-criteria analysis – reprioritising Independent Earner Tax Credit Objective Consistent? Recommended? Improves work incentives Consistent Yes Improves incomes for those in financial hardship Consistent Simplifies the system Very consistent 33. The Independent Earner Tax Credit provides up to $520 per annum to around 500,000 individuals earning between $24,000 and $48,000 that do not receive a benefit, Working for Families or superannuation. The credit can be claimed each week or in full at the end of the year. It costs around $220 million per annum. 34. The credit was introduced in 2009 as a means for increasing incentives for participation in the workforce by targeting those just below the full-time minimum wage at the time. However, wage growth since then means the credit is poorly targeted. It is likely improving work incentives could more effectively be achieved by removing the credit and using the savings to make other changes to tax and transfer settings. 10 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template 35. Analysis indicates marginal impacts on labour supply if the credit were to be removed. While there is a small, positive labour supply impact for recipients, there is an offsetting negative impact as the credit abates, pushing EMTRs up to 30.5 – from 17.5 – percent for those with incomes between $44,000 and $48,000. In addition, nearly two-thirds of recipients receive the credit as a lump sum, indicating a low degree of recipient hardship. 36. Removing the Independent Earner Tax Credit would remove a complex layer of entitlement and abatement from the tax system, simplifying its administration. Increasing targeted assistance 37. Targeted payments are likely to have greater impact on income adequacy than tax rate or threshold changes for a given cost. However, there are several delivery options for targeting these payments. These are discussed below. 38. Government transfers inherently reduce incentives to work for some recipients. The degree to which those incentives are reduced will vary depending on design; some transfers will provide greater disincentives than others. Increasing main benefits Table 7: Multi-criteria analysis – increasing main benefits Objective Consistent? Recommended? Improves work incentives Very inconsistent No Improves incomes for those in financial hardship Consistent Simplifies the system Neutral 39. Increases to main benefits 6 are strongly targeted to those on the very lowest incomes, but not necessarily to those with low residual incomes. However, more-than-modest increases to benefits are likely to reduce work incentives. 6 Main benefits include Jobseeker Support, Sole Parent Support, the Supported Living Payment, and Youth and Young Parent Payments. Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template | 11 Increasing Accommodation Supplement Table 8: Multi-criteria analysis – increasing Accommodation Supplement Objective Consistent? Recommended? Improves work incentives InconsistentYes Improves incomes for those in financial hardship Very consistent Simplifies the system Neutral 40. Accommodation Supplement is strongly targeted to those with low residual incomes; the incidence of low residual incomes is nearly five times higher among recipients than non-recipients. The most support is provided to those with the highest housing costs. 41. The average Accommodation Supplement recipient spends more than half their family income on housing, and the proportion of recipients receiving the maxima has increased from 24 to 44 percent since 2006. Housing costs above the maxima, which were last adjusted in 2005, are unsubsidised and borne completely by the recipient. This indicates that increases to the maxima will tend to strongly target those in financial hardship. 42. Although work incentives are likely to be reduced in total, beneficiary recipients stand to gain from moving into employment as support for non-beneficiaries is withdrawn more slowly than for beneficiaries. In addition, increases in the supplement will tend to reduce the use of Temporary Additional Support – which abates more steeply with income – further improving work incentives. The Accommodation Supplement effectively lowers the relative price of employment, and could be expected to promote greater supply of labour than main benefits for a given level of assistance. 43. Although “landlord capture” is a risk, the evidence for this phenomenon is mixed. Rent subsidies are not unique in this respect; landlord capture is a possibility for any targeted transfer. Increasing or better targeting childcare payments Table 9: Multi-criteria analysis – childcare payments Objective Consistent? Recommended? Improves work incentives Unclear No Improves incomes for those in financial hardship Unclear Simplifies the system Neutral 12 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template 44. Increasing or better targeting childcare payments may reduce barriers to labour force participation for those with children. While early childhood education (ECE affordability) has been declining since the introduction of 20 Hours ECE in 2007, it still remains more affordable relative to income than it was prior to the introduction of this policy. The cost of ECE does not seem to be a barrier to labour market participation, as ECE enrolment and participation levels have been increasing over recent years Aligning Family Tax Credit rates Table 10: Multi-criteria analysis – aligning Family Tax Credit rates Objective Consistent? Recommended? Improves work incentives Unclear Yes Improves incomes for those in financial hardship Consistent Simplifies the system Consistent 45. This option would raise payment rates for families with children under 16 by increasing rates for children under 16 to align with rates for children 16-18. Alignment would support working families as well as beneficiary families. Working for Families is less strongly targeted to those with low incomes than the Accommodation Supplement. Where 90 percent of Accommodation Supplement recipients have incomes less than $30,000, more than half of Working for Families recipients have incomes greater than $30,000. 46. Unlike the Accommodation Supplement, Family Tax Credit payment rates do not depend on housing costs. While it is not clear that the Family Tax Credit would target those with low residual incomes as well as the Accommodation Supplement, administrative data indicate that larger families, who are more likely to have multiple children under 16, are not correspondingly higher-income and accordingly are at greater risk of financial hardship. Benefits from raising rates for families with children under 16 will tend to accrue to those families and alleviate financial hardship. 47. It is difficult to assess the impact on work incentives in the presence of tax cuts without modelling specific combinations.

This option would replace the In-Work Tax Credit formula, which depends on family income and the number of dependent children, with a single rate for all recipients. The total impact depends on where the base payment is set relative to the status quo. To the extent that large families are compensated through raising the base payment there may be a positive labour supply effect for smaller families, although this would reduce targeting of low residual incomes relative to the Family Tax Credit and raise costs. If the payment is not raised, large families would be disadvantaged and their work incentives worsened. Further analysis 49. Four options were selected for further analysis: • changes to tax thresholds; • removing Independent Earner Tax Credit; • increasing Accommodation Supplement; and • aligning Family Tax Credit rates. 50. No single option considered can satisfactorily advance all of the policy objectives; each presents trade-offs. Removing the Independent Earner Tax Credit will worsen work incentives for those receiving full entitlement while improving them for those facing high EMTRs through abatement. Increasing the Accommodation Supplement and Family Tax Credit rates will alleviate financial hardship but worsen work incentives for recipients. Changes to tax thresholds will improve work incentives but do little to improve incomes for beneficiaries in financial hardship. Accordingly, the final package will comprise a combination of the above options reflecting the Government’s preferred balance of the objectives. 51. A number of packages with various combinations of the above were presented to Ministers to allow modelling resource to be prioritised where estimated impacts were most consistent with objectives. 52. Impacts from the changes were estimated using the Treasury’s microsimulation model, Taxwell. However, Taxwell is not able to accurately model the changes to the Accommodation Supplement. The labour supply impacts of the tax, Independent Earner Tax Credit and Family tax credit changes were modelled in aggregate using Taxwell, but we were not able to model the labour supply impacts of changes to the Accommodation Supplement. We expect the impact to be moderately negative for recipients. 53. The impacts on residual income of the tax, Independent Earner Tax Credit and Family Tax Credit changes were again modelled in aggregate using Taxwell. Presented alongside are estimates derived from MSD modelling of the changes to the Accommodation Supplement. However, the results from the two models cannot be combined. 14 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template 54. Analysis was conducted mainly in terms of families rather than individuals. This recognises that family income more accurately reflects the resources available to its members than any member’s own income. Note that the term family is used broadly for the purposes of this analysis. It comprises one adult, a partner (if any) and dependent children (if any). For example, five adults sharing a flat are considered five families, and a couple with one dependent child sharing their house with a boarder would be considered two families. 55. As with all models, Taxwell has some limitations that should be noted: • Only labour supply is modelled, not the demand side by firms. • The model estimates the long run response, not the adjustment through time. In reality, it takes time for workers to negotiate more/fewer hours of work or enter/exit the workforce. • There is no modelling of labour supply choices by self-employed people, retirees or their partners, full-time students or people with disabilities. • It assumes a fixed population (i.e., does not model migration or fertility rates) and fixed household composition. 56.

This package is expected to slightly exceed that estimate. Around ¾ of families (1.1 million) benefit from the changes to tax, IETC and FTC. The average gain is $27 per week. Nearly half (319,000) of all families with taxabl e incomes less than $48k gain, and 95 percent of families with incomes above $48k gain. The number of families facing losses cannot be distinguished from zero. Around 250,000 families benefit from increasing the AS maxima a nd reducing the co-pay. Nearly 80 percent of those that benefit have taxable incomes less than $3 1k. The average gain is $24.50 per week, although the largest gains tend to go to higher income families reflecting that higher income households are likely to have higher housing costs and be able to benefit most from changes to maxima. Around 2,000 families are expected to face average losses of $1 per we ek. Overall, residual incomes of AS recipient families will be on average six percent higher than i n 2006. However, single-person households without children would have incomes still very slightly lower ( on average) than in 2006. 2 To $18k To $52k     1.85 The tax and FTC changes are estimated to increase hours worked by around 0.3 percent. Removing the IETC will marginally reduce this. Around ¾ of families (1.2 million) benefit from the changes to tax, IETC and FTC. The average gain is $19 per week. More than half (362,000) of families with taxable incomes less than $48k gain, and 96 percent of families with income above $48k gain. The number of families facing losses is around 202,000, with average losses of $5 per week. Around 250,000 families benefit from increasing the maxima and reducing the co-pay. Nearly 80 percent of those that benefit have taxable incomes less than $31k.

Around half (349,000) of families with taxable income s less than $48k gain, and around 97 percent of families with incomes above $48k gain. The number of families facing a loss is around 227,000 with average losses of $7 per week. Around 250,000 families benefit from increasing the maxima and reducing the co-pay. Nearly 80 percent of those that benefit have taxable incomes less than $31k. The average gain is $24.50 per week, although the largest gains tend to go to higher income families reflecting that higher income households are likely to have higher housing costs and be able to benefit most from changes to maxima. Around 2,000 families are expected to face average losses of $1.00 per week. Overall, residual incomes of AS recipient families will be on average six percent higher than i n 2006.

Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template | 17 Impacts of final package 57. Ministers selected Package 6a as providing the preferred balance of objectives. Options for scaling and phasing components of the package were sought to ensure the package would remain within the fiscal envelope. The Accommodation Supplement increase was set to the 40 th percentile of 2016 rents. The package and its variations were subject to further analysis. 58. The overall impacts of the final package are very similar to those presented in Table 11 above and are discussed below. Labour Supply 59. Hours worked are estimated to reduce in total. However, this result is dominated by the negative labour supply impact of increases to the Accommodation Supplement and Family Tax Credit for recipients. For a much larger number of non-recipients the labour supply impact is positive. Residual Incomes 60. The tax, Independent Earner Tax Credit and Family Tax Credit changes benefit around 1.3 million families, who on average gain $26 per week. The Accommodation Supplement changes improve residual incomes for around 136,000 families, who on average gain $35 per week. This lifts around 14,000 families out of what the Ministry of Social Development considers is severe housing stress. 9 61. A small number of families (around 4,500) are estimated to lose around $1.50 per week as a result of the changes. These losses arise from: • abatement changes to the Family Tax Credit; • increases to the Accommodation Supplement ‘entry threshold’ as a result of increases to the Family Tax Credit; and • interactions between Temporary Additional Support and the Disability Allowance. Aggregate Impacts 62. We have not modelled impacts at the macroeconomic level. The overall economic impact will depend primarily on: • the relative impacts on GDP of the increased labour supply induced by the tax changes and the decreased labour supply induced by the transfers; and • the extent to which GDP increases as a result of reduced influence of tax in resource allocation. 9 Defined as having equivalised residual income less than $180 per week. 18 | Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template 63. Identifying these impacts would require assumptions over the value of output produced through the extra hours worked, the value of output foregone through hours no longer worked, and the value of activities not being performed that will be after the changes are implemented. Those assumptions would be very difficult to produce credibly. Finally, these impacts are unlikely to be immediate and we are unable to allocate them to time periods with confidence. Consultation 64. The Ministry of Social Development contributed to the development of this package. 65. Due to the need for Budget secrecy, and the short timeframes involved in developing a family incomes package for Budget 2017, the ability to consult in the usual manner has been severely constrained. However, policy responses to the issues raised have been widely debated in the public sphere. Conclusions and recommendations 66. As previously noted, there is no perfect or optimal tax and transfer system. Changes to personal taxes and transfers involve trade-offs among key objectives of efficiency/growth, equity, fiscal integrity, ease of compliance/administration, and fiscal cost. 67. The packages discussed in the preceding pages comprising changes to tax thresholds, the Independent Earner Tax Credit, Family Tax Credit and the Accommodation Supplement, will, relative to the status quo: • improve work incentives; • improve incomes for those in financial hardship; and • simplify the system. 68. Accordingly, the packages are consistent with the stated objectives. However, the direction of the final package is shaped by the relative importance placed on these objectives and is a question of value judgements. Implementation plan 69. This package will be announced at Budget 2017. The components of the preferred option will be implemented from 1 April 2018. 70. Inland Revenue has advised that, with additional funding, it can implement the tax, Working for Families and Independent Earner Tax Credit changes. The costs are being worked through. These costs include systems changes and education and marketing to notify those taxpayers, tax credit recipients and third party withholders (for example, employers and banks) affected by the changes. Regulatory Impact Analysis: Regulatory Impact Statement - Overview of Required Information - Template | 19 71. The Ministry of Social Development will require $3.9 million to implement the proposed Budget package. This includes implementing changes to the AS regions and the maxima as well as consequential changes from the proposed changes to the Family Tax Credit and tax thresholds (to ensure that the IT system that administers the welfare system calculates payments and debts correctly). This funding would cover the cost of the systems changes that would be required as well as a project team to manage the implementation, staff training, communications and stakeholder management, changes to operational documents, and post-implementation support. Monitoring, evaluation and review 72. There are no plans to specifically and separately monitor, evaluate or review the proposed family incomes package for Budget 2017. The post-implementation phase of the Generic Tax Policy Process will help in identifying and addressing any remedial issues post-Budget.

Regulatory Impact Statement Inform ation sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis o f options to enable Inland Revenue and the Ministry o f Social Development to continue the current sharing o f information and extend the information shared to the provision o f housing and verification o f students and their parent’s income for student allowance purposes. Information sharing agreements between government agencies require the privacy o f individuals to be considered and balanced against the need for government agencies to provide efficient, high quality services. The agencies have been working together to assess options to enable a more efficient sharing o f information that allows sharing with a broader purpose, reducing multiple requests for the same information and time delays in the provision o f benefits and entitlements to the public. Consultation has been undertaken with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Ministry o f Social Development, Treasury, and Data Futures Partnership. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. Public consultation has been carried out and seven submissions have been received. The concerns from submissions have been considered in the assessment o f the recommended option. The Privacy Commissioner is comfortable with the proposals presented under the recommended policy option and has expressed full support to its implementation. The assessed options will not incur significant additional costs to the agencies. It is difficult to determine the number o f people who may be impacted by the proposals but it is envisaged the recommended policy option will continue to provide the benefits generated by the current Memoranda o f Understanding and will provide additional benefits to the agencies and their customers in the form of efficiency gains and better service provision. None o f the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for business to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Keith Taylor Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 February 2017 1 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The Government has set out its commitment to reforms that ensure the public sector takes a more collaborative, cross-agency approach to supporting New Zealanders and gaining efficiencies. To achieve these results, government agencies will need to work together to better use their resources, and it becomes essential that they are able to efficiently share information with each other. Government agencies must be trusted to share only when appropriate and handle private information respectfully with transparent processes. 2. The Ministry o f Social Development and Inland Revenue have common customers and have been sharing information about these customers since 1994. Over the years information has been shared for specific purposes by way o f specific amendments to the tax legislation. These specific purposes under different legislative provisions have resulted in multiple requests for the same information and time delays in the provision o f benefits and entitlements to the public. 3. Existing exchanges between the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue enable: • the administration of shared services (such as Working for Families tax credits, child support, and student loans); • improved service to joint customers (such as proof o f identity at the Ministry of Social Development on behalf o f Inland Revenue); and • the prevention and detection o f fraud (such as income and relationship information from Inland Revenue to the Ministry of Social Development). 4. Each sharing activity is governed by its own Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU). These are very prescriptive and contain inconsistent operational aspects such as data handling and use o f the information. Even though the current sharing o f information between the agencies has been providing numerous benefits to both agencies across a range o f services, the improvements are limited by the specific purposes o f the information sharing, which do not allow the agencies to gain further efficiencies and provide a better experience for the customers interacting with them. In addition, the agreements are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to amend. 5. The existing MoUs have very specific purpose provisions, which restrict what the information can be used for. This may affect the agency’s ability to correctly determine entitlement to benefits and subsidies, result in multiple requests being made to Inland Revenue for the same information, or delay payments due to the need for evidence to be provided. The following examples illustrate some o f the situations where this can occur: a. Currently, the Ministry o f Social Development receives income information for the purposes o f determining entitlement to main benefits. This income information, once verified with the customer, would also be useful in determining entitlement to social housing, but because o f the prescriptive nature o f the existing agreements, this income information cannot be used for other purposes. b. A customer applies to the Ministry o f Social Development for a benefit and must provide verification o f their IRD number but some customers do not have this in their possession. Currently, the customer has to go to Inland Revenue to get verification o f their IRD number. Under the Student Loan Scheme, Inland Revenue is able to verify IRD numbers in near real-time. If the purpose of the existing IRD number verification system were to be expanded in the future, the agencies would be able to verify IRD numbers for benefit applications, which would save time for customers, reduce their compliance costs and provide a better customer experience. 6. Research conducted by Inland Revenue and Victoria University o f Wellington1 indicates that New Zealanders are generally supportive o f information sharing across government. They expect high standards o f management o f the information shared, and they expect their personal circumstances to be considered holistically. Information sharing between the Ministry o f Social Development and Inland Revenue will only achieve further benefits if the agencies are trusted to share only when appropriate and handle private information respectfully with transparent processes. 7. For example, widening the purpose of the existing information sharing arrangements would enable information to be shared for assessing eligibility for social housing and student allowances. This would enable the Ministry o f Social Development to extend assistance to those who are most in need, and ensure people receive correct entitlements and benefits across a wider range o f the Ministry o f Social Development services than currently. 8. To address the issues in the examples above, there is the need for a change o f focus for information sharing, from agreements that share information for purposes o f determining an entitlement to a product type (such as child support or Working for Families), to one with a more generic purpose. 9. The generic purpose would change the way information can currently be used, and the oversight and safeguards that apply to these exchanges. This will enable information to be shared for the purpose o f determining an individual’s eligibility to benefits and subsidies provided by the two agencies, and for assessing tax obligations. 10. The recommended option should address these issues and enable agencies to move towards the goal o f making it easier for individuals to interact with government and to access the services they require. Scale of the problem 11. Inland Revenue shared approximately 7 million records with the Ministry of Social Development under the existing information sharing agreements during the 2015/16 year. This figure will include multiple records on a single person and often the same piece o f information being shared more than once for different purposes. 12. At the end o f 2016, there were approximately 193,000 people in Housing New Zealand houses2, and 297,000 working-age people receiving a main benefit3. In 2015, over 40,000 1 Professor Miriam Lips, Dr Elizabeth Eppel, Amanda Cunningham & Virginia Hopkins Bums, Public Attitudes to the Sharing of Personal Information in the Course o f Online Public Service Provision, Victoria University of Wellington, 2009. 2 https//www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/Social housing by the numbers.pdf (retrieved 8 February 2017) 3 https //www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/latest-quarterly- results/all-main-benefits.html (retrieved 8 February 2017) 3 4 https://w w w .m sd.govt.nz/about-m sd-and-our-w ork/publications-resources/statistics/studylink/student- allowance-ytd -12.html (retrieved 8 February 2017) 4 students 24 years old or younger were receiving a student allowance4. The number o f student allowance recipients to be affected by the recommended option is estimated to be over 30,000, but the estimated number o f social housing recipients to be affected is unknown. 13. While the number o f records to be shared for social housing has been negotiated to be a maximum o f 10,000 per month (due to operational constraints), the number of records proposed to be shared for student allowance is still unknown. It has been assumed that sharing information with a wider purpose will reduce the amount of information shared as it will avoid the current duplication. At the same time, the extension o f information shared to provide for student allowance and social housing will increase that amount again. The magnitude o f these opposing forces and the resulting impact is not known. 14. The aim o f sharing o f information for social housing purposes is to assist the proper allocation of social housing and to assist in calculating the correct rate of income-related rent the household may be required to pay for the property. This may result in a fiscal benefit or revenue savings. OBJECTIVES 15. The main objective is to deliver better outcomes for customers by enabling a more accurate and timely provision o f benefits and subsidies. 16. All the options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the following criteria: (a) Efficiency of compliance and administration - gain efficiencies through a more collaborative, cross-agency work in regards to common customers and the joint administration o f social policy, and provide better services to customers, reducing their compliance costs and delivering a better customer experience; (b) Fairness and integrity - maintain the integrity o f the tax and benefit systems, and ensure sufficient protection o f people’s privacy and a proper level o f security and transparency; (c) Sustainability of the public sector - provide a framework that is flexible enough to respond to Government’s priorities, and facilitate changes going forward. 17. Criterion (a) can potentially conflict with (b) if information is shared too widely or if robust security systems and processes are not established to protect people’s privacy. A balance must be reached between providing better public services and ensuring people’s information is adequately protected, so all objectives can be achieved without conflicting. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 18. Four options have been considered in this RIS: Option 1: Retain the status quo 5 Option 2: Create an Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under Part 9A o f the Privacy Act to amalgamate existing agreements and extend the information shared to social housing and verification o f students and their parent’s income for student allowance purposes. (preferred option) Option 3: Use the information sharing framework in section 81BA o f the Tax Administration Act to share information for housing assistance and verification o f students and their parent’s income for student allowance purposes. Option 4: Retain the current information sharing provisions and create a specific legislative amendment in the Tax Administration Act to allow information sharing for social housing and verification of students and their parent’s income for student allowance purposes. Option 1 19. Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 1 Main objective 20. Inland Revenue and the Ministry o f Social Development must work together closely to deliver the service improvements expected by government and customers and that requires information to be available more fluidly across organisational boundaries. This doesn’t currently happen under the status quo. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 21. There are efficiency gains that cannot be achieved under this option due to the limitations o f the current information sharing agreements, which are very prescriptive. Fairness and integrity 22. This option ensures sufficient protection o f people’s privacy and a proper level o f security and transparency. However, the benefits are limited and do not result in improvements in the integrity o f the tax and benefit systems. Although Inland Revenue shares information with the Ministry o f Social Development to ensure integrity o f benefits, information is not shared in relation to student allowance or social housing. Sustainability o f the public sector 23. This option is not future proof as it is not flexible enough to respond to the upcoming organisational changes, Government’s and customer’s expectations. Option 2 24. This option would create an AISA, which is a legal mechanism enabled under the Privacy Act 1993 authorising the sharing o f information between or within agencies (either from one agency to another or sharing by both agencies) for the purpose o f delivering efficient and effective public services. With this option the current legislation would be 6 amalgamated into one AISA and would operate under its authority. Also, the information shared would be extended to include information for assessing eligibility for social housing and student allowance. 25. AISAs set out how information is to be shared according to the requirements o f the Privacy Act. They also provide the necessary flexibility to enable efficient information sharing, and provide appropriate systems and processes to protect people’s privacy. 26. While AISAs do not apply for the sharing o f information between non-individuals, that does not cause any concerns as the information sharing considered in this RIS is entirely relating to individuals. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 2 Main objective 27. The AISA framework was created for the purpose o f delivering efficient and effective public services, so this approach to information sharing would provide easier and faster access to government services and reduced compliance costs for customers. 28. From a customer perspective, greater sharing o f customer information facilitated by the proposed AISA would, over time: • reduce the need for individuals to interact with agencies on multiple occasions or to provide duplicate information to government agencies; • make it easier for individuals to meet their obligations, thereby reducing adverse outcomes such as accumulating debt; and • meet evolving expectations o f the public to provide joined-up social services across government agencies. 29. This option meets the main objective. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 30. The AISA would continue the existing information sharing and provide a wider purpose for using the information. This would enable agencies to provide services more efficiently and effectively, by improving the timeliness and accuracy o f benefits and subsidies, and assisting the assessment o f tax obligations. It would reduce the administration costs associated with agencies sharing information, and create public confidence through the perception o f agencies’ efficiency in managing customer information - sharing the right information, in the right way, at the right time. It would also reduce compliance costs for customers as they would not be required to provide the same information multiple times. This is a significant improvement on the status quo. Fairness and integrity 31. The AISA clarifies and improves the rules around how agencies share personal information, while ensuring safeguards are in place to protect an individual’s privacy. It would provide certainty around the purpose o f information sharing, use of information, and management o f privacy risks; it can also modify privacy principles when justified. AISAs provide a transparent approach to sharing, as all agreements are made public and consultation is required for any agreement. This is an improvement on the status quo. Sustainability o f the public sector 32. An AISA is easier and faster to amend to include sharing of additional information and other agencies in comparison to the status quo process for changing legislation, providing a more future-proof framework for sharing information. 33. From a government and agency perspective, the wider scope of the agreement and having all information sharing under one agreement would, over time, contribute to the Government’s Better Public Service objectives of better service to New Zealanders, and provide a foundation on which to base future sharing o f information among the two agencies. 34. This is an improvement on the status quo. Option 3 35. This option consists o f making an Order in Council (OIC) under section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act to enable Inland Revenue to share information with the Ministry o f Social Development. 36. This option is similar to option 2 in that it enables information sharing to occur through an OIC. The advantages of this option are that it enables information sharing to be done under a means that is presently in use and it enables information to be shared about individuals as well as non-individuals. However, section 81BA is a one-way information sharing mechanism, from Inland Revenue to another agency, and therefore does not provide the ability for the Ministry of Social Development to disclose information to Inland Revenue.. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 3 Main objective 37. This option only partially meets the main objective because it only allows information to be shared in one way, from Inland Revenue to another agency. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 38. This option limits sharing to information that the agency already has the legal authority to collect. It also has the limitation o f being a one-way sharing. This will limit the compliance and administrative efficiencies that can be achieved with this option. This would be worse than the status quo. Fairness and integrity 39. This provision also contains protections for people’s privacy similar to option 2. Also consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and affected organisations is required before an OIC is made under this section. This is an improvement on the status quo. Sustainability o f the public sector 40. This is not a sustainable option because it is limited to one-way information sharing only. This is the same as the status quo. 7 8 Option 4 41. Under this option, the current information sharing provisions would remain and the Tax Administration Act would be amended to allow for Inland Revenue to share information with the Ministry o f Social Development for the specific purposes o f social housing and student allowance. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 4 Main objective 42. This option would not achieve the main objective because it would make new information sharing agreements for housing assistance and student allowance using the same framework as the status quo. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 43. No efficiency gains would be achieved under this option because it would maintain the status quo. Even though more information would be shared, this option would not provide the wider purpose necessary to achieve that, so is the same as the status quo. Fairness and integrity 44. This option has the advantage o f being the most transparent. The information sharing would face Parliamentary scrutiny and would be recorded in primary legislation. This is the same as the status quo. Sustainability o f the public sector 45. This is not a sustainable option because it does not provide the required flexibility going forward. This is the same as the status quo. CONSULTATION 46. Consultation has been undertaken with the Office o f the Privacy Commissioner, the Ministry o f Social Development, Treasury, and Data Futures Partnership. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. In addition, a discussion document and a draft AISA were made available for public consultation from 17 November to 16 December 2016. Submissions were invited through the Government Online Engagement Services, the Inland Revenue Tax Policy website database (which currently has over 6,500 subscribers), the Ministry o f Social Development database (which currently has over 1,100 subscribers), and a Ministerial press release. 47. During the consultation period, the website received 673 visits, resulting in three submissions. From the number o f people who received notification directly (over 7,600, either from Inland Revenue or the Ministry o f Social Development) another four written submissions were received. From these results it is reasonable to infer that most people did not find problems with the proposals and therefore did not take the time to make a submission. 48. The key concerns raised by submissions and the officials’ response to each o f them are as follows: a. Submitters questioned whether the driver for the extended information sharing is improving outcomes for customers by streamlining processes, or identifying fraud. Officials confirm that the additional information sharing has the aim o f improving processes for students applying for student allowances and identifying people in need o f social housing. While it is unavoidable that some additional fraud cases might be identified, this is not the purpose o f the reform. b. It was commented that the risk o f amalgamating numerous and diverse information sharing agreements into one AISA is that more information will be shared than is strictly necessary or appropriate, and the safeguards are not clearly stated in the AISA. Officials recognise that a privacy breach is clearly one of the risks associated with any information sharing proposal and, as such, requires careful management. The agencies have considered and assessed the risks associated with the proposals and have consulted with the Office o f the Privacy Commissioner, who has indicated they are comfortable with the proposals and support the development o f this AISA. In addition, before any information sharing can take place, agencies are required to have an operational agreement clearly describing the purpose o f sharing the information, as well as how information will be handled and the process to be followed in case o f privacy breach. A review and audit process is also outlined in the AISA and operational agreements. Officials consider the safeguards in the AISA address the submitters concerns. c. It was suggested that, whenever practicable, individual’s consent to the information sharing should be obtained and/or notification o f reuse o f information for different purposes should be sent. Although officials appreciate the concern raised, we note that customers applying for a benefit are notified o f the information sharing between agencies through the Privacy Statement included in the Ministry o f Social Development’s application forms. In addition, both the Privacy Act and the AISA allow modification o f the Privacy Principles relating to requirements to collect information direct from the individual (Privacy Principle 2) and the requirement not to disclose information (Privacy Principle 11), therefore allowing the sharing of information without seeking consent from individuals, which would not be practicable and negate some o f the benefits from sharing information. d. In relation to the objective of improving services provided by agencies, a submitter is not convinced that solely amalgamating current sharing agreements under one AISA will necessarily result in two agencies being able to provide services more efficiently, instead considering that efficiencies will arise as a result o f improved IT systems and processes. Officials consider that there is some efficiency to be gained through amalgamating current agreements and providing a more flexible legislative mechanism. For example, enabling the Ministry o f Social Development to re-use information obtained for one purpose to determine entitlement to another benefit will allow the individual to be assessed more holistically, removing the need for duplication o f information requests, which will ultimately result in more timely and efficient services. Officials agree with the submitter’s comments that further significant benefits will come from improved IT systems and processes which the AISA will enable. e. A submitter commented, that the information to be shared for student allowance purposes about an estranged parent who does not financially support the student can cause discomfort for the student concerned. They mention “it is a difficulty for the Ministry o f Social Development to know whether incomplete applications are 9 awaiting the completion o f such documentation or if they have been discontinued”. Officials note that, the Ministry would only match parental income of those considered a parent in line with legislation and only after consent is received from the appropriate parties. Legislatively, the student has until the end of their course o f study to complete their student allowance application, therefore the Ministry is unable to discontinue or close applications prior to this date. f. It was suggested making sure it is clear in the agreement what the purpose o f the information sharing is, ensuring it is clear that it is for operational functions and not intended to cover information for other purposes such as policy development, evaluation, research and statistics. However, officials currently use information shared for evaluation, statistical and policy development purposes under the exceptions to Privacy Principle 10 - limits on use o f personal information, in the Privacy Act. We consider that current exceptions to the Privacy Principle 10 should be retained in relation to the proposed AISA. g. A submitter was concerned that the term “domestic relationship” is too widely defined and could result in inappropriate sharing of information. They consider the term “family member o f the individual” should be defined. An example is where an adult who is made redundant applies for a “jobseeker support” and moves back to live with their parents. In this situation the definition o f “domestic relationship” should not include the parents. However, officials consider that the definition of domestic relationship in the AISA needs to be widely cast to cover all possible domestic relationships for benefit purposes. Although in the example those sharing accommodation should be excluded from the term “domestic relationship” for jobseeker support, for New Zealand Superannuation purposes sharing accommodation is taken into account in determining entitlement. The operational agreements between the two agencies will further define the term “domestic relationship” for each benefit type. h. Submitters also proposed minor drafting changes to the AISA to make a few points clearer and provide the readers with a better understanding, and improve trust in the information sharing by creating more transparency and accountability. Officials have considered these submissions and amended the AISA accordingly. 49. Generally, since the sharing o f information between the two agencies has been occurring for some time, submitters indicated more support than opposition to the proposals. In summary, there was support to the information sharing where there are clear benefits, and as long as there is a balance between the benefits, the safety of the information shared and consideration o f the individual’s privacy. It is recognised that the benefit will be realised from the AISA, whilst also safeguarding information. The AISA will also improve clarity, transparency and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 50. Information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry o f Social Development has provided a number o f benefits since it started in 1994. However, the current format needs to evolve to allow for further benefits. 51. The following table summarises the consideration o f the options from the regulatory analysis section above. Within the overview table the following symbols are used: 10 Significant improvement on the status quo Improvement on the status quo x The same as the status quo x x Worse than the status quo Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1. Status quo Does not meet the main objective Option 2. Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under Part 9A o f the Privacy Act Meets the main objective Efficiency o f compliance and administration Fairness and integrity Sustainability o f the public sector Option 3. Use the information sharing framework in section 81BA o f the Tax Administration Act Partially meets the main objective Efficiency o f compliance and administration x x Fairness and integrity Sustainability o f the public sector x Option 4. Create a specific legislative amendment in the Tax Administration Act Does not meets the main objective Efficiency o f compliance and administration x Fairness and integrity x Sustainability o f the public sector x 52. Option 2 is the recommended option because it provides a consistent and agreed-to means o f addressing privacy and security concerns in addition to meeting all the above criteria. 53. The AISA framework provides the flexibility and transparency to continue the information sharing between the agencies, while sharing additional information would provide greater benefits to customers. The additional sharing would have little to no impact on the integrity o f the tax system and would not unreasonably intrude upon individual’s privacy interests. 54. Therefore, an AISA is considered the best legislative vehicle to enable the information sharing, with additional information being added to the agreement to enable provision o f better services to common customers, and officials recommend this option is implemented. This option would enable the information to be shared under a consistent framework that has been designed for information sharing projects. The AISA would enable efficient sharing and ensure the method o f transferring information and protections for people’s privacy are clearly laid out. IMPLEMENTATION 55. Under the preferred option, officials will finalise the AISA to allow for Inland Revenue to share information with the Ministry of Social Development. The existing information sharing agreements (Memoranda o f Understanding) will be updated to address operational inconsistencies and include the additional information to be shared. 56. During the drafting process, Inland Revenue and the Ministry o f Social Development will design the agreed method o f sharing information and then clearly set out the processes 11 12 that will be followed in the information sharing agreement. These processes will contain adequate protections for people’s privacy and security o f information, designed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. 57. Following this, an OIC will be sought to enact the final AISA agreement. 58. In order to give effect to the AISA the current information sharing provisions will need to be repealed with effect from a future date set by OIC. At the same time the AISA comes into force, an OIC will set the date for the repeal o f the relevant information sharing provisions between Inland Revenue and the Ministry o f Social Development. This needs to occur to ensure there is not an overlap between legislation and regulations for information sharing, the result o f which would be current legislation overriding the AISA and therefore the OIC and AISA would not have effect. 59. When the OIC is passed, the AISA will be publicly available on Inland Revenue’s website. The AISA will continue the existing information sharing and provide a wider purpose for using the information. This will enable Inland Revenue information to be used to determine entitlement to social housing and student allowances. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 60. Inland Revenue is required to report on the operation of an AISA at times specified by the Privacy Commissioner. These reports are concerned with whether the agreement is meeting its goals. The maximum requirements o f the report are that it covers the costs and benefits o f sharing, difficulties experienced, audits undertaken, amendments and safeguards put in place, complaints received, number o f individuals whose information has been shared, number o f transactions that have occurred and number o f adverse actions taken as a result. 61. AISAs are subject to regular review by the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner can review the operation o f the agreement on his or her own initiative 12 months after the OIC approving the agreement has been made and at any time that the Commissioner considers appropriate for subsequent reviews. 62. Any review by the Privacy Commissioner would cover whether the agreement is failing to meet its goal in facilitating public services, unreasonably infringing privacy, or operating in an unforeseen way. It would also cover whether the costs o f sharing are outweighing the benefits. I f there are reasonable grounds to believe any o f these are occurring, the Privacy Commissioner will prepare a report for the Minister o f Revenue, which will also be tabled in Parliament.
February 2017 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Automatic exchange of information This special report provides early information on changes that have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to incorporate the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters into New Zealand domestic law. 1 The standard is usually referred to as “Automatic Exchange of Information”, “AEOI”, or the “AEOI standard”. AEOI is a global initiative, led by the G20 and OECD, to address the international problem of “offshore tax evasion” (that is, evading tax by hiding wealth in offshore accounts). Broadly, a jurisdict ion implements the AEOI standard by enacting legislation that requires financial institutions to: • conduct due diligence on their financial accounts to identify those held or (in certain circumstances) 2 controlled by non-residents; and • report specified identity information (including tax residence) and financial information (such as account balances and interest earned) in respect of those accounts to their local tax administration. Implementing jurisdictions must also have an appropriate network of tax treaties in place to exchange the reported information wit h applicable participating jurisdictions. Although different types of tax treaty can be used for this purpose, AEOI exchanges will predominantly be made under the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. 3 The exchanged information will be used by tax administrations to verify compliance with tax obligations. 1 For information on the standard see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/. 2 Certain entity account holders must be “looked through” to identify the ultimate natural persons who have effective control or deemed control of the financial account. 3 For information on the Convention see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/. 1 This special report outlines and explains the legislative changes at a relatively high level. Inland Revenue is supplementing this report with comprehensive guidance that will deal with the application of the AEOI standard and this implementation legislation at a detailed technical level. (The guidance was issued in draft form in December 2016, and submissions were called for by 28 February 2017. After the submissions are reviewed the guidance will be finalised and published on Inland Revenue’s website.) Key features The AEOI implementation legislation focuses on imposing the necessary due diligence and reporting obligations on financial institutions. (Exchanging the reported information is primarily a tax treaty matter and generally does not require implementation legislation.) The due diligence and reporting obligations to be imposed are set out in an element of the AEOI standard known as the Common Standard On Reporting And Due Diligence For Financial Account Information (in short, the “Common Reporting Standard” or “CRS”). 4 The CRS is also supplemented by a comprehensive official OECD Commentary (the “OECD Commentary”). The approach adopted in the legislation is essentially to incorporate the CRS directly into New Zealand law by reference, and to require the application of the CRS to be consistent with the OECD Commentary. Because of similarities between the CRS and the related United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Account (“FATCA”) initiative, the CRS implementation legislation has primarily been located (and merged) with the FATCA framework legislation at Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The general scheme of Part 11B has been retained. Section 185E, which sets out the purpose of Part 11B, has been updated to include references to the CRS and to outline the new structure. Some provisions in Part 11B (namely sections 185F to 185M) apply solely to FATCA, some (sections 185N and 185O) apply solely for CRS purposes, and some (sections 185P to 185R) apply for both FATCA and CRS purposes. A number of other amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, to support the operation of Part 11B. These include: • new definitions (in both Acts); • new record-keeping provisions (in subsection 22(2) of the Tax Administration Act); • new penalty provisions (at sections 89C, 142H and 142I of the Tax Administration Act); • new determination and Order in Council-making powers (at new sections 91AAU, 91AAV, 91AAW, 226D and 226E of the Tax Administration Act); and • a new Schedule 2 to the Tax Administration Act (modifying the application of the CRS to New Zealand). 4 For information on the CRS see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/. 2 All of these amendments are detailed and explained in this special report. Terminology Given that the focus of the legislation is on incorporating CRS obligations into New Zealand law, this report will primarily refer to the CRS rather than AEOI or the AEOI Standard. The CRS contains numerous definitions that are potentially confusing. Examples include: • The term “ent it y” includes legal arrangements such as trusts, which would not normally be the case under New Zealand law. • The terms “financial institution” and “financial account” have wider application than might normally be expected. For instance, a professionally managed investment trust that meets specified criteria will be a financial institution for CRS purposes. Moreover, a settlor or beneficiary of such a trust will be deemed to hold a financial account with the trust. New Zealand start date The start date to which the New Zealand Government has committed internationally, and from which the legislation provides that CRS obligations are to apply in New Zealand, is 1 July 2017. Due diligence The legislation specifies due diligence procedures that financial institutions must undertake in order to determine if any of their accounts are held or (if “look-through” rules apply) controlled by non-residents. • From 1 July 2017, the due diligence procedures must be conducted in respect of all new accounts. 5 – Due diligence for new accounts will generally involve obtaining, on account opening, self-certifications that contain the required identity and tax residence information. • From 1 July 2017, financial institutions must also begin due diligence reviews in respect of all pre-existing accounts. 6 – Different due diligence procedures are specified for different types of pre-existing accounts. In general, however, financial institutions will often be able to rely on documentation and/or information that they have already obtained for other regulatory or customer relationship purposes. 7 – The due diligence for pre-exist ing high value 8 individual accounts must be completed by 30 June 2018. 5 A new account will generally be one opened on or after 1 July 2017. 6 A pre-existing account will generally be one already open at 30 June 2017. 7 In particular, this includes information obtained from compliance with anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism “know-your-customer” laws. 8 Generally, high value accounts are those with an account balance exceeding US$1 million. 3  The due diligence for all other pre-existing accounts (that is pre-existing lower value individual accounts 9 and all pre-existing entity accounts) must be completed by 30 June 2019. Reporting The legislation also imposes an annual reporting requirement on a financial institution that determines, pursuant to the above due diligence procedures, that it has one or more “reportable accounts”. (That is, an account that is held or (if the “look-through” rules apply) controlled by non-residents.) The New Zealand reporting period for CRS purposes will align with the New Zealand tax year (that is, the 12-month period ending 31 March). 10 The annual reporting deadline for financial institutions for each reporting period will be 30 June following the end of the reporting period. The information that must be reported for each reportable account for each reporting period is: • identity information (including the tax residence) for each non-resident account holder and (if applicable) controlling person; and • financial information, including the account balance or value as at the end of the reporting period, and specified income earned (such as interest) and distributions made during the reporting period. If a financial institution is unable to determine the status of a pre-existing account, in specified circumstances it will be required to report the account as an “undocumented account”. Grace periods for due diligence Each annual CRS reporting period ends on 31 March. Accounts identified as reportable during a reporting period are to be reporting on to Inland Revenue by the following 30 June. However, to provide financial institutions with as much time as possible for conducting due diligence of pre-existing accounts, a grace period of three months applies beyond the 31 March reporting period end date for the first two years of CRS reporting. • The deadline for completing due diligence of pre-existing high value individual accounts is 30 June 2018 (rather than 31 March 2018). • Similarly, the deadline for completing due diligence of all other pre-existing accounts (that is, lower value individual accounts and all entity accounts) has been set at 30 June 2019 (rather than 31 March 2019). Crucially, however: • the 30 June reporting deadline still applies, meaning that due diligence and reporting to Inland Revenue must both be completed by 30 June; and 9 Generally, lower value accounts are those with an account balance that does not exceed US$1 million. 10 However, by virtue of the 1 July 2017 start date, the duration of the first period (from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) will be nine rather than 12 months. 4 • accounts identified as reportable during each grace period must be included in the reporting period to which the grace period relates (this is referred to as a “carry-back rule”) . Thus, due diligence reviews of pre-existing high value individual accounts and all reporting for these accounts must be completed by 30 June 2018. The carry-back rule means that the account balance or value to be reported will be as at 31 March 2018, and income to be reported will be income earned in the period ending 31 March 2018. Similarly, due diligence reviews of all other pre-existing accounts (lower value individual accounts and all ent ity accounts) and reporting for these accounts must be completed by 30 June 2019. The carry-back rule means that the account balance or value to be reported will be as at 31 March 2019, and income to be reported will be income earned in the period ending 31 March 2019. An exception to the carry-back rule applies if the account would not have been reportable before 31 March. This could happen, for example, if the account holder’s status changed fro m non-reportable (for example, New Zealand resident) to reportable (for example, non- resident) after 31 March. In such a case, if the account was identified as reportable in the period from 1 April to 30 June, it would not need to be reported until the following 31 March (rather than the previous 31 March). CRS optionality Some optionality is contemplated under the CRS and OECD Commentary. For example, the CRS provides that pre-existing entity accounts should not be reviewed unless the account balance or value exceeds US$250,000. However, the OECD Commentary provides implementing jurisdictions the option of ignoring this de minimis threshold. The implementation legislation generally allows financial institutions the discretion to adopt the option that best suits their circumstances. However, the legislation wit hholds so me options for New Zealand. These are the two key “excluded choices”: • The reporting period to be used by all New Zealand financial institutions is the year ending 31 March. • The CRS “wider approach” to due diligence will be mandatory for all New Zealand financial institutions. These excluded choices are explained further below. Compliance framework The CRS requires implementing jurisdictions to introduce rules for ensuring compliance. These include anti-avoidance rules and effective sanctions for addressing non-compliance. To meet this requirement, the implementation legislation includes a compliance framework with an anti-avoidance rule and certain penalt ies. The compliance framework applies to financial institutions and also extends to other persons and entities that hold or control accounts with such institutions, or that otherwise act as intermediaries in relation to accounts. 5 This reflects the fact that effective implementation of the CRS requires a chain of information effectively flowing from account holders, controlling persons and intermediaries, to financial institutions and then to Inland Revenue (for international exchange). Background International context and New Zealand’s commitment to implement AEOI To date, 101 jurisdictions have committed to implement AEOI wit h a view to complet ing first exchanges by 30 September 2018 at the latest. This includes: • all G20 and OECD member countries; and • all other jurisdictions identified by the G20 or OECD as having or operating as an international finance centre. Jurisdictions other than those identified above can also implement the AEOI standard, but will not be subject to implementation deadlines (unless they are subsequently identified by the G20 or OECD as an emerging tax risk). As an OECD member, New Zealand has made an international commitment to implement AEOI and to complete its first international informat ion exchanges by the 30 September 2018 deadline. Of the 101 committed jurisdictions, 55 have committed to complete their first exchanges by 30 September 2017. These are generally referred to as early adopters. The other 46 jurisdictions (which includes New Zealand and Australia) are working towards the 30 September 2018 deadline. The success of the global AEOI initiative depends on jurisdictions implementing consistent rules, to a similar implementation timeline. Otherwise there is a high risk of the offshore tax evasio n problem merely relocating to jurisdictions that lag behind or implement to a lesser standard. To ensure consistency and timeliness, the OECD’s global tax body, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (“Glo bal Forum”), will lead peer reviews and other forms of monitoring to ensure that jurisdictions correctly implement the AEOI standard in a timely manner. The Global Forum will report the outcome o f it s reviews to the G20, which is positioned to apply possible sanctions against non-complying jurisdictions, if necessary. Relation to other international initiatives AEOI is a stand-alone initiative, but is related to other international developments aimed at improving transparency frameworks and tax compliance. In particular, the CRS reflects (and is largely based on) the US FATCA initiative, which New Zealand implemented in 2014. The CRS builds off the FATCA initiative in a number of ways. For example, both regimes have broadly similar types of ent it ies, financial institutions, financial accounts, due diligence procedures (including sometimes allowing financial institutions to rely on anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism “know your customer” (“AML”) procedures and other account information that they already hold), and reporting requirements. 6 However, there are some differences between the regimes. Below are some key examples. • FATCA due diligence is focused on identifying “US persons” (which includes US citizens as well as residents). CRS due diligence applies only to non-residents and not foreign citizens. 11 • FATCA contains a number of de minimis exclusions from due diligence and reporting. The CRS generally does not have such exclusions. The one exception to this is for pre- existing entity accounts, where the threshold exemption is US$250,000, unless the financial institution chooses to opt out of the threshold. • FATCA compliance is buttressed by a 30% withholding tax to apply to US-sourced income for non-compliance. This does not apply to the CRS. The CRS therefore requires implementing jurisdictions to have a legal and operational compliance framework in place to verify compliance, penalise non-compliance and counter potential CRS avoidance arrangements. In addit ion, FATCA implementation involved the incorporation of the necessary due diligence and reporting rules (which are set out in a treaty-level instrument) 12 into New Zealand law by regulations. 13 The CRS is not a treaty-level instrument, and incorporation into New Zealand law therefore requires specific legislation. Other elements of the AEOI standard As noted, the CRS is the element of the overall AEOI standard that sets out the due diligence and reporting obligations for financial inst itutions of participating jurisdictions. The other elements of the AEOI standard generally relate to the exchange of AEOI information between jurisdictions. This includes model competent authority agreements and the data schema to be used for exchanges. A common IT solution for encrypting and transmitting data between jurisdictions, referred to as the Common Transmission Standard, is also being developed by the OECD. All exchanges of information with other jurisdictions will be made under New Zealand’s tax treaties. The legal instruments for exchange Any form of tax treaty can potentially be used to make AEOI exchanges. However, the G20 and OECD have promoted the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (“Mult ilateral Convent ion”) as the principal treaty to be used for this purpose. 11 As explained in the detailed analysis section, the legislation makes the CRS option of the “wider approach” to due diligence mandatory for all New Zealand financial institutions. This means CRS due diligence in New Zealand will focus on identifying all foreign tax residents, rather than only the residents of implementing jurisdictions. 12 An Intergovernmental Agreement between New Zealand and the US. The agreement is available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties/united-states-america#iga . 13 The Double Tax Agreements (United States of America-FATCA) Order 2014. 7 New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention in 2012. It was given legal effect in New Zealand on 21 October 2013 by an Order in Council made under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Section BH 1 authorises the making of an Order in Council to give legal effect to a “double tax agreement”. As that term is defined, and under statutory legal principles, the reference to double tax agreement in section BH 1 can apply to a wide range of tax treaty types, including multilateral treaties. However, this was not immediately obvious from the wording. This has led to some claims that the Multilateral Convention was not correctly given legal effect in New Zealand. Although a legal challenge to the validity of the Order in Council giving effect to the Multilateral Convention is unlikely to be successful, any uncertainty is undesirable. Moreover, additional multilateral treaties may need to be given effect under section BH 1 in the future. Accordingly, the legislation includes a retrospective amendment to section BH 1 to put the matter beyond doubt, by clarifying that it also applies to mult ilateral treaties. The definition of “foreign account information-sharing agreement”, in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, has also been amended to specifically include the Multilateral Convention. This supports the change made to section BH 1 with a reference to the Multilateral Convention being brought into force by an Order in Council made under section BH 1. It also clearly links the Multilateral Convention (and other applicable tax treaties) to the agreements to which Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies. Article 6 of the Multilateral Convention authorises automatic exchanges of informat ion (as opposed to other forms of exchange, such as on request). It provides that automatic exchanges must be subject to detailed terms as agreed between “competent authorities”. To give effect to the Article 6 requirement for competent authorities to agree the detailed terms of automatic exchanges for AEOI, the OECD developed an administrative instrument referred to as the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (“MCAA”). New Zealand signed the MCAA in 2015. 15 Competent authorit ies are generally specific persons or authorities nominated by each treaty partner to administer the treaty. The competent authority under New Zealand’s tax treaties is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 16 In addition to other important details, such as the manner of exchanges and rules, and procedures around maintaining confidentiality of exchanged data, the MCAA specifies the actual information to be exchanged between the parties. The MCAA also has a notification mechanism, which enables each party to confirm the actual jurisdictions that it will exchange with (see explanation of “reportable jurisdictions” below), and the timing of exchanges with each of those jurisdictions. This notification mechanism is administered by the OECD, and will be publicised online on the OECD’s AEOI portal. 17 14 Details about the Multilateral Convention are available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties/convention-mutual-administrative-assistance-tax-matters . 15 For information about the MCAA see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/. 16 The Commissioner may delegate competent authority status. 17 See http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/. 8 New Zealand will provide notifications on reportable jurisdictions when its list of reportable jurisdictions is finalised. 18 Application dates The legislative amendment to section BH 1, clarifying that the section applies in the case of multilateral treaties, has retrospective application from 21 October 2013. As noted above, this is to put beyond doubt that section BH 1 applies to the Multilateral Convention (which has had legal effect in New Zealand since 21 October 2013). Otherwise, the legislative amendments come into force from the date of Royal assent. Detailed analysis This special report outlines and explains the legislative changes at a relatively high level. Inland Revenue is supplementing this report with comprehensive guidance that will deal with the application of the AEOI standard and this implementation legislation at a detailed technical level. Incorporating the CRS and OECD Commentary into New Zealand law The due diligence procedures and reporting requirements set out in the CRS are supplemented by a comprehensive OECD Commentary. Rewriting the CRS’s rules into domestic law in a way that ensures consistency with the OECD Commentary could risk inadvertent differences and gaps between the CRS/OECD Commentary and the domestic implementation legislation. Moreover, the CRS and OECD Commentary will almost certainly be subject to future change, as deficiencies and improvements are identified, and in response to possible changes in future taxpayer behaviour. To ensure that the CRS is correctly incorporated into New Zealand law, and reduce the risk of deficiencies being identified during international peer review, the AEOI standard has been incorporated into domest ic law by direct reference to the CRS and the OECD Commentary, as published. To facilitate the incorporation of the CRS by reference, three key definitions have been inserted into section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • “CRS publication”, which refers to the official OECD publication that includes the full AEOI standard (the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters); 19 • “CRS standard”, referring to Part IIB of the CRS publication, which is where the CRS is located; and 18 The mechanism for confirming New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions is covered further below. 19 This publication is available on the OECD website at http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/standard-for- automatic-exchange-of-financial-account-information-for-tax-matters-9789264216525-en.htm. Inland Revenue will issue a New Zealand version of the CRS on its website, with all domestic law modifications (such as key dates and the wider approach to due diligence) included. 9 • “CRS applied standard”, meaning the CRS standard as modified by section 185O and Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 20 As noted, the CRS must be interpreted and applied consistently with the official OECD Commentary, which is in Part IIIB of the CRS publication. New section 185O(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 incorporates that requirement into New Zealand law. Importantly, the definition of CRS standard includes the words “as amended from time to time”. This means that future changes to the CRS will generally flow through into New Zealand legislation automatically. The CRS is an international standard, and New Zealand’s compliance with it will be peer reviewed by the OECD’s Global Forum. The G20 has stated its intention to apply sanctions, when appropriate, in response to identified non-compliance. This applies equally to any future changes to the CRS. Therefore, the automatic flow-through of future changes into New Zealand law is considered to be appropriate. As a safeguard, however, new section 226E allows Orders in Council to be made, if necessary, to facilitate, block or defer particular CRS changes. Note that section 185O(3)(b) also states “as amended at the time”, thereby ensuring that future changes to the OECD Commentary also automatically apply. Other definitions The approach of incorporating the AEOI implementation legislation into existing Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 involves merging the AEOI rules into the concept of a foreign account information-sharing agreement, on which Part 11B is based. To achieve this, the definition of “foreign account information-sharing agreement” (in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) has been amended to include the Multilateral Convention (which, as noted above, will be the tax treaty predominantly used for AEOI exchanges). The CRS itself contains a large number of specific definitions. Generally, the approach of incorporating the CRS into New Zealand law by reference will ensure that these definitions will automat ically apply in the application of the CRS in New Zealand. However, in case of a conflict between a CRS definition and a defined term in the Inland Revenue Acts, a rule has been inserted at new section 185O(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that when applying the CRS standard, the CRS definit io n will generally take precedence. The OECD Commentary specifies that two terms (“passive income” and “maintain”) are to take their domestic law meaning, but they must also include certain things. To ensure that the full meaning set out in the OECD Commentary will apply in New Zealand, specific definitions of these terms have been included in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 20 The legislation modifies the CRS to clarify the application of options, dates (such as the dates that are to apply for due diligence and reporting purposes) and other items as necessary. 10 Other amendments in section 3(1) to ensure the legislation works correctly include new definit ions of “information” (to clarify that it includes a self-certification) and “taxpayer identification number” (to clarify the application to a functional equivalent number in a foreign jurisdiction). A new term “FATCA agreement” has also been introduced in section 3, as a means of differentiating between FATCA and AEOI in Part 11B. Framework for CRS obligations Because the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations are incorporated into New Zealand law by reference, the legislation generally does not need to detail specific obligations. Rather, the AEOI implementation legislation is primarily concerned with establishing the framework under which the CRS obligations will apply in New Zealand. Section 185O sets out the specific modifications to be made to the CRS standard for application in New Zealand (as the CRS applied standard). Section 185N of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies the obligations to financial inst itutions. Section 185P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies the obligations to persons or entities other than financial institutions (such as account holders, controlling persons or intermediaries). Some complexity arises from the fact that the CRS treats certain legal arrangements (particularly trusts and partnerships) as entities. As this does not match New Zealand law, section 185Q provides that any obligations in the CRS that apply to an entity are to apply to the relevant natural person in the New Zealand context. (For example, for trusts, the obligations will apply to the trustees, and for partnerships, each partner.) The framework is supplemented by amendments to section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that insert specific record-keeping requirements in relation to compliance with Part 11B of the Act. This includes a specific requirement for financial institutions that are subject to Part 11B to: • keep a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification; and • keep a record of the steps taken and evidence relied upon in meeting obligations under Part 11B relating to the CRS applied standard. 21 Modifications to the CRS Section 185O(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a number of specific modifications are set out in new Schedule 2 to the Tax Administration Act 1994. (These are detailed further below.) 21 This is required each CRS reporting period, irrespective of whether or not the financial institution has any CRS information that is required to be reported to Inland Revenue. 11 Section 185O(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the CRS is to be applied consistently with the OECD Commentary, as amended at the time. Section 185O(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 effectively provides that a CRS definit ion will prevail in any conflict with a domestic law definit io n. Section 185O(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 generally permits financial institutions to make elections contemplated in and consistent with the CRS and OECD Commentary. Section 185O(6) provides that after making an election, the person or entity must meet the requirements of the CRS applied standard consistently wit h that election. Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 New Schedule 2 makes the following specific modifications to the CRS: • Item 1 clarifies that references in the CRS to reporting period and calendar year should generally mean a 12-month reporting period ending 31 March. • Items 2 and 3 mandate the use of the wider approach for due diligence. This is an important compliance minimisation option offered to implementing jurisdictions in the CRS. It is explained below, in the section “The wider approach”. • Item 4 withdraws a choice available in the CRS to allow a transit io nal period for the introduction of a requirement to report gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets. The reasons for this are explained below under “Excluded choices”. • Items 5 to 10 set out various due diligence timeframes that apply for the different types of pre-existing accounts. • Item 11 provides an option relating to certain employer-sponsored group insurance contracts or annuity contracts. • Item 12 provides that dollar amounts referred to in the CRS (which are in US currency), can be treated as being in New Zealand dollars. • Items 13 and 22 to 24 all link to the lists of New Zealand’s participating jurisdictions, reportable jurisdictions, non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts, which will need to be published. This is explained below. • Item 14 sets out the date at which a credit card issuer is required to implement various defined policies and procedures in order to be a “qualified credit card issuer” as defined in the CRS. • Items 15 and 16 set out various dates from which collective investment vehicles must no longer issue physical shares in bearer form and by which they must have policies in place to ensure that such shares are redeemed or immobilised in order to be an “exempt collective investment vehicle” as defined in the CRS. • Items 17 and 18 define “pre-existing account” and “new account”. The definition of pre-existing account incorporates the option in the CRS to apply the due diligence procedures for pre-existing accounts to new accounts opened by pre-existing customers in circumstances permitted in the CRS. • Items 19 and 20 set out dates that apply for determining whether a pre-existing individual account is a “lower value account” or a “high value account”. 12 • Item 21 sets out a deadline date by which a financial institution is required to implement defined policies and procedures in order for a type of overpaid depository account to be an “excluded account”. • Item 25 replaces the definit io n o f the term “related entity” in the CRS wit h the optional definit ion (at paragraph 82 of Section VIII) in the OECD Commentary. The replacement definit io n of related entit y generally refers to whether an entity is controlled by another entity, or whether two entities are under common control, or whether two managed investment entities are under common management. Much of new Schedule 2 is concerned with inserting the key CRS implementation dates and timeframes that are to apply in New Zealand. These include the date on which CRS obligations begin, dates for determining whether a financial account is a new account or a pre- existing account, and the deadlines for financial institutions to complete due diligence and reporting. In the CRS and OECD Commentary, these dates have generally been left open for each implementing jurisdiction to insert via domestic implementing law (subject to meeting international expectations). In addition, because New Zealand’s reporting period is different from the default calendar year reporting period in the CRS, a rule is included to ensure that all references to reporting period and calendar year are to be read in the context of the New Zealand tax year (unless the context requires otherwise). Obligations of financial institutions The CRS provides that a financial institution that is resident (as that concept applies for CRS purposes) in a jurisdiction will be subject to CRS obligations in that jurisdict ion. However, a branch of a New Zealand-resident financial institution located outside of New Zealand is excluded from the rules. Conversely, a branch of a non-resident financial institution located in New Zealand is subject to the New Zealand rules. These fundamental rules are repeated in section 185N(1) and (2). The CRS also includes a complex series of definitions that set out the actual criteria for identifying financial institutions. For CRS purposes, the term “financial institution” is broadly defined. It extends beyond traditional financial institutions (such as banks) to a wide range of entities that would not normally be considered to be financial institutions (for example, it will include some professionally managed trusts). However, the CRS also specifies a number of categories of financial institution that pose a low risk of being used to facilitate offshore tax evasion, and which therefore are excluded fro m the due diligence and reporting obligations. These are defined as “non-reporting financial institutions”. Section 185N(3) provides that a financial institution must comply with the due diligence and reporting obligations set out in the CRS applied standard. 13 Section 185N(4) imposes an annual reporting deadline for financial institutions of 30 June following the 31 March reporting period end date. Consistent with the timeframes in the CRS and OECD Commentary for completing due diligence of pre-existing accounts, section 185N(5) sets a deadline of 30 June 2018 for due diligence and reporting on pre-existing high value individual accounts, and 30 June 2019 for due diligence and reporting for all other pre-existing accounts. Otherwise, section 185N(5) includes a general rule for the timing of reports in respect of an account identified as reportable during a particular reporting period. Section 185N also includes other supplementary rules that clarify the application of certain options in the CRS. Obligations of persons other than financial institutions Section 185P extends CRS obligations to persons other than financial institutions. This reflects the fact that financial institutions will often be required to collect documentation and information directly or indirectly from account holders (and sometimes the controlling persons of the account) in order to comply with their CRS obligations. This includes circumstances when the institution has a customer relationship with an intermediary that holds an account for the benefit of an account holder and, potentially, other controlling persons. This requires an efficient transfer of information from those account holders and other persons directly or indirectly to the financial inst itution. Financial institutions are required to obtain documentation and information from customers on account opening. 22 However, they may face challenges in obtaining necessary documentation and information from customers in other circumstances. For example, a pre- existing customer may not respond to a written request for information. There may also be difficulties obtaining documentation and information from persons connected with particular types of accounts, such as trust accounts. To assist compliance, section 185P imposes an obligation on such customers and other persons or entities, to obtain and provide any information that the financial institution requests fro m them, directly or indirectly, that is needed to satisfy the institution’s CRS due diligence obligations. Section 185P also requires customers and other relevant persons or ent it ies to provide updates on any material change in circumstances that they are aware of that may affect their status as a reportable person. For example, if a customer has provided a self-certification to a financial institution that they are a New Zealand resident, and they subsequently become non-resident, that change of residence status should be notified to the financial institution. Record-keeping obligations The CRS specifically requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules in place that require financial institutions to keep records of the steps undertaken, and any evidence relied upon, in meeting their CRS obligations. 22 Inland Revenue’s technical guidance will contain specific guidance on this point. 14 This requirement is covered by the introduction of specific rules in section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These include a requirement for a financial institution to keep a record if they cannot obtain a required self-certification. The new record-keeping requirements will assist Inland Revenue in verifying compliance with the CRS and addressing any non-compliance (including considering penalties). Optionality Although the success of the AEOI global initiative depends on jurisdictions implementing similar rules, the CRS provides implementing jurisdictions with a number of options. These options have been developed with a view to minimising compliance costs for financial institutions in areas that are not considered likely to compromise the effectiveness of the CRS. The circumstances of each financial institution can differ markedly, meaning that financial institutions may have different preferences as to whether these options should be adopted. Accordingly, the implementation legislation generally allows each financial institution to decide whether to adopt any particular option offered in the CRS. Some of the specific choices available to financial institutions are set out in section 185N. Otherwise, subsections 185O(5) and 185O(6) generally provide that a financial institution may make an election that is expressed as being available to them (under the CRS and the Inland Revenue Acts). Excluded choices Section 185N(11) provides that the optionality in the CRS for alternative reporting periods, and in the OECD Commentary for the use of average balances rather than period-end balances, will not be available to financial institutions. In these two cases, a particular choice will be mandated for all financial inst itutions: • CRS reporting period – the reporting period to be used in New Zealand will be the 12- month period ending 31 March. 23 This is consistent with the New Zealand tax year and the reporting period adopted by New Zealand for FATCA purposes. The period ending 31 March must be adopted by all financial institutions. • Average balances – the OECD Commentary provides that jurisdict ions that alread y require financial institutions to report average account balances can permit their financial institutions to maintain this approach for CRS, rather than reporting period- end balances. This does not apply in New Zealand. However, for clarit y, the implementation legislation expressly provides that this option is not available to New Zealand financial institutions. An addit io nal excluded cho ice is set out at item 4 of Schedule 2. This relates to an option available in the CRS to allow a transitional period for the introduction of a requirement to report gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets in relation to a custodial account. On this point there is a mismatch between the CRS and the exchange commitments set out in the MCAA, where this is not allowed as an option. Therefore this has been specifically set out as an excluded choice. 23 Given New Zealand’s 1 July 2017 start date, the first CRS reporting period will be a nine-month transitional period from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018. 15 The wider approach The wider approach to CRS due diligence An important option offered in the CRS is use of the wider approach to CRS due diligence. This option addresses the practical issue that the CRS prima facie requires financial institutions to only identify persons that are tax-resident in reportable jurisdictions (that is, jurisdictions that New Zealand has a commitment to provide CRS information to). Over time, additional jurisdictions will join the initiative and become reportable jurisdictions. Without specific rules, each new jurisdiction joining could trigger a new round of due diligence reviews of accounts by financial institutions. To avoid this problem, and to minimise compliance costs, the CRS includes an option for implementing jurisdictions to adopt a wider approach to due diligence. Under this approach, a jurisdiction’s financial institutions would collect and retain CRS information for all non- residents ident ified, rather than just for residents of reportable jurisdictions. The CRS implementation legislation adopts the wider approach to due diligence. To ensure consistency, and to prevent a competitive disadvantage for any financial institution, this approach will be mandatory for all financial institutions. This modification to the CRS standard is made at item 2 of the new Schedule 2. The wider approach to CRS reporting The wider approach to due diligence means that financial institutions will prima facie need to sort the collected data to determine which non-resident accounts need to be reported to Inland Revenue. However, for CRS reporting, the implementation legislation allows a wider approach option for financial institutions to report all of the information to Inland Revenue. That is, financial institutions may choose to report information for all financial accounts held or controlled by a non-resident, not just those that are residents of reportable jurisdictions. Financial institutions that adopt the wider approach reporting option will effectively pass the responsibility for sorting their non-resident data on to Inland Revenue, potentially saving compliance costs. Inland Revenue will be responsible for determining the information to be exchanged with reportable jurisdictions. The wider approach to reporting option is set out in section 185N(7). Section 185N(8) effectively provides that, once a financial institution elects to adopt the wider approach for a reporting period, it must report on that basis for that period. This “permitted choice” rule is consistent with the approach adopted for FATCA. Determinations and regulatory powers The terms “participating jurisdiction” and “reportable jurisdiction” are key concepts in the application of the CRS. The CRS requires New Zealand to publish lists of its participating jurisdictions and reportable jurisdictions. 16 The CRS also provides carve-outs from due diligence and reporting obligations for “non- reporting financial institutions” and “excluded accounts” that pose a low risk of being used for tax evasion purposes. Some generic categories of these are set out in the CRS. However, the CRS also provides that certain other financial institutions and accounts can be subject to the carve-outs, provided they are approved by Inland Revenue as meeting specified criteria. New Zealand’s lists of participating jurisdictions, reportable jurisdictions, approved non- reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts will be published by a mix of Commissioner’s determinations and regulat ions. Participating jurisdictions A participating jurisdiction is generally one that has implemented AEOI and that will provide CRS information to other jurisdictions. More specifically, New Zealand’s participating jurisdictions will be those with which an exchange agreement is in place for that jurisdict io n to provide CRS information to New Zealand. The CRS contains rules that require a financial institution to look through prescribed entities (referred to in the CRS as “passive NFEs”) to determine the natural persons that are its ultimate controlling persons. This look-through rule extends to certain investment entities that are not from participating jurisdictions. This means that New Zealand’s list of participating jurisdictions will impact on the entit y account holders that New Zealand financial institutions will need to look through to identify any ultimate controlling persons. New section 91AAU of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue may make a determination about whether a particular jurisdiction is a participating jurisdiction. The provision authorises the Commissioner to limit, amend, suspend or withdraw a determination. It will take time to confirm whether all jurisdictions that have committed to implementing AEOI have correctly carried through with their commitments. As a transitional measure, the OECD has permitted jurisdictions to tentatively treat all jurisdictions that have made international commitments to implement AEOI/CRS as participating jurisdictions. New Zealand will adopt this approach. However, the transitional measure is only to apply for a limited time, and jurisdictions are required to publish final lists by 30 June 2017. Given that New Zealand’s start date is 1 July 2017, the intended approach is to publish a transit io nal list that will apply for the first reporting period (1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) and then a final list by 30 June 2017 that will apply from the beginning of the second reporting period (that is, from 1 April 2018). Reportable jurisdictions A participating jurisdiction is one that provides CRS informat ion. A reportable jurisdiction is one that also wants to receive CRS information. Not all participating jurisdictions will be reportable jurisdictions. For example, some participating jurisdictions may not have a tax system 24 and therefore have no need to receive information. 24 For example, some smaller economies that are international finance centres. 17 In general, international expectations are that AEOI/CRS information will be provided to all jurisdictions that have signed the MCAA on the basis that they wish to receive such information. However, the OECD acknowledges that this raises potential concerns about confidentiality and data security. AEOI/CRS exchanges will comprise sensitive personal and financial information. The terms of the legal instruments under which the information will be exchanged require this information to be used only for specified (tax) purposes and disclosed only to specified persons for such purposes. Many jurisdictions have been exchanging such sensitive information for many years, have robust laws, processes and systems in place for ensuring exchanged data is kept secure and is only used for legitimate purposes, and have a track record of maintaining confidentiality in respect of exchanged information. However, some jurisdictions that are implementing the AEOI standard have had little, or no, prior experience in exchange of information for tax purposes. Implementing jurisdictions may decide not to provide information to a particular jurisdiction if they have genuine concerns about confidentiality and/or data security. However, such decisions cannot be used to frustrate the purposes of the CRS. This is a difficult balancing act. To assist, the Global Forum is conducting specific reviews of jurisdictions’ confidentiality and data safeguards, and is making its conclusions available to jurisdictions implementing the AEOI standard. A new section 226D in the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a regulation-making power for determining New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions. This will ensure that the New Zealand Government retains oversight and control over adding or removing jurisdictions from New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions list. To ensure that, in the case of any serious breach, exchange of information with a particular jurisdiction can be swiftly suspended, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be authorised to make a determination to temporarily suspend that jurisdiction as a reportable jurisdiction. This determination-making power is contained in new section 91AAV (and its effect on the regulation, in section 226D(5)). The section 91AAV determination power will only exist as a contingency to ensure that the time taken to make an Order in Council to suspend a jurisdiction does not result in a legal obligation to provide information despite a serious breach of confidentiality. Any determination made under section 91AAV will need to be subsequently confirmed by Order in Council or it will lapse. Non-reporting financial institutions As noted above, non-reporting financial institutions are not subject to CRS due diligence or reporting. The CRS provides for so me generic categories of financial institution that will be non-reporting financial institutions. However, there is also a category of low risk financial institutions that an implementing jurisdiction can itself determine. These must meet certain specified criteria in the CRS, must be confirmed by the implementing jurisdiction in a published list, and must meet a final test of not frustrating the purposes of the CRS. 18 New section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a determination as to whether a particular financial institution, or type of financial institution, is a non-reporting financial institution. The provision allows the Commissioner to limit, amend, suspend or withdraw a determination. All determinations made under this provision must be published. Certain low risk excluded accounts Similarly, excluded accounts are not subject to CRS due diligence or reporting. A number of generic categories of excluded account are set out in the CRS. There is also an additional category of low risk accounts that an implementing jurisdiction can determine. However, these must also meet specified criteria in the CRS, must be confirmed by the implementing jurisdiction in a published list, and must meet a final test of not frustrating the purposes of the CRS. Section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994 also provides for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a determination as to whether a particular financial account, or type of financial account, is an excluded account. The provision allows the Commissioner to limit, amend, suspend or withdraw a determination. All determinations made under this provision must be published. Enforcement The CRS requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules and procedures in place to ensure compliance and address non-compliance. This includes having appropriate anti-avoidance rules, record-keeping requirements, compliance programmes and effective sanctions to address identified non-compliance (including countering avoidance arrangements). Accordingly, the legislation includes a comprehensive suite of enforcement rules and penalties. The penalties that can be imposed on financial institutions for not complying with CRS obligations are as follows. “Absolute liability” penalties Under subsection 142H(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $300 applies if a financial institution does not comply with any CRS due diligence or reporting requirement. However, subsection 142H(2) provides that this penalty will not be imposed if the failure was due to circumstances beyond a financial institution’s control. Under subsection 142H(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $300 applies if a financial institution does not obtain a self-certification on opening of a new account, when this is required by the CRS. Under subsections 142H(2) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a transitional period (until 30 June 2019) will apply during which penalties under subsections 142H(1) and (3) will not be imposed if the financial institution is able to demonstrate that it: • made reasonable efforts to comply with its CRS due diligence and reporting obligations; and • corrected the failure within a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of it. 19 Under subsection 142H(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the penalties that may be imposed under sections 142H(1) and (3) must not exceed $10,000 per reporting period. “Negligence” penalties Under subsection 142H(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $20,000 for a first offence and $40,000 for any subsequent offence, may be imposed when a financial institution fails to take reasonable care in complying with its CRS due diligence and reporting requirements. Under subsection 142H(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the penalties that may be imposed under section 142H(5) must not exceed $100,000 per reporting period. Intentional non-compliance “Knowledge offences” by financial institutions will be subject to existing criminal penalties under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under section 142H, civil absolute liability penalties and negligence penalties may not be imposed for the same offence. Information providers The penalties for financial institutions are also backed with specific obligations and penalties that apply to “information providers” who are account holders, controlling persons, or persons that otherwise hold accounts for the benefit of others (including trusts and intermediaries). Under section 142I(2)(a)–( h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $1,000 can be imposed on an information provider for each offence relating to a request for information (such as providing a false self-certification or not providing a self-certification within a reasonable period of time). Under section 142I(2)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $1,000 can also be imposed on an information provider for not informing Inland Revenue of a material change in circumstances within a reasonable time. However, under subsections 142I(3) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the imposition of the above penalties is subject to a “no fault” defence (for a failure to provide information or a self-certification within the control of the information provider) and a “reasonable efforts” defence (for a failure to provide information or a self-certification relating to another person or entity and not within the control of the information provider). Other enforcement amendments Section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to enable Inland Revenue to impose any of the civil penalties under sections 142H and 142I by issuing a notice of assessment (that is, without first having to issue a notice of proposed adjustment). Section 143 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to ensure that criminal “absolute liability” penalties cannot be imposed under that section for non-compliance wit h Part 11B of the Act. (This is because sections 142H and 142I of the Act provide for absolute liability penalties.) 20 In addition, section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to enable criminal “knowledge” penalties to be imposed for knowingly failing to provide information or a self-certification. As advised, specific record-keeping obligations relating to compliance with Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been inserted into section 22(2) of the Act. An anti-avoidance provision that will apply to CRS arrangements and practices entered into or by financial institutions, persons or intermediaries with “a main purpose” of avoiding an obligation under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, has been inserted into the Act as new section 185R. “Reasonable efforts” to comply The mix of transitional measures and available defences included in the above rules reflects the fact that the rules are complex, that financial institutions face short implementation timelines, and that there is therefore a risk of inadvertent error by financial institutions and information providers. The intended approach is that for the first two years, reasonable efforts by financial institutions to comply will be recognised. For that time, sanctions will generally only be imposed in cases of intentional non-compliance or lack of reasonable care. FATCA-related amendments For consistency, the legislation also extends certain CRS obligations to FATCA. These include: • aligning the FATCA anti-avoidance rule with the AEOI/CRS anti-avo idance rule (wit h application to any person with an obligation under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994); • extending the record-keeping obligations in respect of Part 11B to FATCA as well as AEOI/CRS; and • providing for the imposition of the same obligations and penalties on persons other than financial institutions (information providers) under FATCA as for AEOI/CRS. 21
February 2017 (updated 4 April 2017) A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Automatic exchange of information This special report provides early information on changes that have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to incorporate the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters into New Zealand domestic law. 1 The standard is usually referred to as “Automatic Exchange of Information”, “AEOI”, or the “AEOI standard”. AEOI is a global initiative, led by the G20 and OECD, to address the international problem of “offshore tax evasio n” (that is, evading tax by hiding wealth in offshore accounts). Broadly, a jurisdict ion implements the AEOI standard by enacting legislation that requires financial institutions to: • conduct due diligence on their financial accounts to identify those held or (in certain circumstances) 2 controlled by non-residents; and • report specified identity information (including tax residence) and financial information (such as account balances and interest earned) in respect of those accounts to their local tax administration. Implementing jurisdictions must also have an appropriate network of tax treaties in place to exchange the reported information wit h applicable participating jurisdictions. Although different types of tax treaty can be used for this purpose, AEOI exchanges will predominantly be made under the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. 3 The exchanged information will be used by tax administrations to verify compliance with tax obligations. 1 For information on the standard see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/. 2 Certain entity account holders must be “looked through” to identify the ultimate natural persons who have effective control or deemed control of the financial account. 3 For information on the Convention see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/. 1 This special report outlines and explains the legislative changes at a relatively high level. Inland Revenue is supplementing this report with comprehensive guidance that will deal with the application of the AEOI standard and this implementation legislation at a detailed technical level. (The guidance was issued in draft form in December 2016, and submissions were called for by 28 February 2017. After the submissions are reviewed the guidance will be finalised and published on Inland Revenue’s website.) Key features The AEOI implementation legislation focuses on imposing the necessary due diligence and reporting obligations on financial institutions. (Exchanging the reported information is primarily a tax treaty matter and generally does not require implementation legislation.) The due diligence and reporting obligations to be imposed are set out in an element of the AEOI standard known as the Common Standard On Reporting And Due Diligence For Financial Account Information (in short, the “Common Reporting Standard” or “CRS”). 4 The CRS is also supplemented by a comprehensive official OECD Commentary (the “OECD Commentary”). The approach adopted in the legislation is essentially to incorporate the CRS directly into New Zealand law by reference, and to require the application of the CRS to be consistent with the OECD Commentary. Because of similarities between the CRS and the related United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Account (“FATCA”) initiative, the CRS implementation legislation has primarily been located (and merged) with the FATCA framework legislation at Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The general scheme of Part 11B has been retained. Section 185E, which sets out the purpose of Part 11B, has been updated to include references to the CRS and to outline the new structure. Some provisions in Part 11B (namely sections 185F to 185M) apply solely to FATCA, some (sections 185N and 185O) apply solely for CRS purposes, and some (sections 185P to 185R) apply for both FATCA and CRS purposes. A number of other amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, to support the operation of Part 11B. These include: • new definitions (in both Acts); • new record-keeping provisions (in subsection 22(2) of the Tax Administration Act); • new penalty provisions (at sections 89C, 142H and 142I of the Tax Administration Act); • new determination and Order in Council-making powers (at new sections 91AAU, 91AAV, 91AAW, 226D and 226E of the Tax Administration Act); and • a new Schedule 2 to the Tax Administration Act (modifying the application of the CRS to New Zealand). 4 For information on the CRS see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/. 2 All of these amendments are detailed and explained in this special report. Terminology Given that the focus of the legislation is on incorporating CRS obligations into New Zealand law, this report will primarily refer to the CRS rather than AEOI or the AEOI Standard. The CRS contains numerous definitions that are potentially confusing. Examples include: • The term “ent it y” includes legal arrangements such as trusts, which would not normally be the case under New Zealand law. • The terms “financial institution” and “financial account” have wider application than might normally be expected. For instance, a professionally managed investment trust that meets specified criteria will be a financial institution for CRS purposes. Moreover, a settlor or beneficiary of such a trust will be deemed to hold a financial account with the trust. New Zealand start date The start date to which the New Zealand Government has committed internationally, and from which the legislation provides that CRS obligations are to apply in New Zealand, is 1 July 2017. Due diligence The legislation specifies due diligence procedures that financial institutions must undertake in order to determine if any of their accounts are held or (if “look-through” rules apply) controlled by non-residents. • From 1 July 2017, the due diligence procedures must be conducted in respect of all new accounts. 5 – Due diligence for new accounts will generally involve obtaining, on account opening, self-certifications that contain the required identity and tax residence information. • From 1 July 2017, financial institutions must also begin due diligence reviews in respect of all pre-existing accounts. 6 – Different due diligence procedures are specified for different types of pre-existing accounts. In general, however, financial institutions will often be able to rely on documentation and/or information that they have already obtained for other regulatory or customer relationship purposes. 7 – The due diligence for pre-exist ing high value 8 individual accounts must be completed by 30 June 2018. 5 A new account will generally be one opened on or after 1 July 2017. 6 A pre-existing account will generally be one already open at 30 June 2017. 7 In particular, this includes information obtained from compliance with anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism “know-your-customer” laws. 8 Generally, high value accounts are those with an account balance exceeding US$1 million. 3  The due diligence for all other pre-existing accounts (that is pre-existing lower value individual accounts 9 and all pre-existing entity accounts) must be completed by 30 June 2019. Reporting The legislation also imposes an annual reporting requirement on a financial institution that determines, pursuant to the above due diligence procedures, that it has one or more “reportable accounts”. (That is, an account that is held or (if the “look-through” rules apply) controlled by non-residents.) The New Zealand reporting period for CRS purposes will align with the New Zealand tax year (that is, the 12-month period ending 31 March). 10 The annual reporting deadline for financial institutions for each reporting period will be 30 June following the end of the reporting period. The information that must be reported for each reportable account for each reporting period is: • identity information (including the tax residence) for each non-resident account holder and (if applicable) controlling person; and • financial information, including the account balance or value as at the end of the reporting period, and specified income earned (such as interest) and distributions made during the reporting period. If a financial institution is unable to determine the status of a pre-existing account, in specified circumstances it will be required to report the account as an “undocumented account”. Grace periods for due diligence Each annual CRS reporting period ends on 31 March. Accounts identified as reportable during a reporting period are to be reporting on to Inland Revenue by the following 30 June. However, to provide financial institutions with as much time as possible for conducting due diligence of pre-existing accounts, a grace period of three months applies beyond the 31 March reporting period end date for the first two years of CRS reporting. • The deadline for completing due diligence of pre-existing high value individual accounts is 30 June 2018 (rather than 31 March 2018). • Similarly, the deadline for completing due diligence of all other pre-existing accounts (that is, lower value individual accounts and all entity accounts) has been set at 30 June 2019 (rather than 31 March 2019). Crucially, however: • the 30 June reporting deadline still applies, meaning that due diligence and reporting to Inland Revenue must both be completed by 30 June; and 9 Generally, lower value accounts are those with an account balance that does not exceed US$1 million. 10 However, by virtue of the 1 July 2017 start date, the duration of the first period (from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) will be nine rather than 12 months. 4 • accounts identified as reportable during each grace period must be included in the reporting period to which the grace period relates (this is referred to as a “carry-back rule”) . Thus, due diligence reviews of pre-existing high value individual accounts and all reporting for these accounts must be completed by 30 June 2018. The carry-back rule means that the account balance or value to be reported will be as at 31 March 2018, and income to be reported will be income earned in the period ending 31 March 2018. Similarly, due diligence reviews of all other pre-existing accounts (lower value individual accounts and all entity accounts) and reporting for these accounts must be completed by 30 June 2019. The carry-back rule means that the account balance or value to be reported will be as at 31 March 2019, and income to be reported will be income earned in the period ending 31 March 2019. An exception to the carry-back rule applies if the account would not have been reportable before 31 March. This could happen, for example, if the account holder’s status changed fro m non-reportable (for example, New Zealand resident) to reportable (for example, non- resident) after 31 March. In such a case, if the account was identified as reportable in the period from 1 April to 30 June, it would not need to be reported until the following 31 March (rather than the previous 31 March). CRS optionality Some optionality is contemplated under the CRS and OECD Commentary. For example, the CRS provides that pre-existing entity accounts should not be reviewed unless the account balance or value exceeds US$250,000. However, the OECD Commentary provides implementing jurisdictions the option of ignoring this de minimis threshold. The implementation legislation generally allows financial institutions the discretion to adopt the option that best suits their circumstances. However, the legislation wit hholds so me options for New Zealand. These are the two key “excluded choices”: • The reporting period to be used by all New Zealand financial institutions is the year ending 31 March. • The CRS “wider approach” to due diligence will be mandatory for all New Zealand financial institutions. These excluded choices are explained further below. Compliance framework The CRS requires implementing jurisdictions to introduce rules for ensuring compliance. These include anti-avoidance rules and effective sanctions for addressing non-compliance. To meet this requirement, the implementation legislation includes a compliance framework with an anti-avoidance rule and certain penalt ies. The compliance framework applies to financial institutions and also extends to other persons and entities that hold or control accounts with such institutions, or that otherwise act as intermediaries in relation to accounts. 5 This reflects the fact that effective implementation of the CRS requires a chain of information effectively flowing from account holders, controlling persons and intermediaries, to financial institutions and then to Inland Revenue (for international exchange). Background International context and New Zealand’s commitment to implement AEOI To date, 101 jurisdictions have committed to implement AEOI wit h a view to complet ing first exchanges by 30 September 2018 at the latest. This includes: • all G20 and OECD member countries; and • all other jurisdictions identified by the G20 or OECD as having or operating as an international finance centre. Jurisdictions other than those identified above can also implement the AEOI standard, but will not be subject to implementation deadlines (unless they are subsequently identified by the G20 or OECD as an emerging tax risk). As an OECD member, New Zealand has made an international commitment to implement AEOI and to complete its first international informat ion exchanges by the 30 September 2018 deadline. Of the 101 committed jurisdictions, 55 have committed to complete their first exchanges by 30 September 2017. These are generally referred to as early adopters. The other 46 jurisdictions (which includes New Zealand and Australia) are working towards the 30 September 2018 deadline. The success of the global AEOI initiative depends on jurisdictions implementing consistent rules, to a similar implementation timeline. Otherwise there is a high risk of the offshore tax evasio n problem merely relocating to jurisdictions that lag behind or implement to a lesser standard. To ensure consistency and timeliness, the OECD’s global tax body, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (“Glo bal Forum”), will lead peer reviews and other forms of monitoring to ensure that jurisdictions correctly implement the AEOI standard in a timely manner. The Global Forum will report the outcome o f it s reviews to the G20, which is positioned to apply possible sanctions against non-complying jurisdictions, if necessary. Relation to other international initiatives AEOI is a stand-alone initiative, but is related to other international developments aimed at improving transparency frameworks and tax compliance. In particular, the CRS reflects (and is largely based on) the US FATCA initiative, which New Zealand implemented in 2014. The CRS builds off the FATCA initiative in a number of ways. For example, both regimes have broadly similar types of ent it ies, financial institutions, financial accounts, due diligence procedures (including sometimes allowing financial institutions to rely on anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism “know your customer” (“AML”) procedures and other account information that they already hold), and reporting requirements. 6 However, there are some differences between the regimes. Below are some key examples. • FATCA due diligence is focused on identifying “US persons” (which includes US citizens as well as residents). CRS due diligence applies only to non-residents and not foreign citizens. 11 • FATCA contains a number of de minimis exclusions from due diligence and reporting. The CRS generally does not have such exclusions. The one exception to this is for pre- existing entity accounts, where the threshold exemption is US$250,000, unless the financial institution chooses to opt out of the threshold. • FATCA compliance is buttressed by a 30% withholding tax to apply to US-sourced income for non-compliance. This does not apply to the CRS. The CRS therefore requires implementing jurisdictions to have a legal and operational compliance framework in place to verify compliance, penalise non-compliance and counter potential CRS avoidance arrangements. In addit ion, FATCA implementation involved the incorporation of the necessary due diligence and reporting rules (which are set out in a treaty-level instrument) 12 into New Zealand law by regulations. 13 The CRS is not a treaty-level instrument, and incorporation into New Zealand law therefore requires specific legislation. Other elements of the AEOI standard As noted, the CRS is the element of the overall AEOI standard that sets out the due diligence and reporting obligations for financial inst itutions of participating jurisdictions. The other elements of the AEOI standard generally relate to the exchange of AEOI information between jurisdictions. This includes model competent authority agreements and the data schema to be used for exchanges. A common IT solution for encrypting and transmitting data between jurisdictions, referred to as the Common Transmission Standard, is also being developed by the OECD. All exchanges of information with other jurisdictions will be made under New Zealand’s tax treaties. The legal instruments for exchange Any form of tax treaty can potentially be used to make AEOI exchanges. However, the G20 and OECD have promoted the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (“Mult ilateral Convent ion”) as the principal treaty to be used for this purpose. 11 As explained in the detailed analysis section, the legislation makes the CRS option of the “wider approach” to due diligence mandatory for all New Zealand financial institutions. This means CRS due diligence in New Zealand will focus on identifying all foreign tax residents, rather than only the residents of implementing jurisdictions. 12 An Intergovernmental Agreement between New Zealand and the US. The agreement is available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties/united-states-america#iga . 13 The Double Tax Agreements (United States of America-FATCA) Order 2014. 7 New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention in 2012. It was given legal effect in New Zealand on 21 October 2013 by an Order in Council made under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Section BH 1 authorises the making of an Order in Council to give legal effect to a “double tax agreement”. As that term is defined, and under statutory legal principles, the reference to double tax agreement in section BH 1 can apply to a wide range of tax treaty types, including multilateral treaties. However, this was not immediately obvious from the wording. This has led to some claims that the Multilateral Convention was not correctly given legal effect in New Zealand. Although a legal challenge to the validity of the Order in Council giving effect to the Multilateral Convention is unlikely to be successful, any uncertainty is undesirable. Moreover, additional multilateral treaties may need to be given effect under section BH 1 in the future. Accordingly, the legislation includes a retrospective amendment to section BH 1 to put the matter beyond doubt, by clarifying that it also applies to mult ilateral treaties. The definition of “foreign account information-sharing agreement”, in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, has also been amended to specifically include the Multilateral Convention. This supports the change made to section BH 1 with a reference to the Multilateral Convention being brought into force by an Order in Council made under section BH 1. It also clearly links the Multilateral Convention (and other applicable tax treaties) to the agreements to which Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies. Article 6 of the Multilateral Convention authorises automatic exchanges of informat ion (as opposed to other forms of exchange, such as on request). It provides that automatic exchanges must be subject to detailed terms as agreed between “competent authorities”. To give effect to the Article 6 requirement for competent authorities to agree the detailed terms of automatic exchanges for AEOI, the OECD developed an administrative instrument referred to as the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (“MCAA”). New Zealand signed the MCAA in 2015. 15 Competent authorities are generally specific persons or authorities nominated by each treaty partner to administer the treaty. The competent authority under New Zealand’s tax treaties is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 16 In addition to other important details, such as the manner of exchanges and rules, and procedures around maintaining confidentiality of exchanged data, the MCAA specifies the actual information to be exchanged between the parties. The MCAA also has a notification mechanism, which enables each party to confirm the actual jurisdictions that it will exchange with (see explanation of “reportable jurisdictions” below), and the timing of exchanges with each of those jurisdictions. This notification mechanism is administered by the OECD, and will be publicised online on the OECD’s AEOI portal. 17 14 Details about the Multilateral Convention are available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties/convention-mutual-administrative-assistance-tax-matters . 15 For information about the MCAA see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/. 16 The Commissioner may delegate competent authority status. 17 See http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/. 8 New Zealand will provide notifications on reportable jurisdictions when its list of reportable jurisdictions is finalised. 18 Application dates The legislative amendment to section BH 1, clarifying that the section applies in the case of multilateral treaties, has retrospective application from 21 October 2013. As noted above, this is to put beyond doubt that section BH 1 applies to the Multilateral Convention (which has had legal effect in New Zealand since 21 October 2013). Otherwise, the legislative amendments come into force from the date of Royal assent. Detailed analysis This special report outlines and explains the legislative changes at a relatively high level. Inland Revenue is supplementing this report with comprehensive guidance that will deal with the application of the AEOI standard and this implementation legislation at a detailed technical level. Incorporating the CRS and OECD Commentary into New Zealand law The due diligence procedures and reporting requirements set out in the CRS are supplemented by a comprehensive OECD Commentary. Rewriting the CRS’s rules into domestic law in a way that ensures consistency with the OECD Commentary could risk inadvertent differences and gaps between the CRS/OECD Commentary and the domestic implementation legislation. Moreover, the CRS and OECD Commentary will almost certainly be subject to future change, as deficiencies and improvements are identified, and in response to possible changes in future taxpayer behaviour. To ensure that the CRS is correctly incorporated into New Zealand law, and reduce the risk of deficiencies being identified during international peer review, the AEOI standard has been incorporated into domest ic law by direct reference to the CRS and the OECD Commentary, as published. To facilitate the incorporation of the CRS by reference, three key definitions have been inserted into section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • “CRS publication”, which refers to the official OECD publication that includes the full AEOI standard (the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters); 19 • “CRS standard”, referring to Part IIB of the CRS publication, which is where the CRS is located; and 18 The mechanism for confirming New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions is covered further below. 19 This publication is available on the OECD website at http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/standard-for- automatic-exchange-of-financial-account-information-for-tax-matters-9789264216525-en.htm. Inland Revenue will issue a New Zealand version of the CRS on its website, with all domestic law modifications (such as key dates and the wider approach to due diligence) included. 9 • “CRS applied standard”, meaning the CRS standard as modified by section 185O and Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 20 As noted, the CRS must be interpreted and applied consistently with the official OECD Commentary, which is in Part IIIB of the CRS publication. New section 185O(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 incorporates that requirement into New Zealand law. Importantly, the definition of CRS standard includes the words “as amended from time to time”. This means that future changes to the CRS will generally flow through into New Zealand legislation automatically. The CRS is an international standard, and New Zealand’s compliance with it will be peer reviewed by the OECD’s Global Forum. The G20 has stated its intention to apply sanctions, when appropriate, in response to identified non-compliance. This applies equally to any future changes to the CRS. Therefore, the automatic flow-through of future changes into New Zealand law is considered to be appropriate. As a safeguard, however, new section 226E allows Orders in Council to be made, if necessary, to facilitate, block or defer particular CRS changes. Note that section 185O(3)(b) also states “as amended at the time”, thereby ensuring that future changes to the OECD Commentary also automatically apply. Other definitions The approach of incorporating the AEOI implementation legislation into existing Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 involves merging the AEOI rules into the concept of a foreign account information-sharing agreement, on which Part 11B is based. To achieve this, the definition of “foreign account information-sharing agreement” (in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) has been amended to include the Multilateral Convention (which, as noted above, will be the tax treaty predominantly used for AEOI exchanges). The CRS itself contains a large number of specific definitions. Generally, the approach of incorporating the CRS into New Zealand law by reference will ensure that these definitions will automat ically apply in the application of the CRS in New Zealand. However, in case of a conflict between a CRS definition and a defined term in the Inland Revenue Acts, a rule has been inserted at new section 185O(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that when applying the CRS standard, the CRS definit io n will generally take precedence. The OECD Commentary specifies that two terms (“passive income” and “maintain”) are to take their domestic law meaning, but they must also include certain things. To ensure that the full meaning set out in the OECD Commentary will apply in New Zealand, specific definit ions of these terms have been included in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 20 The legislation modifies the CRS to clarify the application of options, dates (such as the dates that are to apply for due diligence and reporting purposes) and other items as necessary. 10 Other amendments in section 3(1) to ensure the legislation works correctly include new definit ions of “information” (to clarify that it includes a self-certification) and “taxpayer identification number” (to clarify the application to a functional equivalent number in a foreign jurisdiction). A new term “FATCA agreement” has also been introduced in section 3, as a means of differentiating between FATCA and AEOI in Part 11B. Framework for CRS obligations Because the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations are incorporated into New Zealand law by reference, the legislation generally does not need to detail specific obligations. Rather, the AEOI implementation legislation is primarily concerned with establishing the framework under which the CRS obligations will apply in New Zealand. Section 185O sets out the specific modifications to be made to the CRS standard for application in New Zealand (as the CRS applied standard). Section 185N of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies the obligations to financial inst itutions. Section 185P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies the obligations to persons or entities other than financial institutions (such as account holders, controlling persons or intermediaries). Some complexity arises from the fact that the CRS treats certain legal arrangements (particularly trusts and partnerships) as entities. As this does not match New Zealand law, section 185Q provides that any obligations in the CRS that apply to an entity are to apply to the relevant natural person in the New Zealand context. (For example, for trusts, the obligations will apply to the trustees, and for partnerships, each partner.) The framework is supplemented by amendments to section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that insert specific record-keeping requirements in relation to compliance with Part 11B of the Act. This includes a specific requirement for financial institutions that are subject to Part 11B to: • keep a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification; and • keep a record of the steps taken and evidence relied upon in meeting obligations under Part 11B relating to the CRS applied standard. 21 Modifications to the CRS Section 185O(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a number of specific modifications are set out in new Schedule 2 to the Tax Administration Act 1994. (These are detailed further below.) 21 This is required each CRS reporting period, irrespective of whether or not the financial institution has any CRS information that is required to be reported to Inland Revenue. 11 Section 185O(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the CRS is to be applied consistently with the OECD Commentary, as amended at the time. Section 185O(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 effectively provides that a CRS definit ion will prevail in any conflict with a domestic law definit io n. Section 185O(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 generally permits financial institutions to make elections contemplated in and consistent with the CRS and OECD Commentary. Section 185O(6) provides that after making an election, the person or entity must meet the requirements of the CRS applied standard consistently wit h that election. Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 New Schedule 2 makes the following specific modifications to the CRS: • Item 1 clarifies that references in the CRS to reporting period and calendar year should generally mean a 12-month reporting period ending 31 March. • Items 2 and 3 mandate the use of the wider approach for due diligence. This is an important compliance minimisation option offered to implementing jurisdictions in the CRS. It is explained below, in the section “The wider approach”. • Item 4 withdraws a choice available in the CRS to allow a transit io nal period for the introduction of a requirement to report gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets. The reasons for this are explained below under “Excluded choices”. • Items 5 to 10 set out various due diligence timeframes that apply for the different types of pre-existing accounts. • Item 11 provides an option relating to certain employer-sponsored group insurance contracts or annuity contracts. • Item 12 provides that dollar amounts referred to in the CRS (which are in US currency), can be treated as being in New Zealand dollars. • Items 13 and 22 to 24 all link to the lists of New Zealand’s participating jurisdictions, reportable jurisdictions, non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts, which will need to be published. This is explained below. • Item 14 sets out the date at which a credit card issuer is required to implement various defined policies and procedures in order to be a “qualified credit card issuer” as defined in the CRS. • Items 15 and 16 set out various dates from which collective investment vehicles must no longer issue physical shares in bearer form and by which they must have policies in place to ensure that such shares are redeemed or immobilised in order to be an “exempt collective investment vehicle” as defined in the CRS. • Items 17 and 18 define “pre-existing account” and “new account”. The definition of pre-existing account incorporates the option in the CRS to apply the due diligence procedures for pre-existing accounts to new accounts opened by pre-existing customers in circumstances permitted in the CRS. • Items 19 and 20 set out dates that apply for determining whether a pre-existing individual account is a “lower value account” or a “high value account”. 12 • Item 21 sets out a deadline date by which a financial institution is required to implement defined policies and procedures in order for a type of overpaid depository account to be an “excluded account”. • Item 25 replaces the definit io n o f the term “related entity” in the CRS wit h the optional definit ion (at paragraph 82 of Section VIII) in the OECD Commentary. The replacement definit io n of related entity generally refers to whether an entity is controlled by another entity, or whether two entities are under common control, or whether two managed investment entities are under common management. Much of new Schedule 2 is concerned with inserting the key CRS implementation dates and timeframes that are to apply in New Zealand. These include the date on which CRS obligations begin, dates for determining whether a financial account is a new account or a pre- existing account, and the deadlines for financial institutions to complete due diligence and reporting. In the CRS and OECD Commentary, these dates have generally been left open for each implementing jurisdiction to insert via domestic implementing law (subject to meeting international expectations). In addition, because New Zealand’s reporting period is different from the default calendar year reporting period in the CRS, a rule is included to ensure that all references to reporting period and calendar year are to be read in the context of the New Zealand tax year (unless the context requires otherwise). Obligations of financial institutions The CRS provides that a financial institution that is resident (as that concept applies for CRS purposes) in a jurisdiction will be subject to CRS obligations in that jurisdiction. However, a branch of a New Zealand-resident financial institution located outside of New Zealand is excluded from the rules. Conversely, a branch of a non-resident financial institution located in New Zealand is subject to the New Zealand rules. These fundamental rules are repeated in section 185N(1) and (2). The CRS also includes a complex series of definitions that set out the actual criteria for identifying financial institutions. For CRS purposes, the term “financial institution” is broadly defined. It extends beyond traditional financial institutions (such as banks) to a wide range of entities that would not normally be considered to be financial institutions (for example, it will include some professionally managed trusts). However, the CRS also specifies a number of categories of financial institution that pose a low risk of being used to facilitate offshore tax evasion, and which therefore are excluded fro m the due diligence and reporting obligations. These are defined as “non-reporting financial institutions”. Section 185N(3) provides that a financial institution must comply with the due diligence and reporting obligations set out in the CRS applied standard. 13 Section 185N(4) imposes an annual reporting deadline for financial institutions of 30 June following the 31 March reporting period end date. Consistent with the timeframes in the CRS and OECD Commentary for completing due diligence of pre-existing accounts, section 185N(5) sets a deadline of 30 June 2018 for due diligence and reporting on pre-existing high value individual accounts, and 30 June 2019 for due diligence and reporting for all other pre-existing accounts. Otherwise, section 185N(5) includes a general rule for the timing of reports in respect of an account identified as reportable during a particular reporting period. Section 185N also includes other supplementary rules that clarify the application of certain options in the CRS. Obligations of persons other than financial institutions Section 185P extends CRS obligations to persons other than financial institutions. This reflects the fact that financial institutions will often be required to collect documentation and information directly or indirectly from account holders (and sometimes the controlling persons of the account) in order to comply with their CRS obligations. This includes circumstances when the institution has a customer relationship with an intermediary that holds an account for the benefit of an account holder and, potentially, other controlling persons. This requires an efficient transfer of information from those account holders and other persons directly or indirectly to the financial inst itution. Financial institutions are required to obtain documentation and information from customers on account opening. 22 However, they may face challenges in obtaining necessary documentation and information from customers in other circumstances. For example, a pre- existing customer may not respond to a written request for information. There may also be difficulties obtaining documentation and information from persons connected with particular types of accounts, such as trust accounts. To assist compliance, section 185P imposes an obligation on such customers and other persons or entities, to obtain and provide any information that the financial inst itution requests fro m them, directly or indirectly, that is needed to satisfy the institution’s CRS due diligence obligations. Section 185P also requires customers and other relevant persons or ent it ies to provide updates on any material change in circumstances that they are aware of that may affect their status as a reportable person. For example, if a customer has provided a self-certification to a financial institution that they are a New Zealand resident, and they subsequently become non-resident, that change of residence status should be notified to the financial institution. Record-keeping obligations The CRS specifically requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules in place that require financial institutions to keep records of the steps undertaken, and any evidence relied upon, in meeting their CRS obligations. 22 Inland Revenue’s technical guidance will contain specific guidance on this point. 14 This requirement is covered by the introduction of specific rules in section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These include a requirement for a financial institution to keep a record if they cannot obtain a required self-certification. The new record-keeping requirements will assist Inland Revenue in verifying compliance with the CRS and addressing any non-compliance (including considering penalties). Optionality Although the success of the AEOI global initiative depends on jurisdictions implementing similar rules, the CRS provides implementing jurisdictions with a number of options. These options have been developed with a view to minimising compliance costs for financial inst itutions in areas that are not considered likely to compromise the effectiveness of the CRS. The circumstances of each financial institution can differ markedly, meaning that financial institutions may have different preferences as to whether these options should be adopted. Accordingly, the implementation legislation generally allows each financial institution to decide whether to adopt any particular option offered in the CRS. Some of the specific choices available to financial institutions are set out in section 185N. Otherwise, subsections 185O(5) and 185O(6) generally provide that a financial institution may make an election that is expressed as being available to them (under the CRS and the Inland Revenue Acts). Excluded choices Section 185N(11) provides that the optionality in the CRS for alternative reporting periods, and in the OECD Commentary for the use of average balances rather than period-end balances, will not be available to financial institutions. In these two cases, a particular choice will be mandated for all financial inst itutions: • CRS reporting period – the reporting period to be used in New Zealand will be the 12- month period ending 31 March. 23 This is consistent with the New Zealand tax year and the reporting period adopted by New Zealand for FATCA purposes. The period ending 31 March must be adopted by all financial institutions. • Average balances – the OECD Co mmentary provides that jurisdict ions that alread y require financial institutions to report average account balances can permit their financial institutions to maintain this approach for CRS, rather than reporting period- end balances. This does not apply in New Zealand. However, for clarity, the implementation legislation expressly provides that this option is not available to New Zealand financial institutions. An addit io nal excluded cho ice is set out at item 4 of Schedule 2. This relates to an option available in the CRS to allow a transitional period for the introduction of a requirement to report gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets in relation to a custodial account. On this point there is a mismatch between the CRS and the exchange commitments set out in the MCAA, where this is not allowed as an option. Therefore this has been specifically set out as an excluded choice. 23 Given New Zealand’s 1 July 2017 start date, the first CRS reporting period will be a nine-month transitional period from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018. 15 The wider approach The wider approach to CRS due diligence An important option offered in the CRS is use of the wider approach to CRS due diligence. This option addresses the practical issue that the CRS prima facie requires financial institutions to only identify persons that are tax-resident in reportable jurisdictions (that is, jurisdictions that New Zealand has a commitment to provide CRS information to). Over time, additional jurisdictions will join the initiative and become reportable jurisdictions. Without specific rules, each new jurisdiction joining could trigger a new round of due diligence reviews of accounts by financial inst itutions. To avoid this problem, and to minimise compliance costs, the CRS includes an option for implementing jurisdictions to adopt a wider approach to due diligence. Under this approach, a jurisdiction’s financial institutions would collect and retain CRS information for all non- residents ident ified, rather than just for residents of reportable jurisdictions. The CRS implementation legislation adopts the wider approach to due diligence. To ensure consistency, and to prevent a competitive disadvantage for any financial institution, this approach will be mandatory for all financial institutions. This modification to the CRS standard is made at item 2 of the new Schedule 2. The wider approach to CRS reporting The wider approach to due diligence means that financial institutions will prima facie need to sort the collected data to determine which non-resident accounts need to be reported to Inland Revenue. However, for CRS reporting, the implementation legislation allows a wider approach option for financial institutions to report all of the information to Inland Revenue. That is, financial institutions may choose to report information for all financial accounts held or controlled by a non-resident, not just those that are residents of reportable jurisdictions. Financial institutions that adopt the wider approach reporting option will effectively pass the responsibility for sorting their non-resident data on to Inland Revenue, potentially saving compliance costs. Inland Revenue will be responsible for determining the information to be exchanged with reportable jurisdictions. The wider approach to reporting option is set out in section 185N(7). Section 185N(8) effectively provides that, once a financial institution elects to adopt the wider approach for a reporting period, it must report on that basis for that period. This “permitted choice” rule is consistent with the approach adopted for FATCA. Determinations and regulatory powers The terms “participating jurisdiction” and “reportable jurisdiction” are key concepts in the application of the CRS. The CRS requires New Zealand to publish lists of its participating jurisdictions and reportable jurisdictions. 16 The CRS also provides carve-outs from due diligence and reporting obligations for “non- reporting financial institutions” and “excluded accounts” that pose a low risk of being used for tax evasion purposes. Some generic categories of these are set out in the CRS. However, the CRS also provides that certain other financial institutions and accounts can be subject to the carve-outs, provided they are approved by Inland Revenue as meeting specified criteria. New Zealand’s lists of participating jurisdictions, reportable jurisdictions, approved non- reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts will be published by a mix of Commissioner’s determinations and regulat ions. Participating jurisdictions A participating jurisdiction is generally one that has implemented AEOI and that will provide CRS information to other jurisdictions. More specifically, New Zealand’s participating jurisdictions will be those with which an exchange agreement is in place for that jurisdiction to provide CRS information to New Zealand. The CRS contains rules that require a financial institution to look through prescribed entities (referred to in the CRS as “passive NFEs”) to determine the natural persons that are its ultimate controlling persons. This look-through rule extends to certain investment entities that are not from participating jurisdictions. This means that New Zealand’s list of participating jurisdictions will impact on the entit y account holders that New Zealand financial institutions will need to look through to identify any ultimate controlling persons. New section 91AAU of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue may make a determination about whether a particular jurisdiction is a participating jurisdiction. The provision authorises the Commissioner to limit, amend, suspend or withdraw a determination. It will take time to confirm whether all jurisdictions that have committed to implementing AEOI have correctly carried through with their commitments. As a transitional measure, the OECD has permitted jurisdictions to tentatively treat all jurisdictions that have made international commitments to implement AEOI/CRS as participating jurisdictions. New Zealand will adopt this approach. However, the transitional measure is only to apply for a limited time, and jurisdictions are required to publish final lists by 30 June 2017. Given that New Zealand’s start date is 1 July 2017, the intended approach is to publish a transitional list that will apply for the first reporting period (1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) and then a final list by 30 June 2017 that will apply from the beginning of the second reporting period (that is, from 1 April 2018). Reportable jurisdictions A participating jurisdiction is one that provides CRS informat ion. A reportable jurisdiction is one that also wants to receive CRS information. Not all participating jurisdictions will be reportable jurisdictions. For example, some participating jurisdictions may not have a tax system 24 and therefore have no need to receive information. 24 For example, some smaller economies that are international finance centres. 17 In general, international expectations are that AEOI/CRS information will be provided to all jurisdictions that have signed the MCAA on the basis that they wish to receive such information. However, the OECD acknowledges that this raises potential concerns about confidentiality and data security. AEOI/CRS exchanges will comprise sensitive personal and financial information. The terms of the legal instruments under which the information will be exchanged require this information to be used only for specified (tax) purposes and disclosed only to specified persons for such purposes. Many jurisdictions have been exchanging such sensitive information for many years, have robust laws, processes and systems in place for ensuring exchanged data is kept secure and is only used for legitimate purposes, and have a track record of maintaining confidentiality in respect of exchanged information. However, some jurisdictions that are implementing the AEOI standard have had little, or no, prior experience in exchange of information for tax purposes. Implementing jurisdictions may decide not to provide information to a particular jurisdiction if they have genuine concerns about confidentiality and/or data security. However, such decisions cannot be used to frustrate the purposes of the CRS. This is a difficult balancing act. To assist, the Global Forum is conducting specific reviews of jurisdictions’ confidentiality and data safeguards, and is making its conclusions available to jurisdictions implementing the AEOI standard. A new section 226D in the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a regulation-making power for determining New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions. This will ensure that the New Zealand Government retains oversight and control over adding or removing jurisdictions from New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions list. To ensure that, in the case of any serious breach, exchange of information with a particular jurisdiction can be swiftly suspended, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be authorised to make a determination to temporarily suspend that jurisdiction as a reportable jurisdiction. This determination-making power is contained in new section 91AAV (and its effect on the regulation, in section 226D(5)). The section 91AAV determination power will only exist as a contingency to ensure that the time taken to make an Order in Council to suspend a jurisdiction does not result in a legal obligation to provide information despite a serious breach of confidentiality. Any determination made under section 91AAV will need to be subsequently confirmed by Order in Council or it will lapse. Non-reporting financial institutions As noted above, non-reporting financial institutions are not subject to CRS due diligence or reporting. The CRS provides for so me generic categories of financial institution that will be non-reporting financial institutions. However, there is also a category of low risk financial institutions that an implementing jurisdiction can itself determine. These must meet certain specified criteria in the CRS, must be confirmed by the implementing jurisdiction in a published list, and must meet a final test of not frustrating the purposes of the CRS. 18 New section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a determination as to whether a particular financial institution, or type of financial institution, is a non-reporting financial institution. The provision allows the Commissioner to limit, amend, suspend or withdraw a determination. All determinations made under this provision must be published. Certain low risk excluded accounts Similarly, excluded accounts are not subject to CRS due diligence or reporting. A number of generic categories of excluded account are set out in the CRS. There is also an additional category of low risk accounts that an implementing jurisdiction can determine. However, these must also meet specified criteria in the CRS, must be confirmed by the implementing jurisdiction in a published list, and must meet a final test of not frustrating the purposes of the CRS. Section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994 also provides for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a determination as to whether a particular financial account, or type of financial account, is an excluded account. The provision allows the Commissioner to limit, amend, suspend or withdraw a determination. All determinations made under this provision must be published. Enforcement The CRS requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules and procedures in place to ensure compliance and address non-compliance. This includes having appropriate anti-avoidance rules, record-keeping requirements, compliance programmes and effective sanctions to address identified non-compliance (including countering avoidance arrangements). Accordingly, the legislation includes a comprehensive suite of enforcement rules and penalties. The penalties that can be imposed on financial institutions for not complying with CRS obligations are as follows. “Absolute liability” penalties Under subsection 142H(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $300 applies if a financial institution does not comply with any CRS due diligence or reporting requirement. However, subsection 142H(2) provides that this penalty will not be imposed if the failure was due to circumstances beyond a financial institution’s control. Under subsection 142H(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $300 applies if a financial institution does not obtain a self-certification on opening of a new account, when this is required by the CRS. Under subsections 142H(2) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a transitional period (until 30 June 2019) will apply during which penalties under subsections 142H(1) and (3) will not be imposed if the financial institution is able to demonstrate that it: • made reasonable efforts to comply with its CRS due diligence and reporting obligations; and • corrected the failure within a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of it. 19 Under subsection 142H(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the penalties that may be imposed under sections 142H(1) and (3) must not exceed $10,000 per reporting period. “Negligence” penalties Under subsection 142H(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $20,000 for a first offence and $40,000 for any subsequent offence, may be imposed when a financial institution fails to take reasonable care in complying with its CRS due diligence and reporting requirements. Under subsection 142H(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the penalties that may be imposed under section 142H(5) must not exceed $100,000 per reporting period. Intentional non-compliance “Knowledge offences” by financial institutions will be subject to existing criminal penalties under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under section 142H, civil absolute liability penalties and negligence penalties may not be imposed for the same offence. Information providers The penalties for financial institutions are also backed with specific obligations and penalties that apply to “information providers” who are account holders, controlling persons, or persons that otherwise hold accounts for the benefit of others (including trusts and intermediaries). Under section 142I(2)(a)–( h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $1,000 can be imposed on an information provider for each offence relating to a request for information (such as providing a false self-certification or not providing a self-certification within a reasonable period of time). Under section 142I(2)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a civil penalty of $1,000 can also be imposed on an information provider for not informing Inland Revenueproviding notification 25 of a material change in circumstances within a reasonable time. However, under subsections 142I(3) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the imposition of the above penalties is subject to a “no fault” defence (for a failure to provide information or a self-certification within the control of the information provider) and a “reasonable efforts” defence (for a failure to provide information or a self-certification relating to another person or entity and not within the control of the information provider). Other enforcement amendments Section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to enable Inland Revenue to impose any of the civil penalties under sections 142H and 142I by issuing a notice of assessment (that is, without first having to issue a notice of proposed adjustment). Section 143 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to ensure that criminal “absolute liability” penalties cannot be imposed under that section for non-compliance wit h 25 Correction made on 4 April 2017. The special report published on 28 February 2017 incorrectly stated that Inland Revenue must be informed. However, the obligation to inform is to the person or entity that made the request. 20 Part 11B of the Act. (This is because sections 142H and 142I of the Act provide for absolute liability penalties.) In addition, section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to enable criminal “knowledge” penalties to be imposed for knowingly failing to provide information or a self-certification. As advised, specific record-keeping obligations relating to compliance with Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been inserted into section 22(2) of the Act. An anti-avo idance provision that will apply to CRS arrangements and practices entered into or by financial institutions, persons or intermediaries with “a main purpose” of avoiding an obligation under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, has been inserted into the Act as new section 185R. “Reasonable efforts” to comply The mix of transitional measures and available defences included in the above rules reflects the fact that the rules are complex, that financial institutions face short implementation timelines, and that there is therefore a risk of inadvertent error by financial institutions and information providers. The intended approach is that for the first two years, reasonable efforts by financial institutions to comply will be recognised. For that time, sanctions will generally only be imposed in cases of intentional non-compliance or lack of reasonable care. FATCA-related amendments For consistency, the legislation also extends certain CRS obligations to FATCA. These include: • aligning the FATCA anti-avoidance rule with the AEOI/CRS anti-avo idance rule (wit h application to any person with an obligation under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994); • extending the record-keeping obligations in respect of Part 11B to FATCA as well as AEOI/CRS; and • providing for the imposition of the same obligations and penalties on persons other than financial institutions (information providers) under FATCA as for AEOI/CRS. 21
February 2017 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Simplified business tax processes This special report provides early information on changes to business tax rules contained in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, enacted on 21 February 2017. This special report covers changes to: • modify the application of use-of-money interest (UOMI) for taxpayers who make all but their last instalment of provisional tax using the standard “uplift” method; • increase the safe harbour from UOMI from $50,000 to $60,000 of residual income tax and extend the safe harbour to non-individual taxpayers; • allow contractors subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate; • extend the schedular payment rules to contractors who work for labour-hire firms; • allow contractors not covered by the schedular payment rules to enter voluntary withholding agreements; • prevent taxpayers from transferring tax to an earlier period that exceeds the amount in debt or in dispute in that period, and to clarify when UOMI starts and when a transfer takes effect for GST refunds and GST overpayments; • enable the Commissioner to offset any credits or refunds the taxpayer has against the taxpayer’s tax liability arising from a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner; • confirm that information required under a prescribed form can be provided verbally when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers it to be appropriate; • enable Inland Revenue to continue to administer the late payment penalty grace period during the period in which tax types are transitioned between Inland Revenue’s old FIRST system and new START software systems; and • modify the cancellation of interest rules, in certain circumstances. Information in this special report precedes complete coverage of the new legislation that will be published in a future edition o f the Tax Information Bulletin. 1 Safe harbour for all taxpayers using the standard provisional tax method Amendments have been made which modify the application of UOMI to taxpayers who make all but their last instalment of provisional tax using the standard method (commonly known as the standard “uplift” method). For these taxpayers, UOMI will no longer apply from the first instalment. Instead, it will commence from the date of the final instalment of provisional tax. Background Under the previous rules, taxpayers who used the standard method for paying provisional tax but exceeded the safe harbour threshold of $60,000 residual income tax were liable to UOMI from the first instalment when their residual income tax for that instalment differed from the amount paid. For taxpayers who cannot reasonably estimate their income (such as taxpayers with volatile or seasonal income) and who use the standard method, the previous rule could be unfair as provisio nal tax assumes a straight-line earning of income throughout a year. The new Act introduces a new rule so that where a taxpayer makes all their provisional tax instalments (except for the final instalment) using the standard method on the respective payment dates UOMI will only apply from the date of the final instalment on the difference between the residual income tax and the payments made. This change was announced by the Government in a pre-Budget release in April 2016 and the proposals consulted on in an officials’ issues paper, Making Tax Simpler – Better Business Tax, released in April 2016. Feedback following consultation at the select committee stage of the bill resulted in some changes to the technical detail of the proposal. These do not alter the policy intent of the original proposal. Key features For taxpayers who pay their provisional tax using the standard method and do not qualify for the safe harbour, UOMI will only apply from the date of the final instalment when: • the taxpayer has made all of their instalments (other than the final instalment) using the standard method; • has paid those instalments on or before the due date; • any provisional tax associates have also used the standard method for all of their instalments (other than the final instalment); and • there is no provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. For taxpayers using the standard method who do not meet the above criteria, UOMI will apply from the applicable instalment date on the lesser of the difference between: • the amount of residual income tax apportioned to the particular instalment date and the amount paid by the taxpayer; or 2 • the amount of the standard method instalment for the particular instalment date and the amount paid by the taxpayer. A “provisio nal tax associate” of a person (person A) is defined as fo llows: • If person A is a company, another company in the same wholly owned group as person A is a “provisional tax associate”. • If person A is a company, another person who has a direct or indirect shareholding interest in the company greater than 50 percent is a “provisional tax associate”. • If person A is not a company or is a company acting as a trustee, another person in which person A has a direct or indirect shareholding interest greater than 50 percent is a “provisional tax associate”. A provisional tax avoidance arrangement is an arrangement involving the manipulation of one or more amounts of residual income tax, including a zero amount of residual income tax, with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the UOMI provisio ns. It is intended to capture situations where taxpayers who are outside the “provisio nal tax associate” definition manipulate income between parties to avoid application of the UOMI rules. It is intended to apply only in cases of clear manipulation to remove parties from the UOMI rules. Application date The new UOMI rules for standard method taxpayers in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Detailed analysis A comprehensive UOMI regime applies to all provisional taxpayers who do not fall within a specified safe harbour. Where a taxpayer’s residual income tax apportioned over the number of provisional tax instalment dates differs from the amounts paid by the taxpayer, over or underpaid tax will arise and UOMI will apply to the difference. This applies even if a taxpayer has made the required instalments under the standard method. The standard method calculates instalments of provisional tax based on 105 percent of the prior year’s residual income tax liability or 110 percent of the year preceding the prior year depending on whether the taxpayer has filed their tax return for the prior year. Example 1 Wooley Shearers Limited (Wooley) provides shearing services to farmers. The company has difficulty estimating its provisional tax for the year as it charges by the weight of the wool and the amount of income derived depends on the growing rate of the sheep. In the 2017 income year Wooley has residual income tax of $260,000. Wooley has filed its 2017 tax return prior to the first instalment of provisional tax and decides to pay its 2018 provisional tax using the standard method. This will require it to pay three instalments of $91,000, which it does on the respective dates. Because of ideal wool-growing conditions, Wooley has a standout 2018 year and at the end of the year Wooley calculates its residual income tax as $390,000. This means that Wooley should have paid instalments of $130,000. Wooley will be charged UOMI on the difference between the instalments calculated by reference to their residual income tax and what they paid, being $39,000 ($130,000 - $91,000) for each instalment until the amount of the underlying tax and UOMI is paid. 3 New section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a new method for applying use of money interest for most standard method and some estimation method provisio nal taxpayers. The effect of the changes is that when a taxpayer pays the required instalments of provisional tax (excluding the final instalment) based on the standard method amount, no UOMI will apply to any over- or underpayment of tax until the due date for the final instalment. Example 2 Assuming the same facts for Wooley above, the new rules in section 120KBB will apply to Wooley because it paid its first two instalments based on the standard method on time, and assuming all the other requirements of section 120KBB are met, UOMI will still apply to Wooley because it has underpaid its tax at the final instalment date. However, it will only apply from that date on the difference between Wooley’s residual income tax for the year and the amount paid to the final instalment date. This means UOMI will be charged on the difference between $390,000 and $273,000, being $117,000, from the final instalment date until the underlying tax and applicable UOMI is paid. This means that a taxpayer who makes all their instalments (other than the final instalment) using the standard method and makes a final instalment which covers their residual income tax for the year will pay no UOMI for the year. Given the final instalment for provisional tax is some time after balance date it should be possible for taxpayers to determine with reasonable accuracy their tax liability for the year and avoid the application of UOMI by topping up any shortfall in tax paid by the final instalment. Example 3 Wooley again uses the standard method in the 2019 income year and under that method is required to make 3 instalments of $136,500 ((105 percent of $390,000)/3). It makes the first two instalments on time but just before the due date for the third instalment Wooley calculates that it has had another spectacular year and its residual tax liability for the year is actually $650,000. This means it should have made instalments of $216,667. Wooley decides not to pay the final instalment based on the standard method amount but rather makes a payment based on its estimate of its final tax liability for the year. Wooley makes a payment of $377,000 on the due date for the final instalment. When Wooley completes its tax return for the 2019 year it calculates its final tax liability for the year as $655,000. As Wooley has underpaid its tax for the 2019 income year it will be charged UOMI. Because Wooley has made all its instalments (other than the final instalment) using the standard method, and assuming all the other requirements of section 120KBB are complied with, Wooley will only be charged UOMI from the date of the final instalment until the tax and any UOMI is paid on the difference between Wooley’s residual income tax and the amount paid: $5,000 ($655,000 - 600,000). Who can use the new rules? A taxpayer must be an interest concession provisional taxpayer to use the new rules. This means they must be liable to pay provisional tax and: • use one of the standard methods described in section RC 5(2) or (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the tax year (commonly known as the “uplift” method); or 4 • use the estimation method described in section RC 5(5) but their payments of provisional tax on or before the instalment dates for the tax year other than the final instalment are not made under the estimation method and are equal to the amounts under the standard method. Essentially this means the person either uses the standard method for all of their instalments or the standard method for all instalments except the final one, which they estimate. This allows a person to estimate an amount higher or lower than the standard uplift at the final instalment date to account for actual results during the year. Given the final instalment is after the end of the income year, a reasonable level of accuracy should be able to be applied to this final instalment to minimise any UOMI. In addition, all provisional tax associates of the taxpayer must either be interest concession provisional taxpayers or use the GST ratio method for provisional tax, and there cannot be a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. Both definitions are discussed below. What if a taxpayer does not pay the instalment due? If a taxpayer does not pay the standard method instalments, UOMI will apply from the applicable instalment date on the lesser of: • one-third 1 of the amount of residual income tax for the year less the amount paid; or • the standard method instalment amount for the relevant instalment, less the amount paid. This will also apply when a particular instalment is paid late. The rule also differs from the previous rule, which charged UOMI on the difference between residual income tax and the amount paid for a particular instalment date. Example 4 Thomas Water Finers Limited (TWFL) is a consulting firm that provides consulting services to the agricultural sector in the use of beavers to assist in water irrigation for farmers in drought affected areas. TWFL has a March balance date. As beavers are not yet permitted into New Zealand, a lot of TWFL’s time is spent lobbying the Government to permit the introduction of beavers to New Zealand. Once the Government permits introduction of the rodents to New Zealand TWFL expects its income earning to skyrocket as farmers see the benefits that using beavers as natural irrigators can have, based on experience in Nevada where beavers are used to provide natural irrigation. In the 2018 income year TWFL had residual income tax liability of $55,000. Because of the uncertainty of the future of this innovative irrigation method, TWFL decides to use the standard method to pay provisional tax for the 2019 income year. It calculates it is required to make three instalments of $19,250 ((105%x$55,000)/3). TWFL pays its first instalment on time but between the first and second instalment dates the Government approves the introduction of beavers for irrigation schemes in New Zealand and TWFL’s workload increases dramatically. Because of this TWFL forget to make their second provisional tax instalment. At the date of the third instalment, TWFL realise they have missed the second instalment and also calculate that because of the massive increase in consulting revenue their year-end tax liability is expected to be $1,250,000. TWFL want to minimise the impact of UOMI and so, on the final instalment date, the company makes a payment based on the estimate of its final tax liability of $1,231,239. This is made up of the tax owing ($1,230,750) and $489 for UOMI on the second instalment. 1 Or other portion where the number of instalments is not three. 5 When it completes its tax return, TWFL calculates its final tax liability as $1,250,000, as it expected. Because TWFL did not make its second instalment on time it cannot use the concessionary rule in section 120KBB(2) for the missed instalment but instead must use the rule in section 120KBB(3) in relation to the missed instalment. This will require the company to pay UOMI on the lesser of: (a) 1 divided by the number of instalment dates for the income year multiplied by its residual income tax less the amount paid in relation to the instalment ((1/3x$1,250,000) -0 = $416,667); or (b) the amount the company is liable to pay in accordance with the standard method for that particular instalment ($19,250). The lesser of these amounts being (b), TWFL will be charged UOMI on $19,250 from the due date of the second instalment until the date that the tax and applicable UOMI is paid, which was the date of the third instalment ($489). TWFL may also be subject to late payment penalties. Who is a provisional tax associate? Under new section 120KBB all provisional tax associates of a taxpayer who wish to use the rules in section 120KBB are required to be an “interest concession provisional taxpayer” themselves or use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax. This is an anti- avoidance provision to stop related parties switching income between themselves to avoid the application of the UOMI rules. Example 5 De Jong Limited (DJ) is a consulting firm owned by Jeff Jazzy. Jeff undertakes all the work for DJ as a shareholder-employee and payments from DJ to him are not subject to PAYE. In the 2016 year DJ has residual income tax of $70,000 as all the income was held in the company that year. Jeff had no residual income tax. Over the next two years, assuming the same income level, but shifting it between DJ and Jeff, and alternating provisional tax calculation methods, no provisional tax is paid by either party, and there is no exposure to UOMI if the RIT is paid by the final instalment: Year 2017 2018 Method Prov amount RIT Method Prov amount RIT DJ Estimate Nil Nil Standard Nil $70,000 Jazzy, Jeff Not liable N/A $70,000 Estimate Nil Nil The rule will only apply to persons who are provisional tax associates of the person wishing to use the rules within section 120KBB. A “provisional tax associate” of person A is defined as fo llows: (i) If person A is a company, another company in the same wholly owned group of companies as person A is a “provisional tax associate”. (ii) If person A is a company, another person that is associated with person A under section YB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, treating section YB 3 as requiring 50 percent voting interests and market value interests instead of 25 percent, and ignoring section YB 3(3) and (4) (commonly known as the tripartite test), is a “provisional tax associate”. 6 (iii) If person A is not a company or is a company acting as a trustee, another person that is associated with person A, treating section YB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as requiring 50 percent voting interests and market value interests instead of 25 percent and also ignoring section YB 3(3) and (4) is a “provisional tax associate”. This definition will essentially capture wholly owned group companies and those who have, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater share in a company. Example 6 Charger Limited (Charger) is owned equally and run by its two shareholders Macintyre and Alistair Craig. Both draw shareholder-employee salaries from the company from which no PAYE is deducted. Charger wishes to use the concessionary rules in section 120KBB. All provisional tax associates must also be “interest concession provisional taxpayers”. As Macintyre and Alistair own 50 percent of the voting interest in Charger they will be required to be interest concession provisional taxpayers or use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax. Example 7 Morrissey Limited (Morrissey) is a procurement consulting company owned equally by four university friends who are not related. All the owners draw shareholder-employee salaries from the company from which no PAYE is deducted. Morrissey wishes to use the concessionary rules in section 120KBB. All provisional tax associates must also be interest concession provisional taxpayers or use the GST ratio method. As none of the four shareholders own 50 percent of the voting interest in Morrissey it can use the concessionary rules no matter what provisional tax method the shareholder-employees use. Example 8 Coronet Super Bee Limited (CSBL) produces honey from a special breed of bee. It has two subsidiary companies, Hummer Limited (Hummer) that operates the hives and Bel Air Limited (Bel Air) that bottles the honey. Hummer is 100 percent owned by CSBL but Bel Air is only 50 percent owned by CSBL with the other 50 percent owned by Pacer Limited, another honey producer who is unrelated to CSBL. Hummer would be required to be an interest concession taxpayer or use the GST ratio method to calculate its provisional tax for CSBL to use the concessionary rules in section 120KBB. What is a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement? To be able to use the concessionary rules in section 120KBB there cannot be a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement in relation to the person. This is defined in section 120KBB(4)(b) as being an arrangement involving the manipulation of one or more amounts of residual income tax, including a zero amount of residual income tax, with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the interest rules. This is designed to capture the situation where related taxpayers manipulate income between entities to avoid the application of UOMI. It is expected that most of the opportunity to defeat the intention of the UOMI rules have been sufficiently dealt with in the requirement that provisional tax associates use the same provisional tax method. However, there may be some cases that will sit outside that provision where manipulation occurs. 7 Example 9 Assume the same facts for the Morrissey Limited (Morrissey) example. As above the shareholders of Morrissey are not caught by the provisional tax associate rule. During the 2018 income year Morrissey uses the standard method to calculate its provisional tax liability. In the 2017 year Morrissey used the last of its prior year tax losses, which resulted in a residual income tax liability of $20,000 for the company. The shareholders meet and agree that for the 2018 year they will leave all the profits of the business within the company and will not take any shareholder salaries for the year. Morrissey pays its provisional tax instalments based on the standard uplift of $7,000 for each of the first two instalments. Prior to the third instalment it calculates its residual income tax for the year to be $240,000. It pays a final instalment on that estimated amount of $226,000. As it meets all the requirements of section 120KBB, UOMI will only apply from any unpaid tax at the final instalment. When Morrissey completes its 2018 tax return it calculates its residual income tax as $240,000 and no UOMI is payable. No provisional tax is payable by the four shareholders for the 2018 year. For the 2019 year the shareholders meet and agree that for the 2019 year they will pay out all the profits of Morrissey to the shareholders via shareholder salaries, which are not subject to PAYE. For the 2019 income year Morrissey estimates its provisional tax liability at zero. The shareholders are not liable for provisional tax. At the end of the 2019 income year the shareholders calculate that they each have residual income tax of $70,000 each. The shareholders are able to use the concessionary treatment in section 120KBB and pay the total amount of tax due by the due date for the final instalment. For the 2020 year the shareholders meet and agree to reverse the 2019 position and leave all the income in the company and receive no shareholder salaries. The shareholders estimate their provisional tax liability at zero and Morrissey is not liable to pay provisional tax. Again the result is no provisional tax paid and no UOMI payable by the shareholders or the company. This essentially mirrors the situation described in the De Jong example above. There are no commercial reasons for the switching of income between the parties other than to avoid the application of the UOMI rules. This situation is likely to be treated as a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement and the rules in section 120KBB will not apply to any of the income years in question. Example 10 Cowan Mattresses Limited (Cowan) has a residual income tax liability for the 2018 year of $100,000. It decides to use the standard method due to a volatile market in the mattress industry. Cowan’s 2019 provisional tax liability will be $105,000 with $35,000 being due at each instalment date. The owner of Cowan, Matt, decides to set up another company called Cowan Mattresses (2019) Limited. This company has a slightly different shareholder structure and is not in a 100 percent wholly owned group with Cowan and is therefore not a provisional tax associate of Cowan Mattresses (2019) Limited. Matt then makes an estimate of Cowan’s income tax liability to zero. All new mattress sales are put through Cowan Mattresses (2019) Limited during the 2019 year. At the time for the final instalment of provisional tax Cowan Mattresses (2019) Limited calculates that it has residual income tax of $130,000, which it pays on the date of the final instalment. Its 2019 tax return confirms that its residual income tax is $130,000 for the year and Cowan Mattresses (2019) Limited is charged no UOMI as it otherwise meets the requirements of section 120KBB. Cowen has no income for the year and has no residual income tax for the 2019 income year. In the 2020 year Cowan Mattresses (2019) Limited decides to estimate its residual income tax as zero. Matt then books all mattress sales in Cowan for the 2020 income year. Again both entities pay no provisional tax for the year. As there is no commercial reason for the structuring of the business in this way, and the effect of the structuring is that no UOMI is paid by the entities (along with no provisional tax), it is likely this situation would be considered a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement and section 120KBB would not apply. 8 Can I make payments into a tax pool and still use the rules in section 120KBB? Tax pooling is a mechanism to facilitate the payment of tax while reducing the impact of UOMI by allowing taxpayers to swap tax payments between those taxpayers who are overpaid and those who are underpaid. The new rules in section 120KBB are related to the calculation of UOMI. The overlay of tax pooling does not change the application of the rules and taxpayers can still use tax pooling and take advantage of the new UOMI calculation rules as long as the criteria in section 120KBB are met. Example 11 eWong Limited (eWong) is an advisor to e-commerce retailers, advising them on the security of payment methods. eWong is owned by Enia who has difficulty determining eWong’s tax liability for the year because of the uncertainty of income. She has previously used a tax pooling intermediary to facilitate the payment of eWong’s provisional tax liabilities. Enia sees value in using a tax pool as inevitably she finds that eWong’s provisional tax paid does not match its final tax liability no matter how hard she tries to estimate the earnings of the company for the year. Using the tax pool reduces her cost of UOMI when the estimate is understated and maximises credit UOMI when she ends up overpaying. Enia sees advantages in using the new rules in section 120KBB but has an existing relationship with the tax pooling intermediary she uses and wishes to continue doing that. For the 2018 year eWong’s residual income tax is $78,000, which means that if eWong wants to use the standard uplift method for its 2019 income year it will need to make three instalments of $27,300. It pays the first two instalments into the tax pooling intermediary on the due dates. On the date of the final instalment Enia calculates that eWong’s residual income tax for the 2019 income year is $100,000 so she decides to make a payment to the tax pool of the balancing amount of $45,400. Within the time permitted to make transfers from the tax pool Enia requests that the pooling intermediary make transfers to the income tax account of eWong Limited of $27,300 at the first and second provisional tax dates and $45,400 on the final instalment date. Assuming eWong meets all the other requirements of section 120KBB eWong will not be charged any UOMI as it has paid its tax liability for the year by the third instalment and has made the required payments under the standard method for the first two instalments. Does credit UOMI apply to overpayments? The concessionary rules contained in section 120KBB reduce the impact of UOMI on taxpayers by delaying the impact of UOMI until the final instalment date, which is after the end of the income year. To be consistent with that, no UOMI is payable by Inland Revenue fro m the date of the final instalment. New section 120VC specifically provides for this. Taxpayers who use the concessionary rules in section 120KBB will have no credit interest paid to them in respect of overpayments until the date of the final instalment. 9 Example 12 Mack Limited is a manufacturer of raincoats. Mack has historically had a very seasonal business in that it tends to sell more raincoats during the winter months but due to climate change, the demand for raincoats is extremely unpredictable, which makes estimating the income of the company very difficult. Mack has been using the standard method as the owner, Steve, finds it is the best estimation of income that he can make because of this unpredictability. However, even using the standard method Steve often finds that Mack ends up paying or receiving UOMI because of its residual income tax not matching with the standard method payments. Steve thinks the changes to section 120KBB will help Mack as it will ensure there is no exposure to UOMI. In the 2017 year Mack has residual income tax of $847,000. It has not filed its 2018 return as yet so calculates its 2019 provisional tax based on 110 percent of the 2017 residual income tax. This will mean that Mack must make three instalments of $310,567 under the standard uplift. Mack makes the first two instalments on that basis on time and when it gets to the third instalment Steve has a good idea of what the final residual income tax for Mack will be for the year. Unfortunately Mack has not had a good year, with rainfall at an all-time low. Steve calculates the residual income tax for Mack at the final instalment date to be $250,000. This means that Mack has overpaid its provisional tax for the year. At the final instalment date Mack estimates its provisional tax liability to be $250,000. It also requests a refund of the overpaid provisional tax from Inland Revenue, which it receives two months after the final instalment date. When Mack files its 2019 income tax return the final residual income tax liability is $250,000. It is assumed that Mack meets all the other requirements of section 120KBB. Because Mack paid its total residual income tax by the final instalment date, no UOMI would be payable by Mack. In addition, although to the third instalment date Mack has overpaid its tax for the year, it will only receive credit UOMI from the final instalment date until the date the amount of the overpayment is refunded (that is, two months after the final instalment date). Safe harbour from use-of-money interest Amendments have been made that modify the existing safe harbour from UOMI. The changes increase the safe harbour from $50,000 to $60,000 of residual income tax and extend the safe harbour to non-individual taxpayers. Background Section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a safe harbour for taxpayers fro m the application of UOMI. Under the previous rules, to qualify for the safe harbour, the taxpayer had to comply with the following requirements: • be a natural person, other than in their capacity as a trustee; • have residual income tax less than $50,000 for the tax year; • not have estimated their residual income tax under section RC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • not have used a GST ratio under section RC 8 in the tax year to determine their provisional tax payable for the tax year; and • not at any time in the tax year held an RWT exemption certificate under section 32I of the tax Administration Act 1994. The taxpayer’s residual income tax would then be due and payable in one instalment on their terminal tax date. This means no UOMI would be payable by the taxpayer for the tax year notwithstanding they may have underpaid their liability at one or more instalments. 10 Changes in the new Act modify this rule. Key features The modifications to the current safe harbour rule: • increase the threshold to use the safe harbour for a taxpayer’s residual income tax from $50,000 to $60,000; • extend the safe harbour to non-individual taxpayers; • ensure that taxpayers using the safe harbour have paid the instalments required; • remove the current requirement that the taxpayer cannot use the safe harbour when they have an RWT exemption certificate issued under section 32I; and • introduce a new anti-avoidance provision to the safe harbour. The safe harbour rule is designed to alleviate the impact of UOMI for those taxpayers who have relatively small amounts of residual income tax. This concession has previously only been available to natural persons. The changes extend the safe harbour to non-individuals and increase the threshold to residual income tax of less than $60,000. To prevent non-individuals from manipulating incomes between related parties, a new anti-avoidance provision has been introduced to protect against gaming of the safe harbour. There has also been a consequential amendment to the definition of “initial provisional taxpayer” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to reflect this change. Application date The amendments to the safe harbour rule in section 120KE(1) apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Detailed analysis Section 110 of the new Act modifies the application of the safe harbour by modifying section 120KE(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It replaces section 120KE(1)(a), removing the requirement for the taxpayer to be a natural person but requiring that the taxpayer to make all instalments required under sections RC 3(3), RC 9 and RC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Subsection 110(2) replaces $50,000 with $60,000 in section 120KE(1)(b) increasing the threshold for residual income tax to use the safe harbour from $50,000 to $60,000. Subsection 110(3) introduces the anti-avoidance provision which requires that there is no provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement in relation to the taxpayer. A provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement is defined in new section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act as an arrangement involving the manipulation of one or more amounts of residual inco me tax, including a zero amount of residual income tax, with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the interest rules within the Tax Administration Act. 11 Subsection 110(3) also removes the current requirement in section 120KE(1)(e) that restricts taxpayers who have a RWT certificate of exemption issued under section 32I from using the safe harbour. When the safe harbour applies The amended safe harbour rule in section 120KE(1) provides that a provisional taxpayer’s residual income tax for a tax year is due and payable in one instalment on their terminal tax date if: • they have paid all instalments under one of the standard methods described in section RC 5(2) or (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 on or before the instalment dates in accordance with sections RC 9 and RC 10 or they have no obligation to pay provisional tax under section RC 3(3); • their residual income tax is less than $60,000 for the tax year; • they have not estimated their residual income tax under section RC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the tax year; • they have not used a GST ratio under section RC 8 of that Act in the tax year to determine the amount of provisional tax payable for the year; and • there is no provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement in relation to the person. Example 13 Leroy is a provisional taxpayer for the 2018 income year who uses the standard method. He is required to make three instalments of $10,000 during the year which he does on the applicable due dates. When Leroy completes his tax return he discovers that his residual income tax for the year is $57,000. He has underpaid his provisional tax for the year. However, because Leroy has paid all three instalments on the due dates, his residual income tax is less than $60,000, he has not estimated or used the GST ratio method and there is no provisional tax avoidance arrangement in relation to Leroy, section 120KE (1) will deem his residual income tax to be due and payable in one instalment on his terminal tax date. He will not have any UOMI exposure until that date. Example 14 Shoshanna is a provisional taxpayer for the 2018 income year. Under the standard method she is required to make three instalments of $10,000 on 28 August 2017, 15 January 2018 and 7 May 2018. She makes the following payments during the year: 28 August 2017 $9,000 15 January 2018 $8,000 7 May 2018 $28,000 When she completes her tax return for the year Shoshanna calculates she has a residual income tax of $45,000. Because Shoshanna did not make the required payments under the standard method on the instalment dates she is not able to use the safe harbour and will be subject to UOMI. 12 Example 15 Tanks-R -Us Limited is a small business that manufactures and sells earthquake water storage tanks to consumers. It was not liable for provisional tax in the 2016–17 year as it had tax losses for the year. Because of an upturn in demand for tanks in the 2017–18 income year, when Tanks-R -Us completes its 2018 tax return it calculates it has a residual income tax of $59,500. Tanks-R-Us is deemed to be a provisional taxpayer for the 2018 tax year under section RC 3. However, because the company has residual income tax of less than $60,000, and it was not required to make any provisional tax instalments for the year under section RC 3(3), it will fall within the safe harbour and its residual income tax will be due and payable on its terminal tax date with no exposure to UOMI until that date. Provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement A provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement is defined in section 120KBB(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as an arrangement involving the manipulation of one or more amounts of residual income tax, including a zero amount of residual income tax, with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the interest rules in Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It is intended that this provision will apply to the most egregious of cases where a taxpayer has manipulated the flow of income to avoid application of the interest rules and take advantage of the safe harbour. It will not apply when normal commercial transactions result in taxpayers being within the safe harbour concession. Example 16 Aroha works as a self-employed computer consultant. She also owns 100 percent of a company that undertakes interior design for domestic clients, Inside Out Limited. Aroha operates the interior design business in her spare time, usually on weekends. Both Aroha and Inside Out Limited make provisional tax payments using the standard method. For the 2017–18 income year both taxpayers make the required standard uplift instalments on the applicable due dates. When they file their tax returns Aroha has $58,700 and Inside Out Limited $59,670 of residual income tax. These two operations are clearly run separately and there has been no manipulation of income so there will be no provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement and both entities will be within the safe harbour. Example 17 Savannah is a self-employed building contractor who specialises in installing swimming pools. Year on year her residual income tax can fluctuate from $57,000 to $110,000. She notes the changes to the safe harbour rules have extended these rules to non-individuals. Savannah looks to take advantage of these rules and decides to set up a company, Savvy Pools Limited. During the year she bills clients from herself and from the company so that the income from the business is split between the company and herself. At the end of the income year Savannah and Savvy Pools Limited file their tax returns and they have residual income tax of $59,999 and $59,999 respectively. In this case there is no commercial reason for the income from the same income earning activity to be split in this manner other than to take advantage of the safe harbour concession. It is likely that Savannah and Savvy Pools Limited will be considered to have a provisional tax avoidance arrangement and the safe harbour will not apply to either taxpayer. 13 Example 18 Jessie James owns a railroad consulting business JJ Rail Limited (JJRL). JJRL uses the standard uplift method to pay its provisional tax. It generally has residual tax of around $40,000. Part way through the 2017–18 income year JJRL realises it is having a spectacular year and is likely to have residual income tax of $100,000. JJRL decides to set up a subsidiary company JJ Railroads Limited (JJRRL). It commences billing clients through JJRRL partway through the year. At the end of the income year JJRL, which has paid all its required provisional tax instalments on time throughout the year, calculates it residual income tax as $59,000. JJRRL calculates its residual income tax as $50,000. All the other criteria of section 120KE(1) are satisfied, and prima facie, both JJRL and JJRRL will fall within the safe harbour. However, because the setting up of the new subsidiary and the transfer of income stream from one entity to the other is for no other apparent commercial reason it is likely that both companies have a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement and the safe harbour will not apply. Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate An amendment has been made which will allow contractors who are subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate without having to apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code. Background Previously, a contractor subject to the schedular payment rules was subject to a flat rate of withholding. This rate would often not accurately match the contractor’s actual income tax liability. Contractors could obtain a special tax code to alter their rate, but the process could increase compliance costs for them, requiring them to apply to Inland Revenue and supply supporting information. Key features A new rule allows contractors who are subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate without having to apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code. There will be some situations when a contractor will not be able to elect their own rate. These include: • when a contractor has not provided their name and IRD number, a “no-notification rate” applies of 20% for non-resident companies and 45% for other contractors; and • when a contractor has not met a liability under an Inland Revenue Act, the Commissioner can prescribe a rate of withholding. A minimum rate of withholding applies to contractors. For non-resident contractors and contractors with temporary work visas, this minimum rate is 15%, for all other contractors the minimum rate is 10%. If a contractor has changed their rate twice in a 12-month period, they will require the consent of the payer to any further changes. If a contractor has not selected a rate, a “standard rate” applies. This standard rate is the relevant rate listed in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Application date The amendment comes into force on 1 April 2017 and applies to payments made from 1 April 2017, regardless of when the services relating to the payment were performed. Detailed analysis New section RD 10B of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets new rules for what rates apply for contractors subject to the schedular payment rules. The flowchart below summarises these rules: No Y es Schedular payment rules apply Has the contractor provided their name an d IRD n um ber? H as the Com mission er provided a prescribed rate? Has the contractor selected a rate? Is the selected rate greater than the mi n im um r ate? Does the contractor have a special tax co de? W ith ho ld at no- notification rate W ith ho ld at standard rate W it h ho l d at selected rate W ith ho ld at prescribed rate W ith ho ld at mi n im um rate No Y es Y es Y es Y es NoNo No 15 Overview of different rate types Description Rate Elected rate Chosen by the payee. 10% – 100% (15% – 100% for non-residents and holders of temporary visas) Special rate Payee can request from Commissioner. Only necessary if the payee wants a rate lower than 10% (or 15% as above) No notification rate When the payee does not provide name or IRD number to the payer. 20% for non-resident companies 45% for other contractors Prescribed rate Set by Commissioner when the payee has not met a liability under the Inland Revenue Acts. Cannot exceed 50% Non-resident entertainer rate This rate must be used by non-resident entertainers. 20% Standard rate The rate for the activity or arrangement set out in schedule 4, which will apply if none of the rates set out above apply. Vary between 10.5% and 33% depending on the type of activity or arrangement Elected rate New section RD 10B(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 24LB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that contractors subject to the schedular payment rules may elect the withholding rate that is to apply to payments to them. To elect a rate of withholding, the contractor must notify the person making the payment of the rate to apply and this notification must be made in a form approved by the Commissioner. The selected rate continues to apply until the contractor makes a new election or until the contractor is no longer able to elect a rate due to a prescribed rate notice being given or otherwise. Minimum rate To address the risk that contractors may attempt to defer or avoid paying their tax by choosing an artificially low withholding rate, section 24LB(2) provides that contractors must elect a rate of withho lding that is not less than the minimum rate. For non-resident contractors and contractors who are holders of temporary entry class visas, the minimum rate is 15%. For all other contractors, the minimum rate is 10%. Special tax rate A contractor may have a rate lower than the minimum if they obtain a special tax rate certificate under section 24N of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Repeatedly changing withholding rates If a contractor has previously elected a withholding rate twice in a 12-mo nth period to the same payer, they require the consent of the schedular payer to make any further changes in their withho lding rate. 16 Example 19 3 March 20 184 April 20 183 March 20 19 Need agreement to elect another rate with the same payer before 3 March 20 19 Elects rate of 20 % Elects rate of 15 % On 3 March 2018 Caroline starts work as a building contractor for Small Builders Ltd. Payments from Small Builders to Caroline are subject to the schedular payment rules and Caroline initially selects a withholding rate of 15%. On 4 April 2018, Caroline wishes to change her withholding rate and notifies Small Builders that she wishes to have a withholding rate of 20% apply to her. Caroline does not require the consent of Small Builders to this change as she has only elected a withholding rate once within the last 12 months. However, if Caroline wishes to make any further changes to her withholding rate for payments made by Small Builders up till 3 April 2019, she will require the consent of Small Builders. On 5 August 2018, Caroline starts work for Large Builders Ltd. Caroline can elect a new withholding rate without the consent of Large Builders Ltd as she has not previously elected a withholding rate with Large Builders Ltd. No notification rate Section RD 10B(2) provides that when a contractor does not give their name and IRD number to their payer, payments to them must have tax deducted at the “no notification rate”. The no notification rate is 20% for non-resident companies, and 45% for all other contractors. This replaces the current “no notification” rate for schedular payments in section RD 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This is intended to provide a simpler “no notification” rate for schedular payments that is aligned with the rate that applies to employees. Prescribed rate Section RD 10B(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 24LC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that when a contractor has not met a liability under the Inland Revenue Acts the Commissioner has the ability to prescribe a withholding rate. The process for the prescribed rate is similar to the one for deduction notices under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and requires a notice to be provided to the payer or the contractor that a different rate should be applied. If a notice is provided to the payer, the payee must also be provided a notice unless, after making reasonable enquiries, the Commissioner does not have a valid address for the contractor. Under the amendments the Commissioner can require two different types of prescribed rate deductions. These are: • standard schedular payment deductions under the ordinary PAYE rules (which provide PAYE tax credits for the contractor); or 17 • additional deductions, which are used to meet the contractor’s tax debts or other liabilities. The additional deductions would generally be required to be recorded on a separate line in the emplo yer monthly schedule and under a different tax code. This is similar to the way additional deductions are currently done for student loans. When additional deductions are paid in this way, the initial late payment penalties charged on the original debt are not applied. Revocation of prescribed rate The Commissioner can rescind a prescribed rate at any time. A taxpayer can also apply to have the prescribed rate notice rescinded by the Commissioner. For prescribed rates relating to standard schedular payment deductions, the Commissioner must revoke the prescribed rate on application, if she is satisfied that all liabilities under the Inland Revenue Acts have been met and she is reasonably satisfied that the contractor will be likely to meet their liabilities in the future. For additional deductions to meet the contractor’s tax debts or other liabilities, the Commissioner must revoke the prescribed rate on application, if she is satisfied that the contractor has paid all tax due and payable. The Commissioner does not intend to use this prescribed rate notice to require additional deductions to meet a contractor’s other tax debts until schedular payments are administered in Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START). Example 20 Ben is a building contractor. He earns $120,000 each year from his building contracts with several major building companies. Ben elects a withholding rate of 10% and $12,000 is withheld from him for the year. Ben predominantly provides labour services and has minimal deductions. His end-of-year tax liability is $30,000 and so Ben has a terminal tax bill of $18,000. Ben does not pay his terminal tax bill and so ends up with a tax debt. The Commissioner prescribes a new rate of withholding to Ben and his payers. This new rate is: • 25% under the standard schedular payment code (WT). Ben receives PAYE credits for these amounts and these amounts are intended to ensure that Ben does not have an end-of-year income tax liability and further tax bills; and • an additional 15% under a new tax code and recorded on a new line in the employer monthly schedule. Amounts withheld under this code are used to pay Ben’s tax debt for the previous year. Standard rates If a contractor does not elect a rate of withholding under section 24LB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, section RD 10B(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the standard rate of withholding applies to them. The standard rate is the relevant rate set out in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For contractors working for labour-hire firms and those under voluntary withholding agreements the standard rate is 20%. 18 For other contractors the standard rate in schedule 4 is the same as the rate that currently applies to those payments. This means that if a contractor that was previously subject to the schedular payment rules does not elect a different withholding rate when the amendments come into force, their withholding rate remains unchanged. Non-resident entertainers The amendments do not apply to non-resident entertainers. Non-resident entertainers will continue to have a flat withholding rate of 20%. These entertainers can continue to have withholding treated as a final tax and will not have to file returns. Extending withholding to labour-hire firm contractors Amendments have been made which extend the schedular payment rules to contractors that work for labour-hire firms. Background Over the last two decades there has been large growth in the labour-hire firm industry. The new rules better reflect changes within the industry and update the rules more generally for contractors working for this industry. Labour-hire firms provide workers to perform services to clients, either as employees or contractors. The previous withholding rules did not generally apply to contractors engaged by labour-hire firms. This meant these contractors were required to manage their own tax obligations, including provisional tax. It also meant that contractors had opportunities for non-co mpliance (whether deliberate or accidental). In addition, using a company structure has become increasingly popular with contractors. Payments to companies are generally not subject to withholding tax under the schedular payment rules. Key features The amendments add payments by labour-hire firms to their contractors to the list of payments that are subject to the schedular payment rules. As a result, labour-hire firms will be required to withhold from all payments made to their contractors that work as part of their labour-hire business. They will be required to withhold at the relevant rate as described under the amendments outlined in “Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate”. Labour-hire firms will also have an obligation to deduct withholding tax when they make payments to companies used by contractors. Labour-hire firm contractors who are resident in New Zealand will not be eligible to receive certificates of exemption from withholding. A labour-hire firm is defined as “a person which has as one of its main activities the business of arranging for a person to perform work or services directly for clients of the entity”. 19 Application dates The amendments come into force on 1 April 2017. If a labour-hire firm is unable to have systems in place for reasonably cost-effective compliance with the new rules before 1 April 2017, the amendments apply to the earliest of: • 1 July 2017; or • the date on which the labour-hire firm has systems in place for reasonably cost-effective compliance with the labour-hire firm rules. Detailed analysis The amendments insert Part J to schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which adds payments made by labour-hire firms to contractors under a “labour-hire arrangement” to the schedular payment rules. Under Part J, payments are covered by the schedular payment rules when: 1. The payment is made under a labour-hire arrangement (as defined). 2. One of the main activities of the person making the payment is providing labour-hire arrangements (that is, the labour-hire arrangement is not incidental to the main business of the person). 1. The payment is made under a labour-hire arrangement Labour-hire firm Cl ien tContractor Payment Payment (withho lding applies her e) Wor k A labour-hire arrangement is an arrangement which in whole or part involves the performance of work or services by a person (the payer) directly for the client of the payer, or directly for a client of another person. The payer receives payment from the client and pays the worker. Arranging for a person to perform work or services directly for clients means that there is an agreement to provide a worker to the client, who will then provide their services at the general direction of the client. This does not include a contract in which the parties agree to deliver a given result or outcome. For example, if a contract provided for Firm A to make available some painters to a building company to work for them for a period of time, and the painters work at the general instruction of the building company, then Firm A would be arranging for a person to perform work or services. In contrast, if a contract provided for a painting company to paint houses for a building company, and the painting company contracted some labourers to work for it in completing the service, the contract between the painting company and building company would be a contract to produce a given result (the painted houses) rather than a contract arranging for a person to “perform work or services directly for clients”. 20 Directly for a client of another person A labour-hire arrangement also includes situations when there are chains of labour-hire firms involved or when a labour-hire firm provides a worker to a sub-client of the labour-hire firm. This can happen if a labour-hire firm arranges for another labour-hire firm to provide workers for their client. 2. One of the main activities of the payer is providing labour-hire arrangements (that is, the labour-hire arrangement is not incidental to the main business of the entity) The amendment only applies when one of the main activities of the entity making the payment is providing labour-hire services. This means that withholding under the amendment only applies if the entity is carrying on a labour-hire business. It is not necessary for the labour-hire activities to be the sole business, or even the main business of the payer. However, a merely incidental business is not sufficient to require withholding. For something to be one of the main activities of the business requires the activity to be more than incidental to the other activities of the firm. For example, a wedding planner may arrange for persons to perform makeup, or other services directly for clients, but because this is incidental to the main activity of the planner, it will not make the wedding planner a labour-hire firm. A business can have more than one main activity. For example, a labour-hire firm may have main activities of providing workers directly, as well as providing direct contracting work. The key question to ask is whether arranging to provide workers directly is being done in a business of its own right, or whether it is merely a requirement or incidental activity of another activity of the business. The amendment is similar to Australia’s Pay-As-You-Go withholding rules. Example 21 IT Universe Ltd provides contractors to other businesses to help with their IT projects. X Co. asks IT Universe Ltd for IT contractors to help with an upgrade of its systems. IT Universe Ltd provides one of their contractors (Steve, a New Zealand resident) to assist X Co. Steve works at the general direction of IT Universe Ltd. IT Universe L td X Co.Steve Payment Payment (less withholding) Wor k IT Universe Ltd is arranging for a worker (Steve) to provide work directly for their client (X Co.). As a result, they are in a labour-hire arrangement with Steve and X Co. and this arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. IT Universe Ltd is required to withhold tax from any payments to Steve. The rate will be the applicable rate as set out in the earlier section “Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate”. If it does not specify a rate then the standard rate for labour-hire firm contractors of 20% will apply. 21 Example 22 Ben is Jane’s solicitor. Jane is engaged in litigation and requires a barrister to represent her in court. For this purpose, Ben instructs Tara and pays Tara on Jane’s behalf. Ben (solicitor) JaneTa r a (barrister) PaymentPayment Wor k Ben is arranging for a contractor (Tara) to provide work directly for their client (Jane). However, Ben is not required to withhold from these payments because arranging for people to work for his clients is not one of his main activities. The payment is incidental to his business of providing legal services. Example 23 Pro Services Ltd is a professional services firm whose core business is providing consulting and advisory services to clients. Pro Services Ltd engages many of its staff as contractors. Sarah is one of these contractors whose work has impressed Task Ltd who is one of the clients of Pro Services Ltd. Task Ltd asks Pro Services Ltd for Sarah to work for them for six months to assist with one of their projects. Under this arrangement, Sarah will work at the general direction of Task Ltd. Pro Services Ltd Task LtdSarah PaymentPayment Wor k Pro Services Ltd is arranging for a contractor (Sarah) to perform services directly for the client of Pro Services Ltd (Task Ltd). As a result, this is a labour-hire arrangement. However, entering into labour-hire arrangements is not one of the main activities of Pro Services Ltd. Instead this is a one-off transaction that is being done incidental to Pro Services Ltd’s core business. Pro Services Ltd did not advertise to provide this service and does not expect to enter into similar arrangements in the future or plan to do so as a business in its own right. Example 24 Pro Services Ltd found the previous arrangement with Task Ltd to be a success, and starts offering similar services to more clients and advertising this service on its website. Pro Services Ltd is now providing labour-hire arrangements as a business in its own right. As a result, it can be considered to be one of the main activities of Pro Services Ltd, and payments made to Sarah and other contractors as part of this labour-hire business are subject to the schedular payment rules. 22 Example 25 Y Co. asks IT Universe Ltd for web designers to help them build a new website. IT Universe agrees to provide a number of web designers to Y Co. but is unable to find enough suitable people. IT Universe Ltd goes to Web Pro Ltd (another labour-hire firm) and arranges for some of Web Pro’s contractors (Uri and Velma) to perform work for Y Co. IT Universe L td Y Co.Uri and Velma PaymentPayment Wor k W eb Pro L td Web Pro Ltd is arranging for contractors (Uri and Velma) to perform work directly for the client (Y Co.) of another entity (IT Universe Ltd). As a result, they are in a labour-hire arrangement and this arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. Web Pro Ltd is therefore required to withhold from any payments it makes to Uri or Velma. Example 26 Paul is a builder and contracts to build a house for Susan. He subcontracts another contractor, Bruce, to do the plumbing work for the house. Paul is not required to withhold from payments to Bruce because he is not arranging for workers to perform work directly for clients. Instead Paul is arranging to produce a specified output for Susan (building a house). Company exception The amendments provide that the general exception to the schedular payment rules for companies will not apply to payments under labour-hire arrangements. That means labour-hire firms will be required to withhold from payments in the circumstances outlined above regardless of the type of legal entity the payments are made to. This applies regardless of whether the payment is also covered by the schedular payment rules due to it being a payment of a type described in another part of schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. A company that finds it is being over-withheld as a result of this, can apply for a special tax code to reduce its withho lding rate below the minimum rate. This can include applying for a withholding rate of 0%. Example 27 As in the earlier example, IT Universe Ltd. has agreed to provide web designers for Y Co. IT Universe arranges for Web Pro Ltd to provide workers for Y Co. IT Universe is arranging workers to provide work directly to clients. As a result, they are in a labour-hire arrangement and this labour-hire arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. As a result IT Universe Ltd is required to withhold from any payment made to Web Pro. Web Pro may apply for a special tax code to reduce its rate of withholding (including applying for a rate of 0%). 23 Associated party transactions If the payer and payee are associated persons under sections YB 2 (Two companies) or YB 3 (A company and a person other than a company), the payer may choose not to treat the payment as being subject to withholding under the labour-hire firm rules. This choice is intended to prevent overreach in the rules where the rules could apply to payments that are effectively made between entities that are part of the same business. In these situations, it is considered that the requirement to withhold would impose additional compliance costs for little benefit. Example 28 Workforce 1 Ltd is a labour-hire firm that provides workers to perform work directly for clients. As part of its business structure Workforce 1 Ltd chooses to have its sales, marketing and client-facing side of the business managed by Workforce 1 Ltd while its staff management is handled by Workforce 2 Ltd. Workforce 1 Ltd and Workforce 2 Ltd are part of a wholly owned group. Workforce 1 Ltd. pays Workforce 2 Ltd part of the fees received by clients in order to pay their contractors. W or kf or ce 1 Ltd ClientsContractors PaymentPayment Wor k W or kf or ce 2 Ltd Payment Workforce 1 Ltd and Workforce 2 Ltd are wholly owned companies and as a result are associated under section YB 2. As a result, Workforce 1 Ltd may choose to treat payments made to Workforce 2 Ltd as not subject to withholding under the labour-hire firm rules. Workforce 2 Ltd will still need to withhold from payments it makes to its contractors. Certificates of exemption Under the amendments, contractors that are resident in New Zealand and are working for labour-hire firms cannot obtain certificates of exemption to exempt themselves from the schedular payment rules. These contractors cannot obtain certificates of exemption even if the payment is covered by the schedular payment rules by virtue of another part of schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These contractors may still apply for a special tax rate if withholding is inappropriate, which includes being able to apply for a 0% rate. This means that all resident contractors working for labour-hire firms must have payments to them recorded on the Employer Monthly Schedule even if a 0% rate of withholding applies to them. Non-resident contractors who work for labour-hire firms may continue to use certificates of exemption. 24 Example 29 Agriculture Angels is a labour-hire firm that provides fruit pickers to farmers. The fruit pickers are engaged as contractors by Agriculture Angels and payments to them are covered by the schedular payment rules under the new labour-hire firm rules (Part J of schedule 4) as well as those for worker services relating to primary production (Part C of schedule 4). The contractors of Agriculture Angels cannot utilise certificates of exemption from withholding. Instead, these contractors will need to apply for special tax rates of 0% if withholding is not appropriate for them. Transitional rule To allow an easier transition to special tax rates for contractors working for labour-hire firms, a transitional rule applies for these contractors whose certificates of exemption are no longer valid as a result of the amendments. Under the transitional rule, contractors who have a certificate of exemption before 1 April 2017 may have the certificate treated as a special tax rate of 0% till 1 April 2018, if the certificate of exemption is invalid as a result of the amendments. Voluntary withholding agreements Amendments have been made which will allow contractors not covered by the schedular payment rules to opt in to the rules with the consent of their payer. Background Currently contractors not covered by the schedular payment rules are not able to have tax withheld on a payday basis. Many of these contractors may prefer to pay their tax through the schedular payment rules. Key features Contractors that are not subject to the schedular payment rules will be able to enter into a voluntary withholding agreement with their payers. If an agreement is entered into, the contractor becomes subject to the schedular payment rules and the payer will be required to withhold from payments made to them. The proposed amendments insert Part W into schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Part W sets out that a payment to a person is a schedular payment when: • there is no obligation to withhold from the payment under the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • the contractor and their payer have agreed to treat the payment as a voluntary schedular payment, and have recorded their agreement in a document. If these two criteria apply, the schedular payment rules apply and the payer is required to withhold from the contractor at the rate selected by the contractor (as per the amendments outlined in “Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate”). 25 This can apply to payments made to companies as well as payments such as expense reimbursements, 2 which previously have not attracted withholding tax so long as the parties have entered into an agreement for withholding to apply. Determining whether there is a valid agreement is based on standard contract law principles and requires there to be offer and acceptance, intention to create legal relations and objective evidence of agreement (which will usually be satisfied if the requirement that the agreement must be in a document has been met). A document can be a memorandum, email, letter, or formal contract between the parties. As long as there is sufficient written evidence that there has been a required agreement between the parties (which can be either electronic or in hardcopy), this requirement will be met. Payments covered by voluntary withholding agreements are excluded from the definition of “employer and employee” for the purpose of the FBT rules. This means that fringe benefit tax does not apply when fringe benefits are provided to contractors under voluntary withholding agreements. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2017. Use-of-money interest and transfers of tax Amendments have been made to sections 120C, 173L, 173M and 173S of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to prevent taxpayers from transferring tax to an earlier period that exceeds the amount in debt or in dispute in that period, and to clarify when UOMI starts and when a transfer takes effect for GST refunds and GST overpayments. Background Taxpayers are able to transfer tax credits to other tax periods, tax types or taxpayers. Currently, taxpayers are able to transfer amounts that exceed the amounts owing in previous periods. When this happens they are paid UOMI from an earlier date than if they had not moved the money. The Tax Administration Act 1994 does not distinguish between a GST refund, which occurs when GST inputs/expenses exceed GST outputs/sales, and a GST overpayment, which occurs when a taxpayer overpays their GST liability. As both actions result in a credit, it can be argued that a GST overpayment constitutes a refund, and is therefore eligible for the transfer date applicable to GST refunds, which is earlier than the transfer date applicable to overpayments. The date of transfer affects when UOMI on a previous overpayment stops being charged. Therefore a taxpayer transferring an overpayment of GST to settle a debt in a previous period will pay less UOMI to Inland Revenue than was intended because the payment will be transferred at the earlier refund date, rather than the date at which they made the overpayment. 2 With the exception of amounts to which the Commissioner has made a determination under section RD 8(3). 26 Key features Sections 173L, 173M and 173S of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to limit transfers of tax within a taxpayer’s accounts, transfers of tax to another taxpayer and transfers of interest on overpaid tax to the total of (for the requested transfer period at the chosen transfer date): • the debt owing by the relevant taxpayer; • the taxpayer’s deferrable tax; • the amount under a notice of proposed adjustment; and • any amount agreed with the Commissioner. Section 173L has also been amended to clarify when a transfer will take effect for GST refunds and GST overpayments. Section 120C has been amended to clarify the date that UOMI will start for GST refunds and GST overpayments. Application date The amendments came into force on 5 February 2017. Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to enable the Commissioner to offset any credits or refunds the taxpayer has against the taxpayer’s tax liability arising from a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner. Sections 139B, 139BA and 142B have been amended to ensure late payment penalties and shortfall penalties continue to be correctly applied following the amendment to section 142A. Background Generally, when the Commissioner makes a new assessment, or increases an assessment, a new due date is set for the payment of the resulting tax. This allows the taxpayer time for payment before late payment penalties, which accrue from the day after the new due date, are imposed. Use-of-money interest continues to apply from the day after the original due date for payment of the tax. When a new due date is set, any credits or refunds available before the new due date are generally refunded to the taxpayer as they cannot be offset against the upcoming liability as it is not yet “due”. The taxpayer then needs to make a payment to Inland Revenue by the new due date, shortly after receiving the refund. Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer system was unable to give additional time before the imposition of late payment penalties without setting a new due date. Its new system, START, is able to use the original due date for payment but still allow time for payment before the imposition of late payment penalties. 27 Key features Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended so that a new due date for payment is not set following a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner. This ensures that any credits or refunds the taxpayer may have can be offset against the taxpayer’s liability arising from the new or increased assessment. Sections 139B and 139BA have been amended to ensure taxpayers are given the same amount of time as they previously were given for payment of the tax before the imposition of late payment penalties. Section 142B has also been amended to ensure taxpayers have the same amount of time for payment of any shortfall penalties. Application date The amendments came into force on 5 February 2017 Prescribed forms An amendment to section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been made to confirm that information required under a prescribed form can be provided verbally (including by telephone or in person) when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers that to be appropriate. Background Section 35 allows the Commissioner to prescribe forms and electronic formats that have not otherwise been prescribed. This could be interpreted as requiring the information required under the prescribed form to be provided electronically or in writing, excluding providing the information verbally. With some prescribed forms it is easier for taxpayers and more efficient for Inland Revenue if the information (or some of the information) required in the form can be provided verbally. For example, more than 50 percent of the paper GST registration forms submitted are incorrectly completed. If the taxpayer was not able to verbally correct their registration form, they would have to complete the registration form again and send it in a second time. This change confirms that an Inland Revenue staff member can telephone the taxpayer and correct the errors on the basis of their discussion with them. Key features Section 35 has been amended to give the Commissioner a discretion to allow a person to provide the information in a prescribed form in a manner other than writing if the Commissioner is satisfied that, in the circumstances, it is appropriate. This discretion will not be exercised in all circumstances – for example, it is not intended that information under a notice of proposed adjustment could be provided verbally. Application date The amendments came into force on 5 February 2017. 28 Administration of the late payment penalty rules An amendment has been made to section 139B of the Tax Administration Act to enable Inland Revenue to continue to administer the late payment penalty grace period during the period in which tax types are operated out of two Inland Revenue software systems – FIRST (the older system) and START (the new system). An amendment to section 138E has been made to ensure certain rights of challenge do not apply to section 139B. Background A late payment penalty is imposed if a taxpayer does not pay on time. If a taxpayer has paid on time all relevant taxes due in the two years before the default in question, the Commissioner must issue a notice to the taxpayer specifying a further date for payment of the unpaid tax (a “grace period”), before late payment penalties can be imposed. Tax types will transition from Inland Revenue’s older FIRST system to the START system in stages. This raises an issue in relation to the grace period, as information relating to the taxpayer’s compliance history will reside in two systems. Key features Section 139B has been amended to introduce a discretion into the provisions setting out whether a taxpayer is entitled to a grace period from late payment penalties. The discretion will enable the Commissioner to ignore defaults in payment if: • doing so is necessary due to tax types being administered from different systems as a result of the coexistence of FIRST and START; and • doing so would not result in the imposition of a penalty that is greater than would otherwise have been imposed (had she not ignored these defaults in payment). In practice, this discretion will be applied to allo w the Commissioner to look only at the tax information about a taxpayer’s compliance history held in the system from which the tax type in default is being administered. For example, if the taxpayer defaults on a GST payment and GST is being administered in START, the Commissioner would only look at the taxpayer’s compliance history in START to determine the taxpayer’s eligibility for a grace period. A “compliance history indicator” providing a snapshot of the taxpayer’s compliance history for all relevant tax types for the last two years will be brought across as tax types transition to START. This will enable START to consider the taxpayer’s compliance history for tax types not administered in START to some extent, but it will become less relevant over time given a grace period is based on the taxpayer’s compliance history two years prior to default. Once all tax types have transitioned to START the Commissioner will once again only need to look at one system (START instead of FIRST) to determine the taxpayer’s compliance history for all relevant tax types. The compliance history indicator will no longer be necessary. Section 138E has also been amended to ensure that certain rights of challenge do not apply to section 139B. Application date The amendments came into force on 5 February 2017. 29 Cancellation of interest Amendments have been made to modify the cancellation of interest rules, in certain circumstances, to help Inland Revenue to simplify the process of issuing cancelled interest statements to taxpayers who mistakenly overpay. Background Section 183C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains rules around the cancellation of interest where multiple statements are issued by Inland Revenue. Specifically, subsection 183C(4) provides that when the Commissioner issues a statement of account to a taxpayer after the original due date for payment to which the statement of account relates, and the taxpayer pays the tax and any interest payable for the period before the date of the statement within 30 days of the statement being issued, any interest charged between the date of the statement and the date of payment will be cancelled. This creates some confusion for taxpayers in that if another statement is issued subsequent ly that statement will have the interest accrued to the date of the second statement. Taxpayers will often pay what is shown on the statement notwithstanding the portion of interest charged between the dates of the two statements is ultimately cancelled. This leaves small credit balances in accounts. Behind the scenes the FIRST computer system has a complex set of programming and rules to track these individual statements and calculate the amount of interest that is ultimately cancelled. In an effort to simplify the process around the cancellation of this interest in the future, Inland Revenue is investigating better ways to deal with these statement issues which retain the general rule yet simplify the process of providing taxpayers with “what you see is what you pay” statements to avoid the current overpayment issues. Because the introduction of START is being undertaken in phases it is necessary to provide a temporary solution until all taxes are migrated to START and the statement process can be standardised across all tax types. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the first tax to be migrated to START and this change will only affect statements issued and interest charged in relat ion to GST. Key features New subsection (4C) has been introduced to section 183C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This provides for a modified cancellation of interest rule where: (a) the Commissioner issues another statement of account (the second statement) to a taxpayer within 30 days of the issue of a statement of account to a taxpayer after the original due date for payment of tax to which the statement relates (the first statement); (b) the first and second statements are for GST and penalties related to the GST; (c) the liability for the underlying GST is the same in the first and second statement; and (d) the GST and related penalties in the second statement, together with any interest payable in relation to the period before the date the first statement is paid to the Commissioner within 30 days after the date on which the second statement is issued, or the due date of tax, whichever comes first. 30 The Commissioner will cancel the taxpayer’s liability to pay interest in relation to the GST and penalties charged between the dates of issue of the first statement and the date payment is made. This essentially mirrors the current rule, with the exception that if the underlying liability to GST increases between the two statements, the 30-day period will reset. Application date The new cancelation of interest rule comes into force on 7 April 2017. Detailed analysis The current cancellation of interest rules seek to allow taxpayers time to make payment on a statement before accruing additional interest in respect of a tax debt where the statement is issued after the due date for payment. The rules around the cancellation of interest are reasonably complex in that they require various statements to be tracked and a calculation of the interest to be cancelled undertaken with reference to various statements. These rules can also be confusing to taxpayers and it may mean that what the statement says they owe is not actually the amount they need to pay so long as they make payment within the 30-day limit. This can result in small overpayments where a taxpayer pays the amount on a statement only to have a portion of the interest to date on the statement cancelled. Example 30 CK Enterprises Ltd (CK) is a company specialising in photography for social media sites. The owner of CK, Ang, receives the following statements for CK: Day 1 - Statement issued showing amount payable of $250 (tax only) Day 5 - Statement issued showing amount payable of $251 (tax plus $1 interest 3 ) Day 10 - Statement issued showing amount payable of $252 (tax plus $2 interest) Day 15 - Statement issued showing amount payable of $253 (tax plus $3 interest) Day 20 - Payment received for $253 Under the previous rules because the payment was received within 30 days of the date of the first statement, any additional interest charged between the date of the first statement and the payment date will be cancelled. This means the payment of $253 will bring the account into a credit situation of $3, based on the statement issued on Day 1. The increased amount due to UOMI showing as payable on the statements issued on days 5, 10 and 15 would be cancelled. This will mean that Ang will have to contact Inland Revenue to deal with the small balance and have this transferred or refunded incurring compliance costs. 3 The interest amounts used are for illustrative purposes only. 31 The way Inland Revenue’s older FIRST system deals with the cancellation of interest uses complex programming and tables to track the individual statements to calculate the amount of interest to cancel. Inland Revenue is investigating ways to simplify the statement process within it s new START system. This can only be fully achieved once all taxes are migrated to START. Because START is being implemented in a phased approach it is necessary to put in a temporary solution for taxes which are migrated to START until a more complete solution can be implemented when all taxes are migrated. This modification to the cancellation of interest rule will only apply to GST, which was migrated to START on 5 February 2017. The modified rule essentially mirrors the previous rule, with the exception that when the underlying tax liability of the taxpayer increases, the 30-day interest period will reset. This will simplify the cancellation of interest rules for taxpayers so that taxpayers will see statements that show them the actual amount to pay and the system will not have to track multiple statements through a complex mechanism. Example 31 Archer Ltd provides professional coaching services to rugby clubs. On 1 August 2017 its owner, Garry, receives a statement from Inland Revenue after the original due date which says that Archer Limited has a June GST liability of $250 plus a $12.50 initial late payment penalty and $3 UOMI. The statement also indicates that interest will continue to accrue at 50 cents per day until the amount is paid unless the total is paid by 31 August 2017. Subsequent to the issue of that statement Archer Ltd receives another statement of account for that same period on 15 August 2017 showing the same amounts which it pays in full on 20 August. The accrued interest between the 1 August statement and the payment on 20 August is cancelled and Archer’s June GST period has a nil balance. Example 32 Assume the same facts as in Example 31 but the second statement issued to Archer Ltd reassesses the liability for the June GST period from $250 to $260. That statement now shows the amount of the GST liability of $260, an initial late payment penalty of $13, and updated UOMI of $5, including interest from 1 August to the date of the second statement, 15 August. If Archer pays the total amount of $278 within 30 days of the date of this statement, any interest incurred by Archer from 15 August to the date payment is made will be cancelled. 32
April 2017 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Closely held companies This special report provides information on changes to the tax rules for closely held companies contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced in May 2016 and enacted in March 2017. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will be published in a future edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. The amendments in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 aim to simplify the rules and reduce compliance costs, while ensuring that the rules remain robust and in line with intended policy. Closely held companies typically have just a few shareholders but can have widely varying net worth and business focus. They also make up a significant proportion of the total number of companies in New Zealand. Many use the standard company tax rules but there are also specific tax rules available for very closely held companies, in particular, the look-through company (LTC) rules and their predecessor, the qualifying company (QC) rules. The LTC and QC rules recognise that companies are taxed differently from individuals and it is important that this tax difference does not influence business decisions on whether to incorporate as this may impede growth. For example, a business may start off as a sole trader and, as it grows, decides to become a company, given the legal benefits of limited liability. The LTC rules, in effect, enable individual tax treatment to continue to apply to owners’ LTC interests even though the LTC is legally a company for other than tax purposes. On the other hand, it is important that these rules be available only to those that could have genuinely alternatively operated through direct ownership. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 makes a number of changes to the LTC rules, QCs and, through a number of changes to the dividend rules, other types of companies. The key changes relate to the following: LTCs • eligibilit y criteria; • entry tax; • the deduction limitat ion rule; and • debt remission. 1 QCs • continuity of ownership; and • ex-qualifying companies and the inter-corporate dividend exemption. Other companies • tainted capital gains; • resident withholding tax on dividends; and • the taxation of shareholder-emplo yees’ emplo yment inco me. Application dates Most of the proposed changes apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year, or 1 April 2017, although some, such as those relating to debt remission, have been backdated where appropriate. 2 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Sections YA 1 and HZ 4E of the Income Tax Act 2007 Several amendments have been made to tighten the LTC eligibility criteria to ensure that LTCs operate as closely controlled companies, as originally intended. The changes relate in particular to who can have an interest in a LTC and how the five or fewer “counted owners” test applies. The changes are as follows: • The way that beneficiaries are counted when determining whether the counted owner test is met has been broadened. • Charities and Māori authorities are precluded from being LTC owners, directly or indirectly, subject to certain exemptions and grandparenting provisions. • Trusts that own LTCs are precluded from making distributions to corporate beneficiaries. • The foreign income that a foreign-owned LTC can earn annually is limited. • The restriction that requires a LTC to have only one class of shares has been relaxed. A transitional rule applies so that LTCs that will lose their LTC eligibility as a result of these amendments can convert to ordinary companies without any immediate tax consequences. Background The eligibility criteria limit the type of entity that can elect to become, and continue to be, a LTC as well as the type of owner that can hold LTC interests. They serve to ensure that the use of the LTC rules is appropriately targeted according to the policy intent. That is, that the rules should only be available to those that could have genuinely alternatively operated through direct ownership. That implies that ownership is held by a few shareholders; LTCs are not designed to be widely held entities. Accordingly the rules require LTCs to have no more than five counted owners to ensure that the company is “closely controlled” by individuals, and the rules specifically limit the number of owners to five look-through owners. The concern covers not only direct ownership but also indirect ownership through benefiting from a distribution from a trust that has an ownership interest in a LTC. For example, the previous rules allowed for charities and Māori authorities to hold LTC interests, either directly or indirectly through a trust. Both charities and Māori authorities have potentially wide pools of beneficiaries and are therefore, conceptually, not part of the LTC target group. Likewise, other amendments primarily focus on strengthening the rules supporting the requirement for a LTC to have no more than five counted owners. Corporate ownership is precluded, given the scope that it would allow for widely held ownership. Another LTC can be an owner but is “looked through” to its owners for the purposes of determining whether the maximum of five counted owners test is met. However, this prohibition on corporate ownership was previously undermined by allowing indirect corporate ownership through trusts. 3 Family trusts can be owners but specific rules determine the extent to which the trustee(s) and beneficiaries are counted owners. The previous rules were considered to be too narrow in that not all beneficiaries were taken into account. Other new rules deal with concerns about LTCs being used by non-resident owners as conduits for investment outside of New Zealand. No change has been made to the rule that states that if a LTC fails to satisfy the eligibility criteria during an income year it loses its LTC status from the beginning of that income year. Key features The definition of “look-through counted owner” in section YA 1 provides the mechanism for counting owners when testing whether the entity has met the requirements of having five or fewer counted owners. The amendments introduce a new limb to the definition with respect to LTCs owned by trusts to broaden the way that beneficiaries are counted, by including any beneficiary who receives any distribution from any source from the trust. The definition of “look-through company” has also been amended to preclude charities and Māori authorities from becoming LTC owners (either directly or indirectly through a trust). The new restrictions do not however apply to Māori authorities and charities wit h existing ownership interests in LTCs that are, in effect, grandparenting structures or arrangements that were in place as at the date of the Bill’s introduction (3 May 2016). To ensure the prohibition on charity ownership does not inadvertently discourage charitable giving, a new rule allows trusts that own LTCs to continue making distributions to beneficiaries that are charities, so long as the distribution is akin to a donation or is received by the charity as a residual beneficiary of the trust. To bolster the existing legislative prohibition on direct corporate ownership of LTCs, the definition of “look-through company” has been further amended to prohibit a trust that owns a LTC from making any distributions to any corporate beneficiaries. LTCs are not intended to be conduit vehicles for international investment by non-residents whereby funds are invested through New Zealand rather than into New Zealand. To restrict the use of LTCs in this conduit manner, the foreign income that can be earned by a LTC that is controlled by foreign LTC holders is now limited to the greater of $10,000 and 20 percent of the LTC’s gross income in the relevant income year. A definition of “foreign LTC holder” provides the rule for determining how the foreign ownership of LTCs is tested when applying the new foreign income restriction. It is defined as “ownership interest held more than 50% by non-residents”. An amendment to the definition of “look-through interest” enables LTCs to have more than one class of shares. This amendment will enable LTCs to have shares carrying different voting rights, provided all shares have uniform entitlements to all distributions. A transitional rule applies so that LTCs that will lose their LTC eligibility as a result of these amendments can convert to ordinary companies without any immediate tax consequences. This means that the “exit tax” (deemed realisation of assets and liabilities) will not arise for these LTCs and any unrealised revenue account gains will not be realised for owners at that stage. 4 Application dates All the amendments, except the foreign income restrictions, apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. The amendments to limit the foreign income of foreign-controlled LTCs apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2017. This means that for taxpayers with early balance dates, the foreign income restrictions apply for the 2018–19 income year. Detailed analysis Counting beneficiaries of trusts Previously, for LTCs owned by trusts, when determining the number of look-through owners, the rules counted the trustee (grouping multiple trustees as one) when the LTC income earned by the trust was not fully distributed to beneficiaries, as well as all beneficiaries who had received LTC income from the trust as “beneficiary income” in the current and preceding three years. This was too narrow. Accordingly, the definit io n of “look-through counted owner” has been amended to count all distributions to beneficiaries, irrespective of whether they are from the LTC or from other sources, or whether they are received by the beneficiary as beneficiary income, trustee income, trust capital or corpus 1 . The amendment is necessary to ensure the test counts all persons who, though they may not receive beneficiary income, nevertheless benefit from the trust owning LTC shares. Including all distributions is also necessary to ensure the rule is not undermined by the fungibility of money, which makes the result fro m tracing the source of a distribut ion arbitrary. Transitional rule To ensure the revised distributions rule applies only prospectively, the time period over which distributions are measured has not been changed. The counted owner test continues to look back to the current and preceding three income years. A transition rule will apply over the next four years which involves applying both tests depending on the relevant time periods involved. The strengthened test will only apply to income earned from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Income earned and distributed to beneficiaries or retained by the trust prior to the 2017–18 income year will be counted under the old test. Those entities that were LTCs in the 2016–17 income year will (with all other things being equal) retain their LTC status if: • they continue to meet the current test over the three to four-year measurement period; and • having applied the new test (measuring distributions made only from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year) to establish whether there are any additional counted owners; and • in aggregate, there are a maximum of five look-through counted owners. 1 For a trust, corpus means an amount that is equal to the market value of a settlement of property on the trust measured at the date of the settlement. 5 This means that for the 2017–18 income year a person would look at distributions provided between the 2014–15 income year to the 2016–17 income year and apply the old test which looks at income sourced from a LTC interest to determine whether any beneficiaries are look- through counted owners. The person would then apply the new rule for any distributions in the 2017–18 income year to determine whether there are any additional look-through counted owners. The legislation is expressed in terms of “persons” rather than counted owners so there is no double counting of the same person if they receive a counted distribution prior to 2016–17 as well as a distribution after the 2016–17 income year. For the 2018–19 income year the person would look at distributions provided in the 2015–17 income years and apply the old test and then look at distributions in the 2017–19 income years and apply the new test. The transit ion is summarised in the following table: For income year Which test to apply Previous year 3 Previous year 2 Previous year 1 Current year 2017–18 Old test 2014–15 2015–16 2016–17 - New test - - - 2017–18 2018–19 Old test 2015–16 2016–17 - - New test - - 2017–18 2018–19 2019–20 Old test 2016–17 - - - New test - 2017–18 2018–19 2019–20 2020–21 Old test - - - - New test 2017–18 2018–19 2019–20 2020–21 To ensure the strengthened test incorporating all distributions to beneficiaries does not result in double counting of owners, under the new rules trustees are only look-through counted owners when no beneficiaries of the trust are look-through counted owners. Example A LTC is 100 percent owned by a Trust A. Trust A has five listed beneficiaries. From 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2020 the trust has made no distributions to any of the beneficiaries. As a result, for the 2019–20 income year, none of the five beneficiaries are look-through counted owners. As the trust has no beneficiaries as look-through counted owners, the trustee is a look-through counted owner and the LTC has a total of one look-through counted owner for the income year. 6 Example A LTC is 100 percent owned by Trust A. In the 2016–17 income year, Trust A made distributions to 10 beneficiaries that were from non-LTC sourced income. In the 2017–18 income year, these 10 beneficiaries will not be look-through counted owners as distributions in the 2016–17 are considered under the old rules which do not consider distributions of non-LTC sourced income. If there are no other distributions the trustee will be a counted owner in these circumstances. Example A LTC is 100 percent owned by Trust B. Trust B has made the following distributions: • 2015–16 income year: Distribution of LTC-sourced income to two beneficiaries. • 2016–17 income year: Distribution of non-LTC sourced income to two beneficiaries. • 2017–18 income year: Distribution of non-LTC sourced income to two beneficiaries. • 2018–19 income year: No distributions to date. All of the beneficiaries are separate individuals. For the 2018–19 income year, the LTC will have four look-through counted owners. This is made up of the two beneficiaries who received distributions in the 2015–16 income year and the two beneficiaries who received distributions in the 2017–18 income year. The two beneficiaries who received distributions in the 2016–17 income year are not look-through counted owners as distributions for the 2016–17 income year are counted under the old rules which do not consider distributions of non-LTC sourced income. Corporate beneficiaries Under the previous rules, a trust that owned a LTC interest could have a corporate beneficiary but direct ownership by companies, other than other LTCs, was expressly prohibited. The trust was looked through and the shareholders of the corporate beneficiary counted if it received any beneficiary income. This, coupled with the way that the number of owners was determined for trusts, unintentionally provided widely held non-LTC corporates with a way to circumvent the prohibition on direct ownership. This could be used to obtain inappropriate tax advantages. The definition of “look-through company” has been amended to expressly prohibit trusts that own LTCs from making distributions to corporate beneficiaries either directly or indirectly. This approach in effect allows for grandparenting of current structures involving corporate beneficiaries, by not expressly prohibiting LTC-owning trusts from having corporate beneficiaries (so long as the trust does not make further distributions to the company) while strengthening the prohibition on ownership of LTCs by standard companies. 7 Example: Indirectly a beneficiary of the trust • Trust B is a shareholder of Company X. • Trust C is a beneficiary of Trust B. • Company Y is a beneficiary of Trust C. Company X makes a distribution to Trust B. Trust B then passes on the distribution to Trust C who passes it to Company Y. Company X will be ineligible to be a LTC. This is because a trustee shareholder of Company X has made a distribution of income to a company that is indirectly a beneficiary of the trust. Voting rights Previously, in order to simplify the attribution of a LTC’s income and expenditure to its underlying owners, LTCs could only have one class of share. This rule was overly restrictive as it could limit legitimate commercial structuring or generational planning and inhibit some companies from becoming LTCs. Accordingly, the requirement has been relaxed through amending the definition of “look through interest”. The amendment allows a LTC to have shares that carry different voting rights provided that all shares still have the same rights to distributions. Charities and Māori authorities To ensure that the LTC rules are reserved for closely controlled entities, amendments have been made that extend the trust approach of looking through to the ultimate beneficiaries to LTCs owned by tax charities (as defined in the Income Tax Act) and Māori authorities. The amendments effectively preclude direct ownership by charities and direct or indirect ownership by Māori authorities. There are however some exceptions to this. $100,000 $100,000 $100,000 Trust C Company Y Company X Trust B 8 “No strings attached” distributions to charities An amendment to the definition of “look-through company” allows distributions by LTCs or shareholding trusts of LTCs to charities which have no influence over the LTC or shareholding trust. This enables genuine gifts from LTCs or shareholding trusts to be made to charities and recognises that many LTCs may want to make charitable distributions. Grandparenting existing Māori authorities and charities The amendments provide grandparenting for existing Māori authority and charity interests in LTCs through the definit ions of “grand-parented charity” and “grand-parented Māori authority. This will enable these entities to avoid the compliance cost of converting their LTC interests to limited partnerships, which are another look-through vehicle that is often used to achieve the same outcome as a LTC. The amendments only enable Māori authorities and charities to hold interests in LTCs which they had an interest in prior to 3 May 2016 (the date of introduction for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill) 2 . This means that Māori authorities and charities can change the amount of shareholding they have in LTCs they had an interest in prior to 3 May 2016, but cannot acquire interests in new LTCs that they did not have an interest in before that date. Example Charity X is a tax charity which, on 15 April 2015, acquired a 50 percent shareholding in Widgets Ltd. On 1 April 2016 Widgets Ltd elected to become a LTC. On 2 May 2017, Charity X increased its shareholding in Widgets Ltd to 100 percent. As Charity X acquired its interest in Widgets Ltd before 3 May 2016, its interests in Widgets Ltd. are grandparented and Widgets Ltd can maintain its LTC status despite Charity X’s ownership interest. The increase in shareholding by Charity X on 2 May 2017 also does not affect the LTC status of Widgets Ltd, due to the grandparenting. Foreign income restrictions Although LTCs are envisaged primarily as a structure for domestically focused companies, under the previous rules there were no restrictions on either foreign investment by LTCs or on LTCs having non-resident owners. This combination unintentionally allowed for LTCs to be used as conduit investment vehicles – that is, New Zealand domiciled vehicles used by non- residents to invest in foreign markets generating income generally not taxable in New Zealand. This gave rise to reputational risks for New Zealand. To address these risks, amendments have been made to the definition of “look-through company” to restrict the amount of foreign income that a foreign-controlled LTC (a LTC that is more than 50 percent held by non-residents) can derive. 2 This includes arrangements entered into before 3 May 2016 to become an owner in a LTC. 9 The amendments provide that a company is ineligible to be a LTC if both: • more than 50 percent of the total ownership interest in the company is held by foreign LTC holders (as defined); and • the entity has foreign-sourced amounts for the income year that in total are more than $10,000 and 20 percent of the company’s gross income for the year. The thresholds are intended to provide flexibility for some degree of combined non-resident shareholding and foreign income, and should prevent a domestic family business inadvertently falling outside the rules through an owner emigrating. On the other hand, the amendment is intended to prohibit LTCs being used by non-residents purely as conduit investment vehicles. Definition of “foreign LTC holders” The rule tests foreign control by looking at the direct and indirect ownership of the LTC, and testing the tax residence of the owners. Standard tests of residency will apply to determine the residency of individuals. A trust that has foreign settlors is considered to be a foreign LTC holder only to the extent of the proportion of the value of settlements made by the non-resident settlors. For example, if a trust held 50 percent of the shares in a company, and 50 percent of the value of settlements made on the trust were by non-residents, then 25 percent of the ownership interests in the company would be considered to be held by foreign LTC holders. In determining the proportion of the value of settlements made by non-resident settlors, provisions of services at below market value are not counted. These services are not counted due to the difficulty in valuing them. Example Company Z has two shareholders, Trust D which has a 60 percent shareholding in Company Z and Steve, who holds a 40 percent shareholding. Steve is an individual who is resident in New Zealand. Trust D is a trust which received $100,000 in cash settlements, $60,000 of the settlements were made by a non- resident settlor and $40,000 were made by a resident settlor. Trust D’s 60 percent shareholding in Company Z is therefore split between treated as being held by non-residents and residents on a 36:24 basis. Overall, 36 percent of Company Z’s shares are considered to be held by foreign LTC holders and 64 percent (40 percent and 24 percent) held by residents. Because of this, the foreign income restrictions will not apply to Company Z. 40% 40% 60% 60% Resident settlor Trust D Non-resident settlor Company Z Steve 10 Transitional rule Section HZ 4E provides a transitional rule for companies that will lose LTC status as a result of the amendments to the eligibility criteria for LTCs. Section HB 4(6) provides that these LTCs will be able to transition to being ordinary companies without triggering the exit adjustment requirements in section HB 4(6). This transitional rule applies when an entity is a look-through company at the end of the 2016–17 income year and ceases to be a LTC because of one of the eligibility changes referred to above. In this situation the section provides that section HB 4(6) does not apply. Section HB 4(6) ordinarily treats a LTC that transitions to an ordinary company as selling all of its assets to a third party at market value and then reacquiring them as an ordinary company. This results in a realisation of any revenue account gains on the LTC’s assets, which becomes income of the owners. Instead section HZ 4E provides that the company is treated as having the same tax position it had as a LTC. This means that any assets of the LTC are transferred at book value, and the company is treated as having acquired them on the same date as the LTC and with the same intention. Example Speculator Ltd is a LTC that is involved in property renting and speculation. On 1 May 2015, Speculator Ltd acquired land for $500,000 with the intention of reselling. Speculator Ltd sells the land on 5 August 2020 for $700,000. On 1 June 2017, Speculator Ltd. made a distribution to a corporate beneficiary. As a result, Speculator Ltd will lose LTC status as a result of the eligibility changes in the new rules. When Speculator Ltd becomes an ordinary company it will be treated as having acquired the land on 1 May 2015 for $500,000 and with the intention of resale. Any increase in the value of the property will not be realised upon Speculator Ltd exiting the LTC rules. Instead any revenue account gains will be brought to account when Speculator Ltd actually sells the land – in this case on 5 August 2020 – realising a $200,000 revenue account gain. 11 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANY ENTRY TAX Sections CB 32C, HB 13, OB 6, RE 2 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amendments to section CB 32C have been made, which modify the income adjustment calculation (commonly known as the entry tax) done when a company converts to a LTC to ensure that: • the taxable income that arises to LTC owners as a result of the calculation is taxed at each shareholder’s personal tax rate; and • for QCs converting to LTCs, that the entry tax formula does not tax owners of QCs any more than they would be if they liquidated before the conversion. An associated amendment to section HB 13 clarifies that a company that elects to become a LTC effectively steps into the shoes of the company it converted from and must use the tax book values of the company at the time of entry for all purposes under the LTC rules. Background The LTC entry tax adjustment applies when a company elects to become a LTC. It triggers a tax liability on un-imputed retained earnings by deeming the company to have been liquidated immediately prior to conversion. This adjustment is intended to ensure that reserves that would generate taxable income for shareholders if distributed before entering the LTC regime and that would be able to be distributed tax-free once the company becomes a LTC, are taxed to owners at the time of entry. The tax rate used in the o ld formula was 28%, which means that no further tax was paid on the company’s retained earnings. The 28% rate was used in the formula to reduce compliance costs, but this could provide a tax advantage for shareholders whose top personal tax rate exceeded 28% (that is, those on the 30% or 33% marginal tax rate) as well as a disadvantage for shareholders whose personal tax rates were below 28%. Further, the entry tax formula applied to tax all un-imputed retained earnings except eligible capital profits. For QCs that elected into the LTC rules, this meant tax was charged to the extent that the earnings were not eligible capital gains. This approach was inconsistent with the QC rules, which allow for tax-free distribution of un-imputed earnings as exempt dividends to QC shareholders. As a result, the entry tax formula could over-charge tax on the un-imputed reserves, which may have deterred some QCs from converting to LTCs. Key features A revised formula treats the resulting income that flows through to the LTC owners as a dividend, with imputation credits attached where available, thereby ensuring that the income is taxed at the owners’ personal tax rates in all cases. This overcomes a problem with the previous formula, which based the calculation on the company tax rate and could lead to under- or over-taxation, depending on an owner’s marginal tax rate. 12 A further formula covers situations when a QC has insufficient tax credits to cover distribut ions of all reserves. An amendment also clarifies that the tax book value of assets and liabilities of a company that elects into the LTC regime become the opening book values for the LTC, for the avoidance of doubt. For example, revenue account property transfers at tax book value, and not market value, meaning that unrealised gains and losses are not recognised at that point. The amendment also clarifies that the LTC has the same status, intention and purpose in respect of its assets, liabilities and associated legal rights and obligations. For example, if a company acquired land on 8 August 2017 with an intention of resale and subsequently converts to a LTC, the LTC will be treated as also acquiring the land on 8 August 2017 with an intention of resale. Application date The amendments apply for the 2017–18 and subsequent income years. Detailed analysis The current formula in section CB 32C(5) is: dividends + balances – assessable income – balances – exit exemption tax rate where: dividends is the sum of the amounts that would be dividends if, immediately before becoming a LTC, the property of the company, other than cash, were disposed of at market value, the company met all its liabilities at market value and it was liquidated, and the net cash amount was distributed to shareholders without imputation credits or foreign dividend payment credits attached. In other words a liquidation took place; balances is the sum of the balances in the imputation credit account and foreign dividend payment credit account immediately before becoming a LTC, plus amounts of income tax payable for an earlier income year but not paid before the relevant date, less refunds due for the earlier income year but paid after the relevant date; assessable income is the amount of income that would arise as a result of liquidation less any deductions that the company would have as a result of liquidating. This includes depreciation gains or losses, bad debts and disposals of revenue account property; tax rate is the company tax rate in the income year before the income year in which the company becomes a LTC; exit exemption is the exit dividends that, if the company had previously been a LTC and is now re-entering the LTC rules, would be attributed to any retained reserves from the previous LTC period that have not since been distributed. 13 The new formula in section CB 32C(4) is: (untaxed reserves + reserves imputation credit) × effective interest where: reserves imputation credit is the total amount of credits in the company’s imputation account, up to the maximum permitted ratio for the untaxed reserves under section OA 18 (Calculation of maximum permitted ratios) and is treated as an attached imputation credit included in the dividend calculated; effective interest is the person’s effective look-through interest for the look-through company on the relevant day; and untaxed reserves is calculated using the following formula: dividends – assessable income – exit exemption where: dividends is the sum of the amounts that would be dividends if the following events occurred for the company or the amalgamating company, immediately before it became a look-through company or amalgamated with a look-through company: (i) it disposed of all of its property, other than cash, to an unrelated person at market value for cash; and (ii) it met all of its liabilities at market value, excluding income tax payable through disposing of the property or meeting the liabilities; and (iii) it was liquidated, with the amount of cash remaining being distributed to shareholders without imputation credits attached; assessable income is the total assessable income that the company would derive by taking the actions described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above; less the amount of any deduction that the company would have for taking those actions; exit exemption is the amount given by the formula in section CX 63(2) (Dividends derived after ceasing to be a look-through company), treating the amount as a dividend paid by the company for the purposes of section CX 63(1), if section CX 63 would apply to a dividend paid by the company. The terms “dividends, “assessable income” and “exit exemption” are therefore the same as in the previous formula. This proposed formula will treat the retained income and imputation credits that would arise on liquidation of the company as being distributed to the individual LTC owners who will need to include the income and imputation credits in their return of income. This approach leaves it to each individual shareholder to determine what tax rate applies to their share of the income, and results in a fairer tax outcome. 14 The formula will apply to companies converting to LTCs, including QCs with sufficient imputation credits to fully impute the dividend, as well as companies that amalgamate with LTCs. However, it will not apply to those QCs converting to LTCs for which the entry tax formula would result in a dividend which is not fully imputed. Qualifying companies with limited imputation credits Instead the proposed additional formula in section CB 32C(8) is to be used to calculate the entry tax payable when a dividend by a QC on liquidation would be only partially imputed and, therefore, only partially a taxable distribution. The proposed formula in this case is: (balances – balances) + balances imputation credit) × effective interest tax rate where: balances is the sum of the following amounts: (i) the balance in the company’s imputation credit account; (ii) an amount of income tax payable for an earlier income year but not paid before the relevant date, less refunds due for the earlier income year but paid after the relevant date; tax rate is the basic tax rate for the income year of the company that contains the relevant day; balances imputation credit is the same as the amount of the item balances, and is treated as an attached imputation credit included in the dividend calculated; effective interest is the person’s effective look-through interest for a look-through company on the relevant day. Benchmark dividends An amendment to section section OB 61 (ICA benchmark dividend rules) ensures that the dividend which results from the entry tax formula is disregarded for the purposes of the benchmark dividend rules. This amendment is for the avoidance of doubt that the level o f imputation attaching to the entry tax deemed dividend does not require a benchmark dividend ratio change declaration as the company is not an imputation credit account (ICA) company as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act at the time that the dividend arises. 15 Example X Co is an ordinary company. It has two shareholders: Amy, who has 40 percent of the shareholding in X Co, and Ben, who holds 60 percent of the shareholding in X Co. $500,000 of equity was put into X Co, which X Co used to purchase a $500,000 house it acquired with the intention of resale. The house is now worth $700,000. X Co also has $72,000 of retained earnings and $28,000 of imputation credits from rent received from the house. X Co converts to a LTC. As a result, an entry tax calculation is required. The formula is: (untaxed reserves + reserves imputation credit) × effective interest The reserves imputation credit is $28,000. Amy’s effective interest is 40 percent and Ben’s effective interest is 60 percent. Untaxed reserves Untaxed reserves are calculated using the formula: Dividends – assessable income – exit exemption The dividends are the amounts that would be dividends if X Co sold its $700,000 house, then liquidated. If X Co liquidated it would have $272,000 of dividends, being the $700,000 cash from the property, the $72,000 of retained earnings, minus the subscribed capital of $500,000. The assessable income of X Co would be $200,000, being the total assessable income that X Co received from the sale of the house (as it was held on revenue account). The exit exemption would not apply as X Co has not previously been a LTC. As a result, the untaxed reserves are $72,000. As a result, the entry tax calculations are: Amy: (72,000 + 28,000) × 0.4 = $40,000 Ben: (72,000 + 28,000) × 0.6 = $60,000 These are treated as dividends and imputation credits may be attached to them. Amy may have up to $11,200 of imputation credits attached, and Ben may have up to $16,800 of imputation credits attached. 16 DEDUCTION LIMITATION RULE Sections GB 50 and HB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The coverage of the deduction limitation rule, which limits a LTC owner’s LTC deductions to the amount that they have economically at risk, has been restricted to LTCs in partnership or joint venture. To bolster the other rules in the Income Tax Act that help to stop LTC owners claiming excessive deductions, the existing anti-avoidance rule that deems a partner’s transactions to be at market value has been extended to owners of LTCs. Background The deduction limitation rule was designed to ensure that LTCs cannot be used to generate deductions in excess of the money that owners have at risk in the company. It was based on a comparable rule that applies to limited partnerships. It works by restricting an owner’s ability to use LTC deductions against their other income when the deductions are greater than the owner’s economic contribution to the LTC (referred to as “owner’s basis”). The rule results in undue compliance costs in many cases, as it requires each LTC owner to calculate their “owner’s basis” annually, which requires owners to keep track of what they have invested in and withdrawn from the business, and all income and expenditure attributed to them while they have been an owner. Over time this would require LTC owners to maintain records well beyond the standard record-keeping period for tax information. Furthermore, each owner must complete the calculation even though most will not have their deductions constrained by it because their share of net expenditure is less than their owner’s basis. Overall, given that this rule results in compliance costs that appear to outweigh the benefits provided from the operation of the rule, the rule is largely unnecessary in the LTC context. However, for LTCs working together in partnership or as a joint venture, the rule has relevance. This is because partnerships and joint ventures of LTCs are in many respects an alternative to limited partnerships where a deduction limitation rule is appropriate. They can also be potentially widely held vehicles. The removal of the rule for other LTCs is considered appropriate, given that the risk of LTCs being used to generate excessive deductions is ameliorated by other rules in the Income Tax Act, including the general and specific anti-avoidance provisions and the debt remission amendments discussed in the following item. Key features The first amendment means that the deduction limitation rule in section HB 11 will not apply for most LTCs. The provision will be changed to specifically cover only LTCs that are in partnership or are members of a joint venture under section HG 1. The formula determining the “owner’s basis” in section HB 11 will otherwise be unchanged, although officials are continuing to explore options for simplifying and clarifying the formula. 17 For those no longer covered by the rule, deductions previously restricted and carried-forward by the rule will be automatically freed up from the 2017–18 income year, and will be available for offsetting against their income from that year onwards. The specific anti-avoidance rule in section GB 50 has been extended to LTCs and their owners. The rule is designed to ensure that transactions between partners and their partnerships that have the effect of defeating the rules in sub-part HG (joint ventures, partners and partnerships) are treated as taking place at market value. Application date The amendment to section HB 11 applies from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. The amendment to section GB 50 applies from 1 April 2017. 18 DEBT REMISSION Sections DB 11, EW 31, EW 39, HZ 8 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amendments to the debt remission rules have been made to deal with specific concerns about the way the rules work in relation to LTCs and partnerships. Background Debt arrangements with owners Debt remission, being the extinguishing of a debtor’s liability by operation of law or forgiveness by the creditor, gives rise to debt remission income to the debtor under the financial arrangement rules. Under current tax law, debt remission produces taxable income to the debtor. Problems arise from the interaction of the LTC (and partnership) rules with the financial arrangement rules that produce remission income in circumstances when, as a result of the transparency of the LTC or partnership, the debt is effectively self-remitted. When an owner of a LTC remits debt owed to them by the LTC, all the LTC owners derive debt remission income given the look-through nature of a LTC. This includes the owner that remitted the debt who is required to pay tax on their share of the remission income despite making an economic loss (to the extent of the portion o f the loan that is attributed to the other shareholders). Generally, they are unable to claim a deduction for the bad debt. Overall, this results in over-taxation of the owner who remitted the debt, which is not an appropriate policy outcome. Market value of debts The other change amends the LTC rules to clarify that when calculating the market value of an owner’s interest as debtor in a financial arrangement with a third party, the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment must be taken into account. This clarification is necessary as Inland Revenue officials have become aware of certain interpretations being taken to the contrary. The amendment will ensure that the debt remission rules apply as intended so that debt remission income arises when a LTC is either liquidated or elects out of the LTC rules. This is important given the proposed limiting of the scope of the deduction limitation rules, as the debt remission rules are one of the backstops in the Income Tax Act that help to preclude excessive deductions. Key features The first amendment ensures that remission income does not arise to either a LTC owner or a partner who remits a debt owed to them (referred to in the amendment as “self-remission”) by the LTC or partnership, including a limited partnership. This also applies when an owner effectively remits the debt through an entity ceasing to be a LTC or similar deemed disposals of owners’ interests. 19 The second clarifies that in respect of a debt owed by a LTC to a third party, the market value of the debtor’s interest in the debt is adjusted for any credit impairment. While this was always the intention, some practitioners have argued otherwise. Both amendments are necessary to ensure that the debt remission rules operate as intended. Any refunds of overpaid tax as a result of the retrospective application can be claimed by taxpayers reopening past returns, but we do not anticipate many will need to do this. Any additional income that may arise as a result of retrospective application will only need to be brought to account in the 2017–18 income year (a transitional amendment achieves this). Application dates The first amendment to remission income applies to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011, the start date of the LTC rules. The second amendment to the valuation of credit impairment applies from 1 April 2011. However, to avoid reopening past returns, any additional income and associated penalties and interest from those earlier years is brought to account in 2017–18 income returns. Detailed analysis Debt remission The new Act amends the financial arrangement rules to exclude self-remission by a shareholder of a LTC or a partner in a partnership. This is achieved by introducing the concept of a “self-remission” into the Act and enabling the shareholder or partner who has lent money to a LTC or partnership a deduction equal to their proportion of debt remission income of the LTC or partnership. Section EW 31(11) has been amended so that the definition of “amount remitted” excludes a “self-remission”. “Self-remission” is defined as an amount of remission for a person and a financial arrangement under which, and to the extent to which, because of the operation of sections HB 1 or HG 2 (which relate to LTCs and partnerships), the person is also liable as debtor in their capacity of owner or partner. This exclusion means that a shareholder or partner of a LTC or partnership will have a negative base price adjustment in their capacity as a creditor that neutralises out any income attributed to them as debtor in their capacity as owner or partner. 20 Example A LTC is 50 percent owned by two shareholders – Shareholder A and Shareholder B. Shareholder A lends $100 to the LTC. Shareholder A subsequently remits the $100 debt it owes to the LTC. As a result of the remission both Shareholder A and the LTC need to make a base price adjustment (BPA). LTC’s base price adjustment The base price adjustment formula is: Consideration in – consideration out – income + expenditure + amount remitted The LTC has received $100 in consideration and as a result its BPA is a positive amount of $100. This $100 is attributed equally to the two shareholders under the LTC look through rules in section HB 1. As a result, Shareholder A has income of $50 and Shareholder B has income of $50. Shareholder A’s base price adjustment Consideration in – consideration out – income + expenditure + amount remitted Shareholder A has paid out consideration of $100 and has made a debt remission of $100. However, $50 of this debt remission is a “self-remission” under the amendments to section EW 31 as they are also liable as a debtor in their capacity as an owner of a LTC. As a result, Shareholder A has a negative base price adjustment of $50. Shareholder A is entitled to a deduction for this negative base price adjustment under section DB 11(1B) up to the amount of the self-remission ($50). As a result, Shareholder A has income of $50 attributed from the LTC and a deduction of $50 and as a result has no net income from the remission. Shareholder B has income of $50 attributed from the LTC. An amendment has been made to section EW 8 to allow taxpayers to treat arrangements that are excepted financial arrangements under section EW 5(10) as financial arrangements. This applies to persons who have made an interest-free loan in New Zealand currency that is repayable on demand. The ability to treat the loan as a financial arrangement enables a person who loans money to a LTC to get the benefit of the self-remission amendments when it would ordinarily be unavailable due to the loan being an excepted financial arrangement under section EW 5(10). Lends $100 50% owns LTC 50% owns LTC LTC Shareholder A Shareholder B 21 Disposals of financial arrangements An equivalent amendment has been made to section EW 39 to ensure that the same result is achieved in circumstances when a LTC owner or a partner in a partnership dispose of their interests in the financial arrangement. For a LTC this can occur upon permanent cessation, capital reduction, or revocation of LTC status. For partnerships this can occur on sale of partnership interests by a partner or upon dissolution of a partnership. Example A LTC is 50 percent owned by two shareholders – Shareholder A and Shareholder B. Shareholder A lends $100 to the LTC. The LTC becomes insolvent and cannot repay its debts. As part of a restructure the shareholders decide to convert the LTC to an ordinary company and as a result a base price adjustment is required for both the LTC and Shareholder A. Base price adjustment for LTC Similar to the previous example, the LTC has income of $100 which is attributed equally to Shareholder A and Shareholder B. Base price adjustment for Shareholder A Consideration in – consideration out – income + expenditure + amount remitted Under the old section EW 39, Shareholder A would be treated as having been paid the full market value of the $100 debt as if the LTC was not insolvent. Under the amendment to section EW 39, Shareholder A may subtract the amount of “self-remission” from this market value. As a result, shareholder A is treated as having been paid $50 for the debt. As a result, Shareholder A has a negative base price adjustment of $50, which offsets the $50 of remission income so that its net income is $0. Shareholder B on the other hand has income of $50 from its share of the remission income. Market value of an owner’s interest as a debtor An amendment to section HB 4 has been made that clarifies that when calculating the market value of an owner’s interest as a debtor in a financial arrangement, the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment must be taken into account. This ensures the debt remission rules work as intended so that when a debtor sells their interest in a financial arrangement that they will not be able to repay in full, they are treated the same as if the amount they are unable to repay was remitted. Lends $100 50% owns LTC 50% owns LTC LTC Shareholder A Shareholder B 22 Determining the amount of credit impairment Under the new rules, debtors will not need to rely on information from the creditor to determine the amount of credit impairment. Instead, the debtors will need to make a fair and reasonable estimate of the credit impairment based on the information they have available. To determine the credit impairment, the key question to ask is “if the LTC was sold or liquidated, how much of the debt would be repaid to the creditor?” In most cases, determining this would involve looking at the balance sheet of the LTC to determine the net assets of the LTC. Example Tara sets up a LTC to hold a rental investment property. The LTC gets a mortgage of $500,000 to finance the purchase of the property. The LTC has no insurance for the property. Due to flooding, the rental property declines in value to $300,000. The LTC also has $50,000 in cash reserves. The only liability of the LTC is the mortgage which still has $500,000 outstanding. Tara decides to liquidate the LTC. In determining the market value of the mortgage, Tara must ask “if the LTC was sold or liquidated, how much of the debt would be repaid to the creditor?” As the LTC has $350,000 in assets and no other liabilities other than the mortgage, the answer to this question is $350,000. When making the base price adjustment, this is the value of the arrangement for the LTC to use. Transitional rule for market value amendment A transit ional rule ensures that any income that would have arisen in earlier income years through the retrospective application of this remedial clarification will be recognised prospectively in the 2017–18 tax year. This will reduce the consequences for taxpayers who should have had income arise in line with the intended operation of the disposal rules but who took a different tax interpretation and avoids the need to reopen past returns. The formula under the transitional rule in section HZ 8 is: retrospective amount – current amount where: retrospective amount is the amount of income, for the person’s owner’s interest in financial arrangements as debtor, that would result from the application of section HB 4 for income years before the 2017–18 income year, treating that section as amended by the clarification that the market value of the interest must take into account the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment, for those income years; current amount is the amount of income, for the person’s owner’s interest in financial arrangements as debtor from the application of section HB 4 that the person returned for income years before the 2017–18 income year. 23 QUALIFYING COMPANIES – CONTINUITY OF OWNERSHIP Sections HA 6 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 An amendment to the qualifying company (QC) rules provides that qualifying company status will cease if there is a change in control of the company. Background Qualifying companies are partial look-through vehicles that allow for the profits of the company to be taxed in the same way as a standard company but, unlike a standard company, capital gains and un-imputed dividends can be distributed tax-free to shareholders during the course of business. QCs in place when the new LTC regime came into force on 1 April 2011 were allowed to continue, pending an ultimate decision on the future of QCs. There are still around 70,000 QCs. As part of the Government’s decisions from the review of closely held company taxation, it was confirmed that these QCs could continue. Requiring all remaining QCs to convert to LTCs, or failing that to ordinary companies, would not only impose significant compliance costs on those businesses but would also not be practical as the LTC requirements might not be suitable for many QCs. This means that while no new QCs can be created, existing QCs can continue until they are either liquidated, elect out of the QC regime or fail to meet the QC eligibility criteria. In effect, this provides the grandparented QCs with some degree of permanent tax advantage, due primarily to the opportunity for tax deferral on income through the taxing of the income in the first instance at the company rate, which is often lower than the top personal rate, or the favourable treatment of capital gains relative to ordinary companies. The effective limitation on trading of QCs by ensuring that QC status is lost if there is a change in control of the company, supports the 2010 decision to grandparent QCs. This outcome ensures that existing QC owners are able to make some shareholder changes without sacrificing QC status while preventing the current owners from trading any tax advantage. Key features A change of control will be measured using a continuity test. The new shareholder continuit y limitation in section HA 6 of the Income Tax Act requires a “minimum continuity interest” of at least 50 percent for the “QC continuity period”. The continuity period will extend from the date of Royal assent (30 March2017) to the last day in the relevant income year. The “minimum QC interest” is defined to mean the lowest voting interest or market value interest during the continuity period. A breach of this requirement will trigger the loss of QC status under the standard QC rules. To ease compliance, the continuity test will apply prospectively to changes in shareholding from the date of enactment (30 March 2017). 24 Exceptions For the purposes of the shareholder continuity measurement, changes to shareholding resulting from property relationship settlements or the death of a shareholder will be ignored when measuring a change of control. In addit io n, transfers between close relatives are ignored when measuring a change in control. The amendments achieve this by treating shares that have been transferred to a close relative as being held by a single notional person. For this purpose “close relat ive” is defined as a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner of the person or a person who is within the second degree of relationship to the person. Example A QC has two shareholders: Tara, who holds 40 percent of the shares in the QC and Uri, who holds 60 percent of the shares in the QC. Uri transfers his shares in the QC to Velma, his daughter. Velma then transfers half of her 60 percent shareholding to Walter, her spouse. As the transfers between Uri, Velma and Walter have all been between close relatives they are treated as being held by a single notional person and so will not affect the QC continuity test. Application date The amendments apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. 25 EX-QUALIFYING COMPANIES AND INTER-CORPORATE DIVIDEND EXEMPTION Sections CW 14 and HA 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections HG 10 and HG 10B of the Income Tax Act 2004 An amendment has been made to limit the scope of section CW 10, which prevents companies that were once qualifying companies from utilising the inter-corporate dividend exemption. Background When the qualifying company regime was being considered, the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee) recommended that qualifying companies not be able to utilise the inter-corporate dividend exemption. This was intended to prevent ordinary companies from providing exempt dividends to qualifying companies, which could then be distributed tax-free to shareholders due to qualifying companies being able to pay un-imputed dividends tax free. The Valabh Committee also recommended that companies that had previously been qualifying companies should similarly not be able to utilise the inter-corporate dividend exemption. This was because there is a potential avoidance risk through a QC creating capital gains through revaluing the shares they hold in a non-qualifying company. These capital gains can be passed to shareholders as exempt dividends and funded by a loan back to the QC. If the QC then converts to an ordinary company, the company can, if the inter-corporate dividend exemption is available, receive an exempt dividend from other companies in a wholly owned group, which could be used to repay the loan from the shareholder without a tax cost. However, this rule extends too far and prevents the use of the inter-corporate dividend exemption in circumstances when the avoidance risks are minimal. As a result, amendments have been made to limit the scope of the rule. Key features Amendments to sections CW 14 and HA 16 have been made so that the inter-corporate dividend exemption is available to companies that have previously been qualifying companies when either: • the dividend is derived at least seven years after the company ceased to be a qualifying company; or • the company never paid an un-imputed dividend while it was a qualifying company. The amendment is retrospective to the 2005–06 income year. To achieve this, corresponding amendments to sections HG 10 and HG 10B of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been made. Application date The amendment applies for the 2005–06 and later income years. 26 TAINTED CAPITAL GAINS Sections CD 44 and CZ 9B of the Income Tax Act 2007 The scope of the “tainted capital gains” rule is being narrowed to address a previous overreach of the rule, and make it much more targeted. Specifically, the rule will only apply to asset sales between companies that have at least 85 percent common ownership, with the original owners still retaining at least 85 percent interest in the asset at the time of liquidation. Previously, the rule applied to any associated party transactions. Background Capital gains derived at the company level cannot be distributed tax-free by ordinary companies, except upon liquidation. Previously the tainted capital gains rule (in section CD 44(10B) of the Income Tax Act) taints a capital profit if it was realised through a sale of a capital asset to an associated person, making the gain taxable when distributed to shareholders in a liquidation. There was one exception to the rule which applies to gains derived by a close company (as defined in section YA 1) that arise during the course of liquidation. The policy rationale for the previous rule was that sales of assets between associated persons (for example, sales within a group of companies) could be for the purposes of creating additional amounts of capital reserves for tax-free distribution, rather than for general commercial reasons. The concern was that this would allow a company to distribute “capital profits” tax-free in lieu of dividends, which would have been taxable. The rule had its origins in the mid-1980s when some companies were selling assets to associated companies to generate capital gains that they could at the time use to pay out tax- free dividends. Major changes to tax settings since then, in particular the introduction of the imputation regime and a comprehensive definition of what is a “dividend”, made the rule less relevant. In practice, the previous rule could capture genuine transactions when the sale was not tax driven – for example, the transfer of an asset as part of a genuine commercial restructure. The restriction, therefore, extended beyond its intended ambit and applied to gains made on sales to any associated party, not just an associated company. Companies could often be inadvertently caught by the rule, resulting in their being unable to be subsequently liquidated without a tax impost. The rule still has a role in the case of sales between companies that have significant commonality of ownership, where it provides protection against arrangements that are in effect in lieu of a taxable dividend. The rule has, therefore, been confined to such instances. 27 Key features The previous rule and exception relating to capital gains (and capital losses) made on asset sales between associated companies (sections CD 44(10B) and (10C)) have been replaced with a rule that measures commonality of ownership interest both at the time the asset is sold and at the time of the liquidation distribution. A capital gain or capital loss amount will not arise (in other words, the amount is tainted) if: (i) at the time of disposal, a group of persons holds, in relation to the seller company (company A) and the buyer company, common voting interests or common market value interests of at least 85 percent; and (ii) on the liquidation of company A, the company that owns the asset is company A or, if it is not company A, the percentage given by the following formula is 85 percent or more: commonality interest × ownership interest where: commonality interest is the percentage of common holding by a group of persons, for the owning company and company A, of common voting interests or common market value interests (if they are greater than the common voting interests); ownership interest is the percentage of ownership of the asset, by market value, for the owning company. For example, an asset of a company (company A) may be sold to another company (company B) in the same wholly owned group for a capital gain and at a later stage be on-sold to a non- associated company for a further capital gain, with both companies being liquidated. Both gains will be non-taxable as the outcome of the series of transactions is that by the time of the liquidation distribution the asset has been sold to a company that has no common ownership with companies A and B. If the owner at the time of liquidation is a non-corporate, (ii) above is not relevant (as that leg of the test requires some portion of the asset to be owned by a company). The gain or loss will, therefore, not be tainted. The proposed threshold is set at 85 percent because a change of ownership to an unrelated third party of more than 15 percent provides sufficient assurance that the transaction is genuine and involves a real transfer of the underlying assets rather than, say being in lieu of a dividend. Application date The amendments come into force on the date of enactment and apply to distributions made on or after that date. 28 Detailed analysis Gains prior to date of enactment The new rules apply to liquidations of a company from the date of enactment. This means the new formula applies to capital gain or loss amounts that were made prior to the date of enactment as long as the liquidation occurred after the date of enactment. This includes gains made between 1988 and 2010 to which the “related persons” test previously applied. To achieve this, section CZ 9B, which contains the related persons test, and section CD 44(14B), which cross-refers to section CZ 9B, have been repealed. Example Beach Resort Ltd and Ice Cream Deluxe Ltd are associates due to having a shareholder with voting interests in each company of 60%. The remaining 40% of shareholdings are held by different persons for each company. On 1 May 2005, Ice Cream Deluxe Ltd sold its ice cream cart to Beach Resort Ltd with Ice Cream Deluxe Ltd making a capital gain of $10,000 on the transaction. On 1 September 2018, Ice Cream Deluxe Ltd is liquidated. The $10,000 capital gain is not tainted as no group of persons hold common voting interests of 85% or more in both companies. Timing of liquidation The second part of the test looks at the ownership of the asset “on the liquidation of company A”. The timing of this test occurs when an amo unt is distributed on the liquidation of the company. Asset that has ceased to exist If an asset ceases to exist on the liquidation, any capital gains or losses from the asset will not be tainted. This is because, at the time, no company owns the asset and so the second limb o f the test above will not be met (company A will not own the asset and the ownership interest will be 0%). 60% 60% 40% 40% Beach Resort Ltd. Shareholder A Shareholder B Ice Cream Deluxe Ltd. Shareholder C 29 Example Company A acquires a boat for $400,000. Company A sells the boat to Company B for $500,000. Company A and Company B have common voting interests of 90%. The boat sinks and Company B has to write off the asset as it is neither salvageable nor insured. Company A and Company B subsequently liquidate. The $100,000 capital gain for Company A and the $500,000 capital loss for Company B will not be tainted. This is because on the liquidation, neither Company A nor Company B own the asset and the ownership interest for the asset is 0% as no one owns it. Application date The amendments came into force on 30 March 2017, being the date of enactment, and apply to distributions made on or after that date. 30 RWT ON DIVIDENDS Sections CD 39, RD 36, RE 2, RE 13, RE 14 and RE 14B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amendments have been made to deal with the over-taxation of certain dividends under the resident withho lding tax (RWT) rules: • The first change allows a company to opt out of deducting RWT from a fully imputed dividend paid to corporate shareholders. • The second change provides a new formula for determining the RWT obligation when cash and non-cash dividends are paid contemporaneously. A third amendment deals wit h an unintended restriction, because of the need to deduct RWT, on the rule which allows a dividend to be backdated to clear a shareholder’s current account. Background RWT on dividends between companies The payment of passive income, such as dividends and interest to resident recipients is subject to an obligation to account for RWT, which is withheld by the company at the time of payment and paid to Inland Revenue in the month following payment. For dividends, a flat rate of 33% applies (less any imputation credits). For interest, the RWT rate varies according to the recipient’s personal marginal tax rate. As a result of the lowering of the company tax rate to 28%, 3 even when a company pays a fully imputed dividend the dividend is still subject to an additional 5% RWT. For dividends paid to corporate shareholders (who will be subject to the company tax rate of 28%) this obligation to withhold RWT resulted in an initial over-taxation of these dividends. 4 Before the amendment, this over-taxation could give rise to additional compliance costs for both the paying company, which had to account for the additional RWT to Inland Revenue, and the recipient company, which was required to seek a refund when the RWT credit could not be used. RWT on concurrent cash and non-cash dividends When a company pays a non-cash dividend, such as a taxable bonus issue, the dividend is still subject to RWT. The non-cash dividend is required to be grossed up because the RWT cannot practically be withheld from the non-cash amount. When a company pays a non-cash dividend concurrently with a cash dividend, both dividends are subject to RWT. Before the amendments, the two dividends were treated as separate dividends, meaning that the non-cash dividend was still subject to the gross-up even when the concurrent cash dividend was sufficient to cover the RWT obligation on both dividends. This could result in the RWT obligation across both dividends being higher than it should be. 3 This was as a result of two tax cuts – from 33% to 30% from the 2008–09 income year and to 28% from the 2011–12 income year. 4 The exception is if the two companies are part of the same wholly owned group, in which case the dividend is exempt from tax, or the recipient company holds a certificate of exemption from RWT. 31 RWT impact on backdating a dividend Under the dividend rules, shareholders who have overdrawn current accounts at year end are treated as having received a deemed dividend based on the interest they would have had to pay if the overdrawn account had been a loan. To simplify matters for taxpayers, the rules in sections CD 39(5) and RD 36(2)(b) were introduced, which allow a company to pay a backdated fully imputed dividend to clear, or at least reduce, an overdrawn current account. For dividends to qualify for backdating there must be no further tax owing. The application of these rules was unintentionally limited as a result of the company tax rate changes. They technically did not work, as a dividend could only be backdated if there is no RWT obligation on the dividend and, in practice, any dividend will have a RWT obligation, even a fully imputed dividend (which had a 5% RWT obligation). Key features RWT on dividends between companies An amendment has been made which limits the definition of “resident passive income” in section RE 2(5) to exclude fully imputed dividends paid to a corporate shareholder if the paying company chooses to exclude the dividend from the definition. In effect this allows a company to opt out of withholding RWT on a fully imputed dividend paid to another company. This amendment reflects the fact that the obligation to withho ld RWT on a fully imputed dividend paid to another company over-taxes the dividend. The ability not to withhold has been made optional because for some paying companies (particularly those that are widely held) an outright requirement not to withho ld RWT on fully imputed dividends may raise compliance costs. This is because they will need first to establish which shareholders are corporates and those that are not, and differentiate between these two groups within their systems. RWT on concurrent cash and non-cash dividends To deal wit h the previous potential over-taxation of cash and non-cash dividends paid contemporaneously, new section RE 14B streamlines the RWT obligations by treating the two dividends as a single dividend. The amendment introduces a new formula to calculate the amount of RWT owing on the dividends, which applies only if the cash dividend is equal to or greater than the amount of RWT payable under the formula. Consequently amendments have also been made to sections RE 13 (Dividends other than non- cash dividends) and RE 14 (Non-cash dividends other than certain non-share issues). 32 RWT impact on backdating a dividend Amendments to section CD 39(9) and RD 26(2)(b) have been made to ensure the rules work as intended. The intention is to allow for a dividend that had no further tax owing (that is, it is fully imputed) to be backdated, to expunge, or at least reduce, an overdrawn current account balance. This avo ids or limits the deemed dividend arising and reduces compliance costs. However, a previous requirement was that there had to be no RWT obligation. Taxpayers continued to use the rule but due to an oversight at the time the company tax rate was changed, it technically did not work given the need to deduct RWT. The amendment provides certainty by clarifying that the rule should apply to dividends that are fully imputed, irrespective of any RWT obligation. Application dates The first two amendments to enable companies to opt out of deducting RWT fro m fully imputed dividends paid to corporate shareholders and providing a new formula for determining the RWT obligation when cash and non-cash dividends are paid contemporaneously, apply from the date of enactment, being 30 March 2017. The third amendment to allow dividends to be backdated applies from 1 April 2008 for the 2008–09 and subsequent income years. Detailed analysis Sections RE 13 and RE 14 calculate the RWT required to be withheld on cash and non-cash dividend respectively. Previously, when cash and non-cash dividends were paid contemporaneously, with the objective of the cash dividend being used to account for the RWT owing on the non-cash dividend, there was potential over-taxation because the two dividends are treated separately under these two sections. New section RE 14B provides the payer with the option of combining cash and non-cash dividend payments and accounting for RWT as though they were a single dividend. The new section only applies when the cash dividend alone is sufficient to cover the total RWT owing, meaning that RWT will be paid by deduction rather than gross-up, and the payer has elected for the section to apply. The amount of RWT that the payer must withhold is calculated using the following formula: (tax rate × (dividends + tax paid or credit attached)) − tax paid or credit attached where: tax rate is the basic rate set out in schedule 1, part D, clause 5 (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits); dividends is the total amount of the cash dividend and the non-cash dividend paid before the amount of tax is determined; 33 tax paid or credit attached is the total of the fo llo wing amounts: (i) if a dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by an ICA company, the total amount of imputation credits attached to the dividends; (ii) if a dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by a company not resident in New Zealand, the amount of foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the total amount of the dividends. To ensure there is no overlap of the rules, neither section RE 13 nor section RE 14 will apply to the dividends if the payer chooses to apply section RE 14B. Amount of cash dividend required to satisfy the RWT liability If a taxpayer provides a non-cash dividend and wishes to provide a cash dividend simply to satisfy the RWT liability on the non-cash dividend then the following formula provides how much cash dividend is required: cash dividend = 0.4925\* non-cash dividend – tax paid or credit attached Example Co. X wishes to provide a non-cash dividend of $360. The non-cash dividend has imputation credits of $140 attached. Co. X wishes to provide a cash dividend solely to satisfy the RWT liability. cash dividend = 0.4925 \* 360 – 140 = $37.30 If Co. X provides a cash dividend of $37.30, the RWT payable is also $37.30. 34 PAYE ON SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEE SALARIES Sections RD 3, RD 3B, RD 3C and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 An amendment has been made so that shareholder-employees of close companies who receive both regular salary or wages throughout the year and variable amounts of other employment inco me are able to elect to split their income so that the base salary is subject to PAYE and the variable amount is paid out before tax. Background Shareholder-emplo yees of close companies often do not derive regular amounts of salary or wages, or do not get paid in regular periods throughout the income year. For smaller companies, the remuneration of shareholder-employees also often depends on the performance of the business and, therefore, the annual salary will not be known until well after year end. This can make compliance with the PAYE rules difficult because the rules are designed for circumstances when employees’ salaries are known at the start of the income year and payments are made regularly (monthly, fortnightly or weekly) throughout the year. To alleviate this problem, the previous rules allo wed for shareholder-employees who do not derive regular amounts of salary or wages or who do not get paid for regular periods, to treat all amounts of income they receive through the year as not subject to PAYE, subject to certain conditions (see section RD 3). As a result, the amounts received would be taxable in the employee’s tax return and could give rise to provisio nal tax obligat ions. The previous rules may not have adequately relieved the compliance costs incurred by shareholder-emplo yees and may not have suited the myriad of shareholder-employee circumstances, when paying a combination of PAYE and provisional tax might have been preferable. There was no option to pay a combination of PAYE and provisional tax; the rule was all or nothing. Key features New section RD 3C allows for a shareholder-employee of a close company to choose to split their earnings so that the base salary is subject to PAYE and the variable amount is paid out pre-tax, and is therefore likely to be subject to provisional tax instead. To be able to treat any payments as not subject to PAYE under these rules, the shareholder- emplo yee must meet one of the following three requirements: • the shareholder employee does not derive salary and wages of a regular amount for regular pay periods of one month or less; or • less than 66 percent of their annual gross income is salary or wages; or • an amount is paid to them as income that may later be allocated to them as an employee for the income year. 35 If the shareholder-employee does not meet these requirements, the full amount of payments to them are subject to PAYE. This amendment allows addit ional flexibilit y for shareho lder-employees who may be unduly constrained by the current rules. To ensure that the ability to switch between provisional tax and the PAYE system is not used inappropriately, there are rules to prevent taxpayers “flip flopping” between the options. These rules provide that: • if a taxpayer has previously elected to use either the provisional tax method (section RD 3B) or the split provisional tax and PAYE method (section RD 3C) for their shareholder salary payments; and • the taxpayer then elected a different treatment for their shareholder salary payments; then • the taxpayer cannot elect to use either of the provisional tax methods for three income years. Example Steve is a shareholder employee of Steve Co. In the 2018–19 income year, Steve receives a shareholder salary of $50,000 which he elects to have treated under the provisional tax rules. In the 2019–20 income year, Steve receives shareholder salary of $50,000 which he elects to have treated under the PAYE rules. As Steve has elected out of the section RD 3B provisional tax option, Steve cannot elect to use the section RD 3B and RD 3C provisional tax options until the 2023–24 income year. Application date The amendments came into force on the date of enactment, being 30 March 2017. 36
March 2017 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Foreign trust disclosure rules This special report provides early information on the increased disclosure requirements for foreign trusts with New Zealand-resident trustees contained in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. These include requirements for the trust to register with Inland Revenue, file annual disclosure returns, and pay registration and filing fees. In addition, the register of foreign trusts would be shared with certain New Zealand government agencies. The resident trustee of the foreign trust would need to comply with the registration and filing obligations in order to qualify for the exemption from tax on foreign-sourced income. The amendments contained in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act require existing trusts to apply for registration by 30 June 2017. Foreign trusts that are formed after the enactment of these amendments (21 February 2017) have 30 days to apply for registration. Background New Zealand taxes trusts on the basis of the tax residence of the settlor. Accordingly there is an exemption in section CW 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for foreign-sourced amounts derived by resident trustees. The eligibility for the exemption is set out in section HC 26. The changes follow the Government’s April 2016 Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. The Inquiry was set up to examine and make recommendations regarding disclosure rules and other related matters to ensure that New Zealand’s reputation is maintained. The Inquiry recommended a formal registration process for foreign trusts and increased disclosures of information. The Inquiry also considered that the Department of Internal Affairs and New Zealand Police should be able to access the information. These changes are important to protect New Zealand’s reputation as having best practice in contributing to global exchange of information. These disclosure requirements are imposed on a New Zealand resident trustee of the foreign trust. 1 Key features Registration of a foreign trust Resident foreign trustees will be required to register foreign trusts with Inland Revenue under new section 59B(2). A contact trustee is responsible for the communication wit h the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and must provide the required information about the foreig n trust. In many cases, it is likely that there will only be one resident foreign trustee, who will therefore also be the contact trustee. If a foreign trust has more than one resident foreign trustee, each of them is responsible for the performance of the trustee obligations, but they will need to decide who will be the contact trustee and will communicate the information to Inland Revenue. These include registering the trust, disclosing information required as part of registration, filing annual disclosure returns and paying fees. If the contact trustee expects to stop being a resident foreign trustee of a trust, for example if they will no longer be a New Zealand resident, they must inform the Commissioner of the date they expect this to happen and the details of any replacement contact trustee. An amendment is also made to the definition of a foreign trust in section HC 11 to ensure a foreign trust is defined at a point in time rather than when a distribution is made. This ensures that all foreign trusts with a New Zealand-resident trustee must comply with the disclosure rules, regardless of whether a distribution has been made. Registration for existing foreign trusts New section 59B replaces the previous section 59B which covered the disclosure of information for foreign trusts. The previous section 59B included requirements to disclose certain information as part of an initial disclosure to Inland Revenue and subsequently to provide any changes to these details within 30 days. The previous foreign trust disclosure process is being replaced by a more extensive disclosure regime with a formalised registration process. Following enactment (21 February 2017), the previous disclosure rules no longer apply. Resident foreign trustees of existing foreign trusts will have until 30 June 2017 to apply for registration of the foreign trust and provide the relevant information. This registration will include providing some information that was already included as part of the trust’s initial disclosure, alongside the more extensive requirements which have been introduced. Registration details Replacement section 59B stipulates what information must be provided with the application to register the trust with Inland Revenue. If the contact trustee does not provide any of the information this may affect the eligibility for the exemption on tax for foreign-sourced income derived by resident trustees. Annual disclosure returns Resident trustees of a foreign trust will be required to file annual returns, including the trust’s financial statements, and details of settlements and distributions made over the year. The due date for filing the return is six months after the foreign trust’s balance date, or 30 September if the trust does not have a balance date (being six months after the end of New Zealand’s tax year). 2 The contact trustee must also provide any updates to the information provided at registration within 30 days after becoming aware of the alteration. Registration and annual filing fee New section 59E prescribes a registration fee of $270 and an annual filing fee of $50. This section also includes a regulation-making power which will allow these fees to be amended by Order in Council. This section also allows natural persons who are not in the business of providing trustee services to be exempt from the fees. Concessions for natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services The previous disclosure requirements introduced in 2006 included a grace period of two years for new migrants who are not in the business of providing trustee services. In recognition of the increased disclosure obligations on resident foreign trustees, this grace period has been extended to four years. The eligibility for the grace period has also been extended more generally to situations where all trustees are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services. This gives the resident foreign trustee more time to understand their obligat ions and comply wit h the disclo sure rules. This change, along with several other concessions, has been introduced to reduce compliance costs for foreign trusts when all trustees of the foreign trust are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services. These concessions recognise that not all foreign trusts are intended to be established as such and some people may become resident foreign trustees of foreign trusts due to changes in circumstances (for example, such as a trustee migrating to New Zealand or acting as an executor of a trust). For consistency, these concessions should all apply in the same circumstances across the board, so that non-professional trustees can readily ascertain what concessions are available to them. These concessions include increased time to comply with registration requirements, limited informat ion required about settlements, and a waiver of registration and annual return fees. The concessions available to non-professional trustees are discussed in further detail in later sections of this special report. Summary of registration requirements and concessions At least one trustee is not a natural person or is in the business of providing trustee services All trustees are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services Time limits for application for registration If the foreign trust exists on the date of Royal assent (and the resident foreign trustee is already appointed as a trustee), the resident foreign trustee must apply to register the trust by 30 June 2017. If the foreign trust is established after the date of Royal assent or a resident foreign trustee is appointed after the enactment of the legislation, the resident foreign trustee must apply to register the trust within 30 days of becoming the resident foreign trustee. The trustee must apply to register the trust within four years and 30 days from the date that the trustee became a resident foreign trustee (that is, when the trustee was appointed or became a New Zealand resident). If the resident foreign trustee has held that role for more than four years and 30 days before enactment of the legislation, the deadline is 30 June 2017. If there are multiple resident foreign trustees, the grace period begins on the earliest date that any of the trustees became a resident foreign trustee. 3 At least one trustee is not a natural person or is in the business of providing trustee services All trustees are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services Information required on application for registration Copy of the trust deed.

Annual return filing fee $50 including GST per return year. Exempt – see “Fees” section. Eligibility for tax exemption Foreign-sourced income derived by a New Zealand-resident trustee is exempt income under section CW 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if certain criteria are met. The criteria are set out in section HC 26. The amendments to section HC 26 ensure that the foreign trust must comply with the increased disclosure obligations in order to be eligible for this tax exemption. Information sharing with other agencies An exception to the secrecy provisions will allow the information contained in the foreign trust register to be shared with the Department of Internal Affairs and New Zealand Police. The Finance and Expenditure committee also recommended that Inland Revenue should be able to share information with the Overseas Investment Office. This will take the form of an Approved Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue and the Overseas Investment Office. Consequential amendments Certain definit io ns and record-keeping requirements have been repealed due to the extended disclosure requirements. 4 Application dates The amendments came into effect on the date of Royal assent, being 21 February 2017. For foreign trusts in existence at the date of Royal assent, the resident foreign trustee must apply for registration of the trust by 30 June 2017. Detailed analysis Tax exemption for foreign-sourced amounts: resident trustees New Zealand taxes trusts on a settlor basis. One result of this is an exemption for foreign- sourced amounts derived by trustees resident in New Zealand if the trust is classified as a foreign trust. This tax exemption was available to all New Zealand-resident trustees before the enactment of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. However, if the trustee was convicted of a knowledge offence and was not a qualifying resident foreign trustee, they did not qualify for the exemption. The amendments to section HC 26 tighten the criteria for the tax exemption. These amendments require the resident foreign trustee to comply with the disclosure obligations for the income year in which the income is derived. Trust deed required for exemption The Commissioner may register a foreign trust regardless of whether it has a trust deed. However, the tax exemption on foreign-sourced amounts will only be available to resident foreign trustees if the trust has a trust deed, even if all other registration and ongoing requirements are met. The rationale behind requiring a trust deed in order to qualify for the exemption is to counter possible circumvention of the disclosure obligations by using documentation other than a trust deed or verbal agreements to avoid disclosing information to Inland Revenue. The trust deed is a vital piece of information and it is important for it to be provided to Inland Revenue and other enforcement agencies. Eligibility for exemption The eligibility for an exemption on foreign-sourced income of the trust is assessed each year. A foreign trust that is not registered on time will lose its exemption for that year. If the foreign trust is later registered, it will be able to get the exemption for the years for which it has met its disclosure obligations. The trust must be registered at the time the income is derived to qualify for the tax exemption in section CW 54. In addit io n, subsect ions HC 26 1(c) and (d) provide rules around when the trust must be registered to qualify for the exemption. 5 Application made within time limits under section 59C If a resident foreign trustee applies for registration within the time limit given by new section 59C (the “application period”), and registration is completed by the end of the income year after the application period (the “post-deadline year”) then for any subsequent years they will qualify for the exemption as long as the trust remains registered and the trustee meets their obligations. Resident foreign trustees must comply with all their obligations under sections 22, 59B, 59C and 59D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the income year in order for the trust to qualify for an exemption on foreign-sourced trustee income. Example XYZ Trust is formed on 1 November 2016, and Frank, a New Zealand resident, is appointed as a trustee. Frank has until 30 June 2017 to apply to the Commissioner for registration of XYZ (see the “Time limits for registration” section for more details). Frank applies for registration within the time specified in section 59C, and the registration process for XYZ Trust is completed one month after the end of the application period. The trust is fully registered with Inland Revenue on 1 August 2017. Any foreign-sourced trustee income will be eligible for an exemption from New Zealand tax under section CW 54 if all the conditions specified in section HC 26(1)(c) are met. For the XYZ Trust’s foreign-sourced trustee income to qualify for the exemption, the following conditions must be met. (a) XYZ Trust must have a trust deed. (b) XYZ Trust’s registration must be current when the foreign-sourced income is derived. (c) The resident foreign trustee (Frank) must also comply with all the requirements under sections 22, 59B, 59C and 59D as they arise during the income year. For example, if XYZ adds a beneficiary on 5 September 2017, Frank will need to provide Inland Revenue with the required information on the additional beneficiary within 30 days, under section 59C. Application made outside time limits under section 59C If the resident foreign trustee does not apply for registration within the application period, the trust can qualify for the tax exemption in future if it is registered from the beginning of the income year when the foreign-sourced income is derived and the trustee fulfils their obligations for that income year. As is the case for trusts who apply for registration within the timeframe given under section 59C, the trust must have a trust deed. 6 Example Tiny Tunes Trust was formed on 1 May 2016, at which time they appointed a New Zealand-resident trustee, Jazz Ltd. Following Royal assent of the new legislation, Jazz Ltd has until 30 June 2017 to apply for registration of Tiny Tunes Trust. However, Jazz Ltd applies for registration of Tiny Tunes Trust on 1 September 2017. For the income year beginning 1 April 2017, Tiny Tunes Trust will not be eligible under section HC 26 for the tax exemption on foreign-sourced trustee income. If Jazz Ltd applies and completes the registration of Tiny Tunes Trust by 31 April 2018, they will be eligible for the income exemption on foreign-sourced trustee income if the conditions set in section HC 26(1)(d) are met. Ongoing compliance with obligations To qualify for the exemption the trust must meet the registration requirements. In addition to these, the resident foreign trustee must comply with the requirements under sections 22, 59B, 59C and 59D as they arise in the income year. Section 22 contains record-keeping requirements. Section 59B sets out the obligations for registering a trust and what information must be provided. (See the section “Informat io n required on registration” for more details). Section 59C specifies the timeframes for registering the trust and updating the details provided at registration. Obligations in relation to annual returns are contained in section 59D. Annual return due dates are discussed in the section “Annual disclosure returns and financial statements”. Non-compliance when reasonable efforts made Amended section HC 26 provides discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to allow the exemption to still apply if the trustee has made an error in registration requirements. This is provided for by new subsection (1B). If a resident foreign trustee makes an error or does not comply with the requirements under sections 22, 59B, 59C or 59D, the exemption for foreign-sourced trustee income may still apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that the trustee made reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements and remedied the error within a reasonable timeframe. Repeal of qualifying resident trustee The previous tax exemption criteria in section HC 26 recognised “qualifying resident trustees” and provided that the exemption would still be available even if a knowledge offence were committed, as long as one or more resident foreign trustees were qualifying resident trustees. A “qualifying resident trustee” was defined as a member of an approved organisat ion, or for a trustee that is not a natural person, a director or person with significant influence over the entity would have to be a member of an approved organisation. The concept of a qualifying resident trustee, and the lesser sanctions that applied in these cases have been repealed. 7 Requirement to register foreign trust Amended section 59B(2) provides that resident foreign trustees of a foreign trust must apply to the Commissioner for registration of the foreign trust. Section 59B(1) provides that the Commissioner may approve the application for registration of a foreign trust, if the foreign trust has a resident foreign trustee and the application fee has been paid. However, other registration requirements must also be met before approval. These are set out in sections 59B(3) and (4). To be eligible for the foreign-sourced income exemption under section HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a foreign trust must be registered with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This is discussed in the section above “Tax exemption for foreign-soured amounts: resident trustees”. “Time limits for registration” below provides further detail on the timeframes for registration. Definition of a foreign trust An amendment has been made to section HC 11 in the Income Tax Act which classifies when a trust is a foreign trust. This section has been amended to apply at a mo ment in time rather than at in relation to a distribution. This ensures that it is not necessary for a foreign trust to have made a distribution before the disclosure obligations apply. It is important to note that there are existing disclosure obligations regarding foreign trusts established in New Zealand. The previous definition of a foreign trust in relation to a distribution does not appear to have caused any significant uncertainty in practice. However, given the more extensive disclosure obligations, and higher compliance requirements for the tax exemption on foreign-sourced trustee income, the definition has been clarified to ensure there is no ambiguity. Example Henry is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. He is appointed as a trustee of the newly formed MNO Trust, which has one settlor who is resident in the United Kingdom. MNO Trust has not made any distributions to beneficiaries of the trust. On the date of his appointment as a trustee for MNO Trust, Henry will be required to register MNO Trust under section 59B(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Resident foreign trustees A resident foreign trustee is defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act as a person who: • acts as a trustee of a foreign trust that is not registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005; and • is resident in New Zealand within the meaning of sections YD 1, YD 2 or YD 3 (excluding section YD 2(2)) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 8 This definition is unchanged from the previous disclosure requirements for foreign trusts. Amendments were made during the select committee stage of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill to ensure the use of the same term and provide consistency. Contact trustee It is possible that a foreign trust may have more than one resident foreign trustee. Section 59B(7) provides that if there is more than one resident foreign trustee each resident foreig n trustee is responsible for meeting obligations relating to the foreign trust, including registration, disclosure of information, annual returns, financial statements and payment of fees. However, the trustee who applies for registration of the foreign trust then becomes responsible for communicating with the Commissioner on matters relating to the trust and is known as the “contact trustee”. The contact trustee is the only trustee that is required to communicate the required information to the Commissioner. This is provided for in section 59B(3). This provision allows the resident foreign trustees to choose the contact trustee and avoids duplication of effort and information. If the contact trustee relinquishes that role (for example, if they are no longer a trustee or become non-resident), new subsection 59B(6) requires them to provide the name and contact details of the new contact trustee and the date on which this trustee will take over the duties of the contact trustee. The outgoing contact trustee must also confirm their own contact details or provide their updated contact details to the Commissioner. Example Jazz Ltd is a resident foreign trustee and currently the contact trustee for Tiny Tunes Trust. Jazz Ltd is being wound up and will no longer be a trustee. Tiny Tunes Trust has another New Zealand-resident trustee, Brass Ltd. Jazz Ltd and Brass Ltd decide on the date that Brass Ltd will become the contact trustee for the trust. Jazz Ltd informs Inland Revenue that it will no longer be the contact trustee for Tiny Tunes Trust and that Brass Ltd will take over the role, and the date this will happen. Jazz Ltd also confirms its own current contact details and advises the email address and business address of Brass Ltd. Time limits for registration The criteria for eligibility for the tax exemption in amended section HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is connected to the time limits for registration set in section 59C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. New section 59C sets out the time limits for applying to register the trust and the time limits for updating the information that must be disclosed. There are three different time limits, depending on the trust’s category: • trusts that become required to register after the date of enactment (new trusts); • trusts that become required to register on the date of enactment (that is, existing foreign trusts with resident foreign trustees at time of enactment); and 9 • trusts where each trustee is a natural person not in the business of providing trustee services. Foreign trusts will always be in one of the first two categories, but if they also fit the third category, they may be eligible for a longer registration period. If a trust becomes required to register after the date of enactment of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, new section 59C(1)(b) provides that the resident foreign trustee has 30 days to apply for registration of the foreign trust from the date the requirement to register begins. Trusts in this category could include a foreign trust that is formed wit h a resident foreig n trustee after the date of Royal assent or an existing foreign trust that does not have a resident foreign trustee until after the date of Royal assent. This means these foreign trusts have 30 days from the date of formation and the appointment of the first resident foreign trustee, respectively, to apply for registration. Trustees of foreign trusts in existence wit h a resident foreign trustee at the time that the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 received Royal assent have until 30 June 2017 to apply for registration of the trust. This is provided for in new section 59C(1)(a). There are differing time limits depending on whether the trust has a resident foreign trustee who is in the business of providing trustee services. The previous disclosure requirements extended the time limit if the resident foreign trustee was a new migrant who was not in the business of providing trustee services to allow them an additional two years to meet their obligations. The amended disclosure rules extend this concession in recognition of the increased disclosure requirements. New sections 59C(3) and (4) provide that regardless of whether a resident foreign trustee is a new migrant, the time limit for application is extended when all of the trustees of a foreign trust are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services and none of the resident foreign trustees have been resident foreign trustees before. If a person has already been a resident foreign trustee they should be aware of the obligations that this role entails. If these requirements are met, the time limit for application is extended to four years and 30 days following the first date on which the foreign trust has a resident foreign trustee. Example: Non-professional trustees of existing trusts Ralph was appointed as a trustee of his friend Nora’s trust on 13 January 2014. Nora is the only settlor of this trust and is not a New Zealand resident. Ralph is not in the business of providing trustee services, and as a New Zealand tax resident, he is a resident foreign trustee. Under the previous disclosure rules, Ralph was required to disclose particular information to Inland Revenue by 12 February 2014. After Royal assent of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill (21 February 2017), Ralph is now required to apply for registration of Nora’s trust. Because Ralph is not in the business of providing trustee services, he is eligible for the grace period provided for by new section 59C(3). The grace period of four years and 30 days is counted from the date that Ralph became a resident foreign trustee (13 January 2014). This means Ralph has until 12 February 2018 to apply for the registration of Nora’s trust. 10 Example: Professional trustees and newly formed trusts Consider Frank and XYZ Trust again. XYZ Trust was formed on 1 November 2016, and Frank, a New Zealand resident, was appointed as a trustee. XYZ’s income year corresponds with the New Zealand tax year (31 March balance date). XYZ is an existing trust at the date of Royal assent of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill (21 February 2017). On the day of Royal assent Frank becomes liable to apply for registration of XYZ under section 59B(2) of the Tax Administration Act. Frank regularly serves as a trustee so the time limit applying to him is that in section 59C (1)(a) – 30 June 2017. Information to be provided at the time of application The previous disclosure rules required resident foreign trustees to disclose certain information on the trust: • the name or other identifying particulars; • name and contact details of resident foreign trustees; • whether a settlor is resident in the Commonwealth of Australia; • details relating to status as a qualifying resident foreign trustee (if applicable); and • any details of which resident foreign trustee is appointed as agent for the purposes of compliance with the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amendments in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 update the information that must be provided at the time of registration, in line with the recommendations of the Government’s April 2016 Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. Trust deed As a starting point, section 59B(3)(a) requires that the name of the trust must be provided on application. The contact trustee must also provide a copy of the trust deed for the foreign trust (or the functional equivalent, for example, if there is no formal trust deed) along with all amending and supplementary documents (section 59B(3)(f)). Note that a will is not a trust deed for the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules. However, a trust established under a will (a testamentary trust) will be a trust for these purposes. Historical settlements The application must also include details relating to settlements made in relation to the foreign trust (section 59B(3)(b)). These details are the date, amount, nature and settlor of each settlement. Services provided to the trust at below market value are generally considered to be settlements, due to the broad definition of “settlement” used for the trust rules, and must be disclosed. 11 However, information relating to the provision of minor services at less than market value that are incidental to the activities of the trust does not need to be provided. This exclusio n is intended to reduce compliance costs for trustees, and is available to both professional and non-professional trustees. Whether a service is incidental depends on the activities undertaken by the trust and could therefore vary between trusts. Example John’s family trust owns a property which is rented out. John’s grandson mows the lawn as a favour as he lives nearby. This would be incidental to the activities of the trust. Example Justin’s trust runs a lawn mowing business. Justin’s daughter Phoebe occasionally helps by mowing lawns. This would not be incidental to the activities of the trust. As well as being incidental to the activities of the trust, to be excluded under section 59B(3)(b), the services must also be minor. That is, the value of the services provided below market value that are incidental to the activities of the trust must also be low. This introduces a standard that applies equally to all trusts, without the addit ional co mplexit ies and compliance costs associated with a monetary threshold. Section 59B(3)(b) sets three different periods for which information on settlements must be provided, depending on whether the resident foreign trustees are in the business of providing trustee services and whether the trust is formed before or after the date of Royal assent of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill (21 February 2017). If any of the trustees are not natural persons or are in the business of providing trustee services, then the period begins with the date of formation of the trust and ends with the application for registration. This is because professional trustees, regardless of whether they are the contact trustee, should have adequate records for the trust. If all of the trustees are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services, the period is shorter. For trustees that become required to register a foreign trust on the date of Royal assent of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill (21 February 2017) (that is, existing foreign trusts with resident foreign trustees), the trustees must provide information on settlements that date back to the later of the date of the trust’s formation and 30 June 2013. 12 Example Natalie and Greg’s family trust was formed in April 2016 and Dan, a New Zealand tax resident, is appointed one of the trustees. All of the trustees are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services. As part of the application for registration of the family trust, Dan must provide details of historical settlements. The later of April 2016 and 30 June 2013 is April 2016, so Dan must provide details of settlements since that date. Example Sam became the resident foreign trustee for a family trust when it was formed in August 2012. The later of August 2012 and 30 June 2013 is 30 June 2013. This means that at the time Sam applies for the trust to be registered, she must provide details on settlements made between 30 June 2013 and the date of her application. If a foreign trust needs to be registered after the date of Royal assent of the Taxat io n (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill (21 February 2017), the trustee must provide information on settlements that date back to the later of the trust’s formation and four years prior to the date on which a trustee first becomes required to register the foreign trust. Trusts in this category could include a foreign trust that is formed with a resident foreign trustee after the date of Royal assent or an existing foreign trust that does not have a resident foreign trustee until after the date of Royal assent. Example John and Maraina’s family trust is formed overseas in March 2019, but has no resident foreign trustee until December 2023, when Sophie, a New Zealand resident, is appointed to be one of the trustees. Sophie becomes liable to register John and Maraina’s family trust when she becomes the first resident foreign trustee. Four years prior to December 2023 is December 2019, which is later than March 2019. This means that as part of the application for registration Sophie must provide details of settlements made on John and Maraina’s family trust dating back to December 2019, not March 2019 (the date of formation). The table below summarises the different periods for which details of historical settlements must be provided on application for registration. Start date End date Any of the trustees are not natural persons or are in the business of providing trustee services. Formation of trust. Date of application for registration. All trustees are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services Trustee becomes required to register trust on date of Royal assent (existing foreign trusts with resident foreign trustees). Later of: • formation of trust • 30 June 2013. Date of application for registration. Trustee becomes required to register trust after date of Royal assent (existing foreign trusts that subsequently appoint their first resident foreign trustee, or new foreign trusts with a resident foreign trustee). Later of: • formation of trust • four years prior to the first date on which a trustee becomes required to register the trust. Date of application for registration. 13 Details about settlors, trustees and beneficiaries In addition to information on historical settlements, section 59B(3)(c), (d) and (e) provides that the application must also include information relating to settlors, beneficiaries and trustees, as well as other persons with certain powers. Section 59B(3)(c)(ii)–( iii) describes other persons who have specific powers in connection to the trust which allow them to have some control over the trust. Specifically these address persons who have a power to: • appoint or dismiss a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary (59B(3)(c)(ii)); • control the exercise of one of the powers mentioned above (59B(3)(c)(iii); or • control a trustee in their administration of the trust (59B(3)(c)(iv). Broadly, these powers are intended to cover the powers that a “protector” of a trust might have over the administration or control of a trust. The information required under these sections does not vary depending on whether the trustees are in the business of providing trustee services. The informat ion required is summarised in the table. Relevant person Information to be provided All trusts • Each settlor, excluding persons who only provide minor services at less than market value that are incidental to the activities of the trust (section 59B(3)(c)(i)). • Each person with a power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary (and each person with a power to control any of these powers) (sections 59B(3)(c)(ii) and (iii)). • Each person with a power to control a trustee in the administration of a trust (section 59B(3)(iv)). • Each trustee (section 59B(3)(c)(v)). • Name • Email address • Physical residential or business address • Jurisdiction of tax residence • Taxpayer identification number • Connection with the trust. Fixed trusts • Each beneficiary who is not a minor (section 59B(3)(c)(vi)). • Each nominee for a beneficiary (section 59B(3)(c)(vi)). • The parent or guardian of each beneficiary who is a minor (section 59B(3)(c)(vii)). • Name • Email address • Physical residential or business address • Jurisdiction of tax residence • Taxpayer identification number • Connection with the trust. • Each beneficiary who is a minor (section 59B(3)(d)). • Name • Age • Taxpayer identification number. Discretionary trusts • Each beneficiary (section 59B(3)(e). • Each class of beneficiary (section 59B(3)(e). • Details sufficient for the Commissioner to determine when a distribution is made, whether a person is a beneficiary. 14 Section 59B(3)(c) states that a person’s physical residential or business address must be provided. This means: • for natural persons, their physical residential address; and • for non-individuals, the business address (or registered office or servicing address). If the email address is known to a resident foreign trustee, it must be provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. If no email address is available, a contact phone number should be provided instead. For beneficiaries of fixed trusts who are minors, the trustee must provide full contact details for each minor’s parent or guardian, in addition to limited information about the minor (name, age and taxpayer identification number). A minor may not always have a taxpayer identification number, but if they do have one, it must be provided. For the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules, a “minor” follows the trust tax rules and is a natural person who is under the age of 16. When a minor reaches the age of 16, the contact trustee must update the registration details held by the Commissioner. See the section “Subsequent changes to information provided on registration” for further information. Signed declaration As part of the application process for registering a foreign trust, section 59B(4)(c) requires the contact trustee to provide a signed declaration that each person referred to in section 59B(3)(c)(i)–(vii) has been informed of, and has agreed, to provide information necessary for compliance with the requirements relating to the provision of informat ion regarding the trust and persons connected with the trust imposed by: • the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Act 2009; and • all regulations made under these Acts. As part of this declaration, the contact trustee must obtain the agreement of all specified persons. If a person is incapacitated, their legal guardian, personal representative or power of attorney must provide the agreement on their behalf. Resident foreign trustees may feel more confident that they have satisfied their statutory obligations by obtaining the signatures of the relevant persons as proof of their agreement. The declaration was a specific recommendation of the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules and ensures that all persons have turned their minds to the relevant laws and regulations that they will need to comply with. If any of the persons specified in section 59B(3)(c)(i)–(vii) are deceased, section 59B(4)(a) provides that in the signed declaration, the contact trustee should state that the agreement cannot be obtained as the person is deceased. 15 If a person cannot be located, section 59B(4)(b) provides that the contact trustee should include in the signed declaration an outline of their attempts to find the person. If incorrect information is disclosed to Inland Revenue as part of the registration or ongoing disclosure processes, including as part of the signed declaration, the resident foreign trustee could have penalties imposed under Part 9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For example, knowledge offences apply for knowingly providing incorrect information required under tax laws. Evasion offences may also apply. Subsequent changes to information provided on registration Following the registration of a foreign trust, if there are any changes to the information provided on registration as set out in section 59B(3), section 59B(5) requires the contact trustee to inform the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the changes and provide a signed declaration required under section 59B(4) for the alteration or addition. New section 59C(2) requires the contact trustee to provide this updated information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue within 30 days of becoming aware of the change. Example The Troy Trust is a registered foreign trust. After registration, Ed becomes a settlor. The contact trustee must provide to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Ed’s details including his email address, physical residential address, where he is tax resident and his taxpayer identification number. The contact trustee must also provide an updated signed declaration that Ed has been informed of, and has agreed to provide information necessary for compliance with, the requirements relating to the provision of information relating to the trust and persons connected with the trust imposed by the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 and all regulations made under these Acts. Annual disclosure returns and financial statements An ongoing requirement for the contact trustee following the registration of a foreign trust is to prepare an annual return for the foreign trust and send it to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This is set out in new section 59D. Section 59D(2) states that the annual return must be in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and must include the following. Information Detail Financial statements for the trust for the return year (section 59D(2)(a)). If the trustee prepares financial statements or is required to prepare financial statements. Settlements made on the trust in the return year, excluding the provision of minor services incidental to the activities of the trust (section 59D(2)(b) and (c)). Each settlement: • date • nature • amount • settlor’s name • settlor’s email address • settlor’s physical residential or business address • settlor’s jurisdiction of tax residence • settlor’s taxpayer identification number. 16 Information Detail Distributions to beneficiaries made during the return year (section 59D(2)(d) and (e)). Each distribution: • date • amount • nature • beneficiary’s name • beneficiary’s email address • beneficiary’s physical residential address • beneficiary’s jurisdiction of tax residence • beneficiary’s taxpayer identification number. If the beneficiary is a minor: • minor’s age • minor’s jurisdiction of tax residence • minor’s taxpayer identification number • parent or guardian’s name • parent or guardian’s email address • parent or guardian’s physical residential address • parent or guardian’s jurisdiction of tax residence • parent or guardian’s taxpayer identification number. At the time of registration, the contact trustee for a foreign trust must provide information about settlements made on the trust before the trust’s registration. To ensure that the information held by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is kept up to date, subsequent settlements must be reported in the annual return. Consistent with the disclosure of historical settlements, information relating to the provision of minor services at less than market value that are incidental to the activities of the trust does not need to be provided. Also see the sect ion “Informat ion required on registration”. Likewise, detailed information about distributions made during the return year need to be included in the annual return. This includes identifying information about beneficiaries, in line with the information provided at the time of registration. Financial statements As noted above, section 59D(2)(a) requires that if the trustee of a foreign trust prepares financial statements or is required to prepare financial statements, these must be provided with the annual return. The intent is that even if a trust does not prepare financial statements for other purposes, they must prepare financial statements in order to meet their obligations under the foreign trust disclosure requirements. An Order in Council will be made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify the minimum standards for financial statements for foreign trusts. The Order in Council will make it clear for foreign trusts, including those that do not ordinarily prepare financial statements, what information must be provided. Due dates Section 59D(3) requires the annual return, including the financial statements, to be filed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue within six months after the trust’s balance date, or by 30 September if the trust does not have a balance date (which is six months after the end of the tax year). This should allo w resident foreign trustees adequate time to gather required 17 documentation and meet their obligations, as it is acknowledged that much of the information may be held overseas. Annual returns must be provided for every year that includes a period which the foreign trust is registered, or is required to register under section 59B. However, a transit io nal rule in 59D(1)(c) allows resident foreign trustees who become liable to register a trust on the date of enactment, to file returns only for years that begin after 31 March 2017. No additional time is provided to non-professional trustees, or those with tax agents. Fees At the time an application for registration is lodged or an annual return is filed, a resident foreign trust must pay the registration fee or annual return fee, as prescribed in sections 59B(2) and 59D(1). The fees are set out in new section 59E. Section 59E(1) provides that the Governor-General may, from time to time, make regulations prescribing either of these fees. However, until the first regulation has been made under section 59E(1), the fees are set at: • $270 (including goods and services tax) for an application for the registration of a foreign trust; and • $50 (including goods and services tax) for an annual return for a foreign trust and a return year. A number of concessions have been introduced into the foreign trust disclosure rules for non- professional trustees. In line with other concessions relating to the period for registration and the provision of historical settlements, section 59E(5) allows an exemption from both the registration fee and annual return fee for resident foreign trustees who are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services. To be eligible for this exemption, all resident foreign trustees of the foreign trust must be natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services. Information sharing with other agencies Information sharing with domestic enforcement agencies Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to add a new subsection 81(4)(z). Section 81(4) contains exceptions to the tax secrecy rules and allows Inland Revenue to share specified information. New subsection 81(4)(z) specifically allows Inland Revenue to share information relating to the registration or the absence of registration of a foreign trust with the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police. This will enable Inland Revenue to share its register of foreign trusts with the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police. This follows a specific recommendation of the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclo sure Rules. 18 In addition, information collected under the amended disclosure rules will be shared with the Overseas Investment Office once an agreement is in place. Information sharing with tax treaty partners Inland Revenue is also able to share information internationally with its tax treaty partners under exchange of information arrangements (double tax agreements, tax information exchange agreements, and the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters). Inland Revenue can provide information in relation to foreign trusts to other tax authorities under exchange of information agreements if relevant parties (for example, settlors and beneficiaries) are resident in those jurisdictions. However, it is important to note that Inland Revenue is not obligated to send foreign trust information to jurisdictions with which it has a tax treaty if it believes there is a risk in how that information will be used or disclosed. Exchange of information articles in tax treaties contain restrictions on what the information exchanged can be used for. These articles provide that a jurisdiction is not obligated to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professio nal secret or trade process, or any information if it s disclosure would be contrary to public policy. Further, exchanged information can only be disclosed to specific persons, and can only be used by those persons for specified purposes. Consequential amendments A number of sections have been repealed or amended. In the Income Tax Act 2007, sections HC 26(2), (3), and (4) have been repealed as section HC 26 has been substantially rewritten. The definitions of “settlement” and “settlor” have been repealed fro m sect ion 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. They are identical to the definitions provided in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so a specific definition is not necessary due to the operation of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The definition of “qualifying resident foreign trustee” has also been repealed as it was a feature of the previous foreign trust disclosure rules that was not retained. 19
31 March 2017 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue GST and services connected with land This special report provides early information on changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, recently enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. The changes apply goods and services tax (GST) to a wider range of services, particularly professional services, supplied to non-residents who are outside of New Zealand and which closely relate to land in New Zealand. The new rules will similarly ensure that, when these services are provided in relation to land outside New Zealand (whether to residents or to non- residents), they are not charged with GST. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation, which will be published in the June edit io n of the Tax Information Bulletin. Application date The new rules came into force on 1 April 2017. Key features Scope of the new GST rules for services connected with land From 1 April 2017, GST will apply to an expanded range of services, particularly professional services, which are closely related to land in New Zealand. These services will be zero-rated where they relate to land outside New Zealand. The new rules supplement the existing “directly in connection” with land test by adding an addit ional test. Services relating to land in New Zealand Under the expanded rules, GST will apply to services that are supplied in connection with land in New Zealand and which are “intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status” of the land. 1 Services relating to land outside New Zealand Supplies of services that are directly in connection with land outside New Zealand are already zero-rated under the current GST legislation. The new test extends the zero-rating treatment to services supplied in connection with land outside New Zealand when they are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land. Application of the new test The requirement that the services be supplied in connection with land (as described in the amendments) is intended to differentiate between services that have a close connection with specific land (such as those relating to the purchase of a specific property) that can therefore be regarded as consumed in New Zealand, and services that relate to land more generally (such as seeking general advice on land law or the housing market in New Zealand). Under the new test, the relevant services must be intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement. The reference to “services intended to enable or assist a change in physical condition” ensures that services that form an integral part of a process of physically changing the land, but do not do so themselves (such as engineering or architectural services), are captured. By adding to services connected with land services which are “intended to enable or assist a change in the... ownership or other legal status of the land”, a variety of professional services (such as legal or real estate agents’ services as part of a land transaction) are expected to be included because the intended outcome is to change the legal nature of the land, even though the services do not involve any physical change or connection to the land. This will ensure that the GST treatment stems from the location of the land as a proxy for where the services are effectively consumed (consistent with the destination principle and with international practice), rather than the location or residence status of the recipient of the services. This also better aligns the treatment of services provided to non-resident purchasers of New Zealand land so that these services will be subject to GST at 15%, consistent with similar services provided to resident purchasers. Background New Zealand’s GST is a tax on consumption and a key concept underpinning the GST framework is the destination principle. Under this principle, supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. This means that services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand will generally be eit her zero- rated or not included in the GST base. This is based on the presumption that the goods or services will be consumed overseas. There is an exception to this for services supplied directly in connection wit h land. In this situation, the most appropriate place of taxation is the jurisdiction where the land is located. Hence, services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed are not zero-rated when the services are supplied directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand. Based on the same principle, services that are 2 supplied directly in connection with land outside New Zealand are zero-rated (GST levied at 0%). These rules for taxing land-related services are consistent with the “place of taxation” rules set out in the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines (“the Guidelines”). The Guidelines suggest that taxing rights over certain services connected with land may be allocated to the jurisdiction where the property is located. In particular, the Guidelines suggest that this treatment may be appropriate for: • supplies of immovable property itself or the right to use that property; • supplies of services physically provided to the immovable property itself; and • other supplies of services with a very close, clear and obvious link or association with the property. 1 In the case of a number of services in the third category above, Inland Revenue’s interpretation (based on the leading cases Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 and Wilson & Horton Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080) is not consistent with the Guidelines. The “directly in connection” test has been interpreted more narrowly than may have been intended by the original policy: therefore a number of services in the third category are unlikely to satisfy the “directly in connection” test. This has resulted in the potential exclusion of professional services such as architectural, real estate or legal services, which are supplied with the intention of facilitating a change in the legal or physical nature of the land, but do not involve a more physical intervention with the land. In addition, the New Zealand interpretation of the “directly in connection” test is not aligned with the international approach. Misalignment with the approaches of other countries gives rise to a risk of so me services being taxed in more than one jurisdiction, or not being taxed in any jurisdiction at all. The new rules are designed to ensure that New Zealand’s legislation reflects the policy intent and international practice. They also better align the treatment for non-resident purchasers of New Zealand land wit h that for resident purchasers. 1 Guideline 3.8. 3 Detailed analysis References are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless stated otherwise. Scope of the new GST rules for services connected with land The general place of supply rules The GST Act imposes GST on goods and services supplied in New Zealand. The Act adopts a broad set of rules to determine whether a good or service is considered to be supplied in New Zealand. If a New Zealand-resident person supplies services, the supply is treated as having been made in New Zealand, and is therefore subject to GST. Where a non-resident person supplies services, the starting point is that the supply is treated as having been made outside New Zealand, and is therefore not subject to New Zealand GST. However, under section 8(3), services supplied by a non-resident are treated as having been supplied in New Zealand (and are therefore subject to GST) if: • the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time of performance (section 8(3)(b)); or • the services are “remote services” supplied to a person resident in New Zealand (section 8(3)(c)). 2 Rules applying zero-rating to supplies of services to non-residents The place of supply rules in section 8 are followed by a range of exclusions that determine whether the supply is zero-rated or exempt rather than taxed at the normal 15% rate. Subject to a few exceptions (for example, services directly connected with land or with moveable personal property), section 11A(1)(k) applies to zero-rate supplies of services made in New Zealand to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. New section 11A(1)(k) (i) excludes from zero-rating services that are supplied in connection with land in New Zealand (or with an improvement to New Zealand land) and which “are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status” of the land, in addit ion to services which are supplied directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand. 2 Note that there are exceptions for services supplied by non-residents to GST-registered businesses. Section 8(4) provides that if a supply (that is not of a remote service) is made to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on their taxable activity, the services are considered to be supplied outside New Zealand, and therefore not subject to GST, unless the parties agree that GST will apply. Section 8(4D) similarly provides that if remote services are supplied to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on their taxable activity, the services are treated as having been supplied outside New Zealand. The services are therefore not subject to GST unless the non-resident supplier chooses to treat the services as being made in New Zealand (no agreement is required between the supplier and recipient for this purpose). If the supplier chooses to treat the supply of remote services as being made in New Zealand, the supply will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). 4 Hence, under the new test, services relating to land located in New Zealand will not be zero- rated but will be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15% when: • their supply is directly in connection with land or an improvement to the land (the current test); or • their supply is in connection with land in New Zealand or an improvement to the land, and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement. Example 1 Serj is a non-resident who owns a parcel of land in Andersons Bay, Dunedin. He initially intended to have a house constructed on it as his own personal home for when he moves to New Zealand. However, his immigration plans have fallen through, so he now intends to sell the land. He arranges by email for the New Zealand land to be advertised for sale in a New Zealand newspaper. The supply by the newspaper of advertising services does not qualify for zero-rating under section 11A(1)(k), as the exclusion in paragraph (i) applies: the advertising services are supplied in connection with New Zealand land and are intended to assist a change in the ownership status of the land. The newspaper must therefore add 15% GST to the cost of advertising Serj’s property. Example 2 Cynthia is a British resident who is looking at buying a holiday home in New Zealand. While still based in her home in London, she seeks general information from a New Zealand-based property valuation firm on the range of property market values for each region that she is considering in order to determine which areas are affordable for her budget. She also engages a New Zealand-based accountancy firm to advise her on the general tax implications of investing in land in New Zealand. Cynthia decides to submit a tender (through a real estate agent) for an empty lot of land in the Coromandel, where she intends to build a holiday home. Before submitting the tender, she engages a New Zealand-based solicitor to provide her with legal advice and undertake the conveyancing work. She again phones the property valuation firm – this time to ascertain the market value of the Coromandel property. After her tender is accepted by the vendor, she hires a New Zealand architect to draw up the building plans. The supply of property valuation services (relating to the New Zealand housing market generally by region) and the provision of general advice relating to the tax implications of investing in New Zealand property are both zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because neither of these services are directly connected with land, nor do they have a sufficient nexus with any specific piece of New Zealand land to be “intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status” of land in New Zealand. However, the conveyancing and architectural services, the services provided by the real estate agent and the valuation services specifically relating to the Coromandel property do not qualify for zero-rating under section 11A(1)(k), as the exclusion in paragraph (i) applies. These services are supplied in connection with specific land in New Zealand and are intended to assist or enable a change in the ownership status or physical condition of that land. These supplies are therefore charged with GST at 15%. Even if Cynthia’s tender had not been accepted by the vendor, the legal and valuation services relating to the Coromandel property would, on an objective assessment of Cynthia’s intention in respect to the Coromandel property, still be charged with GST at 15% because they are intended to assist a change in the ownership status of the land. Similarly, if Cynthia had decided not to proceed with constructing a building on the site after the plans were drawn up, the architectural services would still be charged with GST at 15% as they are related to specific land and were, at the time of supply, intended to assist a change in the physical condition of the land. 5 Example 3 Gary is a non-resident who is interested in buying a house in New Zealand. During his search on the internet, he finds ten different properties of interest to him. To help him compare each property, he places an order through the website of a New Zealand property valuation firm for an electronic set of valuation reports for each property that he is interested in. Each report includes a valuation generated by an electronic algorithm, based on recent sales of properties which are both nearby and comparable to the property for which the valuation is requested. Although the valuation services do relate to specific land in New Zealand (each valuation report ordered is for a specific title of land), the valuation services cannot objectively be said to be intended to enable or assist a change in the legal nature or ownership status of any of those specific titles of land, as it would be reasonable to assume that Gary does not have a specific intention to purchase all ten properties. (In this case, the property valuation services would be considered to be too many steps removed from the process of changing the ownership status of any one of those ten specific properties.) The supply of property valuation services is therefore zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) (as they would have been under the existing “directly in connection” test). Example 4 Nehal is an Australian resident who is looking to invest in New Zealand real estate. During his search on the internet, he discovers a large lot of empty land in the Northern Wellington area which he thinks would be perfect for subdividing and constructing two large multi-storey houses. He hires Tamati, a New Zealand resident, to act as his agent in tendering for the property. The tender submitted by Tamati for the land is successful, and from his home in Sydney Nehal begins planning for developing the land. He hires Paul, a New Zealand-resident lawyer based in Wellington to perform the conveyancing and subdivision work. When construction begins, Nehal hires a Wellington-based on-site construction supervisor, Rachel, to ensure that the work is done in accordance with building codes and that all of the necessary documentation is produced. Nehal also engages a Wellington-based structural engineering firm to carry out independent anti-seismic evaluations during the later stages of the construction work to ensure the structural soundness of the two buildings. GST is charged at 15% on Tamati, Paul and Rachel’s services, as well as the services supplied by the engineering firm. Tamati and Paul’s services are supplied in connection with land in New Zealand and are intended to enable a change in the legal status of the land. The on-site construction supervision and engineering services are supplied in connection with land in New Zealand and are intended to assist a change in the physical condition of the land or improvements to the land. 6 Example 5 Aiko is a Japanese resident who is considering investing in commercial property owned by B Co., a New Zealand company which owns a range of other assets in addition to the commercial property. From her office in Tokyo, Aiko engages a New Zealand-based accounting firm that offers audit and assurance services to audit B Co.’s financial accounts. B Co.’s financial statements include the details of the rental yield of the commercial property. Because the audit services could be used as a means of deriving a valuation of the commercial property owned by B Co., this scenario may appear to be similar to the situation outlined in Example 2 where a real estate valuation for a specific property was obtained with the intention of changing the ownership status of the land in New Zealand. However, the services concerned here are the audit of the company accounts of B Co. (as opposed to being valuation services more directly related to the land owned by B Co.). As such, the services do not have a sufficient nexus with the land to meet the new legislative test for services supplied in connection with land in New Zealand. The audit services are therefore zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) (as they would have been under the existing “directly in connection” test). Zero-rating of services supplied in connection with land outside New Zealand Amended section 11A(1)(e) extends zero-rating beyond the existing “directly in connection” test to services that are supplied in connection with land situated outside New Zealand, and which are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land. Example 6 Maraina is looking to purchase an apartment in Brussels so that she can be closer to Melissa, her twin sister. Maraina engages a New Zealand-resident lawyer, Gordon, to act for her in a transaction to acquire an apartment. Gordon’s services are in connection with land outside New Zealand and are intended to enable a change in the legal nature of the offshore land. His services are therefore zero-rated under section 11A(1)(e). Maraina’s residency status or location does not affect the application of the rule for services connected with land outside New Zealand. 7 Table 1 provides an indication of the usual treatment of some common services under the new GST rules for services connected with land.

April 2017 (updated 16 April 2017) A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue NRWT: Related party and branch lending The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 introduced a number of changes to the taxation of interest payments to non- residents. This special report provides early information on the new NRWT and AIL rules, and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the June editio n of the Tax Information Bulletin. Background New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on New Zealand-sourced interest paid to foreign lenders. The rate is 15%, usually reduced to 10% if the lender is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. An obligation to withho ld falls on the New Zealand borrower. NRWT is still a tax on the foreign investor and they will usually get a credit for the New Zealand tax against the tax they pay on the interest in their home jurisdiction. A New Zealand borrower can elect to pay the 2% approved issuer levy (AIL) instead of withholding NRWT but only if they are borrowing from an unrelated lender – such as a foreign bank. Foreign lenders cannot claim a credit for AIL against home jurisdiction tax. This means it can be more tax-efficient for NRWT to be paid rather than AIL. Broadly speaking, there are two parts to the reform package: • changes to the NRWT rules generally to bring the rules dealing with timing and quantification of income subject to NRWT in line with the FA rules; and • changes to the NRWT/AIL rules, which particularly affect branch structures. The NRWT reform is about correcting anomalies in the rules to level the playing field for taxpayers to whom the NRWT rules apply (or are intended to apply). The changes focus on ensuring that an NRWT liability arises on interest on related party debt at approximately the same time that an income tax deduction is available to the borrower for that interest. Under the previous rules a number of structures delay or remove the liability for NRWT or replace it with AIL. Changes have also been introduced for related party lending by New Zealand banks. The branch changes level the playing field between certain borrowers who can step around AIL and NRWT by operating an onshore or offshore branch, and other borrowers who cannot and are therefore subject to NRWT or AIL on interest paid to non-resident lenders. Much of the interest on funding that flows through a branch structure is ultimately paid to unrelated parties and will become subject to AIL although NRWT will continue to be available. One kind of structure involving related party lending and onshore branches is now subject to NRWT. 1 Proposals for these changes were consulted on in an officials’ issues paper, NRWT: Related party and branch lending, released in May 2015. Twenty-two submissions were received. Separate targeted consultation was subsequently held with the banking sector on the onshore branch notional interest proposals. Feedback from both consultations helped to shape the NRWT and AIL amendments in the new legislation, which was introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill on 3 May 2016. Further refinements to the proposals were recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to submissions made at the select committee stage of the bill. The main recommendations included: • a number of drafting changes to ensure the rules operate as intended and to assist interpretation; • requiring the non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) amount to be calculated under another spreading method if the borrower uses the fair value method or the market valuation method; • removing amounts from NRFAI that have not and will not be received by the borrower; • removing lending by a non-resident through their New Zealand branch from the scope of the NRFAI rules; • adding an intention test to the back-to-back loan provision; • clarifying and reducing the obligations of a direct lender that is party to a back-to-back loan; • clarifying that the back-to-back loan provisions apply only when the debt is not already between related parties; • removing interest amounts that are already subject to AIL from the notional loan rules; • moving the date of the notional interest payment from the end of the income year to the end of the third month following the income year; • extending the five-year grandparenting of the onshore branch changes to certain securitisation vehicles that raise funding from third parties to provide to other third parties; and • removing the AIL registration proposals. 2 INTEREST ON RELATED PARTY LENDING In broad terms, the amendments address “holes” in the NRWT base to ensure that the tax applies evenly to economically similar and easily substitutable transactions. They do not attempt to expand the NRWT base beyond its target of associated party interest, or interest which is logically indistinguishable from associated party interest. Previously, differences in the timing of payments made under a loan fro m a non-resident parent company to its New Zealand subsidiary resulted in very different NRWT outcomes. For example, on an ordinary interest-paying loan, NRWT is payable every time interest is paid. However, for a zero-coupon bond, NRWT was not payable until the bond matured. This difference in the NRWT treatment was not mirrored in the income tax treatment for the borrower. The deduction for the borrower in an interest-bearing loan is similar to the deduction for the borrower in a zero-coupon bond. The deferral of the NRWT impost compared with the income tax benefit provided a significant timing benefit. Another issue arose with the boundary between NRWT and AIL. While AIL is unavailable when the New Zealand borrower is controlled by the non-resident lender, it was available when a group of lenders were acting together and controlled the New Zealand borrower (typically a joint venture or private equity situations). This situation is difficult to distinguish economically from the case of a single non-resident controller – the group of shareholders are able to act as if they were a single controlling shareholder – yet the availability of AIL differed. The effect of these (and certain other) issues was that non-resident investors who were able to take advantage of them faced a lower effective tax rate in New Zealand than other investors. This was not appropriate. To address these issues the following changes have been introduced: • NRWT must be paid at approximately the same time as interest is deducted by the New Zealand borrower, if the borrower and lender are associated. This means that the NRWT consequence of economically similar loan structures is similar; and • the boundary between NRWT and AIL has been adjusted, so AIL is no longer available when a third party is interposed into what would otherwise be a related party loan or where a group of shareholders are acting together as one to control and fund the New Zealand borrower. These changes bring the NRWT treatment of substantially similar transactions into line. Application date The amendments apply to existing arrangements on and after the first day of the borrower’s income year that starts after the date of enactment, being 30 March 2017. For all other arrangements the amendments came into force on the date of enactment. As the bill was enacted on 30 March 2017 the rules will apply to arrangements entered into after that date. For a taxpayer with a balance date between 30 March 2017 and 30 September 2017, the rules will apply to existing arrangements from the start of the 2017–18 year. 3 For taxpayers with a balance date between 1 October 2017 and 29 March 2018, the rules will apply to existing arrangements from the start of the 2018–19 year. The changes to allow registered banks to pay AIL on associated party funding applied from the date of enactment. Key features Broadening arrangements giving rise to non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income (NRPI) only arises when there is “money lent” (leaving aside dividends and royalties). Although the definition of “money lent” is broad, it did not apply in all situat ions when there was funding provided under a financial arrangement. This could result in a New Zealand borrower incurring financial arrangement expenditure when the non- resident lender had no NRPI. The definit io n of “money lent” has been extended to include any amount provided to a New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) by an associated non-resident under a financial arrangement that provides funding to the resident, and under which the resident incurs financial arrangement expenditure. As “money lent” is a term used in other places in the Income Tax Act 2007, this change is limited to the NRWT rules. Reducing quantum mismatches between NRPI and financial arrangement expenditure To reduce mismatches between the NRWT and financial arrangement rules, the definition of “interest” has been extended to include a payment (whether of money or money’s worth) received by a non-resident from an associated New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident), to the extent that the payment gives rise to expenditure to the borrower under the financial arrangement rules. Related party debt “Related party debt” is a new defined term. It covers all financial arrangements where a non- resident provides funds to an associated New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of an associated non-resident) and the borrower is allowed a deduction under the financial arrangement rules. To prevent this being structured around, it also includes funding provided through an indirect associated funding arrangement or by a member of a non-resident owning body – these terms are explained below. A consequence of this definition is that money lent to exempt borrowers (such as charities) does not meet the “related party debt” definition. This is appropriate as no asymmetry can arise between income tax deductions and a lack of NRWT when there is no income tax deduction. Exempt borrowers continue to be required to withhold NRWT under payment rules that existed before the amendments, provided the other requirements are met. Members of a banking group that are registered by the Reserve Bank are also carved out of having related party debt by section RF 12H(2). This is because amendments to section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) recognise that interest payments by New Zealand banks are directly or indirectly equivalent to third-party debt on which AIL can be paid. Although NRWT will continue to be available on interest payments by banks this can be eliminated by paying AIL instead and AIL does not apply on an accrual basis. 4 Arrangements that provide funds For an arrangement to meet the definition of “related-party debt” one of the criteria it must satisfy, in section RF 12H(1)(a), is that the arrangement provides funds to another person. The purpose of this criterion is that NRWT on interest has historically applied to debt instruments and the amendments are intended to cover arrangements that are economically similar to debt. An arrangement that provides funds is intended to be narrower in scope than a financial arrangement. The concept of a financial arrangement that “provides funds” already exists in a number of places in the Income Tax Act 2007. 1 Due to the wide variety of financial arrangements available it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of particular arrangements that will or will not provide funding. However, the inclusion of this term in the NRWT rules is not intended to alter its interpretation as it previously applied. When the thin capitalisation rules were introduced in 1995, commentary was provided on what the term “providing funds” meant. For reference these are included below: Tax Information Bulletin Volume 7, Number 11, March 1996: The term “provides funds” is not defined in the Act. It is intended to convey the broad concept that only arrangements that provide capital to the issuer should be included in the thin capitalisation regime. Comment from officials in the Officials’ report on the Taxation (International Tax) Bill 1995: However, it is recognised that certain financial instruments covered by the financial arrangement definition do not give rise to capital being made available to the New Zealand entity. These include certain hedging or speculative instruments, such as some foreign exchange transactions and certain swaps. Tax Education Office Newsletter No 121, July 1996: Linking the concept of debt to the “financial arrangement” definit io n potentially encompasses instruments and arrangements which may have no resemblance to standard interest bearing debt, eg futures contracts, swaps and options. However, section FG 4(2) \[of the Income Tax Act 1994\] specifies that the financial arrangement must provide funds to the issuer in order to be categorised as debt under the regime. This requirement is intended to ensure that only arrangements which provide capital to the borrower should be included as debt. For example, swaps should be excluded from the definition of total debt, unless there is a real borrowing rather than simply a swap of interest or currency obligations. In the case of other financial derivatives, such as options and futures contracts, it is unlikely that such arrangements would fulfil the requirement of providing funds to the issuer. 1 See, for example, sections EX 20B and EX 20C in the CFC rules and sections FE 5, FE 6B, FE 13, FE 14, FE 15 and FE 18 in the thin capitalisation rules. 5 Further to the examples provided above officials expect that a finance lease, which in substance is a loan, would generally provide funding whereas an operating lease would not. The examples above provide that a swap would not provide funds and this will generally be the case. One exception to this may be where the swap exchanges collateral which is available to the New Zealand resident; however, this would be very fact specific and would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Calculating whether non-resident financial arrangement income arises One of the principal concerns the amendments addressed is where interest payments (and therefore NRWT) significantly lagged accrued deductions. Although deductions can be accrued on a daily basis, interest is usually paid in arrears, frequently up to 12 months after the start of the interest period. These rules do not apply to arrangements when interest is accrued up to balance date but paid shortly thereafter; they are instead intended to cover more substant ial deferrals. To achieve this, taxpayers, for each related party debt are required to complete a deferral calculation, at the end of the second and subsequent years following issue of a financial arrangement, to determine whether non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) arises. Where the deferral calculation in section RF 2C(4) is satisfied, NRFAI does not arise and the related party debt continues to be taxed under the NRWT rules as they applied before the current amendments. The calculation that must be undertaken separately for each related party debt at the end of each income year is: accumulated payments ÷ accumulated accruals ≥ 90% These terms are defined in section RF 2C(5) as: accumulated payments is the total interest paid since the financial arrangement became a related party debt until the due date for filing the NRWT return for the second month after the end of the income year. accumulated accruals is the total expenditure the borrower incurs (excluding the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations) while the arrangement is a related party debt until the end of the year preceding the income year. The period for the two variables is different, with “accumulated payments” covering payments made up to and somewhat beyond the end of the most recent completed income year while “accumulated accruals” excludes the most recently completed year. There are two reasons for this difference: • This approach ensures NRFAI does not arise simply because interest is paid annually in arrears. • “Accumulated payments” only requires knowing what interest has been paid whereas “accumulated accruals” requires a calculation under the financial arrangement rules, which might often not be made until shortly before the income tax return is filed. Using “accumulated accruals”, excluding the current year means the majority of the necessary calculations will have already been completed in the ordinary course of business (that is, whether or not these rules were introduced). 6 Applying a 90% threshold rather than a 100% threshold provides an additional buffer, so that the deferral calculation is not triggered when the majority of interest payments are paid on a 12-month or less deferral basis, but there is a limited amount of accrued interest – for example, when a bond is issued at a slight discount. This 90% discount also partially equalises the effect on arrangements that are entered into at different points prior to a balance date and before the first interest payment is made. Once NRFAI arises in a year, section RF 2C (2)(a) requires NRWT to continue to apply on an accrual basis so long as the financial arrangement is related party debt. This means it will not be necessary for a taxpayer to repeat the above deferral calculation once the 90% threshold has been breached. Record keeping requirements for NRFAI calculations There is no prescribed form for the deferral calculation. Taxpayers will, however, be expected to complete and retain sufficient records to support their tax position. As the deferral calculation is only important in determining whether NRFAI has been derived, rather than the specific value of that calculation, the record keeping requirements should be broadly proportional to the significance of the calculation. For example, a related party debt that had regular interest payments equal to the interest accrued since the previous interest payment would not be expected to be near the 90% threshold so the records to support this would not need to be particularly detailed. Likewise a related party debt that did not have any interest payments would be treated as over 90% at the first NRFAI due date but would be less than 90% at the second NRFAI due date so again minimal records would be required. In contrast, a taxpayer that completed a deferral calculation showing that the result of the formula was 92% would need to maintain sufficient records to satisfy the Commissioner, if requested, that the 92% figure was accurate and should not instead be below 90%. Related party de minimis threshold If a New Zealand borrower has only a small amount of related party financial arrangement expenditure, the amount of the NRWT deferral, compared wit h income tax deductions, may not be sufficiently large to justify the additional compliance costs of having to apply the NRFAI rules. Sections RF 2C(2)(b)(i) and RF 2C (3) carve out a borrower (and their related party lenders) from applying the NRFAI rules, except in relation to arrangements already subject to NRFAI, if their expenditure on related party debt in the previous year is less than $40,000. Unlike the rest of the NRFAI rules, to minimise compliance costs, this threshold includes foreign exchange movements on those financial arrangements so that a separate calculation is not required to be undertaken. The threshold also includes expenditure incurred by entities with a common ownership (66%) of the borrower, to prevent taxpayers avoiding the NRFAI rules by borrowing through mult iple ent it ies. Timing of calculations and payment The above deferral calculation should be completed as part of the preparation of the NRWT return for the second month after the borrower’s balance date. This NRWT return is due on the 20th of the third month after balance date. This date is defined in section RF 2C(7) as the “NRFAI due date”. Once NRFAI arises for a year, section RF 12E(1) deems it to be paid to the non-resident recipient on the final day of that second month. This determines the dates when the NRFAI must be included in a return and paid. 7 The exception to this timing is when a related party debt ceases during a year (the cessation date) in which case the income arising from the start of that year until the cessation date is treated by section RF 12E(2) as paid on the final day of the second month following the cessation date. Foreign currency conversions For arrangements denominated in foreign currency the income calculations are completed in that currency before any income subject to NRWT is converted into New Zealand dollars for the purpose of calculating the tax payable. The effect of this order is that foreign exchange movements are generally excluded 2 from NRFAI calculations. The general rules for currency conversions in subpart YF apply for the NRWT rules. Section YF 1(2) converts foreign currency into New Zealand dollars by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date at which the amount is required to be measured or calculated. Section RF 12E provides that NRFAI is paid on the last day of the second month after a terminating event or the last day of the second month following the New Zealand borrower’s balance date. This is the date that section YF 1(2) requires the NRFAI amount to be converted into New Zealand dollars. Voluntary election into NRFAI The one-year deferral test above means that NRFAI cannot arise for an arrangement, including one with no regular interest payments, before the end of the second year of the arrangement. However, in some cases (for example, a zero coupon bond) it is self-evident that the instrument will give rise to NRFAI and a borrower may find it easier to apply NRFAI treatment from the inception of the arrangement. Section RF 12G allows taxpayers to elect to apply NRFAI from the first year the arrangement becomes a related party debt. Taxpayers can also elect to disregard the application of the related party de minimis threshold. One reason they may choose to do this is when they expect to be above the de minimis threshold in future years. First-year adjustment The first year that a non-resident derives NRFAI on a related party debt, the borrower will need to calculate the non-resident’s income from the debt for that year using the financial arrangement rules. The method will be the same as the borrower applies to calculate their income tax deductions unless they apply the fair value or market valuation methods in which case another method must be chosen. The non-resident is also treated as deriving an additional amount of income, under section RF 12F, which removes the income deferral from that debt for all prior years, including any years the arrangement existed before enactment of the amendments. 2 The exception to this is the de minimis test in section RF 2C(3), which includes foreign exchange movements to minimise compliance costs for borrowers determining whether the de minimis applies. 8 Taxpayers who wish to avoid paying NRWT on pre-enactment deferral can prevent this by making sufficient interest payments after the enactment of the amendments so that NRFAI does not arise. This distinction arises as the deferral calculation covers only the period back to the day the arrangement became related party debt. Arrangements entered into before application of the new rules can only be related party debt from the first day of the first income year after that application date. Whereas the NRFAI calculation formula goes back to the date the person became party to the arrangement. Amounts not received by the lender The financial arrangement rules are intended to be sufficiently comprehensive that they include expenditure that will never be received by the lender – for example, when a borrower pays fees to a third party. As the NRFAI rules are designed to tax the lender on income they will receive, any amounts that will not be paid to them are excluded. This exclusion does not include amounts that are not received for other reasons, such as default by the borrower. 9 Figure 1: Do I need to pay NRWT on NRFAI?

Yes No Have you elected to disregard the de minimis? Yes No Did the rela ted party financial arrangement exist in the previous year or have you already paid interest? No Yes No Yes Yes No 10 Examples The following examples illustrate the main features of the new rules. Example 1: Zero coupon bond A Co has a 31 March balance date and issues a zero-coupon five-year bond with a face value of $1,000 to an associated non-resident on 1 August 2017. The bond is issued for $700. Deductions are calculated on a YTM basis with a 243/365 ths apportionment between years. # Date Event Payments Deductions Deduction > payment Cash NRWT NRFAI NRWT 1 1 Aug 2017 Arrangement commences -700 2 31 Mar 2018 Balance date 34.46 3 20 Jun 2018 NRFAI calculation date N/A – First year 4 31 Mar 2019 Balance date 54.31 5 20 Jun 2019 NRFAI calculation date 0 ÷ 34.46 = 0% = NRFAI triggered (34.36 + 54.31) x 10% - 0 = 8.87 6 31 Mar 2020 Balance date 58.32 7 20 Jun 2020 NRFAI calculation date Not required 5.83 8 31 Mar 2021 Balance date 62.63 9 20 Jun 2021 NRFAI calculation date Not required 6.26 10 31 Mar 2022 Balance date 67.27 11 20 Jun 2022 NRFAI calculation date Not required 6.72 12 30 Sep 2022 Maturity 1,000 0 13 20 Dec 2022 Maturity NRFAI calculation 2.30 14 31 Mar 2023 Balance date 23.01 Total 300 300 30 The balance date entries in #2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 represent income tax deductions available for the return period ending on that date. These may not be calculated until after this date, though the requirement to calculate and pay provisional tax may mean that the company does in fact calculate them earlier than the balance date. The same also applies for the later examples. The maturity NRFAI calculation in #13 is due on the due date for the NRWT return for the period two months after maturity even though the income tax deduction may not be calculated until sometime after balance date. As this arrangement has no regular interest payments, A Co would be aware from the outset that NRFAI would eventually arise. Therefore, it may elect to apply NRFAI from the commencement date which would result in an NRWT payment of $3.45 at #3 and the NRWT payment at #5 reducing to $5.43. Although this would be cashflow negative it may reduce compliance costs. 11 Example 2: Interest paid less than interest accruing B Co has a 31 March balance date and borrows NZ$1,000 from an associated non-resident on 2 April 2017. B Co will pay $60 of interest on 1 April each year and $1,300 upon maturity on 1 April 2022. Deductions are calculated on a YTM basis with a 364/365 ths apportionment between years. # Date Event Payments Deductions Deduction > payment Cash NRWT NRFAI NRWT 1 2 Apr 2017 Arrangement commences -1,000 2 31 Mar 2018 Balance date 108.03 3 1 Apr 2018 Coupon date 60 6 4 20 Jun 2018 NRFAI calculation date N/A – First year 5 31 Mar 2019 Balance date 113.55 6 1 Apr 2019 Coupon date 60 6 7 20 Jun 2019 NRFAI calculation date 120 ÷ 108.03 = 111.1% 8 31 Mar 2020 Balance date 119.35 9 1 Apr 2020 Coupon date 60 6 10 20 Jun 2020 NRFAI calculation date 180 ÷ 221.58 = 81.2% = NRFAI triggered (108.03 + 113.55 + 119.35) x 10% - 18 = 16.09 11 31 Mar 2020 Balance date 125.78 12 1 Apr 2021 Coupon date 60 Not required 13 20 Jun 2021 NRFAI calculation date Not required 12.58 14 31 Mar 2022 Balance date 132.91 15 1 Apr 2022 Maturity 1,360 Not required 16 20 Jun 2022 NRFAI calculation date Not required 13.29 17 20 Jul 2022 Maturity NRFAI calculation 0.04 18 31 Mar 2023 Balance date 0.36 Total 600 600 60 Although the interest payment at #9 is paid after the end of the March 2020 tax year, which is the first one NRFAI arises in, it is not expected the NRFAI 90% calculation will have been completed by this date as it is not yet due. This is the reason NRWT on a payments basis is still required; however credit is given for this in the 90% calculation. 12 Example 3: Interest accruing but not credited to account C Co has a 30 June balance date and a loan facility from an associated non-resident with an interest rate of 10% pa on the outstanding balance, payable at the demand of the lender. C Co draws down $1,000 from this facility on 1 July 2017. The lender demands annual interest payments of $100 for the first four years. The lender then stops demanding interest payments and the borrower does not credit them to the lender’s account, although interest continues to accrue on an annually compounding basis. C Co calculates its expenditure from the facility under the IFRS financial reporting method. # Date Event Payments Accrued interest Deductions Deduction > payment Cash NRWT NRFAI NRWT 1 1 Jul 2017 Facility draw-down -1,000 2 30 Jun 2018 Balance date 100 100 10 3 20 Sep 2018 NRFAI calculation date N/A – First year 4 30 Jun 2019 Balance date 100 100 10 5 20 Sep 2019 NRFAI calculation date 200 ÷ 100 = 200% 6 30 Jun 2020 Balance date 100 100 10 7 20 Sep 2020 NRFAI calculation date 300 ÷ 200 = 150% 8 30 Jun 2021 Balance date 100 100 10 9 20 Sep 2021 NRFAI calculation date 400 ÷ 300 = 133.3% 10 30 Jun 2022 Balance date 100 100 0 11 20 Sep 2022 NRFAI calculation date 400 ÷ 400 = 100% 12 30 Jun 2023 Balance date 110 110 0 13 20 Sep 2023 NRFAI calculation date 400 ÷ 510 = 78.4% = NRFAI triggered 610 x 10% - 40 = 21 14 30 Jun 2024 Balance date 121 121 Not required 15 20 Sep 2024 NRFAI calculation date Not required 12.10 Total 400 (excluding principal) 331 731 73.10 Even if C Co started paying interest again, this arrangement would stay in NRFAI.

Whether the NRFAI rules result in higher or lower NZ$ NRWT will depend on how exchange rates move over the term of the arrangement. 16 Officials agreed in the Officials’ report to the bill that introduced these rules to provide novation examples which are set out below. Some of the facts in these examples appear non- commercial but are provided to illustrate how the NRFAI rules would apply. Example 6: Novation – borrower pays less than face value NZ Co borrows $1,000 from its non-resident parent US Co with annual interest payments of $50 and the principal repaid upon maturity in 10 years. For each of the first three years NZ Co pays $50 interest and withholds $5 of NRWT. As NZ Co’s interest deductions and payments match, the deferral calculation is not triggered so NRFAI does not arise. At the start of year four NZ Co pays NZ Sub Co, a related party, $800 to take over its obligation under the loan. NZ Co is no longer party to the financial arrangement so completes a base price adjustment that shows $200 of income. NZ Sub Co spreads the $200 difference between the amount it received and the principal repayment over the remaining six years of the arrangement. At the end of year four NZ Sub Co pays $50 interest and withholds NRWT. The deferral calculation at the end of year four is treated as more than 90% under section RF 2C(6). The deferral calculation at the end of year five does not include any portion of the $200 deduction as this amount is expenditure that is not, and will not be, received by US Co so is excluded under section RF 12D(3). Example 7: Novation – borrower pays more than face value NZ Co borrows $1,000 from its non-resident parent US Co with annual interest payments of $50 and the principal repaid upon maturity in 10 years. For each of the first three years NZ Co pays $50 interest and withholds $5 of NRWT. As NZ Co’s interest deductions and payments match the deferral calculation is not triggered so NRFAI does not arise. At the start of year four NZ Co pays NZ Sub Co, a related party, $1,200 to take over its obligation under the loan. NZ Co is no longer party to the financial arrangement so completes a base price adjustment that shows a $200 deduction. NZ Sub Co spreads the $200 difference between the amount they received and the principal repayment over the remaining six years of the arrangement. At the end of year four NZ Sub Co pays $50 interest and withholds NRWT. The deferral calculation at the end of year four is treated as more than 90% under section RF 2C(6). The deferral calculation at the end of year five and each subsequent year shows cumulative payments exceed cumulative deductions so NRFAI is never triggered and NRWT remains on a payments basis. 17 Example 8: Assignment NZ Co borrows $1,000 from its non-resident parent US Co with no annual interest payments and $2,000 repaid upon maturity in 10 years. The YTM spread is: Year Cashflow Deduction Accrued balance 0 1,000 1,000.00 1 0 71.77 1,071.77 2 0 76.92 1,148.70 3 0 82.45 1,231.14 4 0 88.36 1,319.51 5 0 94.71 1,414.21 6 0 101.50 1,515.72 7 0 108.79 1,624.50 8 0 116.60 1,741.10 9 0 124.96 1,866.07 10 -2,000 133.93 0.00 The deferral calculation at the end of year 1 is treated as more than 90% but at the end of year two is 0% so NRFAI is triggered. NRFAI at year two, including the first year adjustment, is $148.69 so NRWT of $14.87 is paid. At the start of year three US Sub Co, a related party, pays US Co $1,100 to take over its rights in the loan. At the end of year three NZ Co is still party to the same arrangement and it is still a related party debt so they pay NRWT of $8.25 on the deemed income of $82.45 for the year. At the end of the arrangement US Co will have derived $100 profit with $15.39 of NRWT withheld while US Sub Co will have derived $900 profit with $84.61 of NRWT withheld. This difference arises as the amount paid by US Sub Co for the assignment is less than the accrued value at the time of the assignment. Defining when payments are to a related person New Zealand borrowers that meet the requirements of section RF 12(1)(a) can pay AIL on a payment of interest that is NRPI. When AIL is paid, this NRPI qualifies for a zero-rate of NRWT. The requirements of section RF 12(1)(a) include that the borrower is not associated with the lender, unless the borrower is a member of a New Zealand banking group. Back-to-back loans and multi-party arrangements Before the enactment of the new rules the NRWT and AIL rules did not “look through” to the ultimate lender to a New Zealand borrower. Leaving aside the possible application of the general anti-avoidance provision, this allowed a New Zealand borrower to interpose one or more third parties into what would otherwise be a loan from an associated person. An example of this type of arrangement is a back-to-back loan. 18 Arrangements have also been entered into that are not back-to-back loans in the conventional sense but which also involve indirect funding by a non-resident lender to a resident associated borrower without the imposition of NRWT, while maintaining an income tax deduction calculated under the financial arrangement rules. Amendments now define these back-to-back loans and mult i-party arrangements as “indirect associated funding” if they are entered into with the purpose or effect that the borrower incurs financial arrangement expenditure and the associate does not derive non-resident passive inco me fro m the borrower. Interest payments on indirect associated funding are ineligible for AIL and the New Zealand-resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) borrower will have to consider whether NRFAI arises if interest payments on indirect associated funding have an inappropriate amount of deferral compared with income tax deductions. Indirect associated funding arises when a non-resident associate of a New Zealand borrower provides funding, directly or indirectly, to a third party so it can be provided to the New Zealand borrower or to reimburse the third party for funds provided to the New Zealand borrower. This also applies to arrangements where part of the funding is provided by an associated non-resident and part is provided by the third party. This is achieved by treating any amount lent by or repaid to the associate as being lent directly to the New Zealand borrower rather than the third party. Any interest payments made by the New Zealand borrower to the third party are treated as being made by the New Zealand borrower to the third party as agent for the associate, to the extent they are attributable to money lent by the associate. The amendments capture all arrangements involving a New Zealand borrower, third party and an associated non-resident if there is some linkage between the two amounts of funding provided, but not arrangements where there is no linkage, other than the existence of a common third party. If a borrower does not withhold NRWT on an indirect funding arrangement the direct lender will be required to do so (even if they are themselves a New Zealand resident). This is consistent with the existing treatment of NRWT not being withheld by a payer, aside from the following points: • The direct lender will not have an obligation to deduct NRWT from the payment received if they have taken actions to confirm this is not a back-to-back loan but have incorrect information. For example if the borrower incorrectly represents that this is not a back-to-back loan. • If the arrangement has insufficient interest payments that result in the NRFAI deferral calculation for the borrower being less than 90%, the borrower is required to pay NRWT on the NRFAI. The direct lender cannot be expected to know that this arrangement is NRFAI or the amount of NRFAI calculated so will continue to have the same obligations as above on any interest payments received. Any NRWT withheld by the direct lender on a payments basis will be available to the borrower and/or indirect lender to meet any NRWT liability arising on an NRFAI basis. • In the event that the above NRWT was not withheld/paid by the relevant parties Inland Revenue would commence collection activity consistent with other debts. Inland Revenue would generally seek to collect this tax from the borrower or the indirect lender in the first instance before seeking to collect from the direct lender and would not seek to recover this tax from the direct lender when they did not originally have an obligation to withhold under the principles above. 19 Example 9: Commercial arrangement Foreign Parent has $1,000,000 on deposit with Australian Bank while its subsidiary, NZ Sub, has a $500,000 loan from Australian Bank NZ Branch. Both the deposit and loan are on independent arm’s length terms. Withdrawal of the deposit will have no effect on the loan, and the deposit is not security for the loan’s repayment. In this case, Foreign Parent is not considered to have provided this deposit so that Australian Bank could lend it to NZ Sub. Therefore, this is not indirect associated funding. Example 10: Back-to-back loan NZ Co has a $1,000,000 loan from NZ Bank on which it pays 5% interest. NZ Co’s parent, Aus Hold Co has a $700,000 deposit with Aus Bank, the Australian parent of NZ Bank on which it receives 4.9% interest. Bank lending documents show NZ Co pays 5%, instead of 6% charged to other borrowers, due to Aus Hold Co’s deposit, and withdrawal of the deposit triggers a right for the Bank to demand repayment of, or to increase the interest rate on, the loan. The new provisions impose NRWT as follows. This analysis would also apply if NZ Bank were instead a branch of Aus Bank. This arrangement is treated as an indirect funding arrangement with a $700,000 loan from Aus Hold Co (the indirect lender) to NZ Co (the borrower) and a $300,000 loan from NZ Bank (the direct lender) to NZ Co. NZ Co makes $50,000 annual interest payments (the first interest payment) to NZ Bank and Aus Bank makes $34,300 annual interest payments (the second interest payment) to Aus Hold Co. The first interest payment is treated as a $34,300 interest payment from NZ Co to NZ Bank as agent for Aus Hold Co on which the borrower must withhold NRWT and a $15,700 interest payment from NZ Co to NZ Bank which is treated in the standard manner (NZ Bank has an RWT exemption certificate so no RWT is withheld; however, this is assessable income to NZ Bank). The second interest payment from Aus Bank to Aus Hold Co is treated as a payment of money held as an agent so no NRWT or AIL is required. If NZ Co did not withhold NRWT NZ Bank would be required to pay NRWT on $34,300 of the $50,000 interest payment it received from NZ Co. Example 11: NRFAI and obligations on the direct lender NZ Co has a 31 March balance date and borrows NZ$1,000 from a third party finance company (NZ Finance Co) on 2 April 2017. This example uses the same figures from example 2. NZ Co will pay $60 of interest on 1 April each year and $1,300 upon maturity on 1 April 2022. Deductions are calculated on a YTM basis with a 364/365 ths apportionment between years. On 2 April 2017 NZ Finance Co also borrows $1,000 from NZ Co’s non-resident parent with interest of $55 on 1 April each year and $1,300 upon maturity on 1 April 2022. NZ Finance Co is a NZ resident with an RWT exemption certificate. Assuming these two loans are back-to-back loans, this will be an indirect associated funding arrangement so NZ Co is required to withhold $5.50 of NRWT (assuming 10% is the appropriate withholding tax rate for a payment by NZ Co to its parent) on each $60 interest payment to NZ Finance Co. The NRWT is $5.50 as only $55 of the $60 interest payment is treated as received on behalf of NZ Co’s non-resident parent. The terms of the loan between NZ Co and NZ Finance Co require NZ Co to gross the interest payments up so that NZ Finance Co continues to receive $60. On 20 June 2020 NZ Co advises NZ Finance Co that this arrangement has triggered the NRFAI rules and that NRWT will no longer be withheld on the remaining interest payments. NZ Co will be required to pay NRWT to Inland Revenue on the NRFAI arising and neither NZ Co or NZ Finance Co will pay NRWT on the interest payments to NZ Finance Co. 20 Example 12: NRFAI and obligations on the direct lender This example is the same as example 11 above, except NZ Co does not comply with its tax obligations. Upon receiving the $60 interest payment with no NRWT withheld, NZ Finance Co will be required to pay $5.50 of NRWT to Inland Revenue. It is expected the loan agreement would allow NZ Finance Co to recover this amount from NZ Co. On 21 June 2020 NZ Co advises NZ Finance Co that the arrangement has triggered NRFAI so NZ Finance Co stops paying NRWT on interest payments after that date. NZ Co would continue to have a liability for NRWT on the interest payments and NRFAI once the deferral calculation was triggered on 20 June 2020 however, the total amount payable would be reduced by any NRWT paid by NZ Finance Co. To the extent insufficient NRWT was paid, Inland Revenue would commence collection actions. The attempts to collect this NRWT would likely be from NZ Co and NZ Co’s non-resident parent in the first instance. Inland Revenue could also attempt to collect NRWT from NZ Finance Co if this was unsuccessful; however, the maximum amount that could be collected from NZ Finance Co would be capped at NRWT on a payments basis for interest payments before they received the NRFAI notification (that is, $5.50 in each of the April 2018 to April 2020 periods). Example 13: Commercial cash pooling arrangement Multinational Group has subsidiaries in a number of countries including New Zealand. Each of these subsidiaries has a notional cash pooling account with Worldwide Bank Ltd which it uses for managing its working capital requirements. The New Zealand subsidiary’s balance in the cash pooling account can be positive or negative within limits agreed with Worldwide Bank. During the month of June 2018 the New Zealand subsidiary’s average balance is -$50,000 while the parent company’s average balance is +$750,000. Worldwide Bank does not charge the New Zealand subsidiary interest for June 2018. The parent company has not put money into the cash pool in order for money to be withdrawn by the New Zealand subsidiary so this is not indirect associated funding and the new rules do not apply. This conclusion is not affected if there is a compensatory payment by the New Zealand subsidiary to the parent. Example 14: Back-to-back loan through a cash pooling arrangement US Parent has a $10,000,000 loan to NZ Subsidiary on which the interest payments are subject to NRWT. NZ Subsidiary repays this loan by withdrawing from an account with US Bank. This account is part of a cash pooling arrangement with other members of US Parent’s group. US Parent uses the $10,000,000 repaid by NZ Subsidiary to make a deposit with US Bank in an account that is also part of the cash pooling arrangement. Because these amounts offset each other, US Parent does not receive any interest from US Bank but neither does NZ Subsidiary pay interest to US Bank. NZ Subsidiary pays $100,000 per month to US Parent as part of a transfer pricing agreement which is a deductible funding cost to NZ Subsidiary. Section RF 12J treats this arrangement as a loan from US Parent to NZ Subsidiary. This means that the $100,000 per month payment is New Zealand-sourced income for US Parent, from which NRWT must be withheld. 21 Example 15: Sale of part of a loan to borrower’s associate NZ Co borrows $1,000 from NZ Bank with $100 annual interest payments and the $1,000 repaid in five years. As part of the same arrangement, NZ Bank sells the principal repayment to Aus Parent Co, the ultimate owner of NZ Co for $600. For tax purposes this is treated as two separate financial arrangements, a five-year $400 amortising loan from NZ Bank to NZ Co and a five-year $600 bullet loan from Aus Parent Co to NZ Co as follows: From To Arrangement commences Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Total interest NZ Bank NZ Co -400 100 100 100 100 100 100 Aus Parent Co NZ Co -600 1,000 400 There is no equivalent amount paid by NZ Bank to Aus Parent Co so the $100 interest payments by NZ Co to NZ Bank are treated as payments of principal and interest between two New Zealand residents under the financial arrangements rules. The $1,000 final payment, whether paid directly to Aus Parent Co or paid to NZ Bank as agent for Aus Parent Co is treated as a $600 principal repayment and a $400 interest payment from NZ Co to Aus Parent Co, therefore NZ Co must withhold NRWT. However, as NZ Co is claiming financial arrangement deductions for funding provided by an associated non-resident, this arrangement will trigger NRFAI on which NRWT will be required to be paid by NZ Co over the term of the arrangement. Acting together Before the amendments were made, the non-association tests for accessing the AIL rules relied on the associated persons definition in subpart YB. One of the tests in the associated person rules states that two companies are associated if a group of persons exists whose total voting interests in each company are 50 percent or more. This means that if two or more companies each had ownership interests of less than 50 percent in a New Zealand borrower, these companies were not associated with that borrower unless they are themselves associated. Transactions were identified where two or more non-associated persons (investors), each with less than 50 percent ownership interests in a New Zealand borrower, together provided debt funding to that borrower under an arrangement. Even though these investors may have been genuinely not associated (for example, three pension funds for quite different groups of employees) they could make decisions about the borrower collectively, and in economic substance, operate in a similar manner as if they were a single owner. By operating in this manner, the investors could make decisions in a similar manner to a single owner such as inserting debt (subject to thin capitalisation requirements) in proportion to their ownership interests and thereby received a return on their total (equity + debt) investment with a large proportion of this being deductible in New Zealand. This problem was not unique to the NRWT/AIL rules. Until recently, the same structure meant the thin capitalisation rules did not restrict the New Zealand borrower’s interest deductions. In March 2017 the Government also announced proposals to address this issue in relation to transfer pricing. 22 To prevent this, “related party debt” now includes funding provided by a member of a non- resident owning body. This means: • interest payments on this funding are ineligible for AIL; and • when interest payments are inappropriately deferred compared with deductions, the arrangement may generate NRFAI. A non-resident owning body was an existing concept within the thin capitalisation rules; this definition has now been moved to section YA 1. The thin capitalisation “acting together” rules were explained in greater detail in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 26, No 7, August 2014. In short, a non-resident owning body is a group of non-residents or entities (such as trusts settled by non-residents), that have one or more characteristics indicating they are acting together to debt-fund a New Zealand company. These characteristics include: • having proportionate levels of debt and equity among the group; • an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded with member-linked funding if the company is not widely held (a term defined in section YA 1); and • member-linked debt in the company in a way recommended by a person (such as a private equity manager), or implemented by a person on behalf of the members. Proportionality is a characteristic of acting together as it generally requires a degree of coordination to achieve. More generally, proportionality is also a situation where shareholders are able to substitute debt for equity. This is because, where there is proportionality, the level of debt in a company does not change shareholders’ exposure to the risk of holding equity in the company or shareholders’ overall return. Due to the ability to structure an arrangement to achieve this outcome without explicit proportionate debt, the test is structured to cover transactions that may not have proportionate debt but can still be considered the result of acting together. Prepayments of interest A transitional prepayment rule prevents a company effectively continuing the previous non- imposition of NRWT beyond application of the new rules by prepaying interest on a financial arrangement before the new rules took effect. This situation may arise when a borrower is required to withhold NRWT on interest on an arrangement that became a related-party debt when the new rules come into force but was not previously paying non-resident passive income (for example, because of the onshore branch exemption) or was paying AIL on interest to an unassociated party (for example, as part of an arrangement that is now treated as a loan from persons who are associated with the borrower because they are acting together). The prepayment rule compares the amount of interest paid with any financial arrangement deductions taken to the date the new rules apply. Any excess interest paid is treated as being paid on the first day the new rules apply and will therefore be liable for NRWT. Any AIL previously withheld on these interest payments can be refunded or transferred against an existing tax liability. This rule is not intended to capture foreign exchange movements on arrangements denominated in foreign currencies. When an arrangement is denominated in a foreign currency both the interest payments and total expenditure should be calculated in that foreign currency and then any excess converted to New Zealand dollars using the existing rules in subpart YF of the Income Tax Act 2007. 23 Example 16: Prepayment rule NZ Co is owned 25 percent each by four non-resident private equity funds. NZ Co has been making interest payments to each fund of $100,000 per year and paying $2,000 of AIL on each interest payment. As NZ Co knows its owners will be treated as acting together when the new rules apply to their interest payments after 1 April 2017 they agree that on 1 January 2017 NZ Co will make a one-off interest payment to each fund of $800,000 with no further interest payments until after 1 April 2027. NZ Co pays $16,000 of AIL on each of these payments in its January 2017 AIL return. On 1 April 2017 it is calculated that interest payments exceed deductions by $700,000 for each fund; therefore, NZ Co is treated as paying $700,000 to each fund on 1 April 2017 and only $100,000 to each fund on 1 January 2017. $70,000 of NRWT is required to be paid on behalf of each fund. NZ Co can apply to the Commissioner to have $14,000 of AIL refunded for the interest payment to each fund that is no longer treated as being paid on 1 January 2017. Interest payments by a member of a registered banking group For a New Zealand bank that is part of a wider worldwide banking operation, there are commercial reasons why the New Zealand bank may borrow from its parent or another associated entity. This can include the better credit rating held by the larger parent, economies of scale of a single funding operation and/or better name recognition of the parent, which allows funding to be raised more cheaply. It can reasonably be considered that funding on-lent to a New Zealand bank by its parent is ultimately largely borrowed from unrelated parties and not generally provided by the parent bank’s shareholders as a substitute for equity. As the offshore and onshore branch exemptions have been restricted, New Zealand banks can no longer rely on these structures to remove their NRWT liabilit y. In the absence of further changes, New Zealand banks would have had a tax incentive to raise all funding from third parties so that AIL could be paid instead of NRWT even when, in the absence of tax, it would be economically efficient to borrow through an associated party. Changes to section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) allow a member of a banking group to pay AIL on interest payments to an associated non-resident. These changes have not been extended to non-banks, including other businesses operating in the financial sector. This is because, unlike other industries, banks already have a clear definition which removes boundary issues and provides confidence that related-party funding is not an economic substitute for equity investment. This is consistent with other legislation where New Zealand-registered banks are subject to more rigorous thin capitalisation requirements and greater regulatory oversight by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, than other financial sector taxpayers. 24 BRANCH LENDING CHANGES A number of amendments have been made to the NRWT rules and the source rules that ensure that interest payments from a New Zealand resident (or a New Zealand branch of a non-resident) to a non-resident are subject to NRWT or AIL irrespective of whether that funding is channelled through a branch or an entity that has a branch. This ensures that funding transactions that are economically equivalent have a consistent tax treatment. Offshore branch exemption Changes to the source rules apply NRWT or AIL to an interest payment from the offshore branch of a New Zealand resident to a non-resident to the extent that the offshore branch lends money to New Zealand residents. Onshore branch exemption Changes to the NRWT rules apply NRWT or AIL to an interest payment from a New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) to a non-resident if that non-resident has a New Zealand branch, unless the interest is derived by the New Zealand branch. These changes do not apply to a New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) that pays interest to a non-resident that they are not associated with and that has a New Zealand branch that holds a banking licence. Onshore notional loans New subpart FG and changes to the NRWT rules apply NRWT or AIL (to the extent it was not already) to a notional interest payment from a New Zealand branch of a bank to its head office. This interest payment will be equal to the amount already included in the branch’s financial statements and claimed as a deduction against New Zealand income of the branch. Application date For existing arrangements, the branch amendments apply to interest payments on or after the date shown in the table below. For all other arrangements, the branch amendments apply to interest payments on or after the day the bill was enacted, being 30 March 2017. 25 Scenario Borrower Lender Application date for existing arrangements Intended regime Onshore branches Related party NZ Corporate Foreign associate with NZ Branch Royal assent NRWT Intra-bank Group NZ Bank Sub Foreign parent with NZ Branch Income years five years after Royal assent NRWT or AIL Intra-bank Entity NZ Bank Branch Foreign head office Income years two years after Royal assent NRWT or AIL Corporate NZ Corporate including NZ Bank Third Party with NZ Branch Income years five years after Royal assent NRWT or AIL Third party bank NZ borrower Foreign bank with NZ Branch No change Net income tax Offshore branches Wholesale funding NZ Bank Sub branch Third parties or Foreign parent Income years five years after Royal assent NRWT or AIL The ability for a member of a banking group to pay AIL on an interest payment to an associated party applies from the date of enactment, being 30 March 2017. Further detail is provided on application dates under Key features below. Key features Offshore branch exemption NRPI includes only income that has a New Zealand source. One of the exclusions from having a New Zealand source is the offshore branch exemption. This exemption is intended to apply to a New Zealand resident operating an active business through a branch in another country. If that offshore branch borrows money to fund its offshore operations, the interest on this funding should not be subject to NRWT. This treatment ensures that the offshore branch of a New Zealand company does not have to pay NRWT when a foreign incorporated subsidiary borrowing for an equivalent business would not have to. However, this exemption previously applied when a New Zealand company set up an offshore branch that borrowed money for the purpose of providing funding to New Zealand borrowers, who may have been associated or unassociated with the New Zealand company. The amendments result in an interest payment by an offshore branch of a New Zealand resident to a non-resident having a New Zealand source to the extent that the branch lends to New Zealand residents. 26 Application of offshore branch exemption Offshore Branch NZ Company 2 Offshore Branch NZ Company 2 Foreign Lender OffshoreNZ Foreign Factory NZ Company Foreign Lender Interest (n o NRW T – o ff sho r e br anch exemption) Interest (NRWT – offshore branch exemption does not ap ply) Interest (n o NRWT – between N Z r es id en ts) It is possible for an offshore branch of a New Zealand resident to have a business that includes lending to New Zealand residents and other business conducted outside New Zealand. In this instance, any interest payments by the branch are apportioned based on the proportion of branch assets that are financial arrangements producing New Zealand-sourced income. De minimis provisions in section YD 5(6) and (7) apply when assets deriving New Zealand-sourced income are less than 5% or more than 95% of a branch’s assets. To ensure that interest payments by an offshore branch are appropriately subject to New Zealand tax, section 86IC of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 has been inserted to make the payment of AIL mandatory on relevant interest payments unless NRWT is withheld. 27 Grandparenting of the offshore branch exemption The changes to the offshore branch exemption apply to interest payments on arrangements entered into before the enactment of the bill on 30 March 2017 after a grandparenting period of five complete income years post-enactment. This reflects that these offshore branches have entered into commercial arrangements, frequently with unassociated parties, for terms that usually do not exceed five years, and that have been ultimately used to fund New Zealand borrowing, which is also often at fixed interest rates. All other interest payments by offshore branches apply the new rules fro m the date of enactment, being 30 March 2017. Onshore branch exemption New Zealand-sourced interest income derived by a non-resident was not previously NRPI when the non-resident lender was engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This exemption from NRPI is known as the “onshore branch exempt ion”. This exemption applied irrespective of whether the lending was made through the New Zealand branch. As with the New Zealand branch income, this non-branch (but New Zealand-sourced) income is subject to New Zealand net income tax. This means it was possible for a non-resident parent to lend money to its New Zealand subsidiary with no tax payable on the interest (other than income tax on a very slim margin). The parent could simply lend the money to the head office of a non-New Zealand group company which had a New Zealand branch. The head office of that company could then lend the money to a New Zealand group company. The following diagrams illustrate the new rules. The onshore branch exemption has been narrowed so that it only applies to interest payments derived by the New Zealand branch of a non-resident. Application of onshore branch exemption Foreign Sub 2 N Z Branc h Foreign Sub 1 N Z Branc h N Z Sub Foreign Parent Offshore NZ Interest (n o NRW T – o ns ho re br anch exemption) Interest (NRWT – NZ source) Interest (n o NRW T – n o NZ so ur ce) Interest (NRWT – o ns ho re branch exemption does not ap ply) 28 One exception to this is that the onshore branch exemption continues to apply to loans not made by the onshore branch if the non-resident lender has a New Zealand branch that holds a banking licence and is not associated with the borrower. This is mainly to minimise compliance costs for individual borrowers who were not previously, but would otherwise be, required to withhold NRWT or pay AIL on interest payments to foreign banks for mortgages over foreign properties. Application of onshore branch exemption to borrowing from foreign banks Foreign Bank N Z Branc h NZ Bank SubNZ Borrower Offshore NZ Interest (NRWT – o ns ho re br anch exemption does not apply) Interest (n o NRW T – o ns ho re br anch exemption) Grandparenting of the onshore branch exemption When a New Zealand resident, other than a registered bank or certain securitisation vehicles, is borrowing from an associated non-resident that has a New Zealand branch, these amendments came into force on the date of enactment, being 30 March 2017. When the New Zealand resident is borrowing from an unassociated non-resident that has a New Zealand branch, or when the borrower is a bank or certain qualifying securitisat io n vehicles, these changes will apply after a grandparenting period of five years. This is because these are, directly or indirectly, with unrelated parties and reflect arm’s-length transactions that are frequently entered into for longer terms. This grandparenting applies to interest payments by securitisation vehicles that are a trustee of a trust that, as its core business: • has no trust property other than financial arrangements and property incidental to financial arrangements; and • has total debt that is sourced from another securitisation vehicle, a person who is not associated with the trustee, or an authorised deposit-taking institution regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority; and • provides funds, directly or indirectly, only to a resident who is not associated with the trustee, unless the association arises because the resident, or another person associated with them, is a settlor of the trust as an incident of the arrangement. 29 These criteria ensure that the grandparenting only applies to securitisation vehicles that, as their core business, borrow money from third parties or Australian authorised deposit-taking inst itutions (such as banks) to on-lend to unassociated New Zealand residents. Onshore notional loans The amendments equalise the tax treatment between foreign banks that channel offshore funding through their New Zealand subsidiaries and foreign banks that channel offshore funding through their New Zealand branches. In both cases the subsidiary and the branch can claim a deduction for an interest expense on funding provided by their foreign operations (a notional interest expense in the case of the branch). But whereas the subsidiary has always had to pay NRWT (or AIL going forward under other amendments discussed above) on it s interest payment, the branch previously paid neither because there is no actual interest flow to the extent that its payment is to head office rather than to a separate company (because it is not possible for one part of an entity to make a legally recognised payment to another – the “payment” is merely a movement of funds). This was an inconsistent result and had the potential to distort behaviour. Australia has rules which are similar, in substance, to the changes. The Australian rules apply a 5% withholding tax to a notional interest payment by a branch to its head office. An amount that the head office makes available to the branch, that is recorded in the branch’s accounting records, is a notional loan from the head office to the branch. When the branch is allowed a deduction as an interest payment on that notional loan it will be a notional interest payment that can be subject to NRWT or AIL. NRWT or AIL will be calculated on an accrual basis to match that already calculated by the banks for financial reporting and income tax purposes. When a foreign-owned bank borrows specifically to fund its New Zealand operations through a New Zealand branch any interest payments have always had a New Zealand source and been subject to NRWT or AIL. Accordingly, these interest payments are removed from the notional loan changes so they are not subject to NRWT or AIL twice. Like the offshore branch changes discussed above, these notional interest payments will require AIL to be paid if NRWT is not withheld. Interest on notional loans is deemed to be paid on the last day of the third month following an income year. This period matches the period within which the interest charge must be calculated for non-tax reporting purposes. If a subsequent transfer pricing adjustment reduces the income tax deduction available for a notional loan new section 86GB(1)(b) will also reduce the AIL liability by the same amount. 30 New treatment of notional loans Foreign Bank N Z Branc h NZ Bank Sub Foreign lenders Offshore NZ Interest (AIL – o ns ho re br anch exemption will not apply) Interest (n o NRW T – o ns ho re br anch exemption) Interest (n o NRW T – n o NZ so ur ce) Notional Interest (NRWT or AIL) Grandparenting of the notional loan changes A degree of grandparenting is appropriate as these notional loans have been used to provide funding at fixed rates to New Zealand borrowers. However, unlike the offshore branch exemption and onshore branch exemption changes discussed above, funding allocated to the New Zealand branch cannot be identified from a specific loan that may have a fixed maturit y date (otherwise it would already be subject to NRWT/AIL). These rules will therefore apply to existing arrangements after a grandparenting period of two years. Example 17: Notional loans UK Bank, which has a 31 December balance date, is registered with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for operations through its New Zealand branch. On 1 January 2017 UK Bank allocates NZ$1 billion of funding to its New Zealand branch. This funding is provided for a term of five years at a fixed interest rate of 5%. Inland Revenue has reviewed this funding and did not identify any significant mispricing, and has rated the transaction for transfer pricing purposes as a low risk. Accordingly UK Bank’s NZ Branch will include $50 million of interest expenditure in its financial statements and income tax returns for the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2021. As this transaction was entered into prior to the enactment of the new rules it will qualify for the two year grandparenting. Therefore the notional loan changes will apply to the loan from 1 January 2020. Before 31 December 2020 UK Bank’s NZ Branch registers as an approved issuer (if they were not already) and provides a completed IR 397 form to treat the loan as a registered security. UK Bank’s NZ Branch is treated as paying NZ$50 million of interest on a registered security to UK Bank on 31 March 2021 (for the year ended 31 December 2020) and 31 March 2022 (for the year ended 31 December 2021). It includes $50 million of interest payments and $1 million of approved issuer levy in its AIL returns for the 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2022 periods. 31

Hon Sir Michael Cullen  
Chair, Tax Working Group

Speech to the New Zealand International Fiscal Association (IFA) Conference, Queenstown, 2 March 2018, 2.15pm

### Purpose, principles, and possibilities: The Tax Working Group

#### Introduction

Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to talk with you today about aspects of the work of the Tax Working Group set up by the new Government just before Christmas.

I want to talk about five aspects of the Group. Hopefully, I will cover the first four briefly: the background to its formation, its terms of reference, its membership, and its proposed process.

Finally, I will move on to a somewhat longer discussion of the soon to be released Submissions Background Paper. I want to emphasise in particular the framework of purposes and principles which the Group has been developing at its first three full meetings.

#### Background

The reasons why the Labour Party went into the last election with a policy of a substantial review by a working group of the tax system are not, on the face of things, clear. Labour fought the 2014 election on a policy of introducing a comprehensive capital gains tax regime of 15% on realised assets, excluding the family home.

After the 2014 election some, including new leader Andrew Little, in part blamed the CGT commitment for the calamitous nature of Labour’s defeat. Others remained of the view that the commitment was crucial to a better tax system and that there were other reasons which better explained the magnitude of the disaster.

It seems likely that the proposal to undertake a more general review of the system was a compromise between these opposing views.

Nevertheless, and inevitably, the vagueness of this policy left plenty of room for mischief-making by other parties and this led to some clarifications concerning limitations on the scope of the review.

#### The Terms of Reference

This brings me to the Terms of Reference for the review. In essence they are quite simple. The terms state that the Working Group has been established “in order to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the system”. Anyone who thinks that the terms were drafted by me can be immediately assured to the contrary by this statement: there is no Oxford comma after fairness.

The Terms go on to reaffirm the soundness of the established New Zealand guiding principle that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible.

As always when discussing the objectives and purposes of the tax system there is a tension between this stress upon simplicity and neutrality and other criteria. In the case of the Working Group’s Terms of Reference these include such matters as fairness, promoting the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy, supporting a sustainable revenue base to fund operating expenditure around current levels, treating all income and assets in a fair balanced and efficient manner (having special regard to housing affordability), and a progressive tax and transfer system.

We are also tasked with considering in particular the economic environment over the next five to ten years and the drivers of changes to that environment; whether taxing capital gains or land or other housing tax measures would improve the system; the possibility of a progressive company tax system; and what role tax has in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes.

The exclusions from the scope include consideration of inheritance taxes, any increases in the rates of income tax or GST, a capital gains tax or any other changes to taxation that would apply to the family home or the land under it, and the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system.

Also excluded are what are called “more technical matters already under review as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme”, including tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing agenda and policy changes as part of IRD’s Business Transformation Programme.

In my view these exclusions and limitations do not unduly restrict the ability of the Tax Working Group to undertake a comprehensive review of the tax system. Some simply avoid repetition of work underway, while not precluding a broader consideration of the issues. Others simply reflect political realities. Even were the voice of God to emerge from the clouds telling us to have a CGT on the family home I am certain any New Zealand government would manage not to hear it!

Moreover, I am of the clear view that where there is ambiguity in some of the language the Group may legitimately take a fair, large and liberal interpretation of it. Finally, there are obviously some tensions between parts of the terms of reference. That seems to me an inevitability and could be described as simply part of the human condition.

#### Membership

The membership of the Group is both larger and more diverse than its predecessors. That is deliberate. That is not to say that tax practitioners are not well represented. Apart from the redoubtable Robin Oliver there is Geoff Nightingale (PwC), Joanne Hodge (ex-Bell Gully) and Michelle Redington (head of group tax and insurance at Air NZ). Also experts in various aspects of tax law and practice are Professor Craig Elliffe (University of Auckland) and Nick Malarao (Meredith Connell).

Hinerangi Raumati-Tu’ua is a chartered accountant and has held both governance and senior executive positions in Maori entities including currently as chair of Paraninihi ki Waitotara. Associate Professor Marjan van den Belt is an ecological economist and was, until recently, Assistant Vice Chancellor (Sustainability) at Victoria University. Finally, there is Bill Rosenberg, economist at the CTU, and Kirk Hope, chief executive of Business New Zealand.

Well, not quite finally of course. I am the chair of the Group, which might be taken to indicate the peculiar taste I have developed in so-called retirement for poisoned chalices. Our independent adviser is Andrea Black. Andrea holds degrees in economics, commerce, and taxation studies and has worked in senior positions for both Treasury and Inland Revenue.

The diversity of the Group means that we are far from being of one mind, culture, or philosophy. It might have been more efficient to have had just two economists and so got five opinions.

But I am very confident the diversity we have will add to the value of what we produce. This also means that we do not start from a position of a collective prejudgment of any of our conclusions, particularly on the more politically sensitive issues.

#### Process and time lines

The process the Group is following is reasonably conventional but we are looking for some variations to try to widen the basis for consultation. We have met three times so far and agreed the main processes for consultation as well as some key issues around the framing of our work.

A background paper on the main characteristics of the current tax system and future challenges and possibilities is close to completion and will be released on 14 March.

We called for submissions yesterday on the basis that groups like yourselves and others will not need the background document in order to start preparing their submissions. People not so familiar with the current system may still appreciate the extra time to think about what they want to say.

Submissions will be due in by the end of April. Apart from seeking (and receiving) views from the usual list of suspects – including your good selves with your various hats on – we will be trying to reach out to those less frequently involved in tax discussions. This will include environmental and community NGOs, property investors’ associations, and small business representatives amongst others.

There will be specific engagement strategies for Maori and for youth. Somewhat unusually we will be seeking direct input from government agencies other than Treasury and Inland Revenue in order to bring a broader set of governmental perspectives and opinions to the table.

What we are asking groups, organisations and individuals to do is tell us their views on the future of tax. We will continue to update and provide further digital materials to aid in the discussion using a variety of means. Submissions will normally be released publically once tabled at a Working Group meeting, subject to any redactions required, in particular for privacy reasons. We want this to be an open process.

There will be multiple rounds of public communication during the submission period providing fresh material. This will test some of our media commentators who have a strong tendency to confuse discussion with decisions having already been made. This may make for good headlines and trenchant political reactions but it does not assist in good policy making.

We are tasked with presenting an interim report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue in September. This is a very tight timetable. We anticipate there will be further public, political, and professional feedback on that interim report which will feed into the final report due by the end of February 2019.

#### The Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper

As I said earlier, the first phase of the group’s activity, is now nearing completion. It has centred on the production of the background paper to help inform submissions from a wide variety of groups and individuals, particularly those less familiar with our current tax system.

The paper is structured around six topics: the future environment within which the tax system will need to continue to provide adequate revenue to fund government programmes; the purposes and principles of a good tax system; the key features of the current New Zealand tax system; the key results of the current system; thinking outside the current system; and specific policy challenges which the Terms of Reference require the Group to address.

##### The Future Environment

As the great playwright Ionescu said, “You can only predict things after they’ve happened”. When we do try to predict before the outcome there is often a tendency to fall into one of two errors: linear extension forward from the recent past, or an assumption that all will change and in an unpredictable fashion. The latter – usually summed up in the single word disruption – has been highly profitable for consultancy firms in recent times.

This enables us to make one confident prediction based on linear projection: consultancy firms will continue to make lots of money from incorrectly predicting the future. We can, however, point to some trends which are likely to have implications for the tax system.

1\. Demographic change

The most obvious in many countries, including New Zealand, is changing demography. The most important part of this, in terms of its impact on tax, is the ageing of the population. The process is now well under way for the Pakeha population. It will progressively affect the other major ethnic groups as it is the result of a combination of falling birth rates and increasing life expectancy.

The consequences are likely to be lower rates of labour participation (and thus revenue from labour incomes) and increased expenditure on New Zealand Superannuation and health care. It seems unlikely that, beyond the ten-year horizon set for the Tax Working Group, operating expenditure will be kept as low as around 30% of GDP. The Treasury prediction for 2045 is just under 40%.

The other aspect of demographic change – the growth of so-called superdiversity – has less resonance for the tax system, whatever other political or policy challenges it presents.

The main point is that taxes on capital income may, _of necessity_, bulk larger in the future in total tax revenue. This will be particularly so if the general trend continues for the returns to capital to grow faster than the returns to labour.

Embedded within all of this are intergenerational equity issues which would require substantial retrospective – and thus impossible – action to address properly.

The real lesson is that we need a tax system which is able to flex easily in response to altered circumstances, some of which are beyond our capacity to predict, let alone control.

2\. The nature of work

Changes in the nature of work – already evident – are likely to continue. The biggest of these, of course, are the elimination of existing jobs by new technologies. Economic Cassandras have been busy for a good 200 years predicting mass unemployment due to technologically driven change. They are like people who look at a doughnut and see only the hole.

So far general employment collapse from technological change has not happened to any great extent. Rather, new job creation has more than kept pace with job losses. In terms of participation in paid employment we are probably at or near long-term historic highs rather than teetering on the edge of disaster. Greed and the consequent recurrent financial collapses will arguably continue to have a greater negative effect on employment.

But the impacts of technological change can be serious at the regional or sub-regional level of course, whether in the United States or New Zealand. Crudely, however, that points to the need for sufficient revenue to pay for better adjustment policies rather than propping up dying industries or raising apocalyptic doubts about the revenue system or, indeed, the economy itself.

The one aspect of the changing nature of work which may well impact on revenue is the growing “gig economy”. This is characterised by variable and uncertain hours of employment and the prevalence of supposedly independent contractors.

This all presents challenges for tax assessment and, even more, tax collection. A system which has come to rely heavily on voluntary compliance may find that was able to survive for a brief golden age rather than reflecting a paradigm shift. Let us hope not and that other solutions, assisted by the Business Transformation agenda will enable us to avoid coming to that conclusion.

3\. Technological change

Apart from any direct impacts of technological change on employment its other most significant impact is via the way the internet has changed so much of our personal and public lives. Not just goods but now services are available at the touch of a screen. A new “sharing economy” has emerged where (for a price or by other means) assets such as houses and cars are shared.

Many of these developments provide further potential threats to the tax base, both directly and through changing attitudes to tax compliance.

On the positive side, technology lies at the heart of the IRD’s Business Transformation agenda, opening up new possibilities for (and perhaps threats from) government administration.

4\. The growth of the Maori economy

The growth of the Maori economy (not to be confused with Maori in the economy) is one of the most positive features of New Zealand over the last generation. It offers hope for all New Zealanders, not Maori alone.

The Maori economy asset base has been growing strongly and last year was estimated to be about six per cent of the national total. It tends to be concentrated in the primary sector, producing 30% of our lamb production, 30% of sheep and beef, and 10% of milk.

This concentration is beginning to change as Maori entities take what opportunities are available for diversification, limited to some degree by the impossibility of alienating the great majority of the current landholdings. That, however, strengthens the emphasis on intergenerational sustainability, and tikanga Maori.

Given the well-known disparities in Maori social and economic indicators compared with the rest of the population the encouragement of its further development and strengthening should be a matter of national priority.

In that respect the Working Group is interested in submissions and reflections from Maori in particular as to the effectiveness of the current Maori authority regime and how tikanga Maori could help create a more future-focussed tax regime.

We will also be looking for comment on specific issues we need to be aware of when considering options such as a more general capital gains tax or a land tax and, indeed, any other areas of the tax system from the point of view of te ao Maori.

5\. International tax trends

Some would also argue that trends in tax rates and types of tax offshore may also necessitate similar changes in New Zealand. Most commonly cited is the downward trend in company tax rates which means that our rate is now slightly above the OECD average.

I would caution about self-interest leading to less than deep analysis here. New Zealand – with Australia – are the only two countries with full imputation systems for a start. Interestingly, some European countries went down the imputation track as early as the late 1970s but the European Court of Justice ruled in the 1990s that a domestic only tax credit system breached two of the four freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty of Rome.

Then there is the fact that the empirical evidence for a connection between company tax rates and economic performance remains very weak. That is true whether we measure across countries or look at ourselves over time. The kind of investment we need is likely to be based on far wider considerations than just minor differences in the headline company tax rate. Many of those considerations derive from effective government spending.

And, since those who argue most vehemently for company rate cuts tend to be the same people who argue the top personal income tax rate must be aligned with the company rate, we simply invite ourselves to lead a race to the bottom in terms of revenue. New Zealand already has to admit to having the fourth lowest level in the reduction in the Gini coefficient of inequality in the OECD through its tax and transfer system.

We need to be aware of what is happening elsewhere; but we also need to design and protect a system which suits our own needs and the agreed purposes that we have.

6\. Ecological and environmental challenges

In this summer of 2017-18 there can surely be little argument that the effects of global warming are already with us. To think otherwise is probably to belong to a small, but not select, group of people who believe Elvis is alive and well and has changed his name to Donald Trump.

We face many other environmental challenges such as water pollution, possible overallocation of water, plastic pollution of the oceans, and congestion, in Auckland especially. The dismal list goes on and tends to grow rather than shrink. At the same time, we have calls to use the tax system as a partial solution to such problems as the incidence of obesity.

All this means that the possible use of the system to change people’s behaviour in ways which increase the wellbeing of all of us is very much on the agenda at the present time. I have no doubt there will be a significant number of submissions in that respect.

#### Purposes and principles of a good tax system

The mention of the concept of wellbeing brings me neatly to the question of the possible purposes and principles of the tax system.

No-one has summed the fundamental core purpose better than the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1927: “Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society”. That assertion may be considered to be borne out by the fact that taxes are normally higher in rich societies than poor ones.

This association arises from the tendency in rich, democratic nations for the definition of a civilised society to expand with rising incomes. Thus, for example, there is a close relationship between expenditure on health care as a proportion of national income and per capita national income.

While taxation largely began as a way of funding national defence (or, more precisely in many cases, royal aggression) defence now usually represents in the rich democracies less than about five per cent of total government expenditure. In this instance the public sector has crowded out the public sector!

Taxation now collects between about a quarter and a half of national income in the rich world. The largest areas of spending are nearly always health, education, pensions, and other forms of income transfers, not always in that order.

Given the large amounts of money involved it is important to try to have frames of reference within which to judge the tax system according to broadly acceptable purposes and principles. The traditional criteria are expressed in terms of efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. Obviously, I do not need to spell these out in detail for this audience but they will be more fully described in the background document.

Sufficient at this point to note that none of these criteria can be said to be entirely objective. They have served well for relatively narrow analysis but do not provide a sufficiently broad framework to encompass the range of views the public may have about the purposes and principles of the tax system.

The Tax Working Group will continue to use the traditional framework, especially with respect to the more technical issues.

In terms of values we will also place emphasis on the Living Standards Framework developed over some years by the Treasury.

I want to acknowledge in particular the work of Girol Karacaoglu in the development of the Framework. In Girol’s own words, the purpose of public policy is to “increase collective wellbeing on a sustainable basis”. Taxation is a matter of public policy and so needs to be consistent with that purpose.

The Living Standards Framework identifies four capital stocks that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing. They are financial and physical capital; human capital; social capital; and natural capital. In the Treasury description of the Framework the four capitals are visualised as four interlocking strands.

The crucial point is that the Framework encourages public policy development to consider the complementarities of various options as well as their substitutability, interactions, and trade-offs. Most important it moves the discussion beyond a narrow concentration on financial capital. It also moves away from an implicit assumption that tax is a “burden”.

The Living Standards Framework will therefore assist in making values judgments about particular proposals in relation to taxes. The traditional framework will stand alongside to ensure appropriate consideration is given to how well those proposals may work in practice. Other values tests may also be used - for example, the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals.

There are any number of what might be called “knobbly bits” embedded in any such set of criteria. The most obvious is fairness – specifically mentioned in our terms of reference. We can all parrot that there are two axes of fairness in taxation: vertical and horizontal.

I suspect that somewhere, deep in academia, three or even four-dimensional models of fairness are being developed. Concepts of fairness have changed over time, so the fourth dimension is already there.

We normally begin from two simple starting points. First, those who earn more should pay more (vertical equity). Second, those in the same circumstances should pay the same amount (horizontal equity).

From there onwards all is sound and fury hopefully in our case signifying more than nothing. I am sure the Group will spend some time on this. It is clear to me that one of the most important matters to discuss lies along that horizontal axis. Having decided what everybody should pay how do we make sure they pay it? And how do we do that in the gig cum internet economy? And if, effectively, we cannot under current arrangements what has to give?

What we do know is that, under our current system, those who commit benefit fraud are generally treated more harshly than tax evaders, both in terms of prison sentences and in terms of the write off of debts. This again reflects embedded cultural views about the relative morality of the two kinds of actions.

Then there is the question of behavioural responses to tax in general and specific taxes in particular. It is interesting to note that what has become our most unfair tax in terms of vertical equity – tobacco excise duty – is justified on behavioural grounds. And rightly so, says this ex-smoker/old leftie.

And if one holds the view – as many do – that our current economic system is far from sustainable, fair, or ethically sound then the notion that a particular tax is distortionary might be a good, not a bad, thing.

Having uttered what, for many in this audience, may be the ultimate heresy let me quickly pass on to the rest of the Submissions Background Paper.

#### The current New Zealand tax system

Chapter 4 describes the current New Zealand tax system. Following established conventions we congratulate ourselves on our broad-based low rate system. By that we mean that for those taxes we do have there are few exemptions or deductions.

We then go on to explain in some detail that we are not really broad-based or low rate (except for our GST, which we are tasked with examining whether it should be less broad-based).

By that I mean that the base of taxation has been narrowed since the great tax reforms of the 1980. Many taxes have been abolished, leaving us with a very narrow range of taxes by international standards. And it’s highly unlikely the abolished taxes will be reinstated.

The most obvious area of narrowness is the very limited scope of our current capital gains tax regime. That reflects a long New Zealand tradition, the basis of which is hard to discern.

In addition, one of the many problems in comparing our system with those in the rest of the developed economies is that, other than for ACC, we do not level social security contributions separately from income tax. This makes our system look harsh, with income tax levied from the first dollar. However, if we combine income taxes and social  
security taxes then a very different picture emerges about other countries’ taxes on very low incomes.

#### The results of our current system

What is reasonably apparent is that our tax and transfer system is right towards the lower end of being redistributive compared with the rest of the members of the OECD – only half as redistributive as that of Finland. On the other hand, our company income tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is right at the top end of the mainly rich club. But again, this ignores the significant other taxes levied on companies which are not levied in New Zealand.

Hopefully the data and charts in the background paper will help improve understanding a little. But the truth is that international comparisons are profoundly difficult because one is seldom comparing even the same kinds of apples and pears. At least one thing is clear – New Zealanders are not taxed highly by international developed country standards.

#### Thinking outside our current system

The Group will inevitably consider a wide range of possible changes to the tax system given that we may expect those to be suggested in submissions. The Submissions Background Paper outlines the most commonly suggested of these. I emphasise that the fact that some are mentioned and not others is not an indication of any prejudgment on our behalf.

Some options – notably inheritance tax and capital gains on the family – are outside the terms of reference. That leaves possibilities for discussion ranging from financial transactions taxes, wealth taxes, and equalisation taxes through to a more generalised capital gains tax, land tax (but again already excluding land under the family home), and environmental taxes. We are also likely to discuss the use of hypothecated taxes even though officials seem to believe the words hypothecate and apoplexy have the same ancient Greek root.

Implicit in our terms of reference is the notion that whatever the package - or packages - of proposals that we come up with they will be roughly fiscally neutral. The one caveat I would add personally to that is that they must be capable of sustaining somewhat higher levels of spending if that is considered necessary or desirable by future governments and their electors.

#### Specific challenges

The final section of the background paper goes into a little more detail on the specific challenges that the terms of reference have posed for us. These cover housing affordability, capital gains tax, land tax, progressive company tax, environmental taxes, and removing GST from particular goods. I have covered what I need to say about those at this stage already.

#### Conclusion

The Tax Working Group has a very large task in front of it. Any tax system creates large vested interests that will oppose change. Any change to a tax system is easily misrepresented as a tax grab, an ideological lurch, unfair, unworkable or all of these. New Zealand has some deeply inherited cultural – one might almost say atavistic – attitudes to tax.

At the same time we want a civilised society. Our media (both social and traditional), many and varied pressure groups, and even the recommendations of our Coroners are full of direct or indirect calls for more government spending to achieve that and to widen its compass. There is less consensus on how to pay for it.

Speech

### Speech to International Fiscal Association Conference, Heritage Hotel, Queenstown

#### Introduction

It’s my great pleasure to be able to join you here today in Queenstown.

The IFA conference is a highlight for any Revenue Minister as it provides an opportunity to refresh dialogue with tax experts who have a keen interest and investment in robust tax policy.

It’s a busy time for everyone with a stake in the tax system, and of course that includes both me and the Minister of Finance.

We have a hefty work programme to negotiate which needs to take into account our coalition agreements and also work already commenced by the previous Government.

And as Grant has just explained, the Tax Working Group will be vital to achieving an overarching direction for tax policy.

The Government will remain dependent on its partnership with the private sector and other interested groups to ensure that NZ’s tax system remains fair and fit-for-purpose. I’ll talk a bit about that later.

But as Minister of Revenue I won’t be sitting on my hands waiting for the Working Group to do its work. There are other issues which we need to address right now.

With a new Government comes new priorities. This Government has a clear vision to make things fairer for everyone.

I suspect there are inherent inequities in the system that need addressing, whether it’s ensuring small businesses aren’t disproportionally burdened in complying with tax requirements, or ensuring entrepreneurs aren’t incentivised to invest in property rather than research and development.

Community expectations about living in a fair and decent society with first-world public services rely on the tax system delivering adequate revenue.

And because tax is an essential pillar of a fair society, it follows that a tax regime should be fair across the board, with minimal scope for loopholes to exploit.

So I have two key interests as Revenue Minister.

It’s got to be simple to understand, for businesses large and small, and for individuals. And it has to be fair.

But I also want to balance that against opportunities to make business even easier to conduct in New Zealand. How can we ensure that complying with tax doesn’t get in the way of doing business?

#### Current priorities – fairness and integrity

So, with these things in mind, today I’m mainly going to talk to you about what the Government’s immediate priorities are for tax policy.

Firstly, let’s look at some key upcoming policy measures that will improve the integrity of the tax system.

##### Loss ring-fencing / bright line

The Government has made a number of commitments to making the tax system fairer while improving housing affordability for owner-occupiers.

One of these is ring-fencing of residential rental losses.

This will mean that investors will no longer be able to offset tax losses from their residential investment properties against their other income to reduce their tax liability.

My officials are working on this issue and will ensure it follows the usual GTPP process.

Another lever we intend utilise in the property space to even the playing field is extending the current bright-line test from two years to five.

This will help ensure that more residential property speculators pay tax on the gains from their activity and to also improve housing affordability for owner-occupiers by reducing speculative demand.

This measure has been added to the current tax bill.

##### BEPS / Multinationals

We’re also continuing work to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

12 months ago at this conference you were updated on progress on BEPS, or Base Erosion Profit Shifting.

And now, as you’ll be aware, the Government has introduced a new Bill into Parliament that codifies that work.

The Bill reflects many of the submissions made by you and others in the private sector on the original proposals.

It counters particular strategies some multinationals have used in New Zealand to unfairly reduce their tax bill.

These include avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand, stripping out New Zealand profits through high priced debt or mispriced dealings, and using highly structured hybrid instruments to take advantage of differences in the tax laws of New Zealand and other countries.

New Zealand is not working in isolation. The OECD has recommended several measures to counter BEPS.

The Bill’s measures are broadly consistent with these recommendations which many other countries are also picking up.

New Zealand signed the OECD’s Multilateral Instrument in June 2017 which quickly and efficiently amends many of our tax treaties to stop them from being used by multinationals to avoid paying taxes here.

We expect some multinationals with a physical presence in New Zealand will want to restructure their business operations here in response to the measures.

This should lead to more sales being booked in New Zealand and so more revenue.

The measures will also prevent multinationals from shifting their New Zealand profits offshore under artificial arrangements.

The Government will continue to monitor other possibilities – both legislative and administrative – to counter BEPS activities in New Zealand.

#### Current priorities – making life easier for businesses

Aside from maintaining a robust tax system, this Government is prepared to use tax policy where appropriate to ensure New Zealand remains the best place in the world to do business.

##### R&D tax credits

As Grant pointed out, the Labour Party has committed to considering a tax credit for research and development as part of its set of election promises.

And I certainly believe there is more the Government can do to incentivise private investment in new technologies to ultimately boost productivity.

As you might remember, the previous government removed the last R&D tax credit regime in 2008.

We think this needs to be reinstated. We are now able to draw on lessons learned in other jurisdictions which will help us develop a robust, future-proof system.

A tax credit is an effective way of encouraging businesses to undertake R&D, as it gives them the space they need to make decisions without any second guessing by the Government.

However, I recognise that it will be hard to ensure R&D expenditure is ring-fenced appropriately.

Therefore it’s essential that officials design the policy carefully to reduce the risk of firms claiming tax credits on expenditure that is clearly not R&D.

I’m looking forward to seeing what innovative policy solutions Inland Revenue and other Government agencies come up with in that regard.

No decisions have been made on how this scheme will look, yet. But we are working hard on the design. Policy development and Select Committee stages will provide interested parties with opportunities to define the problem and contribute to a workable solution.

##### Feasibility study expenditure

I’m sure many of you will also be keen to know what the new Government’s intentions are around the treatment of feasibility expenditure.

While our immediate priorities in the tax space focus on ensuring a fair and level playing field across all spheres of the economic output, we also recognise the potential value in reform in this area. This will remain on Government’s work programme, but for now we’re focussed on other measures to help businesses.

##### Business Transformation / Reducing compliance costs

And while I have a captive audience I’d like to take the opportunity to briefly touch on the work Inland Revenue has done recently to make paying tax easier and reduce compliance costs for businesses.

This aligns with the Government’s focus on making things simpler for tax payers, and certainly interests me in my capacity as both Minister for Revenue and for Small Business.

You’ll all be well aware of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation. It’s a massive undertaking but essential as it seeks to modernise the tax system for the 21st century.

The Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme will deliver a range of changes that will significantly reduce compliance costs for all businesses. By April 2019 customers will have:

*   more on-line services for all tax products;
*   integrated tax and business processes;
*   faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax;
*   faster tax refunds;
*   less likelihood of tax debt; and
*   more payment options.

As a result, we expect small businesses will benefit the most out of their changes as they spend a greater proportion of their time and resources on meeting tax obligations.

Inland Revenue estimates that SMEs will spend between 8 and 14 fewer hours a year on compliance by 2023/24.

It is clear that things are going well so far as Inland Revenue goes through its staged implementation.

Nevertheless, I expect Inland Revenue to continue to listen to its stakeholders most impacted by the changes.

Ultimately BT is about future-proofing the tax system, making things easier for people, and maintaining the revenue base in the face of changes and challenges we cannot foresee.

##### Accounting Income Method (AIM)

On the subject of making life easier for businesses, I’m excited about Inland Revenue’s Accounting Income Method, or AIM as we’re calling it, due to be launched in April.

Although that SME group is probably not a core market for most of you there will be others in your firms, organisations or friends at a BBQ (who hit you up for some free advice) who may benefit from what AIM has to offer.

Small businesses will be able to manage their provisional tax through AIM-capable accounting software.

Already more than 70,000 businesses use their accounting software to manage their GST – so using AIM is going to be a logical next step for them. While we are unlikely to get this many to adopt AIM at the outset, I’m hoping a good number will start using AIM and this builds steadily.

Businesses using AIM will pay provisional tax based more on actual cashflow, rather than on what their profit was last year, or what they think they will make this year.

This will take the guesswork out of provisional tax for small businesses.

AIM means provisional tax can be managed as part of its routine financial activity – it can stop being a separate compliance burden.

AIM will help us to support our small businesses to be flexible, adaptable and technically skilled for an economy that is increasingly digital.

#### IFA members’ role in improving the tax system

I recognise that your engagement with tax policy is over and above your day job, but we absolutely value your contribution.

In fact, it’s critical to ensure NZ maintains a robust tax policy development process.

Stakeholder engagement has been hardcoded into tax policy development since the GTPP was established in 1995.

We’re lucky in New Zealand that we’re starting from a good place. We already have the systems in place to take advantage of the experience of corporate and not-for-profit tax professionals as well as tax academics and other groups interested in tax policy outcomes.

I know that Inland Revenue and successive Revenue Ministers of all colours feel they can engage with key players in good faith in the knowledge that all parties want the best and fairest outcomes.

Of course, there will always be areas where full agreement cannot be reached, but it shouldn’t be a fundamental disagreement on crucial tax legislation.

While recognising that absolute consensus is not always possible, I’d like to see us get to the point where there is an acknowledgement on what all parties agree on and what they don’t.

I see this as in the spirit of GTPP where key players have an opportunity to socialise potential policy changes before Government officials spend countless hours fleshing them out. Part of this getting a better understanding of problem definition from affected and interested parties before consultation on options has begun.

We need the people in this room to help the Government, and Inland Revenue, ensure that GTPP remains a good process that adds value.

A recent example of GTPP in action was the error identified in the interest limitation provisions in the BEPS Bill. While any error is unfortunate, it is important that we front-foot it, which GTPP allows us to do. In this case, although the normal date for submissions on the Bill had closed, submissions have been re-opened on this aspect.

#### Conclusion

The upcoming work programme has a number of things in particular that really do need wide and considered consultation.

But just as importantly we need key stakeholders to engage on the bigger challenges facing the tax system that I have just outlined.

We will all need to think outside the box as to how to ensure the tax system is agile enough to respond to new ways of working and earning money in the digital age.

Again, keep an eye out for upcoming discussion documents and opportunities to make submissions to select committees and otherwise engage in the policy development process.

Revenue is a portfolio that excites me. Tax is not just about taking dollars off people. It enables a fair society that provides opportunities for everyone.
