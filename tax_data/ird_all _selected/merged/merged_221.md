A number of consequential amendments have also been made to ensure that the provisions of the Income Tax Act can apply to this DTA. Several other amendments seek to rationalise the various references to DTAs in the Income Tax Act to make them more concise, direct, and user-friendly. Background In the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplo- matic relations between New Zealand and the People’s Republic of China of 21 December 1972, the New Zealand Government recognised the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. This position is often referred to as New Zealand’s “one-China policy”. In 1996 a DTA relating to Taiwan was signed between the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. This DTA is a private, non-governmental agreement that has no legal effect in New Zealand on its own. Because the New Zealand Government wished to give effect to the terms of this agreement under New Zealand income tax law, amendments to the Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act were necessary. Giving effect to this DTA under New Zealand income tax law should not be interpreted as implying New Zealand recognition of Taiwan. Key features The main amendment is to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which empowers Orders in Council to be made to give effect to DTAs under New Zealand income tax law. This provision previously allowed Orders in Council to be made to give effect only to DTAs negoti- ated between the New Zealand Government and the governments of other countries. The DTA relating to Taiwan is a private, non-governmental agreement made between the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. As this DTA has not been made between two governments, an amendment to section BH 1 was required to enable an Order in Council to be made to give effect to it under New Zealand income tax law. Consequential amendments have also been made to the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that the provisions of the Act can apply to both DTAs negotiated with other governments and the DTA relating to Taiwan. The Income Tax Act provisions which have been amended are sections LC 1 (5), LC 7 (1)(b), and OE 6. A conse- quential amendment has also been made to section 88 of the Tax Administration Act. Several other amendments have been made to rationalise the various references to DTAs in the Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act. These amendments mainly involve replacing expressions such as “provi- sions of arrangements to which effect is given by an Order in Council made under section BH 1” with the term “double tax agreement”. The amendments make the provisions relating to DTAs in the Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act more concise, direct, and user-friendly. The provisions amended in the Income Tax Act are sections LF 1 (2)(a)(v), NC 18 (1)(a), OD 5 (10) and the definitions of “eligible company”, “foreign company”, and “qualifying amalgamation” in section OB 1. The provisions amended in the Tax Administration Act are sections 119(2)(b) and 184. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 2 Exempt income – Reference to Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act Section CB 5 (1)(f) Introduction Section CB 5 (1)(f) has been amended to refer to the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. This ensures that overseas pensions that reduce the amount of transitional retirement benefit receivable are treated as exempt income, and all income-tested benefits are treated consistently. Veterans’ pensions, also paid under that Act, have been excluded from paragraph (f), as they are paid on a gross basis. Background Section CB 5 (1)(f) exempts from tax any overseas social security pension that is subject to the direct deduction policy. Under this policy, the benefit to which the beneficiary is entitled is reduced by the overseas pension dollar for dollar. To the extent that the pension reduces the benefit payable, it is not taxable. Key features •Section CB 5 (1)(f) refers to the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. •Veterans’ pensions, paid under the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990, are not subject to section CB 5 (1)(f). Application date These amendments apply retrospectively from 1 April 1996, the date from which recipients of transitional retirement benefits received their United Kingdom pension directly from the UK Department of Social Security. Exempt income – special banking option Section CB 5 (1)(fa) Introduction Section CB 5 (1)(fa) has been amended to ensure that the equivalent amount of income-tested benefit (transitional retirement benefit, 55+, widows’ or invalids’ benefit) paid out under the special banking option is subject to tax. This amendment extends the special banking option to income-tested beneficiaries. Background A special banking option for United Kingdom pension- ers came into operation on 1 April 1997. The option provides for overseas pensions to be paid into a special bank account, with this money being drawn down by the Department of Social Welfare. In return, UK pensioners receive an equivalent amount of New Zealand superan- nuation or veteran’s pension. Section CB 5 (1)(fa) exempts from tax any overseas social security pension which is subject to the special banking option. Under section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964, the benefit to which the beneficiary is entitled is reduced by the overseas pension dollar for dollar. To the extent that the pension is so reduced, it is not taxable. The equivalent amount of benefit paid, NZS or veteran’s pension, is taxed in full. The amendment extends this policy to income-tested benefits. Key features Income-tested benefits (transitional retirement benefit, 55+, widow’s or invalid’s benefit) paid out under the special banking option are subject to section CB 5 (1)(fa). The equivalent amount of benefit paid is taxable in full. Application date The amendment applies retrospectively from 1 April 1997, the date from which the special banking option came into operation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 3 Controlled foreign company currency translations (Section CG 11) Introduction An amendment requires financial arrangements of controlled foreign companies (CFCs) above a certain minimum amount to be translated into New Zealand currency in all cases. This removes the opportunity for taxpayers to choose a reporting currency for their CFCs that creates a foreign exchange loss, even though there may be no economic loss. An amendment has also been made to require the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC to be calculated in the same currency each accounting period, unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue agrees that there is a genuine, non-tax related business reason for a change in the reporting currency. Background The CFC regime is a vital component of New Zealand’s international tax rules. It ensures that income earned by foreign companies controlled by New Zealand residents is subject to New Zealand tax as it is earned. The branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC is generally calculated using New Zealand tax rules as if the CFC were a New Zealand resident company, which would involve translating the income and expenses of the CFC into New Zealand currency on an item-by-item or a transactional basis. This would be done using the exchange rate prevailing between the New Zealand currency and the foreign currency in which the income or expenses are denominated when the income is derived or the expenses are incurred. When the CFC tax regime was designed, it was consid- ered that requiring the income and expenses of a CFC to be translated into New Zealand currency on an item-by- item basis would impose unnecessary compliance costs. Therefore a low compliance cost option (former section CG 11 (3)) giving taxpayers the choice of calculating the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC in the currency in which it prepares its financial accounts was included in the legislation. If the CFC does not prepare financial accounts, its income or loss is calculated in the currency of its country of residence. The amount of income or loss calculated in the particular foreign currency is then translated into New Zealand currency at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month falling within the CFC’s accounting period. However, the currency translation rules in former section CG 11 (3) effectively allowed taxpayers to calculate the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC in any foreign currency (in contrast to rules applying generally that require income to be calculated in New Zealand currency). Taxpayers were able to use the former legislation to generate foreign exchange losses for their CFCs, even though there may have been no economic loss. Typically, this involved a financial arrangement between related offshore entities. For example, one entity calculated its income using a currency producing a foreign exchange loss against the currency in which the loan is denominated, while the other entity used a different currency, thus avoiding an offsetting foreign exchange gain. This usually occurred after the end of a CFC’s accounting period, using historical information on how exchange rates varied during the period. The amendments remove the opportunity for taxpayers to make ex post facto currency choices by requiring the financial arrangements of CFCs above a certain mini- mum amount to be translated into New Zealand currency in all cases. The solution safeguards the CFC tax base. Key features Section CG 11 has been amended to prevent the creation of artificial foreign exchange losses under section CG 11 (3). This provision used to allow a taxpayer to choose the currency in which it calculated its branch equivalent income or loss. The amendments will exclude the application of this provision in determining foreign exchange gains and losses for all financial arrangements of a CFC if: •the total value of the CFC’s financial arrangements on any day in its accounting period exceeds one million dollars, or •the net foreign exchange loss of a CFC in relation to financial arrangements in an accounting period (calculated under section CG 11 (3)) exceeds $100,000. In such cases, foreign exchange gains or losses will be determined in relation to New Zealand currency, instead of the currency chosen by the taxpayer under section CG 11 (3). However, this amendment does not apply to financial arrangements which are variable principal debt instru- ments denominated in the same currency as the reporting currency of the CFC and where the other party to the arrangement is not an associated party. The foreign exchange gains or losses of such arrangements will continue to be determined in relation to the currency chosen under section CG 11 (3). The main effect of this exception is exclude the local bank accounts of CFCs from the amendment. An amendment has also been made to require the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC to be calculated in the same currency each accounting period. A change to the reporting currency will be allowed only if the Commissioner agrees that there is a genuine, non-tax related business reason for the change. Such consistency of accounting treatment will result in a more accurate determination of income over time. Application date The amendments apply to any accounting period of a CFC that ends on or after 17 June 1997.

The amendments clarify the legislation to reflect the original policy intention. Background In 1992 amendments were made to the fringe benefit tax rules to clarify the tax treatment of non-cash benefits received by shareholder employees. Generally, non-cash benefits received by shareholder employees were to be fringe benefits subject to fringe benefit tax if derived in an employment capacity. The legislation was deficient because it required that before a benefit could be exempt from fringe benefit tax it was first to be a non-cash dividend. This was not possible when the benefit was conferred in an employ- ment capacity because the benefit did not satisfy the shareholder capacity test as required by the dividend rules. The benefit would, therefore, be a fringe benefit subject to fringe benefit tax, contrary to its policy intent. The amendments clarify the legislation to reflect the intention of the original policy. Although the provision applies to non-executive direc- tors and company secretaries, under the Companies Act 1993 the statutory role of company secretary no longer exists. Therefore the amendments apply to non-execu- tive directors only. Key features •Non-cash benefits received by a non-executive director shareholder will be treated as exempt from fringe benefit tax and subject to the dividend rules under section CI 2 (3) when that person has no other employment relationship with the company beyond the formal occupation and statutory obligations of a non-executive director. •The provision no longer applies to company secretar- ies because that statutory role does not exist under the Companies Act 1993. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. Introduction Various amendments have arisen from the post-imple- mentation review of the depreciation legislation. Many are minor technical changes, while other amendments reflect more significant policy changes. Background Post implementation review of legislation is a key stage of the Government’s Generic Tax Policy Process, designed to ensure the effectiveness of tax legislation. The depreciation rules enacted in 1993 are the first legislation to be reviewed under this process. The continuing review has resulted in previous remedial legislation. The measures enacted in the latest legislation are largely as introduced into Parliament. However, one key change was made at the Select Committee stage of the bill. New section EG 17, relating to the purchase of depreciable property from an associate, applies only to property acquired after 23 September 1997, the date of enact- ment. The previous section EG 17 is now section EZ 11. This applies to depreciable property acquired on or before 23 September. Key features •Section EG 2 has been amended to make it clear that, in order to claim a depreciation deduction, an asset must be used or available for use in producing income or in a business. •Sections EG 2 and EG 8 have been amended to provide that costs incurred in respect of fixed life intangible property, subsequent to the acquisition of the property, are added to the adjusted tax value of the property at the beginning of the year in which the additional costs are incurred and the total is amortised over the remaining legal life of the property. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 5 •Section EG 12, which provides for the write-off of unused depreciable property, has been amended to clarify the circumstances in which the Commissioner can authorise the write-off. •A new section EG 16A has been inserted to permit taxpayers to elect that an asset will not be depreciable. •Copyright in a sound recording is depreciable if copies of the recording are released to the public and the copyright is acquired on or after 1 July 1997. •There is a refinement to the definition of “estimated useful life” which will apply when the Commissioner sets the depreciation rate for copyright in a recording. •Section EG 17 has been redrafted to more accurately reflect its intent to restrict the base value of an asset purchased from an associate to the lower of: –the cost of the asset to the vendor; and –the cost of the asset to the purchaser. The restrictions on the base value of an asset do not apply if the proceeds of sale are gross income to the vendor. •Section EG 17 has also been expanded to include restrictions on: –the ability to depreciate intangible assets acquired from an associate; and –the depreciation rate to be applied to an asset acquired from an associate. •Several amendments have been made to section EG 19, which relates to the disposition of depreciable property, to provide for property that is irreparably damaged, lost or stolen. Such property is deemed to have been disposed of for the amount of any insurance payment made in respect of the property. •Three amendments have been made to the legislation which provides for the tax treatment of patents: –Section EN 2 has been amended so that, in calculating the profit or loss on sale of a patent, the cost of the patent is reduced by depreciation deductions allowed. This provides a mechanism within section EN 2 to prevent a double deduc- tion where a patent is sold for less than its cost. –The ability to spread income derived on the sale of a patent right has been removed. –Section DJ 6 (1) has been amended to limit the ability to obtain an immediate deduction for costs incurred in obtaining the grant, renewal or maintenance of a patent to patents acquired before the date of enactment of the amendment. The general rules for determining whether expenditure is on revenue or capital account will apply. Application dates The amendments are generally effective from the date of enactment: 23 September 1997. There are four excep- tions, however: •Copyright in certain sound recordings is depreciable if acquired on or after 1 July 1997. •Subsection EG 17 (7), relating to the transfer to an associate of intangible property that is non-depreciable to the vendor, will apply to transfers on or after 1 July 1997. The related amendments to the definition of “associated person” in section OD 8 (3) also apply from this date. •The balance of section EG 17 applies to property acquired after 23 September 1997. •Irreparably damaged assets are deemed to be disposed of for the amount of any insurance proceeds received in relation to the damage, with effect from the 1993-94 income year. For those who have applied existing law, there is a savings provision which deems a disposal to occur at market value. Detailed analysis Link between depreciation and derivation of income Section EG 2 (1)(e) has been amended to clarify that, for a taxpayer to obtain a depreciation deduction, deprec- iable property must be used or available for use in deriving income or in a business. Previously, apportion- ment under paragraph (e) occurred only if property was used for non-business purposes. It did not apply if the property was not used at all. Example 1 In April 1998 a taxpayer purchases equipment in anticipation of setting up a home tutoring business in the near future. The equipment cost $5,000. She in fact commences business on 1 March 1999. The depreciation deduction for the 1998-99 year is $42.46, calculated as follows in accordance with the formula in section EG 2 (1)(e). (The calculation is based on a straight-line depreciation rate, including the loading, of 10%.) Formula: d x f/g = $500 x 31/365 = $42.46 d = 10% x $5,000 x 12/12 = $500 f = 31 days g = 365 days Additional costs of fixed life intangible property Two amendments relate to the tax treatment of fixed life intangible property (FLIP). Under new section EG 2 (3), and an amendment to section EG 8: •additional costs incurred in relation to a FLIP during its legal life are added to the tax book value of the FLIP at the beginning of the income year in which the costs are incurred; and ·the aggregate costs are depreciated over the remaining legal life of the FLIP (calculated from the beginning of that year). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 6 The depreciation rate in relation to the FLIP therefore changes. In effect, the FLIP is treated as newly acquired from the beginning of that year for the aggregate of the tax book value and additional costs. Example 2 A taxpayer acquires a right to use a copyright for five years for $10,000 and has an option to renew for a further five years on payment of an additional $5,000. The legal life is therefore ten years, the depreciation rate is 10%, and the annual deprecia- tion deduction is $1,000. In the first five years, he claims annual deductions amounting to $5,000. In year 6, the $5,000 is paid. The aggregate of the tax book value and additional costs are $10,000 ($5,000 + $5,000). Under section EG 8, the depreciation rate in years 6 to 10 will be 20% (1/remaining legal life of the right = 1/5). The annual depreciation deduction in years 6 to 10 is therefore $2,000. Write-off of unused depreciable property Section EG 12 (1) has been amended to clarify the circumstances in which the Commissioner may sanction the write-off of an unused asset. The Commissioner must be satisfied that: •the taxpayer no longer uses the asset; •neither the taxpayer nor an associate intends to use the asset in the future; and •it is uneconomic to dispose of the asset. There is no longer a requirement that the property can no longer be used. Election not to depreciate Section EG 16A has been introduced to permit taxpayers to elect prospectively, or retrospectively, that an asset will not be depreciable property. The election is effec- tive from the time of the acquisition of the asset, or its entry into the tax base, until the asset is disposed of or exits the tax base. Therefore the provision does not permit taxpayers to “pick and choose” the years in which they depreciate the asset. It does, however, envisage that if an asset (such as a residential property that is let temporarily) periodically enters and exits the tax base, taxpayers may choose whether or not to depreciate the property for each period. If a taxpayer makes such an election, the asset is not “depreciable property” (see new paragraph (b)(ix) of that definition). Therefore the depreciation recovery/loss on sale provisions in section EG 19 do not apply to the asset. Example 3 On 1 November 1997 a taxpayer who owns his own home goes overseas for six months and lets the property. On his return he resumes living in the house. He thinks that any depreciation claimed in relation to his home will be clawed back and therefore does not claim depreciation in his 1997-98 or 1998-99 returns. He elects under section EG 16A (2) in his 1997-8 return that the property is non-depreciable. Under subsection (5) the election has effect until the property is deemed to be disposed of under section EG 19 (9) – 1 April 1999. Copyright in sound recordings is deprec- iable property Copyright in sound recordings has been added to the list of depreciable intangible property contained in Schedule 17. “Sound recording” is defined in section OB 1 and has the same meaning as in the Copyright Act 1994. In order to be depreciable: •the copyright must be produced or purchased on or after 1 July 1997; and •copies of the sound recording must be on sale to the public. Copyright in a recording that is produced on or after 1 July will therefore not be depreciable until copies of the recording are released. If the copyright is purchased by a taxpayer from an unrelated party on or after 1 July, the copyright will be depreciable from that time if copies of the recording have been released. A recording of a work is frequently edited before the final master is produced. Since copyright may exist in every edited version of the recording, there may be some uncertainty about the stage at which the copyright is “produced”. Section OB 1 therefore defines “copyright in a recording” to mean the copyright in the version of the recording of which copies have been sold or offered for sale to the public. This means that copyright in a recording is produced when the final edited version of the recording is made. The Commissioner will set the depreciation rate for copyright in a recording and, in doing so, will use the amended definition of “estimated useful life” which applies for that purpose. Transfer of depreciable property between associates A new section EG 17 applies to property acquired after 23 September 1997. The former section EG 17 (now section EZ 11) applies to property acquired before that date. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 7 Restriction on base value of asset – section EG 17 (1), (2) and (3) Broadly, subsection (1) restricts the base value of an asset purchased from an associate to the lower of: •the price the seller originally paid for the asset; and •the price paid by the buyer. Paragraph (a) applies to transferred property that was depreciable to the vendor. It also applies to the transfer of a lessee’s interest in a lease granted before 1 April 1993 if the transferor was amortising a premium paid on the lease under section EZ 6. Paragraph (b) applies if the property would have been depreciable to the vendor had the vendor incurred a capital cost in relation to the property. It therefore prevents the write-up of an asset from 0 cost to market value by transfer to an associate. It also specifically applies to the transfer of a lessee’s interest in a lease granted before 1 April 1993 if the transferor paid no premium on the grant of the lease. Subsection (1) therefore does not apply to property that is: •trading stock of the vendor; •used for private purposes by the vendor; or •owned by a non-resident vendor who is not entitled to claim a depreciation deduction in relation to the property. Paragraph (c) ensures that it is not possible to avoid the application of section EG 17 (1) by the vendor electing that the property is non-depreciable. Example 4 In October 1996 a self-employed person buys a car for $20,000 to use in her business. She depreciates the car for 12 months and then sells it for $25,000 to a company which she has incorporated to own the business. Subsection EG 17 (1)(a) applies. The company may depreciate the car only from a base value of $20,000. The depreciation recovery provisions apply to the seller in the usual way – all she claimed is recovered on the sale of the car to the company. If the seller depreciated the asset from its market value, rather than its cost, as a result of applying paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of “adjusted tax value”, the cost to the purchaser is the lower of that value and the purchaser’s actual cost. The restrictions on the base value of an asset do not apply in the circumstances set out in section EG 17 (3). The two most important are: •if the proceeds of sale are income to the vendor (there is generally no incentive to transfer the property to an associate in this situation); •if the Commissioner exercises the discretion in subsection (2). The Commissioner continues to have a discretion, in relation to tangible property, to allow the purchaser to base its depreciation deductions on the price paid by the purchaser. This discretion will be considered along with other discretions in the Act as part of the codification of self-assessment. Restriction on the depreciation rate applicable to the asset – section EG 17 (4) Subsection EG 17 (4) restricts the depreciation rate that may be applied to an asset acquired from an associate. The purchaser cannot depreciate the transferred property at a higher rate than that applied to the property by the vendor. The restriction applies only if the asset was depreciable to the vendor. The restriction does not apply to fixed life intangible property (FLIP). The depreciation rate for a FLIP is calculated using the formula in section EG 8, which spreads the cost of a FLIP evenly across its remaining life. Example 5 A company purchased a building in 1990 and depreciated it at 1% straight line (the depreciation rate applicable to such a building acquired before the 1993-94 year). In November 1997 the building is sold to an associated company. The associate must continue to depreciate the building at 1% straight line or its diminishing value equivalent (1%) determined by reference to Sched- ule 10. The provision has an “avoidance” character in that it targets only transfers which would result in an increase in the depreciation rate applied to the asset. The normal provisions apply if a transfer between associates results in a lower rate being applied to the asset. Restrictions apply to direct or indirect transfers of property – section EG 17 (5) The restrictions on the base value of an asset, and the depreciation rate that may be applied to it, apply if the asset is transferred directly or indirectly to an associate. Transfer of depreciable intangible assets that are not depreciable to the vendor – section EG 17 (7) Subsection (7) targets the transfer of intangible property that was not depreciable to the vendor because it was not generally amortisable or depreciable at the time it was acquired by the vendor. If the property is transferred to an associate, it remains non-depreciable to the associate, even though property of that type has become depreciable since the vendor acquired it. The provision therefore prevents intangible property being transferred to an associate in order to bring it within the depreciation rules. The restriction applies to intangible property transferred on or after 1 July 1997 (the date a new item of intangible property – copyright in recordings - was added to Schedule 17). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 8 Paragraph (b) was inserted on the recommendation of the select committee that considered the bill and submis- sions. It is intended to exclude from the restriction property that, while not technically depreciable before 1 April 1993, was in substance depreciable by virtue of an amortisation provision. This includes patents and a lessee’s interest in a lease. Therefore subsection (7) does not apply if a lessee’s interest in a lease granted before 1 April 1993 is trans- ferred to an associate. Subsection (1) applies to such a transfer to restrict a write-up of the base value. The outcome would be the same if subsection (1)(b) applied - no deduction would be available to the purchaser - but would differ if subsection (1)(a) applies. Because of changes to the definition of “associated person” in OD 8 (3), the restriction applies if the vendor is resident or non-resident. Example 6 A company acquired plant variety rights in a new breed of rose in August 1992. Plant variety rights are added to Schedule 17 and become depreciable if acquired after 1 November 1998. The company transfers the rights to an associated company in December 1998. The rights are not depreciable to the associate because: •plant variety rights were not included in Schedule 17 when the rights were acquired by the company; and •the company was not able to amortise the cost of the rights under the Tax Act. Cross references Various cross-references to the former section EG 17 in the Income Tax Act, and in section 594ZM(3) of the Local Government Act (which relates to local authority trading enterprises), have been changed. Irreparably damaged property The pre-1993 rule that irreparably damaged property is deemed to be disposed of for the amount of any insur- ance proceeds received in relation to the damage has been reinstated in section EG 19 (6A). The amendment applies from the 1993-94 income year unless taxpayers have relied on the post-1993 law and treated the disposal as having occurred at market value. Example 7 A courier company buys a car on 1 April 1995 for $20,000. The straight-line depreciation rate applied to the car is 10%. The annual depreciation deduction is therefore $2,000. On 1 April 1998 the car is involved in a crash and is written off. The company receives an insurance pay- out of $18,000. In the three years before the crash the company had claimed depreciation deductions amounting to $6,000. The tax book value of the car is therefore $14,000. The car is deemed to have been disposed of for $18,000 under section EG 19 (6A). Consequently $4,000 will be treated as depreciation recovered on disposal. Lost or stolen property Section EG 19 (6A) and (9)(viii) deem property that is lost or stolen in an income year, and not recovered before the end of the income year, to have been disposed of for the amount of any insurance proceeds received (or for no consideration if there is no insurance). Section EG 19 (5) has been consequentially amended. It provided for the amount of insurance proceeds received in relation to the loss, theft or damage of an asset to be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset. It no longer applies to lost and stolen property, only to damaged property that continues to be used. These amendments ensure that taxpayers can now write off a lost or stolen asset if it is uninsured, or the insur- ance proceeds received are less than the adjusted tax value of the asset. Recovery of lost or stolen property New section EG 19 (6B) applies in the unlikely event that lost or stolen property is recovered, still owned by the taxpayer (because it is uninsured), and used again in its business. Any write-off in the year of loss or theft is reversed in that year or in the year of recovery of the asset, and the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the asset on the date of recovery for its adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of loss or theft. Patent expenses Immediate deduction for certain patent costs Section DJ 6 (1) has been amended to remove the right to an immediate deduction for certain costs associated with the grant, maintenance and extension of patent rights. (The section targets application fees rather than the costs of devising an invention.) Such costs will be deductible only in relation to patents acquired before 23 September 1997. For patents acquired after that date, the general deducti- bility rules will apply to determine whether such costs are immediately deductible or must be capitalised and amortised over the life of the patent. Removal of income spreading on sale of patent The Commissioner’s discretion to permit the spreading of income from the sale of patent rights has been removed, with effect from 23 September 1997. The amendment will not affect existing spreading arrange- ments. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 9 Deduction for adjusted tax value of patent on sale Section EN 2 (3)(c) has been amended to provide that, on the sale of a patent acquired on or after 1 April 1993, a deduction is allowed for the cost of the patent less any depreciation deductions taken. There is no depreciation recovery/loss on sale adjustment on the sale of the patent (see new subsection EN 2 (3A)). If a patent leaves the tax base without being sold, the depreciation recovery provisions still apply. These amendments ensure that no double deduction is available if a patent that has been depreciated is sold for less than its cost. Although the double deduction would be disallowed under section BD 4 (4), it should not be necessary to rely on this. Example 8 A taxpayer acquired a patent on 1 April 1994 at a cost of $20,000. The patent has a life of 20 years and is depreciated as fixed life intangible property. On 1 April 1999 he sells the patent rights for $15,000. Over the five years he has deducted $5,000 by way of depreciation. Under section EN 2 the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the remaining $15,000 of the cost of the patent. The $15,000 sale proceeds are gross income and must be included in the taxpayer’s tax return for the 1999-2000 income year. Assignments and settlements of income Sections FC 11 and OB 1 Introduction The provision relating to short-term assignments and settlements of income has been repealed. This means that when property or income is transferred for a period of less than seven years the income will not automati- cally be deemed to be derived by the transferor. Background Section FC 11 was originally introduced in 1950 by the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) because taxpayers were assigning a proportion of their incomes for short periods to children or other relatives on a lower tax rate. It was an anti-avoidance provision designed to counter income splitting within the family. It was originally intended to be a well-targeted provision, but proved to be unworkable. Various amendments over the years broadened its scope, and led to problems. Although it was an anti-avoidance provision, section FC 11 was not discretionary, nor did it apply only where an arrangement had a tax avoidance purpose or effect. If a taxpayer came within its terms the provision automati- cally applied to determine who derived the income. This, coupled with the broad scope of the provision, enabled taxpayers to misuse it. Key features Section FC 11 has been repealed because it no longer fulfils its original function. Over time the provision had been amended so that it applied beyond family and related party transactions. The broad scope meant the provision could be used to achieve tax outcomes that were not intended. Repeal does not signal that diversion of income to a taxpayer on a lower tax rate is an acceptable tax practice. The general anti-avoidance provisions will be used if such arrangements have a purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Interpretative guidelines have been developed by the courts in relation to when alienation of income and short-term transfers of income earning property consti- tute tax avoidance. Features of an arrangement that indicate that tax avoidance is occurring include: •Transfers of income or property are short-term. •The arrangement has little real effect on business or income earning activity. •The transaction cannot be described as an ordinary family or commercial transaction. •A high degree of control over the earning of the income or the disposition of the property is a part of the arrangement. •There is a close family or business relationship between the parties to the transactions. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 1998 to all assign- ments and settlements in existence at that date and entered into after that date. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 10 Transfer pricing Section GD 13 Introduction The transfer pricing rules previously discouraged non- residents from providing low cost capital to their New Zealand subsidiaries in the form of nil or low rate fixed rate share capital by requiring a market rate of return. Such capital has been excluded from the transfer pricing rules as it is in New Zealand’s interests to receive this type of low cost capital. Background The inclusion of fixed rate shares in the transfer pricing rules was mainly designed to cover the provision of low or nil rate fixed rate share capital by a New Zealand company to its offshore subsidiary. It is appropriate to apply the transfer pricing rules in this case because no, or inadequate, income is being earned on the relevant capital, which is detrimental to the New Zealand tax base. However, it is in New Zealand’s interests for non- residents to provide low cost fixed rate share capital to their New Zealand subsidiaries. It is appropriate, there- fore, for the transfer pricing rules not to apply to this type of supply. The previous application of the transfer pricing rules to inbound fixed rate share capital forced New Zealand subsidiaries using such financing to pay arm’s length rate dividends to their non-resident parents which they may otherwise not have paid. This resulted in investment capital being taken out of New Zealand, which is not in New Zealand’s interests. Section GD 13 (5) provides that the transfer pricing rules (in particular, section GD 13 (4)) do not apply to certain supplies made by non-residents. This exception was designed to ensure that the transfer pricing rules apply only if the transfer pricing arrangement results in a net depletion of the New Zealand tax base. Key features Section GD 13 (5) has been amended to ensure that the transfer pricing rules do not discourage non-residents from providing low cost capital to their New Zealand subsidiaries in the form of nil or low rate fixed rate share capital (inbound fixed rate share capital). This is achieved by excluding such capital from the transfer pricing rules. Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 1996/97 income year, the application date of the new transfer pricing rules. Qualifying companies – exempt dividends distributed to beneficiaries Section HG 13 (1)(a), Income Tax Act 1994 Section 393M (1A), Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The qualifying company legislation has been clarified to ensure that exempt dividends received by a trustee shareholder from a qualifying company are not subject to tax in the hands of beneficiaries. Background Previously, dividends paid by a qualifying company were either fully imputed or exempt from income tax. Uncertainty arose over whether exempt dividends distributed by a qualifying company to a trustee share- holder retained their exempt status when passed through to beneficiaries as beneficiary income. The amendments clarify that they do. Key feature A new section HG 13 (1) has been introduced to the Income Tax Act 1994 to cover dividends distributed to beneficiaries. Exempt dividends paid to trustees will retain their exempt status when distributed to beneficiar- ies. A new section 393M (1A) in the Income Tax Act 1976 mirrors the amendment. Application date The amendment to the Income Tax Act 1994 is applica- ble from 1 April 1995. The equivalent amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 is applicable from 1 April 1992, the date the qualifying company regime came into force. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 11 Loss attributing qualifying company – shareholder majority elections Sections HG 14A, 15 Introduction For the purpose of electing to become a loss attributing qualifying company, shareholders will be allowed to make a majority election. Also, the revocation of election provisions for loss attributing qualifying companies will be simplified by adopting the same revocation rules applying to qualifying companies. This will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and simplify the administration of the loss attributing qualifying company rules. Background When the qualifying company rules were introduced into Parliament, to become a qualifying company or a loss attributing qualifying company required a unanimous election by shareholders. During the select committee process this requirement was relaxed for qualifying companies but not for loss attributing qualifying compa- nies. The difference in election requirements created additional compliance and administrative costs. In certain circumstances a unanimous election might be impossible to obtain (for example, when a minority shareholder cannot be contacted), so shareholders were unable to take advantage of the benefits which the loss attributing qualifying company rules provide. Key features The bill introduces two specific amendments to the loss attributing qualifying company rules: •A new section HG 14A has been inserted to allow shareholders to make a majority election to become a loss attributing qualifying company. •Section HG 15 has been amended by removing provisions from the loss attributing qualifying com- pany revocation rules and applying the revocation rules of the qualifying company regime to loss attrib- uting qualifying companies. This allows sections HG 3 (4), 3(5), 5, 6 and 7 to apply to loss attributing qualifying companies. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. Charitable organisations – addition Section KC 5(1) The African Enterprise (New Zealand) Aid and Devel- opment Fund has been granted charitable donee status. From the 1998-99 income year, donations made to the Fund will entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $500 per annum. A company (other than a closely held company) will be entitled to a deduction from net income up to the amount prescribed by section DJ 4. Independent family tax credit Section KD 7 Introduction An amendment allows Inland Revenue to backdate payment of the independent family tax credit (IFTC) to when a beneficiary’s main Income Support benefit stopped, rather than pay arrears at the end of the income year. The amendment is designed to assist beneficiaries leave the benefit system. Background When beneficiaries move into the workforce there can be a gap of several weeks before they receive their first IFTC payment. This gap may have meant that some beneficiaries could not afford to move off the benefit. The change follows similar changes made in 1995 to the payment of family support and the guaranteed minimum family income and is designed to assist beneficiaries to move off income-tested benefits. The changes made to family support and the guaranteed minimum family income arose from an Employment Task Force recom- mendation and are detailed in TIB Volume Six, No. 12, page 20 and TIB Volume Seven, No. 9, page 17. Key features Inland Revenue will be able to pay arrears of IFTC back to the date that Income Support ceases payment of a beneficiary’s main benefit. Section KD 7 has been amended to allow this and to correct a cross-reference. Application date The change applies from the date of enactment, 23 Sep- tember 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 12 Excess imputation credit conversion rate for trustees Section LB 2 (3)(b)(iii) Introduction The tax rate at which trustees can convert excess imputa- tion credits has been aligned with the 33% tax rate applying to all trustees (except the Maori Trustee). Background Trustees can convert excess imputation credits to tax losses at the extra emolument rate of 24% (during the 1997/98 income year). This inappropriately allows a greater tax loss than if the credits were converted at the tax rate applying to trustee income, 33%. For example, $100 of excess imputation credits should give rise to a tax loss of $303, instead of a tax loss of $417 if the extra emolument rate has been used (the greater tax loss being $114). (These figures have been rounded.) The tax rate at which trustees can convert excess imputa- tion credits has been aligned with the 33% tax rate applying to all trustees (except the Maori Trustee). The extra emolument conversion rate that formerly applied was intended to cater for individuals. Although this amendment may be seen as having retrospective effect, taxpayers have generally not been negatively affected because excess imputation credits can be ascertained only at the end of an income year. Key features The tax rate at which trustees can convert excess imputa- tion credits is 33%. This does not apply to the Maori Trustee, for whom there are special rules. Application date The amendment applies from the 1997/98 income year. Annual conversion rate for excess imputation credits New section LB 2 (3)(b)(iv) Introduction Taxpayers converting excess imputation credits to tax losses under section LB 2 (3)(b)(iii) are required to use the rate of tax deduction on payment of extra emolu- ments applying for that income year. That rate, specified in clause 8 of Schedule 19, applies to every payment of an extra emolument. Amendments specify annual conversion rates of 25%, 24%, and 21.75%. These first and last rates deal with the problem when two or more extra emolument rates apply during an income year. Background Section LB 2 (3)(b)(iii) provides a method to convert excess imputation credits to tax losses. It states that item “b” (of the conversion formula a/b) is “the rate of tax deduction on payment of extra emoluments, expressed as a percentage, stated in clause 8 of Schedule 19 and applying for that income year.” The rate specified in clause 8 of Schedule 19 applies to payments of “extra emoluments”, as that term is defined in section OB 1. Extra emoluments are lump sum payments made in relation to employment which are not for overtime, nor regularly included in a pay period. However, the extra emolument rate in clause 8 of Schedule 19 is a rate for every payment, not a rate for an income year as required by section LB 2 (3)(b)(iii). The new legislation specifies an annual conversion rate for the purposes of converting excess imputation credits. The annual conversion rate will be set with reference to the extra emolument rate applying for that income year. When two or more extra emolument rates apply for an income year, the annual conversion rate will be calcu- lated as the weighted average of the rates applying during that income year. Key features •The annual conversion rate for the 1996/97 income year is 25%. This is the weighted average of the extra emolument rate of 28% applying for the period 1 April 1996 to 30 June 1996 and the extra emolument rate of 24% applying for the period 1 July 1996 to 31 March 1997. •For the current income year (1997/98), the extra emolument rate remains at 24%. Thus, the annual conversion rate will be 24%. •The annual conversion rate for the 1998/99 income year is 21.75%. This is the weighted average of the extra emolument rate of 24% applying for the period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1998 and the extra emolument rate of 21% applying for the period 1 July 1998 to 31 March 1999. Application date These amendments apply for the 1996/97, 1997/98, and 1998/99 and subsequent income years respectively. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 13 Tax simplification: provisional tax Sections MB 2, MB 2A, MB 3, MB 4, , MB 5A, MC 2 NC 15, NE 4 and OB 1 and Schedule 13, Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 92(4), 119, 120K, 140A, 141(14), 142E(3) and 178, Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The provisional tax rules will be simplified and stream- lined with effect from the 1998/99 income year. The underlying principles of the reforms include reten- tion of the “safe harbour” where use of money interest does not apply for people whose residual income tax is less than $30,000. The reforms also simplify the rules for larger taxpayers, and streamline them by removing inconsistencies. The amendments will reduce compliance costs and remove many of the confusing features of the current provisional tax rules. The main ways this has been achieved is by removing the underestimation penalty, providing clear rules on interest starting dates and including rules for determining payments when a balance date changes. Background The current rules are a complex amalgamation of two regimes, one setting specified payment amounts to ensure payment during the year and the other providing incentives to pay through the application of use of money interest. The success of the latter method in ensuring payment has provided scope to simplify the rules, especially for those who pay use of money interest, through removal of the under estimation penalty. The amendments follow consideration of the submis- sions received on the provisional tax proposals contained in the Government discussion paper Tax Simplification Issues, released August 1996. Key features •The definition of provisional taxpayer has been be expanded to cover those who had a reasonable expec- tation of being a provisional taxpayer and who paid provisional tax exceeding $2,500 during the year. •The underestimation penalty and associated provisions have been repealed. Taxpayers will be required to take reasonable care when estimating. •Use of money interest regime will begin from the first instalment date for all non-natural provisional taxpay- ers, natural provisional taxpayers who elect out of the safe harbour, those who hold a certificate of exemp- tion for resident withholding tax (RWT) purposes, and trustees in respect of trustee income only. •Provisional tax and terminal tax payments that fall due on 7 January will be treated as falling due on 15 Janu- ary. Also due on 15 January will be the 5 January PAYE and SSCWT payments from larger employers. •Provisional tax rules for those who change their balance date have been established. The pattern and number of provisional tax instalments and due dates have been prescribed, as has the amount payable on those instalment dates. Rules are also provided for determining the amount of provisional tax payable if a prior year is a transitional year (the year in which the taxpayer adopts a new balance date). •Natural persons may be new provisional taxpayers. The new requirements are that their residual income tax (RIT) for the past four years was less than $2,500, their RIT for the current year exceeds $30,000, they cease to derive income from employment and begin to derive gross income from a business. •If the Commissioner assesses or reassesses a taxpay- er’s prior year RIT on which current provisional tax instalments are based, the amended assessment affects only instalments falling more than 30 days after the amended assessment. At the end of this item there is a summary chart of the old and new provisions. Application date The amendments apply from the 1998/99 income year. Detailed analysis Definition of provisional taxpayer (sections MB 2A and, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act) The definition of provisional taxpayer in section OB 1 has been amended to include a taxpayer who elects to be a provisional taxpayer. Because persons may now elect to be provisional taxpayers, provisions deeming them to be so in certain circumstances are no longer required. Therefore the term “person incorrectly assumed to be a provisional taxpayer”, and associated provisions, have been repealed. A new section MB 2A has been inserted into the Income Tax Act to allow taxpayers to elect to be provisional taxpayers. Taxpayers will be eligible to make the election if they pay provisional tax exceeding $2,500 in an income year and had a reasonable expectation of being a provisional taxpayer for that year. The section provides that: •the election must be made in the tax return for that income year; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 14 •the taxpayer must have had reasonable expectation of being a provisional taxpayer at the point the first payment of provisional tax occurs. This amendment comprehensively addresses the prob- lem of taxpayers paying provisional tax in the expecta- tion that they would be provisional taxpayers, but turning out not to be and not receiving interest on the overpaid tax (although interest would have been charged had they been provisional taxpayers and underpaid their tax). Removal of the underestimation penalty and amendment to related provisions (sections MB 2 and MB 3, Income Tax Act 1994 and section 3(1), 119, 142E(3), 178, Tax Administration Act) Several amendments have been made to the provisional tax rules to give effect to the removal of the underesti- mation penalty. Section MB 2 (1)(c) of the ITA has been amended to remove the reference to taxpayers being required to furnish an estimate of their residual income tax liability. Section MB 2 (2) has been amended to remove the requirement that those with RIT over $300,000 in the current year and who had less than $2,500 RIT in the previous year are required to pay provisional tax. Although they are not required to make payments, they will still be affected by the use of money interest rules from the first instalment date under section 120K(1) of the Tax Administration Act unless they are also new provisional taxpayers. Section MB 3 (2) of the ITA has been amended to remove the requirement on those with RIT over $300,000 to estimate their provisional tax payable. Subsection (3), which addresses the issue of compulsory estimators who do not actually estimate, has also been removed. Section 140A of the TAA, which currently provides for the underestimation penalty, has been repealed, with consequential repeal of the associated remission provi- sion (section 178) and the provision providing for the due date for the underestimation penalty (section 142E(3)). Requirement for estimating taxpayers to take reasonable care (Section MB 3, Income tax Act and sections 119 and 141(14), Tax Administration Act) With the removal of the underestimation penalty and associated provisions, taxpayers will not be required to estimate their liability, but if they do they will have to take reasonable care in estimating the amount payable at each instalment date. If they pay more than last year’s RIT they will be deemed to have taken reasonable care. A new section MB 3 (4) of the ITA provides that taxpayers making an estimate or re-estimate must take reasonable care in doing so. Taxpayers must also ensure that their estimates are fair and reasonable at the time made and for any instalment to which they apply. Section 119 of the TAA, which provides that the Com- missioner may determine the amount of provisional tax payable, has been amended to provide that the Commis- sioner may determine the amount of provisional tax payable should an estimate applying at an instalment date not be fair and reasonable. This section has also been amended to specify that the amount the Commis- sioner may determine is capped at the amount of provi- sional tax that would have been payable had the taxpayer not estimated their liability. Treatment of non-natural taxpayers with RIT less than $30,000 (Section 120K, Tax Administration Act) Owing to the risk of deferred tax payments, interest on non-natural provisional taxpayers with RIT between $2,500 and $30,000 will now begin on the first instal- ment date. This provides a consistent treatment of all non-natural provisional taxpayers in that interest applies from the first instalment date regardless of their RIT. The new section 120K(1) of the TAA gives effect to this measure. Natural persons who hold a certificate of exemption for RWT purposes and trustees, on trustee income, also currently face use of money interest from the third instalment date. They also now come under the interest rules from the first instalment date. The amended section 120K(1) of the TAA provides that use of money interest begins from the first instalment date, while the safe- harbour provided by 120K(4) does not apply to these taxpayers. Moving early January PAYE, SSCWT and provisional tax instalments to 15 January (Sections MC 1 (2), MC 2 (2), NC 15 (1)(b) and NE 4 (b)) Currently, three provisional tax instalments and one terminal tax date fall due on 7 January each year. Given the proximity to the Christmas/New Year holiday period, the due date for payment has been deferred until 15 January. This coincides with the due date for GST for those whose returns would otherwise be due on the last working day in December. Similarly, the 5 January PAYE payment due from large employers (those with $100,000 or more gross tax deductions and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax payable) has also been moved to 15 January. These changes are intended to reduce compliance costs. A significant number of minor amendments were required to give effect to the changes to the provisional and terminal tax due dates. •The definition of “first instalment date”, “second instalment date” and “third instalment date” have been amended. •The definition of “terminal tax date” and sections MC 1 (2) and MC 2 (2) of the ITA have been amended to provide for 15 January as a payment date. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 15 •Section NC 15 (1)(b) has been amended to move the due date from 5 January to 15 January. •Section NE 4 has been amended to provide a 15 Janu- ary payment date for the SSCWT payment. The amendments to SSCWT and PAYE come into force on 1 April 1998, so first apply to payments in January 1999. The provisional tax amendments apply to the 1998/99 income year, so also first apply to January 1999. New balance date rules (Sections MB 2 MB 3, MB 4, MB 5A, OB 1, and Sched- ule 13, Income Tax Act. Sections 119 and 120K, Tax Administration Act) The standard provisional tax instalment rules are geared to a standard income year of 12 months, with instalments due on a recurrent basis, every four months. Rules outlining the treatment of a provisional taxpayer when a balance date change occurs have been introduced: •The pattern and number of provisional tax instalments and due dates will be based on the old balance date, with payments required every four months. However, the final instalment date will continue to be the final month in the transitional year (the year the taxpayer changes balance date). •Instalment amounts in the post-approval portion of the transitional year will be increased or decreased to take into account the length of the transitional year. •If the transitional year’s RIT becomes the base year’s RIT for subsequent payments of provisional tax it will be increased or decreased to take into account the length of the transitional year. The changes ensure that an appropriate amount of provisional tax is paid during the transitional year and, where applicable, interest on underpayments and overpayments is charged. The amendments relating to a change in balance date have not been incorporated into existing provisions but run in parallel to the current rules. Although this in- creases the length of the legislation, it does ensure that the complexity of the rules surrounding payments in a transitional year do not affect all taxpayers. Section MB 2 of the ITA provides for the determination of the total amount of provisional tax payable in an income year. It has been amended to ensure that the correct amount of provisional tax is payable if a prior year is a year in which a taxpayer changed balance date (a transitional year). The new subsections (6) and (7) gross up or scale down the RIT for the prior transitional year till it represents the RIT that would have applied had that transitional year been an income year of normal length. Subsection (6) also applies for the purpose of section 119(3) of the TAA, which provides that the Commissioner may determine the amount of provisional tax payable by a taxpayer in an income year in a number of circumstances. The new section MB 3 (5) of the ITA provides that a taxpayer estimating the provisional tax payable in a transitional year must estimate on the basis of a 12- month year before receiving approval for a change in balance date. However, after receiving approval, the taxpayer must re-estimate the tax payable based on the length of the transitional year. This is on the basis that, before approval, the “normal” provisional tax payment rules apply, so a “normal” estimate must support these rules. After approval, the transitional year rules apply, so an estimate of the liability for the actual length of the year is required. The new section MB 4 of the ITA provides for the determination of the number of payments due in an income year. The new subsection (4) provides that in a transitional year the due dates are determined in accord- ance with Schedule 13 and the amounts payable in accordance with section MB 5A. The new section MB 5A of the ITA sets out the provi- sional tax payable. It applies only in a transitional year, and then only after a change in balance dates has been approved by the Commissioner. Before notification of a change in balance date the “normal” provisional tax rules apply (MB 5A (1) provides for this treatment). Subsection (2) provides that the due date for instalments, other than the final instalment, must be determined in accordance with Schedule 13. Subsection (3) provides that the final instalment is due on the seventh day of the last month in the transitional year unless the final month is January, in which case the due date is 15 January. (A provision in the Bill providing that payment would have been due on the taxpayer’s balance date if the final instalment date would otherwise have occurred after the end of the taxpayer’s income year has been removed. The proposed provision was removed on the basis that no similar restriction applies to provisional taxpayers not changing their balance date.) There will always be a final instalment of provisional tax payable regardless of length of the transitional year because this subsection simply determines the day in the final month of the transitional year on which provisional tax will be payable. Subsection (4) provides for new provisional taxpayers who change their balance date. In effect, it removes the obligation to pay either the first, second or third instal- ment depending on when the taxpayer started business. Note that this provision does not affect the final instal- ment due date, which is always in the final month. Therefore a new provisional taxpayer will always have at least one instalment of provisional tax. Subsection (5) provides for the amount payable in relation to a non-transitional year when a taxpayer is not estimating. Because each non-final instalment in the transitional year is four months apart, each payment is effectively based on one-third of a prior year’s liability. Subsection (6) provides that if taxpayers have estimated their liability, the amount payable is their provisional tax IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 16 payable modified to reflect the length of the transitional year, less any amount previously due and payable on earlier instalment dates. Subsection (7) determines the final instalment for non- estimating taxpayers. The calculation is based on the number of days in the transitional year compared with the previous year, multiplied by the amount of provi- sional tax determined to be payable, less any amount previously due. The important difference between this calculation and those applied to determine the amount payable on non-final instalments is that this calculation is based on days rather than months in the transitional year and the preceding year. This gives an increased level of accuracy and acts to “square up” the overall provisional tax liability. Subsection (8) provides that, if taxpayers have estimated their provisional tax payable, the amount payable on the final instalment date is their estimate, less any amount previously due and payable on an earlier instalment date. The amended section MB 4 places an obligation on taxpayers in a transitional year who have estimated their liability, to estimate based on the full length of the transitional year. This occurs only once they have been notified that their request for a change in balance date has been accepted. Again the final instalment calculation is based on the number of days in the year, rather than the number of months. Subsection (9) determines the number of months in the taxpayer’s transitional year so both the number of instalments of provisional tax payable can be determined and the amount payable on non-final instalment dates can be determined. Months are used as a measure, over a day counting rule, to minimise compliance costs associ- ated with these provisions. Section 119(2)(a) of the TAA, which provides the Commissioner with a discretion to determine the amount of provisional tax payable if taxpayers change their balance date, has been repealed because the new specific rules will apply instead of a Commissioner’s discretion. Section 120K (4A) of the TAA deems the amounts to be due on each of the provisional tax instalment dates for the transitional year. As non-final instalments are four months apart, the amount of each instalment is the proportion that four months represents to the length of the transitional year. The final instalment, which may not represent a four-month period, is the income tax liability for the transitional year, less any amounts due on earlier instalment dates. The difference between these deemed amounts and the amounts actually paid by the taxpayer is subject to use of money interest unless the taxpayer is a safe harbour taxpayer. New provisional taxpayers (Section OB 1, Income Tax Act) If a provisional taxpayer is classed as a new provisional taxpayer the current provisional tax rules apply only to those instalment dates falling due after the taxpayer started business. For example, if a company began operating shortly after the second provisional tax instalment date, use of money interest and provisional tax apply from the third instalment date. Currently, only non-natural provisional taxpayers can be classified as new provisional taxpayers. This exclusion has, however, caused some inequities. The existing definition of the term “new provisional taxpayer” in section OB 1 of the ITA has been expanded to include natural persons if: •Their RIT for the prior four years was less than $2,500. This acts to ensure they really are new provi- sional taxpayers, and not ones with varying types of income. •Their RIT for the current year exceeds $30,000. This ensures they are subject to the use of money interest rules. •They cease to derive income from employment and begin to derive gross income from a business. This also ensures that taxpayers really are “new” provi- sional taxpayer and not ones with fluctuating income. The definition of the term “first business day” has also been amended to provide that a natural person’s first business day is the day after he or she ceases deriving income from employment. Grace period for taxpayers to adjust to changes in their provisional tax liability (Section MB 2, Income Tax Act) Under the current rules, if the Commissioner determines a taxpayer’s provisional tax liability, that amended liability is used to calculate only those provisional tax instalments, if any, which fall due 30 days or more after the notification of that amendment. Under the new rules this approach has been expanded to apply to situations where the Commissioner assesses or reassesses a taxpayer’s prior year RIT, which then affects provisional tax instalments. Section MB 2 (3)(a) has been amended to provide that an assessment or reassessment of income tax for the preceding income year is not used to determine provi- sional tax payable on an instalment date if issued less than 30 days before that instalment date. Treatment of taxpayers under proposed provisional taxpayer rules Safe harbour taxpayers The provisional tax payment rules have not been amended for those natural persons in the safe harbour (except for adjustments related to balance date and new provisional taxpayers). These taxpayers will continue to base provisional tax on their last year’s RIT plus 5%, or RIT for the year before last plus 10%. If the amount of provisional tax due is not paid on the due date, late payment penalty is incurred. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 17 Taxpayers who wish to pay less than required under these rules without incurring the late payment penalty may estimate their provisional tax payable. This also removes them from the safe harbour from the first instalment date. Taxpayers who pay more than is required or make additional payments remain in the safe harbour. Taxpayers in the safe harbour are neither charged nor receive use of money interest if they underpay or overpay their residual income tax liability for the income year. Interest will only begin from the terminal tax date if provisional tax is underpaid. Interest on overpaid tax will start from the terminal tax date or the date the annual tax return for that year is filed, whichever is the later. However, as taxpayers may estimate their liability until the third instalment date, and this action removes them from the safe harbour from the first instalment date, it is possible for taxpayers who consider they have overpaid by the third instalment date to receive interest on that overpayment. Non-safe harbour taxpayers Taxpayers who fall naturally outside the safe harbour will have the option of being able to determine their provisional tax liability based on a prior year’s liability, as taxpayers in the safe harbour do. This option will be available for all three provisional tax instalments. However, given the application of use of money interest to these taxpayers, it is likely that many will estimate their provisional tax payable. When taxpayers estimate the provisional tax payable for an income year they will be required to take reasonable care in that estimate. The estimate must also be a fair and reasonable one, as under current rules. If they estimate more than they would have been required to pay had they not estimated they will be deemed to have taken reasonable care. If they do not take reasonable care, the penalty will be 20% of the difference between a reasonable estimate and the amount actually calculated by the taxpayer.

Background The drafting error meant that the amount of DWP credit attached to a non-cash dividend consisting of a taxable bonus issue did not have to be taken into account in calculating the amount of NRWT to be deducted from that non-cash dividend. Key feature The amendment corrects item “f” of the formula in section NG 9 (1)(b). This ensures that the amount of DWP credit attached to any non-cash dividend consist- ing of a taxable bonus issue is taken into account in calculating the amount of NRWT to be deducted from that non-cash dividend. Application date The amendment applies to dividends paid on or after 23 September 1997, the date of enactment. Income tax treatment of shareholder-employees Sections OB 1 and OB 2 Introduction Several amendments have been made to section OB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The key change provides that the section’s existing application, to shareholder/ employees of companies with 25 or fewer shareholders, will continue on a permanent basis. Background In certain circumstances, income derived by an em- ployee from a company in which they are also a share- holder is deemed to be derived other than by way of source deduction payments. This means that the income is subject to provisional tax, rather than PAYE. The circumstances in which this occurs are listed in section OB 2 (2), and are generally limited to where the income is derived other than by way of regular payments throughout the income year. Up until 1994, section OB 2 (2) only applied to share- holder/employees of private companies. However, to accommodate company law reform, changes were made to the Act. This included shifting the application of section OB 2 (2) to close companies, which have a narrower definition. However, concerns were raised that the change would lead to taxpayer uncertainty with regard to the practical application of the legislation, and result in taxpayer exposure to penalties, therefore increasing compliance costs. In recognition of this, the Government passed legislation carrying over application to private compa- nies until 1 April 1998. It also undertook to review the legislation and its practical application. The amendments arise out of this review. Key features The present application of section OB 2, to companies with 25 or fewer shareholders, is to continue on a permanent basis. The section provides that income derived by employees from a close company in which they are also sharehold- ers is subject to provisional tax, rather than PAYE, if, in the preceding income year, they: •did not derive salary or wages from the company of a regular amount for regular pay periods of one month or less; or •derived total salary or wages from the company, by way of regular amounts for regular periods, that was less than two thirds of their total income from the company; or •received any amount in anticipation of any income that might subsequently have been allocated to them by the company. The amendment removes the requirement that share- holder/employees must make an application to the Commissioner if they wish the section to apply from the initial year that their income falls within the section’s criteria. The section now expressly provides that a company and a shareholder/employee can anticipate compliance with the section and apply it in their first year of operation, if they so choose. The amendment also removes the Commissioner’s discretion to deem income falling within the section’s criteria for non-source deduction income to be source deduction income. This ensures that income falling within the section’s criteria retains its non-source IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 19 deduction status, as long as the criteria continue to be satisfied. The placement of the definition of “close company”, for the purposes of section OB 2, has also been amended. The term is now defined exclusively within section OB 1, with inclusion of a reference to the definition to be used for the purposes of section OB 2. Application date The amendments apply from when the legislation’s present application to private companies lapses, which is the income year commencing 1 April 1998. State-owned enterprises Schedule 18 Qualifying Companies - Loss of qualifying company status Section OB 3 (1)(c)(ii) Introduction An anomaly in the qualifying company legislation has been corrected by preventing a qualifying company from losing its qualifying company status when a trustee shareholder of the company fails to treat dividends from any other qualifying company as beneficiary income. Background The intention of the qualifying company rules is to treat small, closely held companies in a similar way to partnerships. To ensure that the regime is open only to closely held companies, entry is limited to companies with five or fewer shareholders. Family members are counted as one shareholder. Trustees may be shareholders in qualifying companies provided that all dividend income (not being non-cash dividends other than taxable bonus issues) received by the trustee from any qualifying company during the income year is distributed as beneficiary income. Beneficiary income is income not held by the trust but passed through to beneficiaries within a certain period of time. The requirement is intended to prevent distribu- tions from qualifying companies being trapped in discretionary trusts for onward distribution to beneficiar- ies who do not qualify as qualifying company sharehold- ers under the shareholder test. (Beneficiaries are at no time actual shareholders but are required to be counted as such for the purpose of determining whether the company exceeds the maximum number of shareholders allowed in a qualifying company.) An anomaly arose when a trustee held shares in several qualifying companies. If the trustee failed to distribute dividends from one qualifying company to beneficiaries, all qualifying companies with the same trustee lost their qualifying company status. Only the qualifying company from which the trustee did not distribute dividends should be affected. The amendment corrects this anomaly. Key features Section OB 3 (1)(ii) has been amended to ensure that only those qualifying companies whose dividends are not distributed by the trustee shareholder as beneficiary income will lose their qualifying company status. Qualifying companies that have the same trustee as a shareholder will not lose their qualifying company status provided their dividends are distributed as beneficiary income. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. Introduction The list of state-owned enterprises in Schedule 18 has been updated by the removal of references to companies that are either no longer owned by the state or no longer exist. Two companies, Coal Corporation of New Zealand Ltd and Government Property Services Ltd, have been added to the Schedule. Background State-owned enterprises listed in Schedule 18 are included in the special corporate entity definition in section OB 1. Special rules, contained in sections OD 3 (3)(a) and OD 4 (3)(a), apply to special corporate entities when calculating the voting and market value interests of shareholders. These rules deem all the shares in a special corporate entity to be held by the same single person, that is, by all of its members or directors in a collective capacity. No breach of shareholder continuity is therefore possible with a special corporate entity. This means that any losses or credits in the imputation credit account of a special corporate entity cannot be lost as a result of any actual change of shareholding. The policy reason for this IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 20 treatment is that special corporate entities do not ulti- mately have natural person shareholders (as normal shareholder continuity rules assume). Several companies that were listed in Schedule 18 were no longer state owned. It was appropriate to subject these companies to the normal shareholder continuity requirements in respect of their losses and imputation tax credits, and this was achieved by their removal from Schedule 18. As a result of the reordering of the Income Tax Act 1976, Coal Corporation of New Zealand Ltd and Government Property Services Ltd were inadvertently omitted from Schedule 18. The Schedule has been amended to include these companies. Key features The following companies, no longer owned by the state, have been removed from Schedule 18: •Air New Zealand Ltd •Bank of New Zealand Ltd •National Provident Management Company Ltd •New Zealand Steel Ltd. The following companies no longer exist and have been removed from Schedule 18: •Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand •Geothermal Development and Investment Ltd •Government Life Insurance Corporations Ltd •New Zealand Export-Import Corporation Ltd. The following companies have been added to Schedule 18: •Coal Corporation of New Zealand Ltd •Government Property Services Ltd. Application date Air New Zealand and New Zealand Steel Ltd were removed from the beginning of the 1992/93 income year, the date from which the special corporate entity definition applied. Bank of New Zealand Ltd and National Provident Management Company Ltd were removed from their settlement dates, 5 November 1992 and 17 April 1992 respectively. Companies that no longer exist were removed from the date of assent. Coal Corporation of New Zealand Ltd and Government Property Services Ltd were added from the beginning of the 1995/96 income year, the application date of the Income Tax Act 1994. Minor remedial amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 Exempt income – removal of redundant reference (Section CB 5 (1)(e)) Section CB 5 (1)(e) has been amended to remove a redundant reference to New Zealand superannuation (NZS). NZS is paid under the Social Welfare (Transi- tional Provisions) Act 1990, and not under Part I of the Social Security Act 1964, as the section implied. The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. Ex gratia payments (Section CC 1 (2)) •The words “or a parent or child of the taxpayer” have been inserted into section CC 1(2) because their previous omission was incorrect. •The penultimate line of section CC 1(2) incorrectly referred to “spouse” and has been amended to cor- rectly refer to “parent”. The amendments take effect from the start of the 1995/96 income year, since the 1995 amendment which created these problems was intended to change only the location of the provision, rather than the policy itself. Consolidated group loss offsets (Section IG 6 (1)) •When the Income Tax Act 1994 was enacted, refer- ences to sections IG 1 and IG 2 were inadvertently omitted from section IG 6 (1). They have now been included. •Section IG 6 (1) was repealed and an amended section inserted by the Taxation (Core Provisions Act) 1996 with effect from the 1997/98 year. Therefore refer- ences to sections IG 1 and IG 2 have been inserted into the amended section, with the same application date as Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amendment. The first amendment applies to the 1995/96 and 1996/97 income years. The second amendment applies from the 1997/98 income year. Low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year (Section KC 1) Section 21 of the Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997, which inserted a new section KC 1(1) to provide for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year, has been amended to allow a rebate for veteran’s pensions. The amendment applies from the date the Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997 came into force, 14 May 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 21 Alignment of due dates for RWT (Section NF 3 (1)) Section NF 3 (1) has been amended by replacing “14th” with “20th”. The amendment ensures that the due date for all payments of resident withholding tax (RWT) deductions is the twentieth day of a month following a month the payment is received. In July 1992 the due date for payment of RWT deduc- tions was generally changed from the fourteenth day of a month to the twentieth day of a month following the recommendations of the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee. However, the due date for payment of RWT for agents and trustees who are required to make deduc- tions of RWT on payments received from which no deductions of RWT are made, remained the fourteenth of the month. To ensure consistency, the due date for agents and trustees has been changed to the twentieth of a month. The amendment applies from 1 April 1997, the date of the introduction of the new compliance and penalties rules. Non resident withholding tax amendment (Section NG 2 (1)(a)) The amendment corrects a drafting error made in section 59 of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1996. Section NG 2 (1)(a) is now consistent with the new core provisions. Section 59 of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1996 has been repealed The amendment applies to dividends paid on or after 2 September 1996, the date of enactment of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1996. Changes to section OB 1 definitions (Section OB 1) The following amendments are all of a minor nature, correcting either incorrect, redundant or omitted section references. •“Completed”: The section OB 1 definition of “com- pleted” refers to sections EO 3 and EO 4. Both sections employ the word “completed”. It is also used in section OB 1, in the definition of “film production expenditure”. The definition of completed should also refer to the definition of film production expenditure. Accordingly, the definition of completed has been amended by inserting the words “in the definition of film production expenditure and” before “in section EO 3...”. The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. •“Continuity provisions” and “credit account continuity provisions”: The section OB 1 definitions of “continuity provisions” and “credit account conti- nuity provisions” have been amended by the insertion of a reference to section MF 4 (1)(e), which relates to the shareholder continuity requirement in order to avoid the forfeiture of BETA credits. The reference was overlooked during the re-organisa- tion of the Income Tax Act. Although this inaccuracy has been present since 1 April 1995, the application date of the Income Tax Act 1994, the savings provisions of the Act would have protected affected taxpayers. Therefore the amendment applies from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. •“Insurance”: The section OB 1 definition of “insur- ance” has been amended by replacing “OE 2” with “OE 4”. The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. •“Market value”: Paragraph (b) of the section OB 1 definition of “market value” has been expanded to include reference to section OD 4, which prescribes market value interests relating to shares and options. Paragraph (c) of the section OB 1 definition of “ market value” has been amended by replacing the reference to section GC 25 (9) with a reference to section GC 23 (9), which defines market value for the purposes of entry to or exit from the foreign invest- ment fund regime. The amendments apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. •“Tax credit advantage”: “Section GC 22(8)” has been replaced with “section GC 22(9)” in the section OB 1 definition of “tax credit advantage”. The refer- ence to section GC 22(8) was a typographical error. The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. •Tax rate for trustees of superannuation funds (Clause 6, Part A, Schedule 1, Income Tax Act 1994): Clause 6 of Part A of Schedule 1 provides that the tax rate for trustees of superannuation funds is 33%. As this is the same as the tax rate for trustees generally, this clause has been repealed and clause 4 has been amended by removing the reference to clause 6. The amendment applies from the 1997/98 income year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 22 Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 Compliance, penalty and interest provisions Sections 4A, 37(3), 81, 120K, 120O, 120S, 120V ,139, 140A, 142A, 157, 170, 174, 183A, 183B, 183C, 183D, 183F 183H, Tax Administration Act Sections IG 10, NC 15, Income Tax Act Section 43, GST Act Section 12L, Gaming Duties Act Sections 118, 118A, 119, Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Introduction Several amendments have been made to the compliance and penalty provisions to reduce compliance costs, correct drafting errors, and make minor policy changes. Background In the 1992 Budget the Government announced its intention to review and reform the legislation enforcing compliance with tax obligations. It then carried on a detailed revision of the tax penalties rules and identified a series of weaknesses: •Gaps in coverage: There were no direct sanctions to address many forms of non-compliance which result in some taxpayers paying less than they owe. •Flaws in design: Some penalties tried to address more than one aim in a confusing way. •Inconsistencies in application: There were inconsist- encies in the size of penalties applied for similar defaults. Once it had identified these deficiencies, the Govern- ment issued two discussion documents. The first, Taxpayer Compliance, Standards and Penalties, out- lined principles and high level proposals. After consider- ing submissions the Government then issued a second discussion document. Taxpayer Compliance, Standards and Penalties 2, which contained detailed proposals and draft legislation. The document generated a further round of consultation which prompted several other changes to the rules before legislation was introduced and enacted, in late 1996. It generally came into effect from the 1997/98 income year. The recent amendments fine tune the legislation by introducing a number of compliance cost reduction measures, a number of minor policy amendments, mostly of a taxpayer-positive nature, and correct a number of minor drafting errors. Key features •The requirement that taxpayers must request extension of time to file a tax return in writing has been removed. •The requirement that taxpayers must request cancella- tion of interest in writing has been removed. •There will be a 15-day grace period following the issue of a statement of account. •The small balance write-off has been increased from $5 to $20. •Before imposing a late filing penalty, the Commis- sioner must warn a taxpayer either specifically (through a notice) or generally (through advertising) that tax returns relating to a particular period are overdue. •The application date of remission/cancellation provi- sions has been made 1 April 1997. Application date The compliance cost reduction measures apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. The corrections generally apply from the date of effect of the new compliance and penalties provisions, as follows: •income tax, from the 1997-98 income year •GST, supplies made in taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 1997 •estate and gift duty, gifts made on or after 1 April 1997 •gaming duties, to all races run, all lotteries drawn, all dutiable games played by means of a gaming machine, and all casino wins arising on or after 1 April 1997 •stamp and cheque duties in relation to every instru- ment of conveyance executed, every bill of exchange made, drawn, or prepaid and every liable transaction entered into on or after 1 April 1997. The exceptions to these application dates are the changes to the application date of the remission provisions and the amendment to section 157(1). These amendments are deemed to come into force on 1 April 1997 unless, in the case of the remission provisions, a taxpayer has received remission under the previous provisions. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 23 Detailed analysis Compliance cost reduction measures: sections 37(3), 120O, 120S, 139, 174, 183C(4) and (5), 183H Removal of requirement to request extension of time to file a tax return in writing Section 37(3) specifies that a taxpayer requiring an extension of time arrangement must request it in writing to the Commissioner. This provision has been removed to allow taxpayers to request an extension of time verbally. This approach has lower associated compliance and administrative costs, and taxpayers will still be able to request an extension in writing if they so wish. Inland Revenue will confirm or decline the issuing of an extension of time arrangement to a taxpayer by letter to ensure that a record exists. This amendment applies from date of enactment. Late filing penalty Section 139C has been amended to provide that the Commissioner must warn a taxpayer either specifically (through a notice) or generally (through advertising) that tax returns relating to a particular period are overdue, before imposing a late filing penalty. Payment of interest before a tax return is filed The new use of money interest scheme provides that interest is paid from the due date of the tax until the tax is refunded. However, interest will generally not be paid on overpaid tax if the taxpayer has not filed the relevant tax return. Payment of interest will begin once the tax return is filed, with effect from the date of filing. An exception to the return filing rule is made in the case of: •Reconciliation statements. The due date for payment in relation to a PAYE reconciliation return is the same as the due date for the final PAYE payment for the year. However, the reconciliation return has a filing date of 30 May, while the return relating to the last PAYE period is due on 5 or 20 April. Without com- plex ordering rules it would not be possible to deter- mine to what extent an overpayment relates to a reconciliation statement and to what extent it relates to the final PAYE period. Section 120O has been amended to provide that the return filing requirement does not also apply to payments of PAYE also due on that date. The amendment also applies to non-resident withholding tax and resident withholding tax recon- ciliations (section 120O). •Annual payers of fringe benefit tax. A number of these taxpayers may choose to pay part or all of their fringe benefit tax liability during the year and should be eligible for interest if they overpay (section 120S(4)). Increase in the small balance write-off Section 174 allowed the Commissioner to refrain from collecting or refunding tax of less than $5. To minimise compliance and administrative costs the threshold for writing off small debts was raised to $20 This amendment applies from date of enactment. Application of grace period to statements Section 183C has been amended to provide a 15-day grace period following the issue of a statement of account, during which interest imposed under the new rules will not accumulate. If full payment is not made within the 15 days, interest will be calculated from the start of the grace period. This measure gives taxpayers certainty as to the amount to pay following the issuing of a statement and acts to prevent small residual debts arising. This amendment applies from date of enactment. Removal of requirement to request cancellation of interest in writing Section 183H required a taxpayer requesting a remission or cancellation of a late payment penalty, late filing penalty or interest to do so in writing. Although it is appropriate for remissions to be requested in writing, in the case of cancellations, which are undertaken by the Commissioner, the action is automatic and a written request should not be required. The section has been amended to remove this requirement. This amendment applies from date of enactment. Shortfall penalties (Sections 3(1), 138L, 141(3), 141(5), 141A, 141A, 141B, 141C) Several corrections have been made to the shortfall penalty provisions: •A definition of acceptable interpretation has been inserted in section 3(1) because the term is used, for example, in section 141A(3). The definition of acceptable interpretation is simply those interpreta- tions which are not unacceptable. •Section 138L has been amended to ensure that taxpay- ers have the right to challenge how a shortfall penalty is calculated. This provision is required because of the complexity of the calculations involved, and various decisions are required in determining the amount which is subject to the shortfall penalty. •The definitions of “tax position”, “tax shortfall” and “taxpayer’s tax position” in the Tax Administration Act are intended to clearly provide that taxpayers take a tax position in relation to every issue or matter embodied in the calculation of their taxable income. In other words, the tax return is a sum of all the tax positions taken by the taxpayer. If a tax position taken by a taxpayer is not correct a shortfall penalty may apply to that position. The definition of “taxpayer’s tax position” and sections 140A(2)(a), section 141A and section 141C of the Act have been amended to confirm this situation. •Section 141(3) was intended to provide that a separate tax shortfall calculation must be undertaken for each return period, each tax type and each tax position a IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 24 taxpayer takes, although this was not stated. The section has been amended to make this explicit. •Section 141(5) provides for offsetting an overpayment of a tax liability against an underpayment if a taxpayer is liable to pay more than one shortfall penalty. However: –There was no provision allowing offsetting when only one shortfall penalty is imposed. This subsection has been amended to allow for the offsetting of an overpayment of tax against one underpayment. –The legislation provided that the overpayment was apportioned amongst the relevant shortfalls, when the intention is that it be apportioned between all shortfalls. The word “relevant” has therefore been removed. •Section 141(9) has been amended to clearly show that it applies only for the purpose of subsection (6). •Section 141B(1) defines an unacceptable interpreta- tion. The previous wording of the definition was cumbersome and has been simplified. In effect, the amendment simply involves removing a redundant reference to an interpretation. •Section 141B(2) and (3) provide for a threshold below which the unacceptable interpretation penalty will not apply. In the case of taxpayers in loss, the threshold was to be based on the larger of $10,000 and the taxpayer’s net loss multiplied by the base rates of tax (up to a maximum of $200,000). However, because the net loss figure was negative, the result was that the $10,000 minimum threshold applied to all taxpayers in loss, regardless of the size of that loss. Section 141B(3) has ben amended to provide that a tax loss is treated as a positive value in determining the threshold for the unacceptable interpretation penalty. •Section 141B(3) also provides that the threshold for the unacceptable interpretation penalty must be calculated before any group offset election or subven- tion payment. These adjustments applied only to income tax, although the legislation did not explicitly state this. This provision has been amended to make it clear that the issue of these offsets arises only in relation to income tax. •Section 141B provides that the unacceptable interpre- tation penalty can be imposed only on a tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position if the shortfall exceeds $10,000 and the taxpayer’s “total tax figure” (defined as the lesser of $200,000 and 1% of the tax for the return period). The definition of total tax figure provides specific rules for determining the total tax figure if the taxpayer has no tax to pay. The total tax figure was based on the taxpayer filing a tax return on time. This section has been amended to remove the reference to the return having to be filed on time. The total tax figure will be based on the return, regardless of when it is filed. •Section 141C has been amended to add a new subsec- tion providing that an acceptable interpretation of a tax position also means that the taxpayer was not grossly careless. •Section 141F provides that an officer of a company can be liable to a shortfall penalty if the officer fails to make a deduction of tax or permits a deduction to be mis-applied. If an officer is liable to a shortfall penalty, the amount to pay is equal to the shortfall penalty which applies to the company. Therefore if the company is charged a penalty for evasion, which is 150% of the tax shortfall, the officer would also be charged the same amount. (The total amount of penalty is not divided between the two.) Further, as the provision is worded, the Commissioner has no discre- tion as to whether the penalty was applied to the officer or officers involved. This was an unintended change in the policy, so the section has been amended to provide that one shortfall penalty is imposed for the failure, and the tax shortfall on which the penalty is being imposed may be apportioned by the Commis- sioner amongst the taxpayer and the officer/s involved, as appropriate. The title has also amended to clarify the purpose of the section. The amendments apply from the date of effect of the new compliance, penalty and interest rules, 1 April 1997. Use of money interest (sections 120K, 120V and 183C) The provisional tax rules create a liability for use of money interest by deeming that a provisional taxpayer’s residual income tax for the year is due evenly on the three provisional tax instalment date. This general rule has been modified to take into account new provisional taxpayers and changes in balance date. However, no rule deemed a commencement date for interest for those who are in the “safe harbour”. While the income liability for these taxpayers was due on the terminal tax date, they also had provisional tax payments due on each instal- ment date. If taxpayers underpaid, use of money interest applied. Because the intention is that these taxpayers not face use of money interest, a new section 120K(4B) has been inserted with application for the 1997/98 income year. This amendment applies only to that income year because the amendments made to the 1998/99 income year and subsequent years by the new provisional tax rules deal with this issue (section 120K(4)). A number of minor amendments have also been made to the use of money interest rules: •The Commissioner is no longer required to pay use of money interest to persons who have had RWT over- deducted from their interest, since the Government will not have had the use of the money over the period it has been over-deducted. This amendment has been made by way of inserting a new section 120V. •Section 183C(3) provides a 30-day grace period following the issue of an assessment. During this IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 25 period the taxpayer can effectively pay the amount stated on the assessment (and any interest accumulated up to the date of the issue of the assessment) and not be charged interest. The section has been amended to terminate the 30-day grace period at the end of the 30 days or the due date for the tax, whichever is earlier. •Section 120J has been amended to accommodate the enactment of new section 120V: the expression “sections 120K to 120U” has been replaced by “sections 120K to 120V”. The application date of these amendments is the date of effect of the new compliance, penalty and interest rules, which for income tax is the income year beginning 1 April 1997. Remission provisions (section 157, 183A, 183B, 183C, 183D, 183F, Tax Administra- tion Act and sections 118, 118A, 119, Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992) Reinsertion of remission provisions Sections 183A to 183D contain the new remission and cancellation provisions. The two discussion documents proposed that the new provisions apply from a fixed date, 1 April 1997, to all the taxes covered by the regime. A fixed date would prevent two taxpayers in identical circumstances, except that one faced a penalty under the old rules and one under the new, receiving different treatments. However, as enacted, these remis- sion/cancellation provisions applied only to the new rules, while the old provisions continue in force. To prevent two sets of rules applying, sections 183A to 183D have been re-inserted and deemed to come into force on 1 April 1997. A savings provision (section 103 of the Amendment Act) has been inserted to provide that those who applied for remission under section 182, subsequent to 1 April 1997, may have that remission request addressed under that section. The Commissioner must have received the request for remission before 23 September 1997. The exception to the 1 April 1997 application date for the compliance and penalty remission provision is ACC premiums, since ACC has been conducting audits on an industry basis. It would be unfair that industries that the ACC has not yet audited face tighter remission provi- sions simply because they were placed further down the investigation list. Therefore the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act’s remission provision, section 118A, which was replaced by the compliance and penalty regime’s generic provisions, has been re- inserted with effect from 1 April 1997. This remission provision will apply to penalties arising in relation to the 1996/97 and earlier income years. However, the generic compliance and penalty regime’s remission provisions will apply to remissions from the 1997/98 income year. Sections 118 and 119 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act have been reinserted for the period 26 July 1996 until the beginning of the 1997/98 income year. This confirms that penalties on unpaid premiums may be imposed for this period. Minor amendments to the remission provisions Several minor amendments have been made to the remission provisions: •Section 183A provides for remission of a late filing penalty and late payment penalty if a taxpayer has reasonable cause. One of the intended criteria for qualifying under this provision is that taxpayers correct their defaults as soon as practicable. However, the requirement did not apply to the late filing penalty. An amendment has been made to correct this defi- ciency. •Section 183B allowed the Commissioner a discretion to remit a late payment penalty if a taxpayer complied with an instalment arrangement. However, if a tax- payer did comply with an arrangement there would have been no reason for the Commissioner not to remit the late payment penalties. Therefore section 183B has been amended to remove the Commissioner’s discre- tion. •Section 183D provides for remission consistent with the collection of highest net revenue over time. It has been amended to: –Provide that remission is not available on the basis of the taxpayer’s financial position. Unlike the other penalty remission provisions, the section did not include a restriction that remission is not available on the basis of the taxpayer’s financial position. –Clarify the relationship between this section and the Commissioner’s duty under section 6A. The section now provides that the Commissioner when considering remission have regard to the importance of the late payment penalty, late filing penalty and use of money interest in promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts. •Section 183F provides that small amounts of penalty and interest are not to be charged. The provision has been amended to provide that late payment penalty or interest will not be imposed on any amount of tax outstanding of less than $100 after the due date. The previous wording allowed penalties to be imposed if a taxpayer made partial payment. The amendments apply from the date of effect of the new compliance, penalty and interest provisions, 1 April 1997. Other minor amendments (sections 4A, 81, 140A, 142A, 170, Tax Administration Act and sections IG 10, NC 15, Income Tax Act) •Section 4A(2) of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) defines when a deduction of dividend withholding tax or a source deduction payment is made. The section then defines when they have been mis-applied, but IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 26 referred only to dividend withholding payments. The provision has been amended to correct this oversight. •Section 4A(4) of the TAA is intended to provide that shortfall penalties may be imposed on a default in accounting for tax if the tax return shows a higher tax liability than actually paid by the taxpayer. This is achieved by the provision deeming the tax paid to be the taxpayer’s tax position, allowing a shortfall penalty to be imposed, should the Commissioner wish, on the difference between the tax payment and the position returned. However, as previously worded, the provi- sion applied to all taxes. It has been amended to be limited to withholding taxes. •Section 81 of the TAA provides that the Commis- sioner may disclose information for the purposes of administering the various taxes and duties for which the Commissioner is responsible. However the new rules did not apply to the Child Support Act and the Student Loan Scheme Act, which had the unintended consequence of removing them from the scope of section 81. This section has been amended to include these Acts. •Section 140A of the TAA provides for the underesti- mation penalty. With the introduction of the shortfall penalty provisions it was appropriate that the underes- timation penalty apply only to an underestimation that occurs in relation to the tax position the taxpayer initially takes in a tax return. Any subsequent change in tax liability should not result in further underestima- tion penalty because shortfall penalties are available to deal with this problem. As the provision was worded, it was possible for an underestimation penalty to increase on a second reassessment. Section 140A has been amended to prevent this. •Section 142A provides that a new due date must be set if a taxpayer’s liability to pay tax is increased beyond the amount calculated by the taxpayer. However, the provision did not make it clear that the calculation is the one provided by the taxpayer in a tax return. This section has been amended to include a reference to the calculation being that contained in a tax return. •Section 157(1) gives the Commissioner the power to recover tax and penalties in default via a bank as a lump sum. An amendment to this section requires a bank to recover any interest which has accumulated on the overdue tax and penalties after the Commissioner issued the recovery notice. To reduce compliance costs, the bank will be informed of the amount of interest which is accumulating daily on the overdue tax and penalties. This approach removes the need for the Commissioner to issue a second recovery notice for the additional interest. A similar amendment has been made to the GST recovery provisions, The Gaming Duties Act and the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act. •Section 176 of the TAA provides relief from an income tax liability in cases of serious hardship. The definition of the term “tax” in the Tax Administration Act was previously widened, as a result of the broad scope of the new compliance and penalties legislation, to include all taxes and duties, rather than just income tax. A consequence of the earlier amendment was that taxpayers could request remission under the provision in relation to, for example, GST, when it is the policy intention that this remission provision be limited to income tax. Therefore section 176 has been amended to provide that it applies only to income tax. •Section IG 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the use of losses to pay penalties. A provision has been inserted that allows a loss incurred by a company in a wholly-owned group of companies to be used to pay a shortfall penalty imposed on any company in that group. •Section NC 15 of the Income Tax Act 1994 sets a due date for the payment of tax discrepancies identified as a result of the completion of a PAYE reconciliation. As previously worded, the due date was 20 April when, in relation to larger employers, it should have been 5 April. This provision has been amended to confirm a 5 April due date for larger employers. These amendments apply from the date of effect of the new compliance, penalty and interest provisions, 1 April 1997. Objection rights for thin capitalisation determinations Section 90A(4) and (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The redundant objection rights open to taxpayers in respect of determinations on the apportionment of interest costs under the new thin capitalisation rules have been removed. Taxpayers continue to have rights under the new dispute resolution procedures to challenge any determination issued. Background Subsections (4) and (5) of section 90A referred to the objection rights open to taxpayers in respect of deter- minations made under this section. Similar objection rights in the other determination provisions, namely sections 90 and 91, had been repealed in line with the new dispute resolution procedures. These subsections were redundant since any determination made under section 90A would be subject to the right to challenge by taxpayers under Part VIIIA. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 27 Key features Subsections (4) and (5) of section 90A are repealed to remove the anomaly that would have retained objection rights for taxpayers who have had determinations issued under this section. The new disputes resolution proce- dures replaced objection with a single challenge process. Repeal of the redundant provisions ensures consistency of treatment with all of the determination provisions in the Act. Application date The repeals apply from 1 October 1996, the date the new dispute resolution procedures came into force. Binding rulings on livestock Section 91 C(1)(e) Tax Administration Act 1994 In order to clarify the legislation relating to binding rulings on specified livestock and non-specified live- stock, two amendments have been made to paragraph 91C(1)(e). Subparagraph 91C(1)(e)(v) has been amended to relate solely to binding rulings on specified livestock. A new subparagraph, (vi), which relates solely to binding rulings on non-specified livestock, has been inserted. The amendments apply from 23 September 1997. Binding rulings on matters subject to determinations Section 91C(1)(e)(iA), Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment prevents the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from making a binding ruling if the matter in question is or could be the subject of a determination issued under the thin capitalisation rules. This ensures that there is a clear demarcation between binding rulings and determinations. Background A reference to section 90A was inadvertently omitted from section 91C(1)(e) when the thin capitalisation rules were enacted. The effect of this omission was that a taxpayer could seek either a binding ruling or a determi- nation on any matter that is the subject of Part FG of the Income Tax Act 1994. This was inconsistent with the general demarcation between the binding rulings legislation and various determinations rules. Key features New subparagraph 91C(1)(e)(iA) prevents the Commis- sioner from issuing a binding ruling on matters that are, or could be, the subject of a determination issued under the thin capitalisation rules in section 90A. Application date The amendment applies from the start of the 1996/97 income year, to coincide with the application date of the new thin capitalisation rules. Binding rulings on matters under challenge Sections 91E(3)(b) and 91F(3)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The Commissioner of Inland Revenue now has a discretion to decline issuing a private or product ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to a challenge. This ensures that the Commissioner retains the right to decline a ruling in cases where a court decision on a question of law is pending. Background When the disputes resolution procedures were enacted, references to “objection” were replaced with references to “challenge” in relevant provisions except for sections 91E(3)(b) and 91F(3)(b). Key features Sections 91E(3)(b) and 91F(3)(b) of the Tax Administra- tion Act 1994 (TAA) have been amended by inserting the words “, challenge,”. This results in the Commis- sioner having the right to decline a ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to a challenge. Application date The amendment applies from 1 October 1996, the date the new dispute resolution procedures came into force. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 28 Binding rulings and double tax agreement procedures Section 91E(4)(d)(ii), 91F(4)(d), Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Amendments ensure that binding rulings cannot be issued on all double tax agreement (DTA) procedures, including tax sparing protocols involving competent authorities. Background The previous legislation stated that the Commissioner could not issue a binding ruling if the matter on which the ruling was sought was being dealt with (or in the Commissioner’s opinion should be dealt with) under a DTA procedure that allows the competent authorities to agree on the application of any provision of that DTA. It was the policy intention of the binding rulings legisla- tion for all DTA procedures involving competent authorities to be taken outside of that regime. However, the relevant wording in the legislation was not clear about preventing rulings being issued on the tax sparing protocols. This is because it referred to both competent authorities agreeing on the matter, whereas the proce- dure under the tax sparing protocols requires both competent authorities to be actively involved but leaves the final decision with the New Zealand competent authority. Key issue Section 91E(4)(d)(ii) (relating to private rulings) and section 91F(4)(d) (relating to product rulings) have been amended to ensure that binding rulings cannot be issued on all DTA procedures (including tax sparing protocols) in New Zealand’s DTAs involving the competent authorities. Application date The amendments apply to private rulings and product rulings made on or after 23 September 1997. Assessments of further income tax Section 101(3) Tax Administration Act Section 101(3) has been amended by replacing refer- ences to “Part VIII” and “an objection” with “Part VIIIA” and “a challenge”. The amendment applies from 1 October 1996, when the new dispute resolution procedures came into effect. Time bar for amendment of assessments Sections 107A and 108 Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction A new section 107A restores the former four-year statute bar against reassessments of returns filed between 1 October 1996 and 31 March 1997. Background An unintended consequence of the introduction of the new tax disputes resolution procedures enacted in 1996 was the creation of a period between 1 October 1996 and 31 March 1997 in which the Commissioner was not subject to the four year statute bar against reassessments. The amendment New section 107A re-enacts the former section 108 in the same terms as that section existed before its repeal. Section 107A applies to returns filed between 1 October 1996 and 31 March 1997. Application The new section is effective from 1 October 1996. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 29 Assessments and notices to deduct tax arrears Sections 109A and 157(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Amendments clarify that: •notices of assessment; and •notices of deductions to be made from monies due to tax defaulters, issued after 1 April 1995, are issued under the Tax Administration Act (TAA), not the Income Tax Act 1976. Background When the Income Tax Act 1976 (the 1976 Act) and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (the IRD Act) were reorganised, provisions from both Acts were amalgamated into the TAA. The TAA came into force on 1 April 1995, and applies, where appropriate, to tax on income derived in the 1995/96 income year and subsequent years. Practical difficulties arose because the IRD Act had applied from a particular day (1 January 1974), whereas the sections transferred from the 1976 Act applied to a particular income year. Key features New section 109A has clarified the policy intention of the application of the TAA to notices of assessment. Those issued since 1 April 1995 will have been issued under the TAA, irrespective of the income year to which they relate. The income tax liability for years before the 1995/96 year will, however, still be assessed under the 1976 Act. The amendment to section 157(10) ensures that all notices of deductions to be made from monies due to tax defaulters issued since 1 April 1995 have been issued under the TAA. The deductions may be in respect of outstanding tax from income years both before and after the 1995/96 income year. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 1995, the date the TAA came into force. Certain rights of challenge not conferred Section 138E(1)(e)(iii) Tax Administration Act 1994 To correct an omission from the drafting of the original provision, section 138E(1)(e)(iii) is replaced. The replacement paragraph (iii) re-enacts the omitted exclusions. The amendment applies from 1 April 1995, the date the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into effect. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 30 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – minor remedial amendments Tax file number Sections 2(1) and 24(2B) These amendments define “tax file number” in line with the Income Tax Act definition and insert that term to replace the term “Inland Revenue Department’s identifi- cation number” in section 24(2B). Section 24(2B) requires a debtor’s “tax file number” to be used on a tax invoice when there is a sale in satisfac- tion of a debt and the debtor – the supplier – does not have a GST registration number. (Goods sold in satisfac- tion of a debt are deemed to be supplied in the course of a taxable activity carried on by the debtor.) The amendments align the terminology used in the GST and Income Tax Acts. The amendments apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 31 Amendments to other Acts Correction of cross-reference to the Social Security Act 1964 Section 30, Child Support Act 1991 The child support formula in section 30 contains a living allowance component that is based on Social Welfare benefit allowances. The Social Security Amendment Act 1996 resulted in the relevant schedule in the Social Security Act 1964 being re-lettered. This amendment makes the consequential amendment that should have been made to section 30 at that time. The amendment applies from 10 May 1996, the date that the Social Security Amendment Act 1996 was assented to. Removal of redundant references to District Commissioner Sections 83(1), 83(2), Child Support Act 1991 Sections 3, 12H(2), 12L(1), Gaming Duties Act 1971 References to the redundant position “District Commis- sioner” in the Child Support Act 1991 and the Gaming Duties Act 1971 have been removed and, where appro- priate, replaced with a reference to “... an officer of the Department”. A new definition of “Officer of the Department” has been inserted into both the Child Support Act and the Gaming Duties Act. The amendments apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. Correction to Student Loan Scheme Act Section 28, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Section 28 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 has been amended to correct a number of cross-referencing errors arising from amendments made to the provisional tax rules in 1993. These errors were carried forward to the reordered Income Tax Act 1994. In addition, the omission of a cross-reference to the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been corrected. The amendments do not make any policy changes. The section has also been amended by the insertion of the underestimation penalty previously located in the Tax Administration Act. The penalty has been moved because it now applies only to student loan repayments. The changes apply from the date of enactment, 23 Sep- tember 1997. Conferring effective tax exemptions on international organisations Section 9AA, Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 An amendment has been made to the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 to ensure that the tax exemptions intended to have been conferred by Orders in Council made under section (9)(2)(a) of that Act and under the corresponding provision of the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act 1957 are conferred as originally intended. The amendment has retrospective effect so as to cater for the twenty international organisations for which Orders in Council conferring ineffective tax exemptions have previously been made under the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 or its predecessor, the Diplo- matic Immunities and Privileges Act 1957. The amend- ment applies in respect of these Orders in Council only. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 32 Correction to Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 Sections 17 and 30 Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 Amendments correct the cross-reference in section 17(2C) and amend the regulation-making authority in section 30(2) to enable the filing fees to be challenged on proceedings brought under this Act. The amendments apply from the date of enactment, 23 September 1997. Corrections to Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997 Section 16(1), Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997 Section 16(1) of the Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997 contained an incorrect reference to “section 51(1) and (2)”. Section 16(1) has been amended to omit the reference to “section 51(2)”. These amendments apply from 14 May 1997, the date of assent of the Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 33 Remedial provisions arising from the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 A number of remedial amendments have been made to correct drafting errors in the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. All the amendments apply from the 1997/98 income year. Income Tax Act 1994 Section CB 10 (2)(b) A possible ambiguity in section CB (10) (2)(b) has been clarified. The amendment ensures that the provision’s application does not depend on whether a company has gross income in an income year. New section DJ 13A A new section DJ 13A makes it clear that a deduction is allowed for the cost of minerals, flax and timber that have been extracted, removed, sold or disposed of. It also allocates the allowable deduction to an income year. Which income year it is allocated to depends on whether the property is trading stock or not. If the property is not trading stock, the provisions of section EF 2 (Matching Regime for Cost of Revenue Account Property) will apply. If the property is not trading stock, the provisions of section EF 2 (matching regime for cost of revenue account property) will apply. New section EQ 1 A new section EQ 1 clarifies that excess allowable deductions may be treated as a net loss for grouping purposes. Otherwise they are carried forward as a net loss. As a result, section LE 3 holding companies that receive supplementary dividends in that income year will have an income tax liability for that year at least equal to those dividends. The amendment also clarifies that the calculation of non- refundable credits and convertible credits are not affected by this provision. Section EQ 1 and IF 7 operate together to ensure that losses offset against supplementary dividends are reinstated. The replacement of the pre-core provisions legislation (section LE 3 (10) and LE 3 (11)) by sections EQ 1 and IF 7 clarify that the reinstated losses are subject to the shareholder continuity rules. New subpart ID 1 A new subpart ID 1 clarifies the law relating to the calculation of some schedular income tax liabilities. It identifies classes of schedular gross income for which a calculation of schedular income tax liability may not take into account losses that are carried forward. Section IF 7 An amendment has corrected a cross-referencing error, and clarified that the calculation of non-refundable credits and convertible credits are not to be affected by this provision. Insertion of new subsection (3) and (4) into section II 1 New subsections II 1 (3) and II 1 (4) clarify section II 1 to limit the amount of a policyholder net loss that a life insurer may offset against policyholder income. They also provide that a life insurer may offset the policy- holder net losses only against policyholder income. Section BC 6 (4)(a) The reference in section BC 6 (4)(a) to “future year” has been amended to read “future income year”. Section CB 9 (e) The reference in section CB 9 (e) to “income” has been amended to read “an amount”. Section CI 1 (o)(i)(A), section HH 1 (6), section IE 2 (8) The cross-references to section CH 1A have been removed and replaced with references to section CH 3. Section EZ 9 (2)(c) The cross-reference to section BB 5 in section EZ 9 (2)(c) has been replaced to refer to section CE 4, since section BB 5 has been repealed. Section HI 4 (2) The reference in subsection (2) to “subclause (1)” has been replaced with “subsection (1)”. Section LB 2 (3) An amendment clarifies that a loss calculated under section LB 2 (3) can either be made available to other group companies under the loss grouping rules, or be carried forward to offset against future net income. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.12 (November 1997) 34 Section LC 1 (5) Section LC 1 provides for tax credits paid outside New Zealand. The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act replaced section LC 1 (1), (2), (3) and (4) with section LC 1 (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), but omitted to renumber the existing section LC 1 (5), resulting in two LC 1 (5) sections. The second section LC 1 (5) is now numbered LC 1(6). Section LC 14 (4) The formula in section LC 14 (4) for calculating a taxpayer’s “notional income tax liability” has been amended. The effect is that the family support tax credit, the guaranteed minimum family income tax credit and the independent family tax credit are not taken into account in calculating the notional income tax liability. Section LE 3 (10) Section LE 3 (10) has been amended to include a cross- reference to the new section EQ 1. Section ME 4 (1)(a) An amendment ensures that an imputation credit arises for payments made to satisfy provisional tax and termi- nal tax obligations in respect of the 1997/98 and subse- quent income years. Provisional tax and income tax paid in respect of income years before the 1997/98 income year will continue to be subject to the pre-core provi- sions legislation. Section NE 2 (1) and NE 5 (a) Sections NE 2 (1) and NE 5 (a) contained cross-refer- ences to clause 9 of the first schedule of the Income Tax Act. This has been amended to refer to clause 10. Section NF 9 (1)(j) Section NF 9 (1)(j) has been amended to remove the cross-reference to section DJ 16, replacing it with section DJ 17.

Extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents Introduction Legislation provides that any taxpayer who is unable to file their income tax return by the due date may apply for an extension of time. This policy outlines how Inland Revenue will consider extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents. Legislation The legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. The legislation relating to extensions of time is - Section 37(3) Extension of Time Subject to subsection (5) where any taxpayer satisfies the Commissioner that the taxpayer is unable to furnish the required return by the due date required under this section, the Commissioner, upon application by or on behalf of the taxpayer on or before that date, or within such further period as the Commissioner may allow in any case or class of cases, may extend the time for furnishing the required return to such date as the Commissioner thinks proper in the circumstances. Section 37(5) Final Dates For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), - (a)Where the return required to be furnished by any taxpayer is a return for a year ended on 31 March, the time for furnishing that return shall not be extended or further extended to a time later than the 31 March that immedi- ately succeeds that 31 March: (b)Where the return required to be furnished by any taxpayer is, by consent of the Commissioner under section 38, a return for a year ending with the date of the annual balance of the accounts of the taxpayer, the time for furnishing that return shall - (i)Where that date is between 30 September and the next succeeding 31 March, not be extended or further extended to a time later than the 31 March next succeeding the 31 March that immediately succeeds that date: (ii)Where that date is between 31 March and the next succeeding 1 October, not be extended or further extended to a time later than the 31 March that immediately succeeds that date. Section 38(2) Balance dates up to 30 September For the purposes of this section and section 39, 30 September in any year shall be deemed to be nearer to the last preceding 31 March than to the next succeeding 31 March. Comments on the legislation These sections of the legislation clearly provide that any taxpayer may apply (verbally or in writing) for an extension of time for their annual income tax return, provided they satisfy the Commissioner that they are unable to furnish the return by the due date. The period of the extension cannot be extended beyond the following 31 March. If a taxpayer has a balance date of 31 March, the date for filing an income tax return may not be extended beyond the following 31 March. For example, an IR 3 income tax return for the year ended 31 March 1997 is due on 7 July 1997. The time for filing this return can not be extended beyond 31 March 1998. Policy issues The legislation clearly provides that any taxpayer may apply for an extension of time for their income tax return. To ensure all taxpayers who are not represented by a tax agent are treated fairly, applications for an extension of time will be considered on a case by case basis. Application verbally or in writing The legislation has recently been changed to allow for an application to be made verbally as well as in writing. However taxpayers should ensure that they are request- ing “an extension of time arrangement” for clarity. Reasons for requesting an extension The following are examples of reasons that Inland Revenue considers appropriate for extending the filing date: •Taxpayer/entity is unable to obtain the necessary information to file the return e.g., awaiting IR 12/13s from an employer •Taxpayer has been overseas and time is needed to prepare a return (dependent on dates of leaving and returning) •Ill health, hospitalisation or injury of the taxpayer or taxpayer’s family member (partner or dependant) •Awaiting the finalisation of accounts for a related taxpayer/entity with a different balance date. Return filing history Inland Revenue will also take the taxpayer’s return filing history into account. If the previous two years’ returns have not been filed then it is unlikely that an extension continued on page 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 2 late filing penalty has been imposed.) The criteria for remission of the late filing penalty in this instance are outlined in section 183A. If a default assessment has been imposed before the approval of an extension of time arrangement the default assessment will be reversed. A new default assessment will be scheduled for action after the extension of time has expired. Summary •Applications for an extension of time will be consid- ered from those taxpayers/entities who are not repre- sented by a tax agent. •Applications can be in writing or verbal. •Examples of granting reasons for an extension of time include: –ill health, hospitalisation or injury of the taxpayer and/or a taxpayer’s close family member –awaiting information/lost records, eg IR 12/13 details from an employer –ill awaiting finalisation of a related taxpayer/ entity with a different balance date. •The period given for an extension will be set at the discretion of the officer reviewing the case. When agreeing to an extension of time Inland Revenue will give reasonable regard to the facts of the case. The maximum period is from the due date of the return until the following 31 March. •A letter confirming the extension of time arrangement will be issued to each applicant. Remission of penalties and interest Introduction Legislation introduced in 1997 consolidates the rules for remissions. The changes apply to all taxes and duties, but not to student loan and child support repayments. The objective of imposing a penalty is to maximise voluntary compliance. Taxpayers who have complied see that non-complying taxpayers are penalised. Non- complying taxpayers are provided with an incentive to comply in the future. The penalty regime is therefore principally about fairness. When considering these remission provisions the Commissioner considers it important to have in mind fair treatment for both the taxpayer requesting the remission as well as all other taxpayers. A lenient remission policy penalises complying taxpayers and may ultimately affect voluntary compliance. However, allowing an unfair penalty to stand will also impact on voluntary compliance. The issues are complex and this practice statement will assist the decision making process. This standard practice statement sets out the relevant legislation, practical issues and the Commissioner’s policy. Application dates This policy applies to: •remission requests received before 23 September 1997 and the penalty/interest was charged after 1 April 1997 •remission requests received on or after 23 September 1997 for all penalties/interest, other than those charged in relation to ACC employer and earner premiums. •remission requests received for ACC employer and earner premiums for periods starting on or after 1 April 1997. Strict criteria must now be met All applications must be made in writing. There are two main grounds for remission: of time will be granted for the current year. However, we will also consider whether the current year’s reason for requesting an extension of time could apply to the previous years’ returns. Period of the extension The maximum period for an extension of time for the current year’s income tax return is to 31 March. How- ever, most individuals would probably only require an extension for a few weeks or months. Confirmation - extension of time granted or declined Inland Revenue will send the taxpayer a letter confirm- ing the granting or declining of the extension of time arrangement, and update details on our computer system. Timing The legislation states that an application should be made on or before the due date for filing. However, there is room for discretion. Inland Revenue will consider extension of time requests for 1998 income tax returns after the due date to encourage taxpayers to seek a formal arrangement with us. For 1999 and future years, approval after the due date will be on a case by case basis, depending on the reasons given. If a late filing penalty has been imposed before the approval of an extension of time arrangement the penalty will not be cancelled. The penalty may be remitted in certain circumstances; once the return has been filed the taxpayer will then be able to apply for a remission of the late filing penalty. (The same applies to taxpayers who become a client of a tax agent after the from page 1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 3 •Remission may occur if an event or circumstance provides the taxpayer with reasonable justification for not meeting their obligations. •Remission may occur if it is consistent with the collection of highest net revenue over time. Interest remissions can only be considered under this ground. Shortfall penalties can’t be remitted. The taxpayer’s circumstances will have already been taken into account when considering the imposition of the penalty. All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Remission for reasonable cause Legislation – section 183A (1)The Commissioner may remit a late filing penalty or late payment penalty or any imputation penalty tax imposed under section 140B or any dividend withholding payment penalty tax imposed under section 140C if – (a)The Commissioner is satisfied that the late filing or late payment was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the taxpayer that provides the taxpayer with a reasonable justification or excuse for not providing the tax return or paying the tax on time; and (b)The taxpayer files the required tax return or pays the unpaid tax as soon as practicable. (2)Without limiting the Commissioner’s discretion under subsection (1), an event or circumstance may include - (a)an accident or a disaster; or (b)illness or emotional or mental distress. (3)An event or circumstance does not include - (a)An act or omission of an agent of a taxpayer, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent - (i)That could not have been anticipated; and (ii)The effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (b)A taxpayer’s financial position. Practical issues Remissions under this section apply to late filing penalty, late payment penalty or any imputation penalty (imposed under section 140B) or any dividend withhold- ing payment penalty tax. Application can be made under section 183A, regardless of the Act under which the penalty was imposed (except for penalties on student loan and child support repay- ments). The request must be in writing and the taxpayer may be required to produce relevant information (section 183H). It is envisaged that Inland Revenue would request additional information only in circumstances when there is insufficient information available in the original application and there is difficulty deciding if the case meets the “reasonable cause” criteria. There is no right to dispute the Commissioner’s deci- sion. Policy Remission will only occur if the taxpayer is able to provide reasonable justification for the failure. The term “reasonable” must be applied to the event or circumstance. This is an objective test, which requires that it be reasonable for an average person in the taxpay- er’s position not to have complied. Application of policy In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Com- missioner will consider: 1.Has the penalty been correctly imposed? 2.Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question? 3.Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late? 4.Was the failure caused by an event or circumstance that was – •an accident or a disaster? •illness or emotional or mental distress? When considering the above-mentioned circum- stances or events the Commissioner will use the following definitions: •accident – an event that is without apparent cause or unexpected •disaster – sudden or great misfortune or a calam- ity •illness – state of being ill •emotional distress – disturbance of the mind, mental sensation or state •mental distress – of the mind, done by the mind, affected with mental disorder. 5.Has this reason been used before? Were measures put in place to ensure that this situation does not recur in the future (where appropriate)? 6.Was the tax paid or return filed as soon as “practica- ble” (as soon as it can be done, and as soon as is feasible and realistic)? This will depend on each case, specifically was the default corrected as soon as possible after the event or circumstance passed? 7.Was the failure an act or omission of the taxpayer’s agent? Did an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent cause it? Could the default have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct? 8.Any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application. continued on page 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 4 Practical issues Remissions under this section apply to late filing penalty, late payment penalty or any imputation penalty (imposed under section 140B) or any dividend withhold- ing payment penalty tax and interest payable under Part VII. There is no requirement to remit all three (late filing penalty, late payment penalty, interest). Each case will be considered on its merits. Application can be made under section 183D, regardless of the Act under which the penalty was imposed (except for penalties on student loan and child support repay- ments). The request must be in writing and the taxpayer may be required to produce relevant information (section 183H). It is envisaged that Inland Revenue will request addi- tional information only in circumstances when there is insufficient information in the original application and the Commissioner needs to substantiate the assertion made by the customer to be able to make an informed decision. There is no right to dispute the Commissioner’s deci- sion. Policy The Commissioner is required by law to collect over time as much revenue as possible in a timely manner, but with underlying emphasis on voluntary compliance by all taxpayers. The Commissioner recognises that pursuing the collection of penalties in some circum- stances will not meet his legal duty. Those circumstances are where a penalty is charged because of: •a genuine error •a “one-off” situation •wrong advice given by an officer of Inland Revenue which has directly resulted in the failure. Interest will only be remitted if an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the failure. Interest will not be remitted when the cheque has gone astray in the post. Section 183D expressly prevents a taxpayer’s financial circumstances being taken into account. The hardship provisions deal with such situations. Remissions under section 183D apply to recent events. It was not intended that this section be used to remit penalties remaining from longstanding arrears when the taxpayer has financial difficulties and eventually can only pay the core tax or the core tax plus minimal penalties. These cases are dealt with under the hardship provisions. Application of policy In deciding whether remission is appropriate the Com- missioner will consider: Examples Emotional or mental distress Taxpayer’s return was due on 7 July. The return was near completion and the taxpayer’s previous compli- ance history was exemplary. However, leading up to the due date his daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalised. Her condition steadily deteriorated and the family spent a great deal of time at the hospital where she was in intensive care until the first week in September. During this time a reminder notice had been issued advising the taxpayer that a late filing penalty would be imposed if his current year’s income tax return was not filed within 30 days. He ignored the notice but filed the overdue return in the middle of October along with documentation verifying his daughter’s illness/hospitalisation after the penalty had been imposed. In these circumstances, the taxpayer filed the return three months after the due date, but given the “circumstances and events” this would be consid- ered a “practicable” time frame. Circumstance beyond agent’s control An agent was entrusted to pay a client’s income tax by the due date of 7 February, as the taxpayer would be overseas at the due date. The cheque was made out for the correct amount, signed and post-dated. The cheque was given to the agent and placed in the office safe. The night before 7 February the office was burgled and the safe blown up – the safe’s contents were destroyed. The client’s agent pro- duced supporting documentation. This is considered to be an event beyond the agent’s control. Remission consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time Legislation – section 183D (1)The Commissioner may remit - (a)A late filing penalty; and (b)A late payment penalty; and (c)Interest under Part VII - payable by a taxpayer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practica- ble within the law. (2)In the application of this section, the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of the late payment penalty, the late filing penalty and interest under Part VII in promoting compliance especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts. (3)The Commissioner must not consider a taxpayer’s financial position when applying this section. from page 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 5 1.Has the penalty or interest been correctly imposed? 2.Has the taxpayer paid the tax (or filed the return) in question? 3.Why did the taxpayer pay (or file) late? 4.Was the failure because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation? Remitting a penalty for a “reliable” taxpayer who failed to comply due to a genuine oversight or “one-off” situation recognises that penalising a compliant taxpayer for a small failure is counter-productive and may actually reduce volun- tary compliance. Requests for remission because of a genuine over- sight or a one-off situation apply to penalties only. The Commissioner will not remit interest in these cases as he considers interest is compensation to the Revenue for the loss of funds on timely deposit. Interest charged because of a default by a third party does not fall into this category. In this situation the Commissioner considers the taxpayer should look to the third party for compensation. 5.Has Inland Revenue given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, which has resulted in the failure? If an officer(s) of Inland Revenue has given the wrong advice, the imposition of the penalty may adversely affect future compliance by the taxpayer or other taxpayers. This is due to the adverse impact that imposing a penalty would have on a taxpayer’s perceptions of the integrity of the system eg where the taxpayer has been given the incorrect date, or amount, for payment and can substantiate to Inland Revenue’s satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. The tax must be paid in full as soon as the error is established. Section 183D is the only provision under which interest can be remitted. Interest will only be remitted if Inland Revenue has given a taxpayer incorrect advice which caused a return or payment to be made late and the taxpayer can substantiate to Inland Revenue’s satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. The tax must be paid as soon as the error is established. 6.Any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application. Examples The following are all examples where the penalty would be remitted. Wrong advice A small business person registered for GST and was a six-monthly payer. However as business improved the person elected to file GST returns two-monthly. The person sought the advice from the nearest Inland Revenue office but unfortunately confusion arose over the date the next return was due to be filed, resulting in the imposition of a late payment penalty. One-off situation An employer has a computer system set up for PAYE/wage records. A virus is detected on the 19th day of the month when the IR 66N was due to be filed and paid on the 20th. The software developer was called but had not fixed the problem until the 21st when the monthly data was extracted and the IR 66N completed and forwarded to Inland Revenue with payment. The late payment penalty had been imposed and a request was made for remission. Genuine oversight A new office person had been hired by an employer as a wages clerk. The new person’s duties included preparing the wages, maintaining the wage records and preparing the end of year reconciliation. The new person arrived in early March and found the wage records in a terrible mess. The person completed and balanced the reconciliation and forwarded it to Inland Revenue by 20 April, and had intended to enclose the monthly PAYE for March in the same envelope. Unfortunately the IR 66N and the cheque were caught up in some papers and were not discovered until 22 March. The IR 66N and cheque were promptly delivered to the nearest Inland Revenue office with supporting documenta- tion and an accompanying letter requesting remis- sion. Interest A taxpayer is advised of an incorrect date for PAYE and incurs interest and a late payment penalty. As the late payment penalty was caused by Inland Revenue error; both interest and the late payment penalty would be remitted. However the taxpayer would be expected to provide evidence to support the contention that the incorrect information was given by Inland Revenue. Automatic cancellation/remission There are two provisions for automatic cancellation of penalties and remission of interest: 1.Section 183B – Cancellation of late payment penal- ties under instalment arrangement. Broadly, if a taxpayer meets all obligations under an instalment arrangement all incremental penalties incurred after the date that the instalment arrangement is entered into are cancelled at the successful completion of the instalment arrangement. 2.Section 183E – Remission of interest if unpaid tax remitted. Where the underlying tax is remitted the interest is also remitted. The Commissioner will also reverse interest in the very unlikely situation when a retrospective change to legislation caused the position taken by a taxpayer to become incorrect after it was taken. In this situation a continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 6 policy. The circumstances of the taxpayer will be taken into account. 3.The legislation will be applied in a manner that is not only fair to compliant taxpayers but is seen to be fair. Inland Revenue recognises that penalising a compli- ant taxpayer for a small failure is counterproductive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance. 4.Application for remission must be made in writing. 5.Late payment penalty and late filing penalty will be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that the failure has been caused by: •an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification for the omission. •genuine oversight and confusion or a one off situation. •incorrect advice given by Inland Revenue. 6.Interest will be remitted only if Inland Revenue has given a taxpayer incorrect advice which has directly caused a return or payment to be made late, and the taxpayer can substantiate to Inland Revenue’s satisfaction that they were given the incorrect advice. 7.Remission applications will be considered only when the return and tax have been paid. 8.The legislation does not permit a remission to be granted under section 183A or 183D for financial reasons. new due date for payment would be made, and the interest would be cancelled. Difference between remission, cancellation and reversal Remission: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest is correctly imposed at the time but a decision has been made to relieve the taxpayer of the liability to pay. Cancellation: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest was correctly imposed at the time but a provision of the legislation relieves the taxpayer from the obligation to pay, such as the successful completion of an instalment arrangement. Reversal: the tax, penalty or interest should not have been charged in the first place. Summary 1.Penalties exist to provide fairness to the tax system. 2.Remission provisions are needed to allow the Commissioner to accommodate circumstances in which a penalty is not appropriate. Because penalties encourage customers to feel that the tax system is fair, the procedures used in handling cases by Inland Revenue should cause customers to feel that they have been justly treated, regardless of the outcome. Inland Revenue will weigh the particular circum- stances that exist in each individual case against from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 7 Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

Sale of long-term residential properties – GST implications Public Ruling - BR Pub 97/12 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/2 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 2, August 1995, but its period of application is from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001 and some formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 95/2 applies up until 31 March 1998. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 14(d). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies when a GST registered person sells a residential rental prop- erty in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and the property has been rented out by the registered person for five years or more prior to the sale. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement For section 14(d) to apply, the property must have been: •Rented out for five years by the same person who sold it: it is not sufficient that the property has been rented out for five years but by different owners; and •Used exclusively for residential rental purposes during that period. If the property has been used partly for rental purposes and partly for other pur- poses (e.g. property development purposes) it has not been used exclusively for residential rental purposes and section 14(d) does not apply. All the other requirements of section 14(d) must be satisfied before the exemp- tion will apply. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to the sale of dwellings where the time of supply occurs between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2nd day of December 1997. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) commentary continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 8 Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/12 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/12 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/2 (TIB Volume Seven, No. 2, August 1995 at page 5 under the heading “GST – sale of long-term residential properties”). This Ruling covers the period from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001. Background Generally, the sale of residential rental property is not subject to GST. As the provision of rental accommoda- tion is exempt from GST, the sale of the property is not in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. How- ever, sometimes a residential rental property may be sold by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity (such as the taxable activity of selling houses) in which case the sale is then subject to GST. When a registered person (“the vendor”) sells property in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the vendor must account for output tax on the sale. How- ever, if the vendor has rented out the property as residen- tial accommodation for five years or more before the date of the supply, section 14(d) exempts the sale from GST. Sometimes a property is rented out for residential accommodation for five years before the sale, but the owner of the property changes during that time. A property owner may have also used the property for another purpose as well as for residential accommoda- tion during the five years. Legislation Section 14(d) states: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: ... (d)The supply, being a sale, by any registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity of- (i)Any dwelling; or (ii)The reversionary interest in the fee simple estate of any leasehold land,- that has been used by the registered person for a period of 5 years or more before the date of the supply exclusively for the making of any supply or supplies referred to in paragraph (c) or (ca) of this section: Section 14(c) exempts: (c)The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of- (i)Hire; or (ii)A service occupancy agreement; or (iii)A licence to occupy. Section 14(ca) exempts: (ca)The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land. Section 14(d) was introduced for the purposes of the Housing Corporation. Because the Housing Corporation sold a high number of houses it was carrying on the taxable activity of selling houses. The reference to paragraph (ca) in section 14(d) took effect on 1 August 1990. Application of legislation In order to apply section 14(d), the vendor must satisfy all the following criteria: •The supply must be by way of sale. •The supply must be by a registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity. The sale of a house used for residential rental purposes will usually be an exempt supply. However, a registered person may sell a property in the course of a taxable activity of selling residential properties. A person will usually have a taxable activity of selling residential properties if that person sells properties continuously or regularly (See Case S36 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,237). •The property must have been used for residential, not commercial, rental purposes. •The property must have been used exclusively for rental purposes. If the property has been used partly for rental purposes and partly for other purposes, section 14(d) does not apply. For example, a property developer who rents out property for residential purposes while trying to sell the property does not meet this test. A property developer can only take advantage of the exemption in section 14(d) if the property has been used exclusively for rental purposes. When the property has been used for two purposes, one a taxable supply (property development) and one an exempt supply (rental accommodation), the prop- erty has not been used exclusively for the exempt purpose, so section 14(d) cannot apply. •The vendor must have rented out the property for at least five years. It is not sufficient that the property has been rented out for a minimum of five years by different owners. Example X sold a house in May 1992 to Y Ltd, a property developer. X rented out the house for 15 years prior to the sale. This sale is exempt from GST as it was not a sale in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Y Ltd claimed a “secondhand goods” input tax deduction as the property was acquired for the IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 9 principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Y Ltd continued to rent out the property while developing it. In February 1996 Y Ltd sold the house in the course of its taxable activity of property develop- ment. Section 14(d) does not apply to this sale for two reasons: •Y Ltd was trying to sell the property as part of the property development during the time that it was rented, therefore, it was not used exclusively for rental purposes. •Y Ltd did not rent out the house for five years. Y Ltd must account for output tax on the sale of the house. Notice of extension of Public Ruling 1. This is a notice of extension of a public ruling made under section 91DD of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. Public ruling No.95/1A entitled “Associated non- profit bodies - $1,000 income tax exemption” was signed on 8 December 1996 and notice of its making appeared in the Gazette of 12 December 1996 (Issue No.180). A copy of the ruling appeared in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin Vol.8, No.10 of December 1996. 3. Public ruling No.95/1A originally applied for the 1998 income year. The new period of application is for the 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 income years. Jeffrey Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 10 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Foreign currency amounts – conversion to NZ currency The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the six months ending 30 September 1997. In the past we’ve published these rates in an annual IR 270G form. However, we are now going to publish them six- monthly in the Tax Information Bulletin instead. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year will be published following the end of the Septem- ber quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign cur- rency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equiva- lent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key x y xis the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. yis the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 September 1997. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1997 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.3001 = NZ$37,735.14 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 September 1997. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 18.4554 = NZ$18,964.64 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1997 and has a balance date of 30 Septem- ber 1997. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 1997: (0.9963 + 0.9824 + 0.9586 + 0.9717 + 0.9563) ÷ 5 = 0.9731 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9731 = NZ$513,821.81 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 6 month period ending 30 September 1997. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 30 September 1997 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 30 September 1997 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 22.1795 = NZ$22,543.34 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 14 International tax disclosure forms Introduction Currently interests held in foreign companies and foreign investment funds (FIFs) e.g., shares or units, must be disclosed on a separate IR 4G or IR 4H form for each interest. Inland Revenue has recently reviewed these disclosure forms. As a result of this review two new forms have been developed to simplify the disclo- sure process for certain foreign companies and FIFs. This allows for multiple interests to be disclosed on a single form. Foreign company interests – IR 4GS A person who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company of 10% or greater must disclose that interest. Disclosure must currently be made on an IR 4G form “Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Sched- ule”. A new form IR 4GS has been developed for disclosing multiple interests held in foreign companies listed in Schedule 3, Part A countries (i.e. Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom, and the United States). The IR 4GS can be used pro- vided the foreign company has not applied a tax prefer- ence specified in Schedule 3, Part B. Foreign investment fund interests – IR 4H-CVS A person who holds an interest in a FIF must disclose that interest and calculate FIF income or loss under one of four calculation methods (accounting profits, branch equivalent, comparative value and deemed rate of return). A new form IR 4H-CVS has been developed for the comparative value method. The IR 4H-CVS allows taxpayers with ten or more FIF interests who use the comparative value calculation method to calculate their FIF income on a single form rather than a separate IR 4H-CV form for each FIF. Availability of forms These forms are available now, and can be used for the 1997 tax year onwards.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. BNZ Finance Limited v Holland and Nash (Privy Council, 30 October 1997) Facts:In the 1989 tax year BNZ Finance Deposits Limited, a subsidiary of BNZ Finance Limited, entered into three redeemable preference share and floating rate deben- ture transactions, whereby an initial investment yielded a dividend return over the next three years or so until the date of maturity. The Commissioner alleges that by entering these transactions BNZ Finance Deposits Limited was party to a tax avoidance scheme, and would have been liable to be assessed on the pro- ceeds. BNZ Finance Deposits Limited was dissolved under the Companies Act before the Commissioner could reassess it for the proceeds of these transactions. The Commissioner instead assessed BNZ Finance Limited as agent for the dissolved company, relying on section 276 Income Tax Act 1976 as it stood before changes announced in the 1991 Budget. In the High Court it was held that the Commissioner could assess for the latter two of the four years in question, and the Court of Appeal upheld this finding. The taxpayer appealed to the Privy Council, contending that as the original company had been dissolved before the reassessment was contemplated, the Commissioner had no power to assess BNZ Finance Limited. The taxpayer further argued that as the Commissioner had assented to the original company’s dissolution, the Commissioner was prevented from seeking to assess any other entity for any tax which might be payable by the original company. Findings:The Privy Council held that the Commissioner was entitled to assess the tax- payer for the original company’s liabilities. The Privy Council held that, consid- ering the words in the section “Where an original company was, when it ceased to carry on business in New Zealand, liable under this Act for any income tax or was liable to be assessed for any such tax, and that tax has not been paid, the new company shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be the agent of the original company and shall be liable for all tax payable by the original company” (emphasis added), the Commissioner had the power to assess BNZ Finance Limited regardless of whether or not the original company had been assessed. Further it was held that the Commissioner’s assent to the original company’s dissolution did not prevent assessment against BNZ Finance Limited. Implications:This judgment reinforces the Commissioner’s existing approach to the old sec- tion 276, that it was effective notwithstanding the original company had ceased existence before it had been assessed or reassessed. Section 276 (now section HK 11 Income Tax Act 1994) has been extensively redrafted and the uncertainty which arose in this case does not arise under the new legislation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.13 (December 1997) 16 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

It will also include Accruals determinations which are currently issued separately and included in the TIB. The TIB will provide a regular information service on interpretation of taxation legislation and tax prac- tice and will be issued at least once a month. The new format will provide information in sum- mary form. More detailed information such as Ac- cruals determinations and Legislation commentar- ies will be provided in a separate Appendices to the TlB. Our aim is to provide a more efficient service. You will have the options of: a.Receiving all appendices with the TIB. b.Receiving TIB only and request Appendices which are of specific interest to you. With the first two/three issues of the new TIB you will automatically receive the appendices. A ques- tionnaire will be included in the third issue so you can let us know whether you wish to receive, in fu- ture, all appendices or just the TIB. We are also intersected in hearing your reaction to the new approach and will look to make further improvements on an on-going basis. David Henry Commissioner of Inland Revenue not regarded as variable principal debt instruments. Once the farm is developed to the stage of being a vi- able unit the mortgage is converted to a type i. mortgage. Enquiries with Land Corp revealed that all of these mortgages were originally entered into before the com- mencement of the accrual tax accounting regime, and their terms are such that they are not affected by the accrual tax accounting regime. There are 360 farmers from Whangarei to Te Anau to whom this offer has been made. This means that the amount of the debt forgiven will not be assessable income to the farmer concerned. A media release, based on the above, was made by the Deputy Commissioner Technical on 9 May 1989. A copy of that release was produced in PIB 182. LAND CORPORATION LTD OFFER TO FARMERS TO REPAY MORTGAGES OUTSTANDING Landcorp is currently offering, to mortgagors, the op- portunity to repay their outstanding mortgage at a dis- count. There are two types of financial arrangements involved: Type i. A fixed principal fixed term mortgage Type ii. A current account mortgage where further sums are advanced as further development is needed to bring the farm up to a viable unit. These further advances are subject to satisfactory development of the farm, in terms of a development plan agreed to at the time of entry into the mortgage. As there are further conditions to be met before any further advance is made these mortgages are EAST COAST, NORTH ISLAND DROUGHT In a recent Press Release issued jointly by the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture most of the East Coast of the North Island has been declared an Adverse Events Area because or the drought experienced up to the end of April 1989. The areas covered by the declaration are the counties of Waiapu, Cook, Waikohu, Wairoa, Hawkes Bay, Waipawa, Waipukurau, Masterton, Wairarapa South and Featherston: Dannevirke County east of Highway 2 to the coast, Eketahuna County east of Alfredton. Since the termination of section 94 of the Income Tax Act 1976, the income tax effects of the declaration of an Adverse Event Area has diminished to some extent. However, that section will still be operative where the present drought is a “further occurrence” (see the pro- viso to section 94(2)). This provision will only apply where a farmer was unable to replace capital livestock, sold as a result of an earlier adverse event, because of the current drought. Farmers in the drought area will be able to take advan- tage of the declaration by making use of the income spreading provisions of the Income Equalisation Scheme. Normally deposits made to the scheme can only be withdrawn after 12 months. Where an area has been declared an Adverse Event Area the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the authority to make refunds from the scheme at an earlier date. This will enable the income arising from the forced sale of capital stock to be depos- ited in the scheme and withdrawn when that stock is replaced. The scheme also provides for early refunds, from funds already deposited, where those refunds are used to undertake development or repair work arising from the adverse event that was unforeseen at the time the deposit was made. The Commissioner can also au- thorise early refunds “to avoid the suffering by the tax- payer of serious hardship.” 3 TAX DEDUCTIONS ON PAYMENTS TO SCHOOL TRUSTEES The Department has been asked to clarify the tax status of allowances paid to members of the Boards of Trus- tees recently set up as part of the changes in the educa- tion sector. A payment of $55.00 gross is made to each school board trustee for each board meeting attended, to a maximum of 10 meetings per year. The payments are in the nature of honoraria and are therefore subject to lax deductions at the rate of 33 cents in the dollar pursuant to clause 5 of Part B of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withhold- ing Payments) Regulations 1979. As these payments are not income from employment any expenditure directly incurred by school board trus- tees in attending board meetings that meets the require- ments of the Income Tax Act 1976 may be claimed as a deduction. ing of separate supplies which are used to offset the tax liability to the supplier (farmer). (a)Where the reduction in the net value is a result of charges made directly in connection with ascertain- ing the value or the quantity, volume or quality of a supply, that reduction in output tax liability may be accepted and the net consideration established prior to any other deductions tor unrelated supplies shall be considered to be the consideration for the suppli- er’s total taxable supply. (b)Where the buyer-created invoice notifies the supplier of purchase made from the recipient who has is- sued that invoice, those purchases and the amount that the consideration is reduced by, will be regarded as an expense incurred by the supplier. An input tax deduction may he made if a supporting tax invoice has been supplied and the goods and services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It may be difficult to determine if some charges are in fact an internal cost or whether a supply has been made, e.g., freight. The question should be asked, who is the recipient of the supply? Is the charge a disbursement or does the dairy company own its own trucks and merely identify the charge separately for accounting purposes? BUYER - CREATED INVOICES AND THE "NETTING OFF" OF SUPPLIES INTRODUCTION The purpose of this item is to establish guidelines for determining a registered persons GST liability where that person calculates their liability to tax by accounting for the net amount of a supply only. BACKGROUND In some cases, especially in the supply of agricultural products, a form of buyer-created invoice is used that contains both output and input tax components. For example, a dairy company contracts with a farmer to purchase milk on a daily basis and issues a buyer-cre- ated invoice on behalf of the farmer. The farmer receives a payment reflecting a net amount after the deduction of items such as commission, freight, levies, processing charges etc. In addition to these charges, there may be a further deduction for goods and services that the farmer has purchased from the dairy company, such as fence posts, drench, fuel, groceries etc. COMMENT When the reduction in the net value is a result of charges directly relating to the establishment of the value of a supply, these charges may be accepted in most cases as an internal cost or component of the calculation used by the recipient. Charges other than these internal costs cannot be interpreted as anything other than a supply from the recipient to the supplier. The following guidelines are to be used to distinguish between the acceptable netting off of internal costs in- curred by the recipient (dairy company) and the mak- GST - SECONDHAND GOODS CREDIT - LIVESTOCK PROGENY, WOOL, DEER VELVET, MOHAIR ETC BACKGROUND It has been brought to the Department's attention that a number of registered persons have continued to claim an imputed secondhand goods credit in respect of items which are outside the scope of the definition of secondhand goods. In particular, woolbuyers have made representations in respect of wool purchased from un- registered farmers. FACTS Section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988 amended the meaning of secondhand goods in sec- tion 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 with ef- fect from 24 March 1988. The effect of this amendment was that the term “secondhand goods” should apply to goods that had been previously owned by another per- son for their own use. This is the common meaning of secondhand goods. The definition as amended may still include goods such as trading stock, livestock and pets where those goods have previously been owned by an- other person for their own use. The definition ensured that goods such as livestock progeny, wool, deer velvet, mohair and other items "produced" would not be classed as secondhand goods. 4 DECISION Where wool is purchased by an unregistered farmer and later sold to a woolbuyer the woolbuyer may claim a secondhand goods credit in respect of that purchase. Where the wool is produced by the unregistered farmer and sold to the woolbuyer, no imputed credit is allowed as the wool does not come within the definition of secondhand goods This item confirms the policy stated in PIB 174 and has effect from 24 March 1988, the date of assent of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988.

No. 1JULY 1989
1 PART A: IMPUTATION Section 55 of the Act inserts into the Income Tax Act 1976 Part XIIA - sections 394A to 394ZJ - which contains the provisions implementing the imputation regime. Application The new Part XIIA applies from the income year which commenced 1 April 1988 unless otherwise provided. Section 394A - Interpretation This section provides various definitions for the purposes of the imputation regime. Where appropriate, there is comment upon relevant definitions where these are used in the substantive sections. Section 394B - Companies required to maintain imputation credit accounts Unless excluded by subsection (2) of this section, every company resident in New Zealand is required, with effect from 1 April 1988, to maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) for each imputation year. As a unit trust is deemed to be a company for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, every unit trust will also be required to maintain an ICA subject to the exclusions out- lined below. “Imputation year” is defined in section 394A as the period from 1 April to the following 31 March. Companies which have non-standard balance dates are nevertheless required to operate the ICA on a 1 April to 31 March basis. Any company required to maintain an ICA is an “imputation credit account company”. There are several types of companies which are not permitted to maintain ICAs. These are: 1. Non-resident companies. Where a company is non-resident for all or part of a year it may not operate an account for the period during which it is non-resident. 2. A company acting only in the capacity of trustee. Where a company acts as trustee, the rules applying to trustee/benefici- ary apply. However there is an exception to this in that a company which is a group investment fund deriving category A income must operate an ICA. ‘Group investment fund’ and ‘category A income’ are defined in section 394A and pick up the meaning of those terms in sec- tion 211A(1). The reason for requiring group investment funds with category A income to maintain an ICA is that, for tax purposes, group investment funds are treated as companies in respect of category A income and all category A income dis- tributed to an investor is a dividend (section 4(2)). Where a company acts in a dual capacity (both as a trustee company and a company carrying on other business), it is required to maintain an ICA in respect of its non-trustee business. 3. A company whose constitution prohibits all of its income from being distributed to any proprietor member or share- holder. This would include incorporated clubs and societies. 4. A company which is exempt from tax - for example, an incorporated charity. However, if a company solely derives divi- dend income that is exempt from tax, that company must operate an ICA. 5. A company to which section 204 applies where that company Is solely engaged in the business of life Insurance or reinsurance. Where a company has both a life insurance business in addition to other business, it will be required to maintain an ICA in respect of its other business. In such a case, no debits or credits arise to the extent that they relate to the life insurance business. Section 394C - Imputation Credit Account Every company must record as its opening balance on 1 April in each year the amount of the closing balance as at the previous 31 March. The opening balance as at I April 1988 will be nil. Where payments of provisional tax are made prior to 1 April 1988 in respect of the income year commencing on April 1988 by, for example, early balancing companies, a credit will arise on 1 April of the amount paid (see section 394ZI). In addition, debits and credits to the account are to be recorded as they arise under sections 394D and 394E. Section 394D - Credits to the ICA Section 394D sets out the circumstances in which credits arise to the ICA and the timing of the credit entries. 2 The following amounts arise as credits to the ICA: 1. New Zealand income tax paid The amount of income tax paid by the company during the imputation year. “Income tax”, as defined in section 394A, refers only to New Zealand income tax and excludes penal tax, excess retention tax, additional tax by way of penalty, fringe benefit tax and interest payable by the Commissioner or taxpayer in relation to under- or over-payment of provisional tax. Non-resi- dent withholding tax imposed under the Act is not income tax. The credit arises on the date of payment of the tax or on 1 April 1989 if tax is paid before that date in respect of the 1989 income year. However, a credit does not arise for income tax paid in the following circumstances: (a) Income tax paid by a company in respect of its activities when acting in the capacity of trustee (b) Income tax paid by a life insurance (section 204) company in respect of income derived for the benefit of policyholders (c) Income tax which a group investment fund deriving category A income pays in relation to category B income (d) Where a company which has not been an imputation credit account company becomes one, income tax paid in respect of income derived when the company was not an ICA company. For instance, where an overseas company (e) Where ‘further income tax’ is paid, a credit will arise for the ‘further income tax’ on the date it is paid (see item 2 below). ‘Further income tax’ is able to be offset against a future liability for income tax. Under para. (v) of subsection (1), where such an offset occurs, there is, of course, no credit to the lCA for the amount of tax which is ‘paid’ by means of the offset. (f) Where income tax is paid after I April 1988 in relation to any income year preceding the 1989 income year, no credit arises for the tax paid. 2. Further income tax A credit arises for payment of ‘further income tax’ on the date the tax is paid. ‘Further income tax’ is an amount of tax that is payable under section 394L if the ICA has a debit balance at the end of the imputation year (refer to the discussion on that section at page 13). 3. Excess Retention Tax A credit arises on the date of payment of ERT assessed on an insufficient distribution of income derived during an income year commencing on or after 1 April 1988. 4. Imputation Credits attached to Dividends Received Where imputation credits are attached to a dividend received by a company, a credit arises to the ICA of that company of the amount of the credit attached to the dividend (refer to exception in next paragraph). The credit arises at the time the dividend was paid. The term ‘paid’ is defined in section 394A to include “distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interest of or on behalf of”. An exception is where a company is assessable on its dividend income - for example a life insurance company. In such a case the company may offset the credit against its tax liability for that income year and no credit will arise to the ICA 5. Dividend withholding payment credits attached to Dividends Received As noted in Part B of this commentary, a company has the option of operating a dividend withholding payment account (DWPA) - it is not mandatory. Where it chooses not to do so any withholding payment credits attached to dividends which it receives give rise to a credit in the company’s ICA. The credit arises at the time the dividend was paid. 3 6. Dividend withholding payment made on Foreign Source Dividends The dividend withholding payment regime is discussed in detail in Part B of this commentary. Broadly, it requires a deduc- tion to be made by a New Zealand resident company on receipt of a foreign dividend. The amount deducted is known as a dividend withholding payment and is paid quarterly to the Commissioner by the resident company. Where a dividend with- holding payment is made at a time when the resident company does not operate a DWPA, the amount paid gives rise to a credit in the ICA. The credit arises on the date of payment of the dividend withholding payment. 7. End of year balance in dividend withholding payment account A company which operates a DWPA may transfer to the ICA all or part of a credit balance in the DWPA at 31 March (section 394ZZE). Where this election is made, the amount transferred will be a credit to the ICA which arises on the date of transfer. Note that credits cannot be transferred from the ICA to the WPA. 8. Credit balance in branch equivalent tax account (BETA) There is a detailed discussion of the BETA regime in Part C of this commentary. A company which operates a BETA may transfer to its ICA at any time all or part of the credit balance in the BETA (section 394ZZQ). Where it does so, the amount transferred is a credit to the ICA which arises at the time of transfer. Note that except where a debit arises to the ICA when a correspond- ing credit arises to the BETA in accordance with section 394ZZP, credits cannot be transferred from the ICA to the BETA. 9. Amount of Reduction in dividend withholding payment payable A company may use a credit in its BETA to reduce a dividend withholding payment for which the company is liable (refer to section 394ZZQ(3)). Where it does so, a credit arises to the ICA of the amount of credits in the BETA applied to reduce the liability (this amount is also a debit to the BETA). The credit arises on the date that the company is, or would have been, re- quired to make the dividend withholding payment. 10. Credit to offset previous debit for arrangement to obtain tax advantage Where the Commissioner determines that a company has entered into an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage and deter- mines the amount of the credit which is the subject of the arrangement, a debit arises to the ICA of that amount (section 394ZG). Under para. (j) of subsection (1), where the matter is subsequently resolved in favour of the company (whether by litigation or otherwise), a credit arises of the amount previously debited. The credit arises on the date that the debit arose. Section 394E - Debits arising to the ICA Section 394E sets out the circumstances in which debits arise to the ICA and the timing of the debit entries. Debits arise to the ICA in the following circumstances: 1. Imputation credits attached to dividend paid by a company Where a company attaches an imputation credit to a dividend paid by the company to a shareholder, a debit arises, on the date of payment of the dividend, of the amount of imputation credit attached. 2. Refund of income tax Where a company receives a refund of income tax (as defined in section 394A), a debit arises in the ICA, on the date of pay- ment of the refund. The debit is equal to the amount of cash received by the company and such amount may be less than the actual refund because of the limitation in section 394M (refer to page 14 which outlines the circumstances in which the refund may be limited). Where a refund has been used in part by the Commissioner to offset an outstanding income tax liability, a debit arises for the full amount of the refund and a credit arises for the tax paid by virtue of the offset. However, there are exceptions to this - no debit arises for: (a) A refund of tax paid under the international tax regime where the company has an income interest in a controlled foreign company. (A debit arises to the BETA in this case - refer to page 48). (b) A refund of income tax paid for 1988 or prior income years. (c) A refund of income tax paid in respect of a period when the company was not an ICA company. 3. Refund of Excess Retention Tax A debit arises for the amount of any refund of ERT paid by the company in respect of an insufficient distribution of income derived during an income year beginning on or after 1 April 1988. The debit arises on the date the refund is paid. 4. Allocation debit 4 The imputation legislation contains provisions which require companies to attach credits at the same ratio to all dividends paid during an imputation year (section 394G). These are discussed in detail on page 10. When a company is in breach of these allocation rules an allocation debit arises in the ICA (section 394G(4)). The debit arises on 31 March of the year in which the company was in breach of the rules. 5. Refund of dividend withholding payment Where a company does not operate a DWPA and receives a refund of dividend withholding payment, a debit arises to the ICA of the amount of the refund. The debit arises on the date the refund is paid. 6. Credit of Income Tax to Branch Equivalent Tax Account There is a detailed explanation of the operation of BETAs in Part C of this commentary. It is sufficient to note here that a com- pany may elect to operate a BETA. When a BETA company files its return of income for a year, a credit arises to its BETA of the amount of tax payable under the branch equivalent tax regime (section 394ZZP(1)). When that credit arises to the BETA, a debit to the ICA of the same amount simultaneously arises. This is because all income tax paid is credited to the ICA when it is paid and where a portion of that is tax payable under the international regime, that portion is separated out and used to offset a liability for dividend withholding payment on dividends received from a control- led foreign corporation (CFC). This avoids double tax on income received from a CFC in which the company has an income interest. 7. Continuity provisions - Changes in Shareholding A debit arises to the ICA where there is a loss of continuity of shareholding beyond the specified level. It arises on the date there is the loss of continuity. For a detailed outline of the loss of shareholder continuity provisions refer to the explanation below on the relevant provisions of section 394E. 8. Arrangement to obtain a tax advantage Where the Commissioner has determined that there has been a tax advantage arrangement and has determined the amount which is the subject of the arrangement and also the company whose ICA should be debited, a debit of that amount arises in the lCA of that company (section 394ZG). It arises at the end of the year in which the arrangement commenced (as determined by the Commissioner). 9. Ceasing to be an ICA company Where a company ceases to be an ICA company, i.e. where it becomes non-resident or is otherwise excluded from the require- ment to maintain an ICA (refer section 394B(2)), a debit arises to the ICA of the amount of the credit balance in the account. The debit arises immediately before the company ceases to be an ICA company. Sections 394E(1)(g), 394E(3) and 394E(4) - Loss of continuity These provisions are designed to support the allocation rules (refer to section 394G and commentary thereon on page 10) to ensure that imputation credits cannot be retained in a company that is later sold to shareholders who can make effective use of the imputation credits. In order to prevent this, the legislation provides that where the same shareholders cease at any time to hold shares carrying the right to 75% or more of the profits, credits in the company's ICA are cancelled by a debit entry in the ICA. The debit entry arises on the date of loss of continuity. Example 1 ABC LTD 1 February 1989 Shareholder A holds shares carrying right to 100% of profits. ICA DRCRBal. $$ Feb/March 1989Tax paid700 20 June 1989Div. paid600 (credits attached) 30 June 1989100 Cr 30 June 1989 Shareholder A holds shares carrying right to 70% of profits Shareholder B holds shares carting right to 30% of profits 30 June 1989Loss of commonality100 7 July 1989Tax paid800 12 July 1989Div. paid400400 Cr (credits attached) 5 On 30 June a debit arises in the ICA of $100 being the amount of any credit in the ICA where since the date on which the credit arose the same persons ceased to hold shares carrying the right to receive not less than 75% of the profits. Under subsection (4)(d), $600 of the $700 credit arising in Feb/March would not be subject to the requirement because it was allocated/extin- guished prior to the continuity of shareholding ceasing. Example 2 (assume all shares carry equal rights to profits) 1 February 1989ICA Shareholder A owns 100% of sharesDRCR Bal. $$ Feb/March 1989Tax paid1000 25 May 1989Dividend paid (credits attached)600 400 Cr 28 MayDividend received (credits attached) 200 600 Cr 1 June 1989 Shareholder A owns 80% of shares Shareholder B owns 20% of shares 7 July 1989Tax paid 6001,200 Cr 19 July 1989Dividend paid (credits attached)600 600 Cr 1 August 1989 Shareholder A owns 70% of shares Shareholder B owns 20% of shares Shareholder C owns 10% of shares 7 November 1989Tax paid 7001,300 Cr 4 DecemberDividend paid (credits attached)800 500 Cr In Example 2, credits arising in Feb/March and 28 May are the only credits arising to the ICA to which a loss of continuity applies - there was no loss of continuity between I June 1989 and I August 1989. Under section 4(d) the required continuity of shareholding ceases on 1 August 1989. All of the 1200 credits that arose in Feb- ruary/March and May have been allocated prior to that date - therefore there is no debit entry on 1 August. Shares to be held in the same proportion There is a loss of continuity if shareholders do not continue to hold shares in the same proportion. Therefore if shareholder A, with shares carrying 70% of the right to receive profits, and shareholder B with 30%, exchange shares there would be a loss of continuity. Shareholding continuity period In determining a person’s entitlement to profits the provisions of section 191(1) apply, as modified for the purpose by subsec- tion 4(a). For these purposes, any reference to income year is to be read as the relevant shareholding continuity period (see next paragraph). For the purpose of determining continuity during the life of a credit. i.e. between the credit arising and being cancelled (this is referred to in the legislation as the ‘shareholding continuity period’), there are transfers of ownership of shares which do not count. These are: -Where shares are transferred under a matrimonial agreement, the shares held by the new owner are deemed to be held by the transferror for the remainder of the shareholding continuity period. -Where a shareholder dies during the shareholding continuity period, shares which are held by the trustee of the estate or the beneficiaries are deemed to he held by the deceased shareholder during the shareholding continuity period. Exclusions from Loss of Continuity Provisions The shareholder continuity provisions do not apply to: (a) Any credit arising before 16 December 1988 (which is the date the legislation received the Royal Assent) (section 394E(4)(e)) (b) Any company which has any of its shares quoted on the NZ Stock Exchange (c) Any statutory producer board or wholly-owned subsidiary of a statutory producer board (d) Any co-operative company registered under any of the Acts listed in section 394E(3)(d) 6 (e) A private company (e.g. Company A) included in a specified group (defined in section 191(4)) where any member of the group (e.g. Company B) has shares quoted on the N.Z. Stock Exchange and where (i)Company A and Company B continue to be in the specified group during the shareholding continuity period, or (ii)during the shareholding continuity period the reason that company A failed to meet the continuity of shareholding require- ment was that shares in Company B had been sold in the ordinary course of trading and less than 11% of the shares In com- pany B were acquired by any one person or by 2 or more associated persons Section 394F - Attaching an imputation credit to a dividend A company which is required to operate an ICA may attach an imputation credit to a dividend. This is done at the time of payment of the dividend. The term “dividend” is defined in section 394A. It excludes dividends paid in kind and dividends which are deductible to a company. Imputation credits may be not be attached to such dividends. However, credits may he attached to taxable bonus issues. A transitional provision provides for retrospective attachment of credits to a dividend paid during the period commencing on 1 April 1988 and ending before 1 February 1989. Section 344G - Allocation rules 1. Exceeding imputation ratio A company is not permitted to attach credits to a dividend at an imputation ratio which exceeds a 1 - a where “a” is the resident company tax rate for the income year in which the dividend is paid. “Imputation ratio” is defined in section 394A to mean the amount of the imputation credit attached the amount of the dividend paid (excluding credits attached to the dividend) Therefore for the 1989 income year the maximum ratio allowed is $28 credits/$72 net dividend paid. Where the company ex- ceeds this ratio, the Commissioner will nevertheless restrict the amount of credit which may be claimed by the shareholder to a ratio of 28/72. With the recent change in the company tax rate to 33 cents from the 1990 income year the maximum imputation ratio allowed will be $33/$67 in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 April 1989. 2. Allocating credits at different ratios during year In order to prevent the “streaming” of credits to shareholders who are able to use them, section 394G requires that every dis- tribution during an imputation year must carry credits at the same imputation ratio. The first dividend paid by an ICA company during the year is the “benchmark dividend”. All subsequent dividends paid during that imputation year must carry credits at the same ratio as the benchmark dividend. For example, if there are no credits attached to the benchmark dividend, every subsequent dividend paid in that year would also have no have credits attached. Where a company is in breach of this provision, a debit (known as an “allocation debit”) arises to the ICA of the company of an amount calculated as follows: (a x b) - c where a = the amount of all dividends paid by the company during the imputation year (excluding credits attached to the dividend) 7 b =the lesser of (i)the highest imputation ratio of dividends paid during the year (ii)the maximum ratio allowable for the year (see para. 1 above) c =the amount of all imputation credits attached to dividends paid by the company during the imputation year. The effect of the debit to the \]CA is to assume, for the purpose of the ICA, that all dividends paid during the imputation year are credited at the highest ratio. Example April 1989Dividend paid to A and B$10.000 with 2,000 credits July 1989 " "$10,000 with $3,000 credits The dividend paid in July is credited at a different imputation ratio to the dividend paid in April. A debit will therefore arise to the ICA of: $20,000 x 3/10 - $5,000 = $1,000 A debit of $1,000 will arise to the ICA of the company at the end of that imputation year (March 1990). 3. Ratio change declaration As the purpose of the allocation rules is to prevent streaming of credits, a ratio change is only permissible where a company officer completes a statutory declaration to the effect that a subsequent dividend is not being credited at a different ratio to the benchmark dividend as part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage (such as for the purpose of streaming of credits). The ratio change declaration is to be delivered to the Commissioner before the subsequent dividend is paid. For the special provisions applying to statutory producer boards and co-operative companies, see pages 15 to 18. Section 394H - Company dividend statement When an ICA company declares a dividend, it is required to complete and retain a company dividend statement. This sets out the information listed in section 394H. The statement is to be forwarded to the Commissioner by 31 May following the end of the imputation year in which the dividend was paid. Section 3941 - Shareholder dividend statement A company which pays a dividend with an imputation credit attached is required to give to the shareholder at the time of payment a shareholder dividend statement. Section 394I lists the information required on the statement and is self-explana- tory. The non-corporate shareholder is required to attach the statement to the shareholder’s income tax return when the credit is claimed. Section 394J - Annual imputation return An ICA company is required annually to file a record of the debits and credits to, and the opening and closing balance of, its ICA for each imputation year. This annual imputation return is to be forwarded to the Commissioner by 31 May immediately following the end of the imputation year. In addition to the debits and credits to the account, the company should show in the return the amount of further income tax payable and the amount of imputation penalty tax payable (refer to pages 8 and 9 of this commentary). Where the company is also a branch equivalent tax account company (see Part C below) information is required in relation to entries in its branch equivalent tax account. Subsequent Variation in Ratios For the 1990 and subsequent years, where either of the ratios referred to below have increased or decreased by more than 20% from those for the previous year, ICA companies must include in the return a note to that effect and an explanation of the reasons for the change. The ratios are: a b 8 where a =the amount of credits (imputation and dividend withholding payment) attached to dividends paid by the company during the year b =the amount of dividends paid by the company during the year c d where c =the amount of all debits arising to the ICA during the year d =the amount of credits to the ICA during the year. Example In year 1 (1989) a company does not credit dividends and in the following year dividends are fully credited. 1989credits attached0 dividends paid$7,200 1990credits attached$3,300 dividends paid$6,700. The ratio a/b has increased by more than 20% and therefore the company is required to state this fact in its imputation return. An explanation of the reason for the change is to be furnished - it may simply be a change in the number of credits available in its ICA as a result of increased tax payments. Section 394K - Imputation return required upon request or cessation The Commissioner has the power to require a company to file a return of the entries in its ICA at any time. For instance, a return may be required if there is reason to believe that entries in the account are not correct. Where a company ceases to be an ICA company (for example, if it becomes non-resident) the company is required to furnish within two months of its ceasing to be an ICA company an imputation return for the period from the beginning of the impu- tation year until the date it ceased to be an ICA company. Section 394L - Further income tax A company may, during an imputation year, attach credits to dividends in anticipation of credits subsequently arising in the ICA. The ICA may therefore run into debit. Where there is a debit balance at the end of 31 March, the company is required to pay to the Commissioner, on or before 31 May, an amount equal to that debit balance. This is an amount of tax by way of further income tax, and may be used to offset a future income tax liability. Where there is no future income tax liability, this amount is retained by the Commissioner as it represents tax in respect of which credits have already been allocated to shareholders. If this amount is not paid by the due date, the standard six-monthly incremental penalty at the rate of 10% will be incurred. Where the ICA is in debit at the end of the imputation year, imputation penalty tax is also payable (refer to the discussion on section 394N below). The Commissioner has power to assess the tax, and the taxpayer may object to the assessment in the usual way. Section 394M - Limits on refunds of tax In order to protect the revenue, the amount of credits attached to dividends in each imputation year should not exceed the credits in the ICA (after taking into account further income tax) as at the end of the imputation year. Where a company allocates credits in year 1 and in year 2 is entitled to a refund of income tax paid in year 1, the Commis- sioner would, if the company has a nil or debit balance in its ICA, effectively be refunding an amount which has already been passed on by way of credit to shareholders. Section 394M therefore imposes a limit on the amount of income tax which may be refunded to an ICA company. The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the credit balance in the ICA as at the previous 31 March. Any excess which is not refunded may be offset against a future income tax liability. Where there is no future income tax liability, the Commissioner will retain that amount. In this situation there is a debit entry in the ICA of the cash amount refunded to the company. There is no debit entry for the amount retained by the Commissioner. 9 Example ICA DrCrBal $$$ 7 July 19895,0005,000 7 November 1989 5,0000,000 7 March 19905,0005,000 15 March 199013,000 31 March 19902,000 3 September 1990 - refund owing 3,0002,000 The refund to the company is limited to $2,000 which is the amount of the debit entry in the ICA. The other $1,000 is retained by the Commissioner and can be credited against payment of provisional tax due in November 1990 or any subsequent in- come tax liability. Where there are two refunds paid in an imputation year, the amount of the credit balance in the ICA at the end of the previous imputation year is reduced for the purposes of calculating the amount of the second refund by the amount of the first refund. The reference in section 394M(3) to dividend withholding payment is of relevance where a company has no dividend with- holding payment account and dividend withholding payments and refunds thereof are entered in the ICA. Section 394N - Imputation penalty tax Where a company is in debit at the end of an imputation year imputation penalty lax is payable in addition to further income tax. Imputation penalty tax is intended to be a disincentive for a company to be in debit at year end. It is not a penalty for late payment of tax. The amount payable is 10 percent of the amount of further income tax payable (in other words, 10 percent of the debit balance at 31 March) and is due by the following 31 May. There are the standard late payment penalty provisions in the event that the imputation penalty tax is not paid by due date. As with further income tax, the imputation penalty may be assessed and a company can object to such an assessment in the normal way. Sections 394Q to 394ZB - Statutory Producer Boards and Co-operative companies These provisions are covered on pages 15 to 18. Section 394ZC - Income to include credits Where a shareholder receives a dividend with an imputation credit, or dividend withholding payment credit, attached, the shareholder must return the amount of the credit plus the amount of the dividend as assessable income (unless the shareholder is exempt from tax on dividends). For example, if there is a dividend paid of $1,000 to which $250 credits have been attached, $1,250 is included as assessable income and $250 claimed as a credit. The only exception to this is a notional distribution made by a producer board or co- operative company - refer to section 394ZC(2) and the commentary on page 16). Section 394ZC(3) and (4) merely retain the provisions previously in effect and contained in repealed section 4(6) and (7) relat- ing to the assessability of foreign imputation credits to which New Zealand residents are beneficially entitled under double tax treaties. Section 394ZD - Amount of credit This section limits the amount of credit to be allowed by the Commissioner in certain circumstances. 10 1. Trusts Beneficiary income In order to prevent the streaming of credits by trustees the amount of credit which will he allowed to a beneficiary who de- rives dividends with an imputation credit (or dividend withholding payment credit) attached is calculated in accordance with this formula: a x b c where a =all imputation and dividend withholding payment credits attached to dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the year b =all distributions (income and capital) made to the beneficiary during the year c =all distributions (income and capital) made to beneficiaries of the trust during the income year Effectively the amount of credit which will be allowed to each beneficiary is proportional to the distributions made to them during the year. Example Beneficiaries of Trust: A and B A receives all dividend income ($10,000 with $2,800 credits attached) B receives all interest income ($12,000) The amount of credit which be allowed to A is $2,800 x $10,000 = l ,272.73 $22,000 The remaining credits will be lost. Trustee income Where the dividends are retained by the trustee and taxed as trustee's income, the imputation credits are included in the as- sessable income of the trustee and allowable as a credit against the trustee’s tax liability. As group investment funds in so far as they derive category A income are treated as companies, the formula in section 394ZD(l)(a) which restricts the amount of credit which may be claimed by a beneficiary of a trust does not apply to group investment funds in so far as a beneficiary derives category A income (s394ZD(2)) 2. Partnerships There is a similar rule applying to partnerships. Where a partnership has derived dividend income with imputation credits (or withholding payment credits) attached, the amount of credit which will be allowed to a partner under section 394ZD(1) will be: a x b c wherea =the total of imputation and dividend withholding payment credits attached to received by the partners in an income year b =the partner’s share of the partnership income in that year c =the income of the partnership for the income year Example Partners A and B Partnership receives$5,000 dividend income ($1,000 credits attached) $11,000 other income 11 lf the income is split equally, the amount of credit allowed to both A and B will be $1,000 x 8,000 = 500 16,000 If, however, A receives$8,000 income (including all dividend income) B receives$8,000 income The amount of credit allowed to A will be 1,000 x 8,000 = 500 16,000 B will receive no credits (as he derived no dividend income). Therefore $500 of the credits are not available for use. 3. Exceeding imputation ratio - section .394ZD(1)(c), (d) and (e) Where a company attaches imputation (or dividend withholding payment credits) to a dividend at a higher ratio than is per- mitted, the amount of the credit allowed will be the amount calculated at the maximum ratio permitted (section 394ZD(1)(c) and (d)). For imputation credits the maximum ratio permitted is set out in section 394G (refer to page 6) while for dividend withholding payment credits the maximum ratio is set out in section 394ZY (refer to page 24). Where both types of credit are attached, the combined ratio also must not exceed company tax rate 1 - company tax rate Where it does, there is a formula in subsection (5) of section 394ZD for disallowing the excess credit. Firstly the dividend with- holding payment credit is reduced in so far as it extends, then, if there is still an excess credit, the imputation credit is reduced. 4. Failure to furnish shareholder dividend statement - section 394ZD(1)(f) and (g) In order to obtain a tax credit for imputation or dividend withholding payment credits attached to a dividend, the shareholder is required to file the shareholder dividend statement (or other evidence in writing of the credit) with the shareholder’s in- come tax return. Where the statement or other evidence is not filed the Commissioner will not allow the shareholder a credit of tax. 5. Insufficient tax paid - section 394ZD(1)(h) and (i) Where a company has attached an imputation credit and has not paid sufficient tax or further income tax, the Commissioner may disallow part of the credit of tax. As noted earlier, a company may during an imputation year attach credits for tax which it has not at that time paid. However, if it has not paid such tax by 31 March it must pay “further income tax” by 31 May (refer to page 8 above). Where the further income tax is not paid, the Commissioner may disallow credits attached to a dividend in that year. Where the tax is subsequently paid by the company, the Commissioner has power to reinstate credits (section 394ZE(6)). Similar rules apply where a company has attached dividend withholding payment credits to a dividend and the company has not paid sufficient dividend withholding payments. 6. Credit in excess of proper amount - section 394ZD(1)(h) and (i) Where the imputation credit or dividend withholding payment credit claimed by a shareholder is in excess of the proper amount, the Commissioner will not allow the claim to the extent of the excess. There is no definition of what constitutes an amount in excess of the proper amount but this would, for example, be where a shareholder has fraudulently altered the shareholder dividend statement so that it shows a higher credit than that attached to the dividend. 7. Stapled stock - section 394ZD(1)(j) There is an explanation of section 394ZF, which covers stapled stock on page 20. Briefly, where a company (company A) which cannot operate an ICA and pass credits to shareholders enters into a stapled stock arrangement so that its shareholders may receive credits from another company (company B), no credit of tax will be allowed for any credit attached to a dividend paid by company B to the shareholders of company A 12 8. Arrangement to obtain a tax advantage - 394ZD(1)(k) and (l) Where a shareholder has entered into a shareholder tax advantage arrangement, there is power in section 394ZG (refer to page 21 for an explanation of that provision) for the Commissioner to determine the amount of imputation or dividend withhold- ing payment credit which is the subject of the arrangement. No credit of tax is allowable in respect of that amount. Section 394ZE - Credit of Tax Where the assessable income of a taxpayer includes the amount of an imputation credit, the taxpayer may claim a credit of tax of an amount equal to the credit. Generally companies receiving dividends with imputation credits attached will therefore not claim a credit of tax but will enter the amount of the credits in the ICA. However, where a company is assessed on dividend income, e.g. a life insurance company, the company itself may claim a credit. As non-residents and tax-exempt bodies do not include the amount of a dividend in assessable income imputation credits do not give rise to a credit of tax in the hands of non-residents and tax-exempt bodies. This is in contrast to dividend withholding payment credits which do give rise to a credit of tax in the hands of non-residents and tax exempt bodies. There will be no refund of any unutilised imputation credits, but in order to enable the taxpayer to effectively carry forward the excess credits, those credits are converted into a loss which is carried forward to the succeeding income year of the tax- payer The amount of the loss which is to be carried forward is calculated using the formula in section 394ZE(3)(b) - i.e a bwhere a = the amount of unutilised imputation credits b = the extra emolument tax rate (for the income year in which the dividend is included in assessable income). Example 1989 income year$ Income from employment2,000 Dividend Income27,700(includes credits) Credits attached(7,700) Total income29,700 Tax payable (at, say, .24)7,128 Imputation credits7,700 Tax PayableNil Excess credits572- converted to loss c/f PAYE paid480- refunded Amount of Loss carried forward - 572 = 2,043 28 Note:Non-refundable credits are to be claimed before refundable credits. In the above example, therefore. PAYE credits are claimed after imputation credits. This is to give the taxpayer maximum benefit of the credit. Section 394ZF - Stapled stock There are businesses which pay New Zealand income tax but which are not permitted to operate an ICA and attach credits to dividends - for example a branch of a non-resident company. Where the non-resident company has New Zealand sharehold- ers, it may nevertheless want to pass on credit to those shareholders for New Zealand tax paid. It is possible to enter an ar- rangement whereby that non-resident company sets up a company in New Zealand and gives to its shareholders shares which are “stapled” to shares in the non-resident company. Such shares are “stapled” because they are allocated on the basis of shareholding in the non-resident company and may be disposed of only with those shares. An alternative arrangement is where the New Zealand company pays dividends to shareholders in the non-resident company by virtue of their shareholding in the non-resident company. Dividends may then be paid from the New Zealand company and imputation credits attached to the dividends. 13 Section 394ZF is intended to remove any incentive for companies to staple stock for this purpose. Where dividends with cred- its attached are paid by a resident company, as part of a stapled stock arrangement, those credits do not give rise to a credit of tax. (Neither do they form part of assessable income of the shareholder.) There is no provision for a credit entry reversing the debit which arose on attachment of credits in the ICA of the company paying the dividend. It is anticipated that the type of company which will institute such an arrangement will not be able to operate an ICA. Gener- ally therefore subsection (2)(c) will be of no effect. Section 394ZG - Tax Advantage arrangements This section has two purposes: 1. to prevent shareholders buying and selling shares in order to pass imputation (and dividend withholding payment) credits to those best able to use them, and 2. to prevent companies "streaming" credits to those shareholders best able to use them. The rationale for these anti-streaming provisions is that all shareholders have borne the company tax and the credits should be allocated to them all in proportion to their shareholding. In addition, if streaming is permitted, there is a greater cost to the Revenue in imputation. 1. Transfer of shares There is deemed to be an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage where (i)there is an arrangement for the sale of shares and (ii)the vendor or purchaser anticipates that a dividend with an imputation credit or dividend withholding payment credit attached would be paid in respect of the shares and (iii)the vendor or purchaser might expect that one of them will, and the other will not, be able to obtain a credit of tax in respect of the imputation or dividend withholding payment credits. The purpose of the arrangement to transfer the shares must be to enable the vendor or purchaser to obtain the credit of tax. Example Shareholder A - resident Shareholder B - non-resident Shareholder B, as a non-resident, cannot obtain a tax advantage (defined as including the allowance of a credit of tax under section 394ZE) because dividends received by B, although subject to non-resident withholding tax, are not included in his as- sessable income in New Zealand. It may therefore be in the interests of A and B to transfer the shares prior to payment of a dividend with credits attached for the purpose of enabling A to obtain the benefit of credits attached to the dividend which would have been paid to B. Where this occurs, the Commissioner may determine that the arrangement is a shareholder tax advantage arrangement - i.e. an arrangement which relates to the obtaining of an allowance of a tax credit - and the amount of the credit which is the sub- ject of the arrangement. So, in the above example if B transferred his share to A prior to payment of a dividend with a credit attached, and A therefore received in relation to each share $72 net dividend with $28 imputation credits attached, the Commissioner would determine that $28 was the subject of the arrangement. Under subsection (6) Shareholder A is not entitled to a credit of tax for that $28. 2. Streaming of imputation (and dividend withholding payment) credits Under sub-section 2(b) where a company streams the payment of dividends or the attachment of credits to those shareholders who can benefit from the receipt of credits the Commissioner has the powers set out in subsection (4). The principle may be illustrated in two examples. 1 Example 1 Shareholder A - resident Shareholder B - non-resident 14 A company with the above shareholders wishes to stream credits so that shareholder A receives all imputation credits (share- holder B receives payment in lieu of credits). In June 1990 the company pays dividends to A and B - the dividend to A carries the maximum credits and the dividend to B carries no credits. The company has, in terms of subsection (2)(b), streamed the attachment of imputation credits in such a way as will give a higher credit value to A (being a shareholder who will obtain a tax advantage from imputation credits) than to B (who will not obtain a tax advantage from credits). Section 394ZG(3) sets out a variety of circumstances where a dividend is deemed to have a higher credit value. For example, a dividend has a higher credit value than another dividend when - •the dividend has an imputation credit attached and the other dividend does not, •the imputation ratio of the dividend is higher than that of the other dividend. Therefore in this example there is an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. In exercising his powers under subsection (4), the Commissioner may determine, in relation to the above example: (a) That the arrangement is a shareholder tax advantage arrangement as the arrangement relates to the obtaining of a credit of tax under section 394ZE: (if the shareholders are both companies, it will be a “company tax advantage” arrangement); (b) that there should arise in the ICA of the company a further debit; (c) that the amount of the imputation credit which is the subject of the arrangement is $28, being the amount of credit which should have been attached to the dividend to B so that all dividends were credited equally during the imputation year, (d) that the arrangement occurred in the imputation year ending on March 31, 1991. When the Commissioner has so determined, then a further debit of $28 arises in the ICA of the company at the end of the imputation year in which the arrangement occurred. Example 2 Shareholder A - resident Shareholder B - tax-exempt A company with the above shareholders pays a $720 dividend in the 1990 imputation year to shareholder A only with $280 credits attached. In the 1991 imputation year it pays an uncredited dividend to shareholder B only. In 1992 the company pays to A a further $720 dividend with $280 credits attached. The company has in this example “streamed the payment of dividends” and “the attachment of credits” “over more than one imputation year” “in such a way as will give higher credit values to shareholders who will obtain a tax advantage therefrom than to shareholders who will not so obtain a tax advantage”. The dividend paid to A has a higher credit value than the dividend paid to B because the dividend paid to A had an imputa- tion credit attached and the other did not. It is not possible to avoid the application of subsection (2)(b) by crediting the dividend to B at a lower rate than the dividend to A. In that circumstance, the imputation ratio of the dividend to A is higher than that of the dividend to B The dividend therefore has a higher credit value (subsection (3)(b)). As with example 1, this is therefore an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage and the Commissioner may determine: (a) that it is a shareholder tax advantage arrangement (b) that there should arise a debit in the ICA of the company (c) the amount of the credit which is the subject of the arrangement is $280 (d) the arrangement occurred in 1991. A further debit of $280 will arise to the ICA of the company at the end of the 1991 imputation year (see section 394E(1)(h)). The Commissioner is required to advise the company of the determination he makes under subsection (4). Section 394ZH - Credits and Debits incorrectly recorded The Commissioner may, either on investigation of a company or following receipt of the annual imputation return, check the entries recorded in the ICA. Where the Commissioner considers that -an incorrect amount has been recorded, or -a date of an entry is not correct or -there is an entry omitted from the ICA 15 the Commissioner may determine the correct amount and date of the entry as appropriate. Where he does so the amount is to be recorded in the ICA of the company along with any necessary corrections made as a result of the Commissioner’s determination. Any such amount is to be recorded in the ICA with effect from the date the origi- nal credit or debit arose or is determined to have arisen. The company may object to the notice of determination. Sections .394ZI and 394ZJ - Transitional 1. Credit for provisional tax paid before 16 December 1988 A credit arises in the ICA for provisional tax and income tax paid by the company for the 1989 and subsequent income years. Early balancing companies will have paid provisional tax prior to I April 1988 - where this occurs the credit arises on 1 April 1988. Payments of provisional and income tax for the 1989 year which are made prior to the enactment of the legislation (16 Decem- ber 1988) are credited to the ICA on the date of payment. 2. Dividends paid before 1 February 1989 A company may, prior to 31 March 1989, determine that an imputation credit will be retrospectively attached to a dividend or dividends paid between 1 April 1988 and 31 January 1989. Where the company so determines, it must (a)Debit the ICA, as at the date of payment of the dividend, with the amount of the credit attached (b)Complete the company dividend statement at the time it makes the determination, and (c)Give to the shareholder a shareholder dividend statement at the time it makes the determination. The allocation rules apply in the first year in the same way as they do for any other year. Therefore if a company determines to retrospectively attach credits to a dividend, it must attach credits at the same imputation ratio to all dividends paid during the imputation year ending on 31 March 1989. It may, however, complete a ratio change declaration in accordance with sec- tion 394G. Section 394J requires this to be filed by 31 March 1989 (this date was originally 7 February 1989 but the date was amended in the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989). Where, of course, a company would not have been an ICA company at the time it paid the dividend, it is not permitted to retrospectively credit the dividend. Sections 394Q to 394V - Statutory Producer Boards Statutory producer boards are now liable for income tax (refer to Technical Policy Circular 89/2 Part II) and dividend with- holding payment on foreign source dividends. As statutory producer boards do not have conventional shareholding structures, special provision must be made to enable them to impute to their members credits for income tax (and dividend withholding payment) paid by them. Statutory producer board is defined in section 394Q and basically means any primary producer or marketing board estab- lished by an Act. A member of a board is defined as any person resident in New Zealand who, during an income year in question, carries on any farming or agricultural or other business and who is liable to pay a levy to the board, or who supplies produce to the board, during the year. A statutory producer board is deemed to be a company for the purposes of the Act and is therefore required to maintain an ICA for each imputation year. Credits and debits arise to the account as they do for other companies under sections 394D and 394E of the Act. Under section 394R a statutory producer board can distribute credits to members in one of two ways - by means of 1. a notional dividend 2. a cash dividend A determination to do so must be made within 6 months after the year of determination in respect of which the determination is made (section 394R(3)). A “year of determination” is defined as an income year that commences on or after 1 April 1988. 16 1. Notional dividend The producer board may allocate imputation credits to members on the basis of (a)the proportion of produce transactions of the member to all produce transactions during the year of determination, or (b)the proportion of levies which a member paid to the amount of levies paid by all members, or (c)a combination of (a) and (b), or (d)any other method approved by the Commissioner. In relation to paragraph (d) above, the Commissioner will approve an alternative method of allocation on a case by case basis upon application by a producer board. Section 394T provides the respective formulae for allocation of credits to be attached to a notional distribution in relation to a member of the board on the basis of produce transactions of a member or levies paid by a member. The Commissioner has power to determine the extent to which a board should have made the calculation on another basis if he considers that a calculation made by a board does not result in a fair and reasonable allocation - section 394T(4). Example - (a) allocation on basis of produce transactions Producer Board with two members: A - $1,000 of produce transactions during year ending 30 June 1990 B - $2,000 of produce transactions during year ending 30 June 1990 Formula in section 394T(2) a x c b a = amount paid to or by the member for produce transactions during the year b = amount paid to or by all members for produce transactions during the year c = all imputation credits which the producer board has determined to attach to the notional distribution If the producer board has $1,500 credits in its ICA which it wishes to allocate to members, it calculates the amount of credit to be allocated to each member as follows: A1,000 x 1,500 = 500 3,000 B2,000 x 1,500 = 1,000 3,000 Where the producer board determines to attach a credit to a notional dividend, it is deemed to have paid a dividend to each member of the following amount: a b wherea = the amount of imputation credit attached b = the resident companies’ tax rate (for the income year in which the determination is made) So, in the example above, on the basis of a company tax rate of 28%, the notional dividend paid to member A would be 500 = $1,785.71 28 Member A will therefore receive a “notional” dividend of $1,785.71 with 500 credits attached - this is a dividend carrying the maximum imputation ratio. (As all notional dividends will be fully credited the allocation rules in section 394G do not apply to producer boards.) 17 A will receive no cash (hence the term “notional” dividend), merely a shareholder dividend statement. The dividend is de- rived on the date of the determination by the producer board and must be included in the member’s assessable income for that year. Note:In all circumstances other than the receipt of a notional dividend, a non-corporate shareholder returns as assessable income the dividend received plus the imputation credit attached. In the case of a notional dividend, the amount of the no- tional dividend already includes the credit. Imputation credits attached to notional dividends are therefore not added to the notional dividend paid in returning assessable income. Member A will return $1,785.71 as income and claim $500 credits. As noted earlier, this is a means of allowing imputation credits for tax paid by the producer board to flow through to the member. If member A is on a tax rate which is higher than the company tax rate he/she will receive no cash and will be required to pay additional tax on that notional dividend. For those on the company tax rate, or a lower rate, there will be no additional liabil- ity. When the cash which was represented by that notional dividend is subsequently distributed, it is distributed tax-free to mem- bers (section 4A(1)(j)) - this is because, of course, tax has already been assessed to a member on that amount. However, the amount which is paid to the member cannot be an amount which is deductible to the producer board - section 4A(5) deems such a distribution to be a return of capital for the purposes of section 106(1)(a) which prohibits a deduction for capital. Pro- ducer boards are required to keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to determine whether an amount which is distributed is an amount which was represented by a notional distribution. Producer boards are not required to file company dividend statements but section 394U(3) requires that they furnish with the annual income tax return particulars of the dividend deemed to have been paid. 2. Cash Distributions The second method which a producer board may adopt for passing on imputation or dividend withholding payment credits to members is to attach the credits to a cash distribution which would have been deductible to the board but which the board has elected to treat as non-deductible. (To allow a company to attach imputation credits to an amount which is deductible is effectively to allow credit for tax not paid.) The amount of the distribution which the producer board elects to treat as non-deductible is deemed for the purposes of the Act to be a dividend. It will be derived by the member when it is received. The producer board may elect to make a cash distribution to all who were members at any time during year X based on: (i)the proportion of a member’s produce transactions with the board to the total produce transactions, or (ii)the proportion that levies payable by each member bear to the total levies payable by all members of the board, or (iii)any other method approved by the Commissioner. The formula for calculating the amount of imputation credits which may be attached to a cash distribution is set out in section 394S: a x b 1 - b wherea = the amount of the cash distribution b = the resident companies’ tax rate (for the year in which the determination is made) Example In July 1989 a producer board wishes to allocate credits to a total cash distribution of $900 made to members of the producer board during the year ended 30 June 1989. The cash distribution would have been deductible under the Income Tax Act but the producer board elects to treat this amount as non-deductible in determining its assessable income. The amount of credits which may be attached to the distribution (on the basis of a company tax rate of 28%) is 900 x .28 = 350 72 Member A in that year was paid $1,000 in produce transactions Member B in that year was paid $2,000 in produce transactions Member A is to receive $600 Member B is to receive $300 18 The amount of credit to be allocated to each member is calculated according to the formula in section 394S(2): c x e d Wherec = the member's share of the cash distribution d = the total amount of the cash distribution e = the amount of imputation credits attached in respect of the cash distribution Member A therefore receives600 x 350 = 233.33 900 A receives a $600 cash distribution with $233.33 credits attached S/he will return $833.33 (distribution plus credits) as assessable income and claim $233.33 credit of tax. Member B receives300 x 350 = 116.66 900 B receives a $300 cash distribution with $116.66 credits attached. S/he will return as income $416.66 and claim a credit of $116.66. Section 394W to 394ZB - Co-operative companies There are provisions for co-operative companies which parallel sections 394Q to 394V applying to producer boards. In addition to being able to allocate credits to members by attaching them to notional distributions and cash distributions, co- operative companies which are imputation credit account companies and dividend withholding payment account compa- nies may pay dividends and attach credits thereto in the normal way. In relation to allocation rules, these apply only to attachment of credits to those dividends which are not notional distribu- tions or cash distributions, i.e. dividends which are paid in proportion to shareholding in, rather than transactions with, the co-operative company. As with producer boards, notional and cash distributions are fully credited. The other difference is that co-operative companies are only entitled once in respect of each year of determination to attach a credit to a notional distribution and/or a cash distribution. 19 PART B : DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENT REGIME - FOREIGN SOURCE DIVIDENDS The dividend withholding payment regime is contained in Part XIIB of The Act and is in two parts - dividend withholding payments and dividend withholding payment accounts. It was introduced in order to counter deferral of tax on foreign source dividends. It is not a tax on the company: the company deducts and pays the withholding payment on behalf of the share- holder. A. DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS Section 394ZK- Interpretation This section provides various definitions for the purpose of the withholding payment regime. There is comment upon relevant definitions where these are used in the substantive sections. Section 394ZL - Deduction in respect of foreign withholding payment dividend In broad terms, where a company resident in New Zealand is paid a dividend from a non-resident company on or after 1 April 1988, it is required to deduct an amount of dividend withholding payment (DWP) from that dividend. “Paid” is defined for the purposes of Part XIIB of the Act and includes “...distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interest of or on behalf of ...”. Liability to make DWP arises when the dividend is paid by the foreign company and not when that divi- dend is received. Section 394ZL(2) sets out in detail the type of dividends in respect of which a deduction is to be made. It applies to dividends received which are exempt from tax under section 63 of the Act and which are (a)paid by a non-resident company or (b)paid by a resident company which is not subject to tax on part or all of its income under a double taxation agreement or (c)paid by a resident company where the company previously was not resident and had, prior to becoming resident, more funds available for distribution than the amount of the dividend. This is to prevent overseas companies changing residence to New Zealand and then paying dividends from sums accumulated overseas. These dividends are referred to as "foreign withholding payment dividends, or "foreign dividends". The restricted definition of dividends which applies for the purpose of attaching imputation and dividend withholding pay- ment credits to dividends does not apply in determining which dividends are subject to the dividend withholding payment deduction (see section 394ZK(2)). Section 394ZM - Dividend withholding payment to be deducted 1. Amount to be deducted The formula for calculating the amount to be deducted from a foreign dividend is set out in subsection (I) - (a x b) - c wherea = the amount of the foreign dividend paid including any foreign withholding tax (FWT) deducted from that dividend b = the rate of resident companies’ income tax for the income year in which the dividend is received c = the amount of foreign withholding tax (not exceeding a x b) The amount of DWP payable is reduced by any FWT that has been deducted. For this purpose the Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) payable in the United Kingdom is not regarded as FWT. Example Dividend received in March 1989 of $100 gross (consisting of $85 cash and $15 FWT deducted) Amount of DWP to be deducted:(100 x .28) -15 =13 If the dividend was received on or after 1 April 1989, then the amount of DWP would be: (100 x .33) -15 =18 The formula can at most give a Nil result and never a negative amount. So that if $100 gross ($30 FWT deducted) is received the amount to be deducted is: (100 x .28) - 28 = 0 for a dividend paid on or before 31 March 1989. If the dividend was paid on or after 1 April 1989, the DWP to be deducted would be: (100 x .33) - 30 = 3 20 If a company which receives foreign dividends is a Branch Equivalent Tax Account company, refer to paragraph 2 below. 2. Branch Equivalent Tax Account (BETA) Company The branch equivalent tax regime is referred to in detail in Part C of this Commentary. However, for the purposes of section 394ZM it is sufficient to say that a company which has an income interest in a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) under the international tax regime may operate a branch equivalent tax account. The purpose of operating the account is to prevent double taxation of income - once under the branch equivalent tax regime and also through the dividend withholding payment regime, when dividends are distributed from the CFC to the New Zealand company. Tax paid under the CFC tax regime is a credit to the BETA. Under section 394ZM(2) where a company which operates a BETA is paid a dividend in respect of an income interest in a CFC, the amount to be deducted as dividend withholding payment can be reduced by an amount of up to the credit balance in its BETA at the time the foreign dividend is paid (see section 394ZZQ(3)). When a dividend withholding payment is reduced in this manner, the amount of the reduction is debited to BETA and there is no entry in the dividend withholding payment ac- count. Example Company is paid in April 1989 gross dividend of $100 (15% NRWT deducted) DWP payable = ($100 x .33) -15 = $18 If the company has a credit balance of at least $18 in its BETA at the time the dividend is paid by the CFC, it may use this to satisfy payment of DWP. There arises a debit to BETA of $18. A credit of $18 simultaneously arises in the company’s ICA (section 394D(1)(i)). Subsection (3) of section 394ZM sets out in detail in what circumstances a dividend paid to a company is deemed to have been paid in respect of an income interest in a CFC. This is basically where the company held the interest in the CFC - (i)during the income year before the year in which the dividend was paid, or (ii)between the beginning of the income year in which the dividend was paid and the date of payment of the dividend. Under subsection (4) evidence of payment of foreign withholding tax that reduces the DWP deduction is required to be fur- nished to the Commissioner having regard to the time period stated in section 301 of the Act. Section 394ZN - Payment of Dividend Withholding Payment A company which is liable to make a deduction on receipt of a foreign dividend is required to pay the amount of the deduc- tion on a quarterly basis. Companies which have received foreign dividends during a quarter are required to pay the amount of the deductions made to the Commissioner within 14 days of the end of the quarter. "Quarter" is a defined term and is the period ending with the last day of March, June, September and December in each year. Payments are therefore due on 14th January, April, July and October in each year. Companies in loss There is provision in subsection (2) for companies in a tax loss position to reduce the loss carried forward in lieu of paying the dividend withholding payment on foreign dividends. There are two circumstances in which a company may reduce its loss: (a)Where a company has incurred a loss in a previous income year which may be set off against income derived during the year in which it received the foreign dividend, or (b)Where a company has reason to believe that it will incur a loss for the income year in which the dividend is received. If it chooses to reduce its loss, the company must notify the Commissioner by the 14th of the month following the quarter in which the foreign source dividend was received (i.e. the standard payment date for DWP) of its election to reduce its loss in lieu of making the withholding payment. The formula for calculating the amount by which the loss is to be reduced is: a b wherea = the amount of dividend withholding payment payable b = the resident companies’ tax rate (for the income year in which the dividend was received). Under subsection (3), where the company elects to reduce a current year loss and the company does not incur a loss or does not incur a loss large enough to enable it to reduce the loss in satisfaction of a liability for dividend withholding payment, the 21 Commissioner has the power to disallow the election. The company is then required to pay the dividend withholding pay- ment in respect of which the election has been disallowed plus late payment penalties. The penalty for late payment of divi- dend withholding payment is set out in subsection (4) and is the standard six-monthly incremental at 10%. Subsection (5) provides that where a company fails to deduct DWP the amount of the DWP liability constitutes a debt payable to the Commissioner and is deemed to be payable within 14 days of the end of the quarter in which the initial liability arose. Subsection (6) allows the Commissioner to recover an amount equal to the foreign withholding tax that reduced the amount of any DWP where evidence of the foreign withholding tax has not been furnished within the period required under section 394ZM(4). The Commissioner has the powers of assessment referred to in subsection (7). Section 394ZO - Refunds 1. Restriction on amount of refund Where a company has overpaid dividend withholding payment, it is entitled to a refund. However, there are similar restric- tions on refunds as apply to refunds of income tax to an ICA company. Where during imputation year X a company becomes entitled to a refund of dividend withholding payment paid in year X-1 (i.e. the previous imputation year), the refund is not to exceed: . : (a)the amount of the credit balance in the dividend withholding payment account (DWPA) at the end of year X-1 (b)where the company has no DWPA, the credit balance in the ICA at the end of year X-1. Where the company which is entitled to a refund has ceased to be resident in New Zealand, the refund cannot exceed the amount of the credit balance that was debited in the DWPA or ICA immediately before the company became non-resident (that is the amount debited under sections 394ZW(1)(g) and 394E(l)(i)). The amount of any credit balance in the DWPA or ICA available at the end of year X-1 is reduced by the amount of any previ- ous refund of DWP or income tax (as appropriate) in year X. 2. Refunds to company in loss Where a company that has paid dividend withholding payment in income year X incurs a loss in that year and has filed a re- turn for that year, the company is entitled to a refund of the lesser of: (a)the amount of dividend withholding payment paid during year X, or (b)a x b wherea = the amount of the loss b = the resident company tax rate for year X, or (c)the amount of the credit in the DWPA at the end of the previous imputation year. Example A company in the imputation year ended March 1990 pays DWP of $1000. It incurs a loss of $2,000 for the 1990 income year and has a $500 credit balance in its DWPA at 31 March 1990. It will receive a refund of the lesser of: (a)$1,000 (b)$2,000 x .33 = $660 (c)$500 22 Where a company is paid a refund of DWP because it has a tax loss, the amount of the company's loss is reduced by an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a b wherea = the refund paid to the company b = the resident companies tax rate Where the Commissioner does refund an amount of DWP in excess of the proper amount, he may recover the excess as if it were income tax payable by the company. Section 394ZP - Credit of tax for dividend withholding payment (DWP) credit This provision parallels section 394ZE in relation to imputation credits. Where the assessable income of a taxpayer includes the amount of a DWP credit, the taxpayer obtains a credit of tax equal to the amount included. The credit of tax is credited in payment of income tax payable in respect of the income year in which the dividend is paid to the recipient and the excess is refundable . In this respect a DWP credit differs from an imputation credit. As the DWP credit is refundable, it is credited to income tax payable after non-refundable credits such as imputation credits and credits for overseas tax. The shareholder must, in order to obtain the credit of tax, furnish the shareholder dividend statement or other written evi- dence of the DWP credit. Where a company has paid insufficient DWP, or further DWP, to support the credits which it has allocated during a year the Commissioner has power to disallow the credits. If the DWP is subsequently paid, the Commissioner may reinstate the cred- its. As provided in the imputation regime, subsections (6), (7) and (8) provide the Commissioner with the power to disallow DWP credits and recover refunds where a taxpayer has claimed DWP credits in excess of the proper amount. Section 394ZD applies also to DWP credits. The amount of DWP credit which the shareholder may claim can be restricted in certain circumstances (refer to page 16 of this commentary). Section 394ZQ - Refunds to non-residents and tax exempts As noted above, unutilised DWP credits are refundable. This section provides the mechanism of refund to the two groups of shareholders who do not ordinarily file income tax returns. Where a non-resident shareholder receives DWP credits attached to a dividend, these credits are automatically applied to sat- isfy liability for non-resident withholding tax on the dividend. The shareholder may apply for a refund of any surplus credits after 31 May following the end of the imputation year in which the dividend was received. Example $ Cash dividend paid720 DWP credits attached280 Gross dividend1,000 NRWT (15%)150 DWP credits(280) DWP credits refund130 Amount received by non-resident shareholder: Cash dividend720 Credits refunded130 850 For a non-resident the position is the same as if a dividend of $1,000 had been paid with 15% NRWT deducted - the non-resident would receive cash of $850. 23 The company makes no payment of NRWT (see section 311(2)). The $280 credits have been used to satisfy the NRWT liability ($150), the balance is refunded to the shareholder. If the dividend was paid in, say, May or August 1989, the non-resident cannot apply to the Commissioner before 31 May 1990 for a refund. This delay is to enable the Commissioner to have the opportunity to confirm that payments of DWP have been made sufficient to support the credits allocated. In order to obtain a refund the non-resident must forward the shareholder dividend statement or other evidence of the credit using, in the case of individuals, a form IR 3NR or an income tax return, to show details of all income derived from New Zea- land during the relevant income year as well as the DWP credits attached to dividends. A tax exempt shareholder or a non-resident corporate shareholder may apply for a refund by forwarding a written applica- tion or a company income tax return attaching the shareholder dividend statement or other evidence of the dividend with- holding payment credit. Any application by a non-resident for a refund of dividend withholding payment credit should be made to the District Commissioner Inland Revenue Department Private Bag DUNEDIN Section 394ZS - Offences This provision specifically makes it an offence to fail to deduct DWP or to fail to pay the same to the Commissioner. It is, how- ever, under subsection (3) a defence to a charge of failure to pay that the amount of the deduction has been accounted for and the delay was due to accident or other cause beyond the control of the company. 2. DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENT ACCOUNTS To a large extent the provisions relating to dividend withholding payment accounts (DWPAs) mirror those for the imputation credit accounts (ICAs). It should be noted that there are several provisions which are contained in Part XIIA (relating to imputation credits) which apply to DWP credits - in particular sections 394ZD and 394ZG. Refer to the explanation of those sections on pages 9 and 13. Section 394ZT - Election to maintain dividend withholding payment account It is not mandatory for a company to operate a DWPA - it may elect to do so by notifying the Commissioner that it has so elected within 21 days of the election or such further time as the Commissioner may allow. A company which operates a DWPA is a “dividend withholding payment account company” (refer to this definition in section 394ZK). The DWPA will run from the date of election for that and subsequent imputation years. The advantage for companies in operating a DWPA is that they are able to attach DWP credits, which are refundable, to divi- dends paid. If therefore a company has non-resident or tax-exempt shareholders or shareholders on marginal tax rates lower than the company rate and is making dividend withholding payments or receiving dividends with DWP credits attached, it will be in the interests of those shareholders for the company to operates a DWPA. If it does not do so, entries which relate to the dividend withholding payment regime are made in the ICA and the resulting imputation credits will not be refundable. A company may subsequently elect that it will cease to be an DWPA company. An election to cease to be a DWPA company will apply from the commencement of the imputation year succeeding the year in which the election to cease is made. Section 394ZU - Dividend withholding payment account A company operating a DWPA is to record: -the opening balance of the account in each year (as the account is operated for each imputation year, this will be done as at 1 April in each year) and -debits and credits to the account as they arise under sections 394ZV and 394ZW. Section 394ZV - Credits arising to the DWPA The following credits arise to the DWPA: 1.The amount of dividend withholding payment paid to the Commissioner. The credit arises on the date of payment. No credit will arise where a company elects, under section 394ZN, to reduce a loss in lieu of paying a dividend withholding payment. 2.The amount of a DWP credit attached to a dividend received by a company. This arises on the date the dividend was paid to the company. 24 3.The amount of ‘further dividend withholding payment’ paid to the Commissioner (refer to page 26 for an explanation of this). This is credited to the DWPA on the date of payment. 4.The amount of any previous debit to the DWPA which has arisen as a result of the Commissioner determining that there has been a tax advantage arrangement (refer to commentary on section 394ZG on page 13) and where it is subsequently established that there was no such arrangement. The credit arises on the date the previous debit arose. Section 394ZW - Debits arising to the DWPA The following debits arise to the DWPA: 1.The amount of DWP credits attached to a dividend paid by the company. This debit arises on the date that the dividend is paid. 2.Any part of the credit balance of the account at year end which the company elects to transfer to the ICA (refer to section 394ZZE). This arises at the end of the imputation year. 3.Any refund of dividend withholding payment. This arises on the date of payment of the refund. 4.The amount of any allocation deficit debit. The allocation rules in relation to the dividend withholding payment regime are similar to those for imputation - for a detailed explanation of the relevant provisions in section 394ZY see page 40. In brief, the DWP ratio (i e. the DWP credit/net dividend paid) is to be the same for all dividends paid by the company dur- ing an imputation year. An allocation deficit debit arises on 31 March of the imputation year in which the company was in breach of the allocation rules. 5.Where there has been a tax advantage arrangement under section 394ZG, the amount which the Commissioner determines has been the subject of the arrangements. This arises at the end of the year in which the arrangement occurred or commenced. 6.Where the same persons cease to hold directly or indirectly 75% entitlement to the profits that may be distributed by the company, a debit arises at the time there ceases to be the required continuity of shareholding. See below for a detailed ex- planation of these provisions. 7.Where the company ceases to be a DWPA company a debit arises of the amount of the credit balance immediately before it ceases to be a DWPA company. Loss of Continuity Sections 394ZW(1)(f) and 394ZW(3) and (4) parallel sections 394E(1)(g) and 394E(3) and 394E(4) which apply the loss of con- tinuity rules to companies which operate an ICA. The problem which led to introduction of loss of continuity provisions in relation to the ICA - to prevent the sale of imputa- tion credit trap companies - also applies to the DWPA. The rules are the same as those detailed in relation to the ICA on page 6 of this commentary. Section 394ZX - Attachment of dividend withholding payment credit A DWPA company may attach a DWP credit to a dividend paid by the company. For this purpose, “dividend” does not in general include non-cash dividends or dividends for which a deduction is allowed under the Act (refer to the definition of “dividend” in section 394A). A transitional provision provides for retrospective attachment of credits to a dividend paid during the period commencing 1 April 1988 and ending before 1 February 1989. Section 394ZY - Allocation rules Section 394ZY is a provision paralleling section 394G which relates to attachment of imputation credits (Refer to pages 10 and 11 for a detailed explanation of section 394G). References to imputation credits and imputation ratio should be read as divi- dend withholding payment credits and dividend withholding payment ratio (both of which are terms defined in section 394ZK). Where a company is in breach of the allocation rules (i.e. where it has changed the dividend withholding payment ratio with- out filing a ratio change declaration) an allocation deficit debit arises to the DWPA. It is calculated in the same manner as the allocation deficit debit which arises to the ICA. These allocation rules do not apply to notional and cash dividends paid by statutory producer board and co-operative compa- nies - refer to page 15 for an explanation of the provisions which apply to those bodies. Section 394ZZ - Dividend with both imputation and withholding payment credits attached Where a company attaches to a dividend both imputation and withholding payment credits the combined imputation and dividend withholding payment ratio (defined in section 394ZK) is not to exceed 25 a 1 - a where a = the resident company tax rate for the income year. For the year ending 31 March 1989 therefore, the combined ratio cannot exceed 28/72. With the recent change in the company tax rate to 33 cents from the 1990 income year the maximum ratio allowed will be 33/67 in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 April 1989. Where a company attaches credits so that this ratio is exceeded there is a formula in subsection (2) for calculating those credits which are excess and will be disallowed. The excess credits will be disallowed in the manner provided in section 394ZD(5) (refer to the commentary thereon at page 18). Section 394ZZA - Company dividend statement Where a company which operates a DWPA attaches a DWP credit to a dividend, the company is to include the information listed in section 394ZZA in the company dividend statement which it completes at the time of declaring a dividend (refer to section 394H and the commentary thereon at page 9). Section 394ZZB - Shareholder Dividend Statement Where a DWPA company attaches a DWP credit to a dividend, it must at the time of payment either: (a)if it is attaching an imputation credit to the dividend and therefore is sending to the shareholder a shareholder dividend statement (see section 394I and commentary on page 7), include in the statement the information listed in subsection (1) relating to DWP credits; (b)if there is no imputation credit attached to the dividend, give to the shareholder a shareholder dividend statement in a form approved by the Commissioner setting out the details listed in section 394ZZB(2). Section 394ZZC - Annual dividend withholding payment account return Every DWPA company is required to give to the Commissioner by 31 May immediately following the end of each imputation year an annual dividend withholding payment account return. The return sets out the opening and closing balance of the DWPA together with the amount and source of all debits and credits that have arisen during the year. In addition the following items should be included: -The amount of further dividend withholding payment payable in respect of the imputation year; -The amount of DWP penalty tax payable (this should be 100% of the amount of further dividend withholding payment) -A statement showing whether the company has elected to cease being a DWPA company. -The amount and source of all foreign withholding payment dividends paid to the company during the year and the amount of foreign withholding tax paid in respect of that dividend. Section 394ZZD - Dividend Withholding Payment Account Return Required upon Request or Cessation The Commissioner has power to require a company to file a DWPA return for any period. Where a company becomes non-resident it must file a return for the period up to the date it became non-resident within 2 months of becoming non-resident. Such returns are to contain the information listed in section 394ZZC in respect of the period to which the return relates. Section 394ZZE - Transfer of credit balance to ICA A company with a credit balance in its DWPA at year end (or a credit balance at the date it ceases to be resident) may transfer credits to the ICA. It may wish to do this in order to prevent the ICA from being in debit as at 31 March if it has allocated excess credits from its ICA during the year, and does not wish to pay an instalment of income tax or to pay further income tax at 31 March. 26 Section 394ZZF - Further dividend withholding payment payable This provision operates in the same way as section 394L which relates to further income tax payable in respect of an end of year debit in the ICA (refer to page 8). A DWPA company may, during an imputation year, allocate credits to dividends in anticipation of credits subsequently ris- ing to the DWPA. It may therefore be in debit at 31 March. Where this occurs, the company is required to pay an amount of “further dividend withholding payment” equal to the amount of debit balance in the account at 31 March. This must be paid to the Commissioner by the following 31 May. The amount of further dividend withholding payment may be used to reduce payment of any DWP for which the company becomes liable after the date of payment of the further dividend withholding payment. Where, however, there is no further dividend withholding payment liability that amount is retained by the Commissioner. This is because the DWP credits have already been allocated to shareholders. Where a company with a debit balance ceases to be resident, it is required to square up the DWPA before it ceases to be resi- dent by a payment of further dividend withholding payment on the date it ceases to be resident. This may be one instance in which the further dividend withholding payment is retained by the Commissioner. There are the standard late payment penalties applying to further dividend withholding payment. The Commissioner has the power to assess the DWP and the company may object to the assessment in the normal way. Section 394ZZG - Dividend withholding payment penalty tax Where a DWPA company is in debit at the end of an imputation year, and is liable for further dividend withholding payment, it will also be liable to pay dividend withholding payment penalty tax. This will be an amount equal to 10% of the debit bal- ance in the WPA at 31 March. It is not a late payment penalty, but is intended to operate as a disincentive to companies being in debit at year end The payment of DWP penalty tax is also due by 31 May following the end of the imputation year for which it is payable. There are the standard late payment penalties applicable to payment of DWP penalty tax. Example DWPA DrCr $ April 19892,000 May 19893,000\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Balance 31 March 19901,000 The company is required by 31 May 1990 to pay $1,000 further dividend withholding payment, plus $100 DWP penalty tax. If the payment is not received until 30 June 1990, the company will be liable for $1,000 further dividend withholding payment $100 penalty by way of additional tax $100 DWP penalty tax $10 penalty by way of additional tax Section 394ZZH - Remissions and refunds of DWP penalty tax The Commissioner has power to remit DWP penalty tax in certain circumstances: 1.where liability for the penalty tax has arisen because the Commissioner has determined that there has been a tax avoidance arrangement, and it is subsequently established that there was no such arrangement; 2.where the DWP penalty tax arose because the Commissioner had posted to the company a refund of DWP which it had not received at 31 March. The debit to the DWPA for a refund of DWP arises on the date it is paid by the Commissioner - so a debit may arise on, say, 31 March and the company may not be aware of this until some days later. Late payment penalties for the DWP penalty tax are also remitted. There still arises a liability for further dividend withholding payment in the second instance. In the first case, late payment penalties for the further dividend withholding payment for which the company would have been liable are also remitted. There will be no further DWP payable if the original debit entry is reversed by a credit entry under section 394ZV(1)(d) (see page 24). 27 Section 394ZZI- Application of other parts This provision extends other Parts of the Act, so far as applicable, to dividend withholding payment penalty tax. Section 394ZZJ - Debits and Credits Incorrectly Recorded The Commissioner has power where a credit or debit has been incorrectly recorded or omitted from the DWPA to determine the amount of the credit or debit arising to the account. The relevant debit or credit is deemed to be the amount determined by the Commissioner and to have arisen on the date deter- mined by him. The Commissioner is required to give notice of the determination to the company. The company may object to the determina- tion. Section 394ZZK - Dividend paid before 1 February 1989 A DWP company which paid a dividend between 1 April 1988 and 31 January 1989 may retrospectively attach a DWP credit to that dividend. It must make the determination to do so by 31 March 1989. Where a company so determines, it must: (a)Debit the DWPA, as at the date of payment of the dividend, with the amount of the credit attached; (b)Complete the company dividend statement, and give to the shareholder a shareholder dividend statement, at the time it makes the determination. The allocation rules apply to the year ended 31 March 1989 as they do to any other year. Therefore all dividends paid during the year must have DWP credits attached at the same DWP ratio. Subsection (4) requires any ratio change declaration in respect of dividends paid during the transitional period (1 April 1988 to 31 January 1989) to be filed by 31 March 1989. Section 394ZZL - Dividend received before 16 December 1988 Where a company received a foreign dividend on or after 1 April 1988 but before 16 December 1988 it was not liable to deduct dividend withholding payment from the dividend in accordance with the normal rules for deduction of DWP. However, dividend withholding payment in respect of all foreign dividends received during the quarters ended June, Sep- tember and December 1988 were to be made to the Commissioner not earlier than 16 December 1988 and not later than 14 Feb- ruary 1989 as if such deductions had been made. 28 PART C - BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS In brief, under the international tax regime, New Zealand resident individuals, companies and other entities with an income interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC) are liable to pay tax on a branch equivalent basis - i.e. they pay tax on the in- come of the CFC as if it were a branch. If the income of the CFC is subsequently distributed as a dividend to the New Zealand taxpayer there will be double taxation on that income. For a company, this arises because companies are liable for dividend withholding payment on foreign source dividends. For individuals and trusts there is double taxation - firstly under the branch equivalent regime and then when the dividend is returned as assessable income. The operation of a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) is intended to prevent such double taxation. Part XIIC of the Act provides for the maintenance of a BETA. Section 394ZZM - Interpretation The terms defined for the purposes of the imputation and dividend withholding payment regimes have the same meanings for the purposes of Part XIIC. The following sections deal separately with BETA persons and BETA companies. BETA persons are persons other than com- panies who maintain a BETA. However, life insurance companies are treated as BETA persons. BETA Companies Section 394ZZN - Election to maintain BETA A company may during an imputation year (1 April to 31 March) elect to maintain a BETA for that year and subsequent years. Where it does so, it is to notify the Commissioner within 21 days after the date of election or such further time as the Commis- sioner may allow. The company may in a subsequent imputation year elect to cease to be a BETA company from the beginning of the following year. This election is of no effect, however, unless the company files the annual imputation return required for the year in which the election is made. This contains information on the BETA account - see section 394J. Unlike the ICA and WPA, the BETA may not run into debit. Section 394ZZO - BETA of a company BETA companies are required to record in the BETA the opening balance of the account and debits and credits as they arise under section 394ZZP. The opening balance for the imputation year beginning on 1 April 1988 is nil. Thereafter, it is the closing balance for the pre- vious year. Section 394ZZP - Debits and Credits to BETA Credits The only type of credit which arises to the BETA is in effect the amount of income tax payable by the company on its CFC income under the branch equivalent regime for an income year. This is calculated in accordance with the formula in subsec- tion (1): (a + b) x c - b d where: a =the amount of income tax payable by the company for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1988 b =the amount of foreign tax credit allowed under section 245K or 245L in calculating the income tax payable by the com- pany for that income year c =the lesser of: (i)the amount of attributed foreign income (see section 245G) derived by the company during that income year (ii)the taxable income of the company for that year - this includes the amount in item (i) above 29 d =the taxable income of the company for that year (i.e. the amount in c (ii)) The credit arises on the date the company files its income tax return for that year. Debits The following debits arise to the BETA of a company: 1. Offset of withholding payment liability Where a BETA company receives a dividend from a CFC in which it has an income interest, it may use a credit in its BETA to offset the liability for withholding payment on the dividend (refer to section 394ZZQ and also to the explanation below of this commentary). The amount by which the liability is reduced is a debit to the BETA. The debit arises on the date by which the company is required to pay the DWP that is reduced by the BETA credit - i.e. on the 14th of January, April, July or October. 2. Credit to ICA A BETA company may elect to transfer credits from its BETA to its ICA - refer to section 394ZZQ and the explanation below. Where it does so, the amount transferred to the ICA is a debit to BETA which arises on the date the company elects to credit the ICA. 3. Refund of income tax Any refund of income tax paid in relation to attributed foreign income derived in respect of an income interest in a CFC. This arises on the date the refund is paid. 4. Loss of continuity of shareholding A debit arises to BETA where there is a loss of continuity of shareholding to the extent referred to in subsection (3)(d). This provision (and subsections (5) and (6)) is identical to those which apply in respect of the ICA and WPA - refer to the discus- sion of those provisions on pages 4 and 24 of this commentary. 5. Ceasing to be resident in New Zealand Where a company ceases to be resident in New Zealand, a debit arises to the account of the amount equal to the credit balance at the date me company ceases to be resident. Section 394ZZQ - Transfer to ICA or Reduction of Dividend Withholding Payment Section 394ZZQ permits a company to apply a credit balance in BETA in either of two ways: -a BETA company may elect to transfer credits from its BETA to its ICA. The company does so simply by debiting the BETA and crediting the ICA. -As noted on pages 32 and 33, a BETA company may use credits in its BETA to offset a liability for withholding payment on receipt of a dividend from a CFC in which it has an income interest. Example A company has in its BETA a credit balance of $200 (this means it has paid income tax of $200 under the CFC regime). It re- ceives a dividend of $1,000 (including $150 withholding tax deducted) from a CFC in which it has an income interest. The liability for dividend withholding payment is, at the current company tax rate of 33%. ($1,000x .33) -150 =180 The company may elect to use $180 of the credit balance in its BETA to offset that liability. The BETA would be debited with $180 and the ICA would be credited with $180. Section 394ZZR - Incorrect entries in BETA of Company The Commissioner has power to correct entries to the BETA of a company in the same way as he has for the ICA and WPA. Where a debit or credit has been incorrectly recorded or omitted, the Commissioner is to determine the amount of the credit and the time at which it arises. Note that BETA companies are required by section 394J(1)(e) to include in their annual imputation return details of entries in me BETA account. 30 Branch Equivalent Tax Accounts of Persons Section 394ZZS - Person electing to maintain a BETA Any person, other than a company but including a life insurance company, may elect during an income year to maintain a BETA for that year and following years. The person is to notify the Commissioner that the election has been made within 21 days of the election or such further time as the Commissioner may allow. The person may elect to cease to operate a BETA as from the commencement of the year following the year in which the elec- tion to cease is made. This is of no effect unless the annual BETA return has been filed for the year in which the election is made. The BETA of a person is operated on an income year basis. The account may not run into debit. Section 394ZZT - BETA of a Person A BETA person is to record in the BETA the opening balance of the account and debits and credits as they arise under section 394ZZU. The opening balance for the BETA is nil in the first year of operation and is the closing balance of the previous year in subse- quent years. Section 394ZZU - Debits and Credits Arising Credits The only credit which arises to the BETA of a person Is, in effect, income tax payable under the CFC regime. That is calculated using me formula in subsection (1): (a + b + c) x d - c e wherea=the amount of income tax payable for the income year by the person b=rebates deducted under section 57 c=foreign tax credits allowed under section 245K or 245L d=the lesser of . . : . (i)the amount of attributed foreign income (see section 245G) derived by the person during the year (ii)the taxable income of me person for the year e=the taxable income of the person for the year (d(ii)) The credit arises on the date on which the person files an income tax return for the income year in which the attributed foreign income was derived. Debits The following debits arise to the BETA of a person: 1. Credit against tax payable Where a person receives a dividend from a CFC in which the person holds an income interest, credits in the BETA may be used to offset the tax on that dividend - see section 394ZZV and the explanation below. The amount which is credited against income tax payable is a debit to the BETA which arises on the date the person elects to offset credits against tax payable. 2. Refund of income tax Where there is a refund of income tax which is attributable to tax paid in relation to attributed foreign income, that amount is a debit to BETA which arises on the date the refund is paid. 31 3. Loss of continuity of shareholding The loss of continuity provisions (in this case relating to life insurance companies) which apply to the BETA are identical to those which apply to the ICA and WPA - refer to the commentary on section 394E(3) at page 4. Section 394ZZV - Offsetting of income tax payable on dividend Where a person who operates a BETA receives a dividend from a CFC in which it has an income interest, the person may use credits in the BETA to offset payment of income tax on the dividend. That person records the amount which is credited against tax payable on the dividend as a debit in BETA. The BETA credits are credited against tax payable on the dividend only if the person has paid the income tax which gave rise to the credits in BETA. (Note: the credits to BETA arise when the person files a return). Section 394ZZW - Annual BETA returns A person who operates a BETA is required to file an annual BETA return in the prescribed form for each income year that the person is required to maintain the account. The return should set out the opening and closing balances of the account and the amount and source of all credits and debits arising during the year. This return is to be filed by the date allowed for filing the income tax return for the year - it is anticipated that the return will be filed with the income tax return for the year. The Commissioner has power to require a person to file a return for any period (subsection (4)). Where a BETA person ceases to be resident that person is required to file a BETA return for the period from the beginning of the year to the date the person became non-resident. Section 394ZZX - Limit on refund of income tax This provision applies both to companies and other persons who operate a BETA. Unlike the ICA and WPA, the BETA may not operate in debit. The only entry which may conceivably place the BETA in debit is a refund of tax paid which relates to attributed foreign income. Therefore, where the company or person is entitled to a refund of income tax paid in respect of attributed foreign income, the amount of refund is reduced so that the BETA will not go into debit. Where it is reduced, the amount not refunded to the com- pany or person will be retained by the Commissioner and will not be available for credit in payment of tax. This is because in the case of a company the amount not refunded represents an underpayment of dividend withholding pay- ment. For a person other than a company the amount not refunded is an amount which has already been claimed as a tax credit. Example - Company $ 25 June 1989Foreign source Dividend received from CFC (includes foreign w/t) 1,000 WP liability330 Less foreign w/t150 WP liability180 14 July 1989Less BETA credit100 WP liability 80 Assuming the company has paid $100 of tax on Branch-equivalent income for the year to 31 March 1989 and files its tax return on 1 June 1989, the BETA entries will be as follows: BETA DrCr 1 June 1989Tax payable per return100 14 July 1989WP offset100 on 15 December 1989 the company is entitled to a refund of tax of $20 - it overpaid tax in relation to attributed foreign income. This refund would place the account in debit. 32 If the company had not overpaid tax the amount standing to the credit of BETA at 1 June 1989 would have been $80. Therefore the company would have been required to make a withholding payment of $100 not $80. Because the amount of a refund will always represent withholding payment underpaid, the amount of the refund will be retained by the Commissioner. Example - Person other than a company BETA Dr$Cr 30 June 1989Tax on attributed foreign income1,000 (1989 return filed) 1 August 1989Dividend received from CFC - $5,000 30 June 1990Offset of tax payable on dividend1,000 15 July 1990Refund of 1989 tax on attributed foreign income - $200 No refund will be made as it would put the BETA into debit. The amount not refunded represents a tax credit which the per- son has in effect obtained to which he would not have been entitled if the correct amount of tax had been paid. The correct amount of tax on attributed foreign income for the 1989 year was $800. The offset of tax payable on the dividend at 30 June 1990 should therefore have been only $800. By retaining the refund, the Commissioner allows only the correct amount of tax. 33 PART D - IMPUTATION RELATED AMENDMENTS The commentary below covers the amendments in Part IV of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 5) 1988 that are related to or consequent on the new imputation regime. Therefore, sections 30, 31, 33 - 44, 43, 49, 51 and 52, which make amendments related to bonus issues, dividends, producer boards and co-operatives, fringe benefit tax, and excess retention tax, are covered in separate commentaries on those subjects as appropriate. Section 32 - Assessments, determinations of loss etc. Section 32 amends section 19 of the principal Act by inserting subsection (1A) to provide that any adjustment made by the Commissioner to the amount of imputation credits or dividend withholding payment credits or certain BETA credits claimed by a taxpayer is deemed to be part of an annual assessment. In such event the standard assessment and objection procedures of the Act will apply. Section 19 is also amended to provide that determinations by the Commissioner in respect of entries to the ICA, DWPA, and BETA are to be treated In the same way as determinations of loss for the purposes of the objection procedures of the ACT. Section 45 - United Kingdom tax on divldends This section makes a consequential amendment to section 308 of the principal Act to amend the reference in that section from section 4(6) of the Act to section 394ZC(3). The amendment is consequent on the repeal of section 4(6) and the insertion of the provisions of that subsection into section 394ZC(3). Section 394ZC(3) provides that where a taxpayer is entitled, either under United Kingdom law or under the New Zealand/ United Kingdom double tax treaty, to a tax credit in the United Kingdom in respect of a dividend received from a United King- dom company, the amount of the dividend is deemed to be increased by the amount of the tax credit. Section 308 provides that, for the purpose of allowing credit for foreign tax under Part Vlll of the Act and the double tax treaty, the United Kingdom tax payable on such a dividend is deemed to be the full amount of tax on the dividend, even if that tax may not actually be paid (e.g. an imputation credit). Section 46 - Interpretation provision relating to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) Section 46 repeals the previous section 309 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section 309. The amendment includes within the definition of the term “dividends” for the purposes of Part IX of the Act any dividend withholding payment (DWP) credits attached to dividends. Any imputation credits attached to dividends are excluded. The reason for this is that non-resident shareholders are entitled to the benefit of DWP credits but not to imputation credits. Where dividends are paid to a non-resident shareholder the calculation of NRWT is based on the amount of the dividends paid plus the amount of any dividend withholding payment credits attached to the dividends, for example - dividends paid$720 imputation credits attached$200 DWP credits attached$ 80 $1,000 non-resident withholding income$800 (dividends + DWP credits) non-resident withholding tax (30%)$240 (or 1596 under a double tax treaty) For the purposes of Part IX, the term “dividends” also does not include any dividends in respect of which winding up distri- bution tax has been paid. Therefore where winding up distribution tax has been paid in respect of dividends paid to a non- resident shareholder such dividends are not included in non-resident withholding income and no NRWT is payable on those dividends. Section 47 - Non-resident withholding tax imposed This section repeals section 311 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section. The only difference in substance is to pro- vide that persons liable to pay NRWT will be deemed to have paid the tax to the extent that the amount of any dividend with- holding payment (DWP) credit is included in non-resident withholding income. The effect is that DWP credits attached to the dividends may be credited against the NRWT liability and will therefore reduce the amount of NRWT payable in respect of those dividends. To take the example above (refer to section 46), the amount of NRWT payable will be $160 being the amount calculated ($240) reduced by the DWP credits ($80). Should the DWP credits attached to dividends exceed the amount of the NRWT calculated there will be no NRWT payable and the non-resident will be entitled to apply for a refund of the excess. 34 Section 50 - Payment of NRWT to Commissioner Section 50 amends section 319 of the principal Act by inserting a new paragraph (c) to cover the situation where NRWT is not deducted or is not deducted in full because dividend withholding credits in excess of the proper amount are attached to a divi- dend. In such a case the shareholder receiving the dividend is required to pay the amount of NRWT that has not been deducted. Section 53 - Amendment of tem “residual income tax” This section amends the definition of “residual income tax” in section 375 of the principal Act to allow provisional taxpayers to take into account - imputation credits and dividend withholding payment credits deducted from or set off against income tax payable by a taxpayer, and certain BETA credits offset against income tax payable on dividends received in respect of income interests in control- led foreign corporations in calculating the amount of provisional tax payable in respect of the 1990 and subsequent income years. In summary, provisional tax is, at the option of the taxpayer, calculated with reference to the previous year’s income tax pay- able less certain listed tax credits. This list now includes the above credits (see previous paragraph). The effect of the amend- ment is that for the 1990 and subsequent income years provisional tax instalments will be payable on a basis that takes into account imputation, dividend withholding payment, and certain BETA credits claimed in the previous year. Section 54 - Offset of further income tax Section 54 inserts a new section 378A into the principal Act to provide that any payment of an amount of further income tax under the imputation regime (refer to section 394L) is to be set off against subsequent instalments of provisional tax instal- ments. Where a company pays further income tax in accordance with section 394L, the amount of the payment is credited in payment of the next provisional tax instalment that is payable after the date of payment of the further income tax. To the extent that there remains an amount of further income tax uncredited, that amount is to be credited in payment of subsequent provisional tax instalments in the order that they fall due and payable. Section 56 - Refund of excess tax Section 409 has been amended to make that section subject to the restrictions on refunding income tax which are contained in sections 394M, 394ZO and 394ZZX. This will enable the Commissioner to retain any refund of income tax or dividend with- holding payment to the extent to which that refund exceeds the credit in the company's ICA, DWPA, or BETA, as appropriate, at the end of the preceding imputation year. Section 57 - Tax paid iln excess offset against additional tax Section 410, which empowers the Commissioner to offset an excess of tax payable against unpaid tax for another year, has also been amended to make that section subject to sections 394M, 394ZO and 394ZZX which impose limitations on refunding of income tax. Section 58 - Interest on tax overpaid This section amends section 413A of the principal Act by adding imputation credits, dividend withholding payment credits, and certain credits to the BETA to the definition of the term “residual income tax”. This allows such credits to be deducted from tax payable when calculating the amount of residual income tax for the purpose of determining the interest to be paid by the Commissioner on the difference between provisional tax paid for an income year and residual income for that year The amendment also inserts subsection (3A) into section 413A so that the Commissioner is not required to pay interest in re- spect of the amount of a refund of income tax retained in accordance with section 394M and 394ZZX. Section 59 - Keeping of business records Section 428 of the Income Tax Act has been amended to require companies to maintain for 10 years records of ICA, DWPA and BETA accounts, company dividend statements and foreign withholding payment dividends received. BETA persons (other than companies) are also required to keep a record of the BETA account. 35 APPENDIX TO TIB NO.1, JULY 1989 EXPLANATION OF INCOME TAX AMENDMENT (NO. 5) ACT 1988 - PART IV CONTENTS Page 1.

The measures were contained in Parts I and II of the Finance Bill (No 5) 1989. Those Parts are enacted as the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989 and the Land Tax Amendment Act 1989. Issues covered are: 1.PAYE tax deductions and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax deductions. 2.National superannuitant’s surcharge. 3.Retirement tax. 4.Family support credit of tax. 5.Guaranteed minimum family income tax credit. 6.Land tax. Legislation commentaries are provided in Appendix A to this TIB. 1.PAYE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND SPECIFIED SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS (Sections 6 to 11 and 14 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989). At present PAYE deductions and specified superannua- tion contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) deductions are paid to the Commissioner once a month on the 20th of the month after the month in which the source deduc- tion payments or contributions were made. That is, if the source deduction payments or contributions were made in January, the payments to the Commissioner would be due by the 20th of February. From 1 May 1990, payments of PAYE deductions and SSCWT deductions must be paid to the Commissioner twice monthly. (Sections 6 to 9). Payments for the first half of the month (from the 1st to the 15th day) will be due on the 20th of the month, and payments for the second half of the month (from the 16th to the end of the month) will be due on the 5th of the next month. This new arrangement will commence in May 1990 and will apply as follows: i.All PAYE and SSCWT deductions for the month of April 1990 will be payable to the Commissioner by 5 May 1990; and ii.From 1 May 1990 the twice monthly payment ar- rangement as set out above will apply. These changes also apply to employees who pay their own tax deduction, i.e. IR 56 taxpayers. (Section 10). 2.NATIONAL SUPERANNUITANT SURCHARGE (Section 4 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) This section provides that only one half of pensions and annuities from registered superannuation schemes and certain life insurance funds will be subject to the national superannuitant surcharge. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 reformed the taxation treatment of private superannuation schemes. That Act put in place the taxed/taxed/exempt tax regime which means that all earnings of superannuation schemes are taxed as derived and that benefits (pensions and annuities) paid after 1 April 1990 will be tax free. However it was intended at that stage that pensions and annuities would continue to be subject to the national superannuitant surcharge where that applied. It is now considered that it is more appropriate that only half of these pensions and annuities are subject to the surcharge. Where taxpayers make any investment other than pension or superannuation contributions they will pay tax, and surcharge if applicable, on the income derived from that investment but not on the amount of capital invested when that amount is returned to them. However income from pensions and superannuation schemes received by pensioners and superannuitants generally comprise both income and capital elements. Although it is not possible to identify the precise compo- sition of pension and superannuation payments, a 50 percent apportionment is considered a reasonable proxy. Treating only half of a pension or annuity as surchargeable income, recognises the capital element of any superannuation or pension payment and is therefore consistent with the tax and surcharge treatment of other types of investment. 3.RETIREMENT TAX (Sections 2, 3, 5, and 15 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) The Government announced in the Budget that a portion of the current tax take would be attributed to the cost of National Superannuation. The retirement tax regime will clearly identify the contribution each taxpayer makes to the support of the elderly. The retirement tax will apply to the following taxes: \*Income tax. \*Fringe benefit tax, and \*Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax. The rate of retirement tax will be shown on the tax deduction certificates, fringe benefit tax returns, specified superannuation withholding tax forms, and end-of-year income tax assessment notices. A panel will be included on the income tax return for taxpayers to calculate how much of their own tax liability will be spent on provision for retirement income for the aged. 3 The rate of retirement tax for the 1990/91 income year is set at 7.5 cents for every dollar of income, fringe benefit, or specified superannuation contribution. The First Schedule to the Finance Act contains the new Twentieth Schedule to the Income Tax Act which sets out a list of estimated retirement rates for the next 30 years. 4.FAMILY SUPPORT CREDIT OF TAX (Section 12 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) The Government announced in the Budget that the $16,000 threshold at which family support commences to abate is to increase to $17,500 with effect from 1 October 1989. The effect of the timing of this amendment means that a composite threshold will apply for the 1989/90 income year. The threshold for the income year commencing 1 April 1989 will therefore be $16,750. To effect the new family support and GMFI payments, the department will automatically calculate the new entitlements for persons who currently hold a valid certificate of entitlement without the need for fresh applications. These certificates will be issued in time for affected persons to forward them to their employers before 1 October. For families with one child and gross annual incomes in the range $17,500 to $27,540 this will generally result in an increase in family support entitlement of $270 in a full year. Where the entitlement for one child is $36 per week, and for subsequent children $16, the income level at which family support will be fully abated will be: Number of ChildrenAnnual Family Income (Under 16 Yrs.)Tax Year 1991 1$27540 2$30314 3$33087 4$35860 5$38634 5.GUARANTEED MINIMUM FAMILY INCOME TAX CREDIT (Section 13 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) The Minister of Finance announced in the Budget that the minimum after tax family income, including family benefit and family support, for a family with 1 child is increased from $300 per week to $310 per week. Where there are further children this amount increases by $22 for each additional child under 16 years of age ($6 family benefit and $16 family support) or $42 for each child 16 years or over ($36 family support and $6 family benefit) where the taxpayer qualifies for a family benefit in respect of the child. To effect the new family support and GMFI payments, the department will automatically calculate the new entitle- ments for persons who currently hold a valid certificate of entitlement without the need for fresh applications. These certificates will be issued in time for affected persons to forward them to their employers before 1 October. Although the increase is backdated to 1 April 1989 any excess entitlement in respect of the period from l April 1989 to the operative date of the new Certificates will only be claimable at the end of the tax year when an income tax return is filed. 6.LAND TAX (Land Tax Amendment Act 1989) The Land Tax Act 1976 is one of the few parts of the New Zealand tax system not fundamentally reviewed since 1984. On Budget night the Minister of Finance announced that it was intended to amend the land tax regime to bring it into line with the Government’s commitment to the broadening of the tax base and the lowering of tax rates. The lowering of the land tax rate was made possible through 3 measures. The first was removing many of the current exemptions from land tax for various land uses. The second was the replacement of the $175,000 special exemption with a lower $10,000 de minimis threshold. The final measure was to announce (but not enact) the advancing of the land tax payment dates so that the resultant land tax revenue is collected earlier. The amendments made to the land tax regime are as follows: 1989 Year of Assessment For land owned as at 31 March 1989 the rate of land tax is reduced from 2 cents for every $1 of land value on which land tax is payable to 1.5 cents. There is no change to the special exemption which is retained at $175.000 and no amendment to any of the exemptions applying to certain classes of land. There is also no change to the date of paying land tax which is retained at 7 October. All land tax returns furnished before the annual rate of land tax was confirmed will be assessed at the confirmed rate of land tax. 1990 Year of Assessment For land owned as at 31 March 1990 the scheduled rate of land tax is reduced from 1.5 cents for every $1 of land value on which land tax is payable to 1 cent. Specific provisions have been introduced to exempt from land tax Crown land used for roads, reserves, national parks, Parliament, any Vice-Regal residence etc. A number of exemptions have been repealed. e.g. The exemptions provided to the trustee savings banks, friendly societies and public and local authorities. The concessionary rates of land tax for certain religious societies, named trusts, and for local authorities engaged in the supply of energy have been removed. The special exemption of $175,000 is repealed hut a of $10,000 de minimis rule is introduced to the effect that 4 taxpayers owning land with a total value of less than $10,000 will not be required to pay land tax. Owners of land with a total value exceeding $10,000 will be re- quired to pay land tax on the total land value not the total land value less $10,000. The sections imposing a higher rate of land tax on persons absent from New Zealand for more than 2 out of the last 4 years is repealed. Land tax will be due and payable in 2 instalments on 7 May 1990 and 7 October 1990. Legislation for this meas- ure will be included in future legislation. 1991 Year of Assessment The Minister also announced that land tax payable for the 1991 year of assessment will be due and payable on 7 May 1991 and will be payable in one instalment. As with the 1990 year of assessment payment dates the amending legislation will be included in a later Bill.

STUDENT YOUTH ALLOWANCES – TAXATION SUMMARY This item clarifies confusion surrounding the taxation of grant payments to students under the new Youth Allow- ance Scheme. BACKGROUND The Student Allowance Scheme is a new system of taxable allowances which replaces the Tertiary Assist- ance Grants available before 1989. It provides assistance, on a non-competitive basis to students 16 years of age and over who are studying approved full-time secondary or tertiary courses, and who are permanent residents of New Zealand or hold New Zealand citizenship. (Further information on the Student Allowance Scheme may be obtained from your local tertiary institution or Student Allowances Section, Ministry of Education. Private Box 1379, Wellington.) RULING Grant payments are treated as salary and wages for tax purposes. The primary tax code “G” should apply to the majority of students. Where a student has a second form of employment a “G” code would be declared for the higher gross income and a “Sec” or “Special tax code” would be declared for the lower income of the two. The question also arises as to whether students are eligible to use the transitional tax code “T” in respect of the student youth allowance. It is not possible for them to use the “T” code because they do not meet the definition of a full time earner contained in section 50C of the Income Tax Act. That definition requires a person to be engaged in “remunerative work” for not less than 20 hours per week. Study is not “remunerative work” as defined in section 50C(1) of the Act as the use of the word “work” in the definition implies that the remuneration must be received in return for actual personal services performed and not merely an allowance paid for attend- ing a university.

The announced increases will be paid by employ- ers from the date specified on the new Certificates - generally this will be 1 October 1989. The balance of the increase, which is backdated to 1 April 1989, may be claimed when an income tax return is filed at the end of the tax year." For inquiries: Stuart Jamieson Phone (04) 721-032 2. Stiffer Penalties for Tax Evaders As from 1 September 1989 a new system for Voluntary Disclosure will operate in all District Offices and Re- gional Offices. Penal rates have been increased. The following is copy of a press release issued by the Com- missioner of Inland Revenue on 3 August 1989. “Following last year’s tax amnesty, Inland Revenue has moved to increase penalties on people evading tax. The penalties under the tax law for evasion are: •on conviction by the courts a fine of up to $15,000.00 for each false return; •a late payment penalty of 10% added every 6 months; •penal tax of up to 300% of the tax evaded; •publication of name and details of the offence. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, said today that the amount of penal tax charged will be increased substantially as from 1 September 1989. At present the penal tax charged varies according to the circumstances of the particular case but the benchmark used is 100% of the tax evaded. “In respect of investigations or inquiries commencing on or after 1 September 1989 we will be using 150% of the tax evaded as the benchmark. However we are giving much more generous treatment for people who come forward voluntarily”, Mr Henry said. People making a voluntary disclosure to the Department before any inquiry or investigation has commenced will have the penal tax reduced to 25% of the tax evaded, will not be prosecuted in Court and will not have their names 6 published. The new voluntary disclosure policy will be applied to any disclosures made after last year’s amnesty ended 11 November 1988. However the 10% late pay- ment penalty will still be applied. “People who did not straighten up their affairs during the tax amnesty still have an opportunity to do so because the penal tax will be substantially reduced. However they will not get as good a deal as the people who came forward during the amnesty”, Mr Henry said. The tax amnesty ran for 2 months, from September to November in 1988. The total tax assessed under the amnesty was $26.6m and was payable by 11,170 taxpay- ers. Some 24,000 back year returns were also filed. 13 taxpayers owed more than $100,000.00 and 3 taxpayers owed more than $500,000.00 tax. Not everyone got bills to pay though. 4,913 people got refunds amounting to nearly 3 million dollars. Mr Henry said he was pleased about that. “These people have also straightened up their tax affairs by filing overdue returns and that makes our job that much easier”, he said. Inland Revenue has beefed up the number of people working on audit of taxpayers and has substantially increased the amount of taxes assessed. In the last 3 years taxes assessed from compliance work have increased 96% from $285m in 1987 to $560m in 1989.

1 LEGISLATIVE COMMENTARY The Budget night legislation was divided into two separate Acts: The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989 The Land Tax Amendment Act 1989 This legislative commentary explains the provisions contained in those Acts. INCOME TAX AMENDMENT ACT (NO 3) 1989 1. SPECIFIED SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX (SSCWT) AND PAYE TAX DEDUCTIONS (Sections 6 to 11 and 14 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989). Section 6 amends section 336ZC of the Tax Act to provide that SSCWT payments by the employer to the Commissioner will be made twice monthly. Subsection (1) provides that: •Deductions of withholding tax made in the first period, that is, on or before the 15th of the month, will be payable by the 20th day of the month, and •Deductions of withholding tax made in the second period, on or after the 16th day of the month, will be payable by the 5th day of the next month. Subsection (2) provides that deductions of withholding tax made in April 1990 are payable by 5 May 1990. Section 7 amends section 336ZD of the Tax Act and provides new due dates for the statements which are furnished by the employer to the Commissioner with the SSCWT payments. Subsection (1) provides that those statements are due on the same date as the payment of the withholding tax deductions. That is: •No later than the 20th of the month for the first period (from the first of the month to the 16th), and •No later than the 5th of the next month for the second period (from the 16th day to the end of the month). Subsection (2) provides that the statement applicable to deductions made in April 1990 is required to be furnished by 5 May 1990. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply as from 1 May 1990. Section 8 amends section 336ZF of the Tax Act, which relates to failure to deduct SSCWT. Subsection (1) provides that where an employer has failed to deduct tax this shall constitute a debt payable: •By the 20th of the month for tax not deducted in the first period, (from the first to the 15th day of the month), and •By the 5th of the next month for tax not deducted in the second period (from the 16th day to the end of the month). Subsection (2) provides that where the employer has failed to deduct tax in April 1990, the amount in default shall consti- tute a debt payable on 5 May 1990. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply as from 1 May 1990. Section 9 amends section 353(1) of the Tax Act to provide that tax deduction payments by employers to the Commissioner will be made twice monthly. Subsection (1) provides that: •Tax deductions made in the first period (that is, from the first day of the month to the 15th day) will be due by the 20th of the month, and •Tax deductions made in the second period (from the 16th day of the month to the end of the month) will be due by the 5th of the next month. Subsection (2) provides a new subsection which defines the meaning of three new terms: “First period” means the period from the 1st to the 15th day of the month, “Second period” means the period from the 16th day to the end of the month, and “Period” to be first or second period as the case may require. 2 Subsection (3) provides that tax deductions made in April 1990 are payable to the Commissioner by 5 May 1990. Subsection (4) provides that subsections (1) and (2) will apply as from 1 May 1990. Section 10 amends section 355 of the Tax Act and provides that employees who deduct and pay their own tax will be re- quired to make those payments to the Commissioner twice monthly. Subsection (1) provides that: •Payment for the first period (from the 1st to the 15th of the month) will be due by the 20th of the month, and •Payment for the second period (from the 16th day to the end of the month) will be due by the 5th of the next month. Subsection (2) provides that tax deductions made by employees in April 1990 are due 5 May 1990. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply as from I May 1990. Section 11 amends section 366 of the Tax Act which deals with an employer’s failure to make tax deductions. Subsection (1) requires that where the employer has failed to make tax deductions, the amount in default will be deemed payable to the Commissioner: •By the 20th of the month for the first period (that is from the first to the 15th day of a month) and •By the 5th of the next month for the second period (from the 16th day of the month to the end of the month) Subsection (2) provides that default payments that arise in April 1990 shall be deemed due and payable on 5 May 1990. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply as from 1 May 1990. Section 14 amends section 374H of the Tax Act which deals with the requirement for employers to deduct tax credits from PAYE deductions in certain circumstances. Subsection (1) repeals a proviso to section 374H(1) of the Tax Act and substitutes a new subsection (1A). The effect of the amendment is that where an overpayment of family support has arisen, the amount refundable to the Commissioner will become due: •On the 20th of the month if the overpayment arose in me first period, (that is between the first and the 15th day of any month), and •On the 5th of the next month if the overpayment arose in the second period (between the 16th and the last day of the month). Subsection (2) provides that overpayments for April 1990 shall be due 5 May 1990. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) of this section will apply as from 1 May 1990. I May 1990. 2. NATIONAL SUPERANNUITANT SURCHARGE (Section 4 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) Section 4 amends the formula for calculating “other income” (surchargeable income) in section 336B of the Tax Act. Following the amendment the calculation of "other income" will be as follows: a - b - d Where: ais the taxable income of the superannuitant including: specified foreign social security pensions\*, and overseas pensions, but excluding: pensions from registered superannuation schemes and annuities from the life insurance fund of a company to which sec- tion 204 applies, PLUS: half of any pensions from registered superannuation schemes and annuities from the life insurance fund of a company to which section 204 applies, other than those pensions or annuities which are included in assessable income. bis gross national superannuation, and dis the amount of any specified foreign social security pension\*. \* specified foreign social security pension means an overseas pension, the amount of which reduces a taxpayer’s entitle- ment to national superannuation. 3 3. RETIREMENT TAX (Sections 2, 3, 5, and 15 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) These sections attribute a portion of the current tax take from income tax, fringe benefit tax, and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax towards the cost of national superannuation. Section 2 defines “retirement tax” as a retirement tax under Part VA of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 3 introduces a new Part VA into the Act comprising sections 257A to C. Section 257A states that other Parts of the principal Act (except part 1) shall not apply to retirement tax unless expressly provided for in Part VA. Section 257B defines retirement tax to be a part of: •Income tax (payable by all classes of taxpayer), •Fringe benefit tax, and •Specified Superannuation contribution withholding tax. Section 257C: •Provides that retirement tax shall be assessed on the taxable income of every taxpayer, the taxable value of fringe benefits provided by employers and the specified superannuation contributions provided by employers to a superannuation fund at the rate specified in clause 14 of the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act, and •Introduces a new schedule, the Twentieth Schedule, to the Income Tax Act which contains a list of estimated rates of re- tirement tax for the years 1990/1991 to 2019/20. Subsection (2) provides that this section shall apply with respect to: (a)Taxable income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1990 and in every subsequent income year; (b)Fringe benefits provided on or after the 1st day of April 1990; and (c)Specified superannuation contributions made on or after the 1st day of April 1990. Section 5 of the Amendment Act amends Section 336S of the principal Act to provide that the fringe benefit tax rate of 49 percent includes a rate of retirement tax specified in clause 14 of the First Schedule to the principal Act. This section applies to fringe benefits provided on or after the 1st day of April 1990. Section 15 makes a number of amendments to the First Schedule to the Principal Act. Subsection (1) inserts a footnote character “1” after the rates specified in clauses 2 to 10 and clause 13 of Part A of the First Schedule to the principal Act (refer subsection (3) of this section below) Subsection (2) inserts a new clause into Part A of the First Schedule to the principal Act. The new clause specifies that the rate of retirement tax on taxable income of taxpayers, the taxable value of fringe benefits provided by employers and the specified superannuation contributions provided by employers to a superannuation fund shall be 7.5 cents. This rate will apply for the 1990/91 income year. Subsection (3) inserts the following footnote after clause 14 of the principal Act. “1 includes retirement tax calculated at the rate specified in clause 14 of this Schedule.” This subsection and subsection (1) above ensures that the rates specified in clauses 2 to 10 and clause 13 of Part A of the First Schedule include the rate of retirement tax. Subsection (4) inserts a footnote character “1” after the rates of income tax specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the principal Act. Subsection (5) inserts the following footnote after the rates of income tax specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Prin- cipal Act. “1 includes retirement tax calculated at the rate specified in clause 14 of this Schedule.” Subsection (6) provides that this section shall apply with respect to: (a)the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1990 and in every subsequent income year; (b)Fringe benefit tax on fringe benefits provided on or after the 1st day of April 1990; and (c)Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax on specified superannuation contributions made to a superan- nuation fund on or after the 1st day of April 1990. 4 FAMILY SUPPORT CREDIT OF TAX Section 12 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) Section 12 of the Finance Act (No 5) 1989 implements the Budget announcement that the threshold family income above which family support ceases to abate will be increased from $16,000 to $17,500 with effect from 1 October 1989. For the purposes of the end of year adjustment for the 1989/90 income year a composite threshold of $16,750 will apply. Subsection (1) makes the required amendments to increase the threshold to $17,500. Subsection (2) provides a composite threshold for the calculation of end-of-year entitlement for the 1990 income year. For that year abatement will commence when the specified income exceeds $16,750. Subsection (3) provides arrangements for the issue of Certificates of Entitlement in respect of the remainder of the 1990 tax year. The instalments in relation to certificates in respect of the period 1 April 1989 to 30 September 1989 are to be calcu- lated on the basis of the present $16,000 threshold. Instalments on certificates in respect of the period 1 October 1989 to 31 March 1990 are to be calculated on the basis of the $17,500 threshold. Subsection (4) is the application provision. Subsection (1) applies to the 1990 tax year. Subsection (5) repeals the transitional arrangements for the 1990 tax year at the end of that year. 5. GUARANTEED MINIMUM FAMILY INCOME TAX CREDIT Section 13 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1989) This section gives effect to the Budget announcement that the level of the guaranteed minimum family income for a family with one child is to be increased from $300 per week to $310, effective from 1 April 1989. Section (1) substitutes the new level of the guaranteed minimum family income into section 374E of the principal Act. Subsection (2) provides for the increase to apply for the 1990 income year and every subsequent year. 6. LAND TAX (Land Tax Amendment Act 1989) Section 1 - Subsection (1) provides that the land tax amendments made by sections 2 - 10 of the Land Tax Act 1989 apply to the Land Tax Act 1976 (the principal Act in this case). Subsection (2) provides that the amendments made by sections 2 - 7 and 10 apply to the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1990 and for every subsequent year. Sections 8 and 9 are excluded from the 1 April 1990 commencement date as these sections set the rate of land tax to apply for the current year of assessment. Section 2 - Subsection (1) repeals the definitions of the words “energy”, “friendly society” and “service organisations” in section (2) of the principal Act as the sections in the principal Act that made use of these definitions will no longer exist. Subsection (2) also amends section (2) of the principal Act by excluding from the definition of a “local authority” any local authority trading enterprises, any airport company, any port company, and any energy supply operation to which section 197C of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies. These entities are excluded from the definition of a local authority to ensure that they do not qualify for the exemption provided in section 27(1)(d) of the principal Act. It is not strictly necessary to exclude airport companies because of section 29A(3)(d) but it was done for clarification purposes. Subsection (3) further amends section (2) of the principal Act by excluding from the definition of a Public authority any of the Enterprises listed in the First and Second Schedules to the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986. This provision is neces- sary for the same reasons the definition of a local authority was amended; to ensure these SOEs do not qualify for the ex- emption in section 27(1)(d) of the principal Act. Subsection (4) is simply a consequential amendment as a result of the above changes. Section 3 - Provides that the principal Act binds the Crown. This is a major provision. It provides that the Land Tax Act will now apply to the Crown ensuring that public authorities are required to pay land tax. A public authority has a very wide definition and includes every department or instrument of Executive Government of New Zealand (but as amended does not include SOEs who are subject to land tax in their own right). Section 4 - Subsection (1) replaces the current $175,000 special exemption with a $10,000 total land value threshold beneath which no land tax is payable. This section provides that no taxpayer will ever be eligible for more than one de minimis provision. Subsection (2) replaces the current section 13(3) of the Land Tax Act with a new provision which ensures that no joint owner of land will be eligible for the $10,000 de minimis rule where the joint estate exceeds $10,000. Where a person owns part of a joint estate with a land value of less than $10,000 then the de minimis rule does not apply to that assessment. 5 Example of joint/separate assessment: The assessment covers A and B partnership who joint own land and partner A who also owns land separately. The example covers 3 combinations of land ownership. CASE:123 Joint Assessment: A and B Partnership:$4,000$8,000$12,000 De Minimis rule applies:YesYesNo Land Tax Payable:$ 0$ 0$ 120 Individual Interest Partner A: Share of joint estate:$ 2,000$ 4,000$ 6,000 Land owned in own right:$ 5,000$10,000$ 5,000 De Minimis rule applies:YesNoNo Land Tax Payable:$ 0$ 140$ 110 Tax credit from joint assessment:$ 0 $ 0$ 60 Amount to be paid:$ 0$ 140$ 50 Subsection (3) repeals section 15 of the Land Tax Act as the special exemption no longer exists and the apportioning rules no longer apply. Subsection (4) repeals section 23(3) of the principal Act because the special exemption no longer exists. Section 5 - Repeals section 26 of the principal Act. Section 26 provided that absentee land owners were required to pay land tax at a rate 50% greater than non-absentee land owners. This provision was not considered to be equitable and was easily avoided. Section 6 repeals section 27 of the principal Act and introduces a new section 27. Subsection (1) of this new section is a mix of some of the old section 27(1) exemptions and various new exemptions as follows: Exemptions Introduced Land tax will be payable by the Crown from 1 April 1990 except for land used for usages listed below which are not subject to land tax: Paragraph (a) provides that National Parks are exempt. Paragraph (b) provides that land vested in the Crown or owned by any public authority and forming a domain, a recrea- tion, historic, scenic, nature, scientific, or Government purpose reserve are exempt. This paragraph also provides that Crown or public authority lands that comprise a wildlife management reserve, wildlife refuge, or wildlife sanctuary are exempt. Flood ponding areas and foreshore areas are exempt from land tax as are the bottom of any navigable river. Paragraph (c) provides that the vice-regal residence and Parliament grounds are exempt. Paragraph (d) provides that the Crown is eligible for the exemptions provided in paragraphs (i) and (k). This is land used for museums, cemeteries, libraries, sports and games grounds etc. Paragraph (e) provides that the national and public road networks are exempt from land tax. Exemptions Amended Paragraph (f) provides that land occupied by the New Zealand Railways Corporation and used as a permanent railway is exempt from land tax. This exemption does not apply to land used as marshalling yards or as loading/unloading areas, or for administrative or ancillary purposes. This exemption matches the exemption provided to the national and local road network and provides a consistent land tax treatment between the 2 transport networks. Paragraph (g) provides that land the Crown has set aside or granted for pastoral purposes will be exempt from land tax. This is normally land used for sheltering livestock being moved by a drover. Paragraph (o) provides that land used for the purposes of a university, college, high school, secondary school, or other public educational institution not run for pecuniary profit is exempt from land tax. This paragraph, previously 27(1)(b) in the prin- cipal Act, used to refer to land “owned” but has now been changed to refer to land “used” instead. This means that land owned by an individual and rented at a profit to a university will not be subject to land tax. It also means that land owned by a University but not used for that University’s purpose will be subject to land tax. Paragraph (p) is a modified version of the old section 27(1)(1). Section 27(1)(1) has been changed to ensure that hobby farm- ers will not be subject to land tax . It was considered that hobby farm land should be not be subject to land tax as the land is used for a mixed residential/agricultural purpose. Hobby farmers now qualify for this exemption because the business test that used to be included in the old paragraph (1) has been removed. The section was further modified to ensure that individuals could not qualify for this exemption where the agricultural land use is merely a way of avoiding land tax on land which is actually intended for other than agricultural purposes. 6 Exemptions Continued Unchanged Paragraph (h) - (n) and (q) - (t) maintain some of the exemptions provided for by section 27(1) prior to the amendments. (a)Paragraph (h) continues the exemption for Maori customary land. (b)Paragraph (i), previously old paragraph 27(1)(g), provides that societies and trustees may receive an exemption from land tax for land used as the site of a public museum, library, cemetery, domain, etc. (c)Paragraph (j), previously old paragraph 27(1)(h), continues the exemption for land owned by a charitable body where that land is used for the purposes of that charitable body and not for any pecuniary profit of any individual. (d)Paragraph (k), previously old paragraph 27(1)(n), continues that exemption for land owned or occupied by any trust or association using that land for games or sports not including horse racing, greyhound racing, or trotting, and not used for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. (e)Paragraph (l), previously old paragraph 27(1)(o), continues the exemption for land owned or occupied by any racing club, or company owned by a racing club, if the land is used solely or principally for the purposes of horse racing, grey- hound racing, or trotting. (f)Paragraph (m), previously old paragraph 27(1)(d), continues the exemption provided to any society incorporated un- der the Agricultural and Pastoral Societies Act 190 and used as a showground or meeting place. (g)Paragraph (n), previously old paragraph 27(1)(f), continues the exemption for land owned by a society incorporated under the Libraries and Mechanics Institutes Act 1908. (h)Paragraph (q), previously old paragraph 27(1)(p), continues the current residential exemption. (i)Paragraph (r), previously old paragraph 27(1)(q), continues the exemption for long-term boarding establishments. (j)Paragraph (s), previously old paragraph 27(1)(r), continues the exemption for homes for the elderly. (k)Paragraph (t), previously old paragraph 27(1)(s), continues the historical places trust exemption. Subsection (2) of this new section to the Land Tax Act, is the current section 27(2) with a minor amendment. The amend- ment adjusts the references to take into account the rearranging of the exemptions provided in the new 27(1) compared with the old section 27(1). Subsection (2) of section (6) of the amendment Act provides for various consequential repeals. Section 7 repeals section 28 and section 28A of the principal Act as these sections provided an advantageous land tax treat- ment to certain taxpayers over other taxpayers in similar positions. It also helps simplify the land tax system. Section 28 applied to a)Land owned or in trust for any religious society, if the land or the rents or profits thereof are used exclusively for chari- table purposes, and if the principal purpose for which the society is established is the teaching, maintenance, or advance- ment of religion: b) Land vested in the Masterton Trust Lands Trustees: c) Land vested in the Greytown Trust Lands Trustees: d) Land vested in Trustees of Cornwall Park, Auckland. Section 28A applied to a local authority supplying energy to the public where the principal purpose of the authority is not the supplying of energy to the public. Section 8 repeals the existing schedule in the principal Act and introduces a new schedule with 2 parts. Part A specifies that the rate of land tax for the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1989 is 1.5 cents/dollar. Part B provides that the rate of land tax applying for the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1990 and every subsequent year is 1 cent/dollar. This section has an enactment date of 1 April 1989. Section 9 confirms the rate of land tax for the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1989 shall be the rate specified in Part A of the newly introduced schedule. This is 1.5 cents/dollar.

1 Section 33 - Repeal of Exemptions from Income Tax This section repeals sections 61(6), (7), and (8) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The effect is the withdrawal of income tax ex- emptions relating to income derived by: •Primary producer and marketing boards, •Certain milk treatment companies, •Milk treatment corporations established under regulations made pursuant to the Marketing Act 1936 and the Agriculture (Emergency Powers) Act 1934. The withdrawal of the exemption applies from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1988. The amendment results from an announcement made in the Government Economic Statement of 17 December 1987. For details of the tax treatment of these organisations see the commentary on section 39 of the Amendment Act. Section 39 - Taxation of Primary Producer Boards and Co-operative Companies Introduction In line with Government policy outlined in the Government Economic Statement of 17 December 1987, a number of exemp- tions and concessions have been removed from the Tax Act. This Appendix specifically deals with: •The exemption from tax of income derived by primary producer and marketing boards, and certain milk treatment com- panies and corporations. (See section 33 of the Amendment Act (No 5)). •Deductions for “qualifying expenditure” incurred by primary producer co-operative companies. (See section 41 of the Amendment Act (No 5)). •The exemption from tax of certain income derived by co-operative dairy companies, co-operative milk marketing com- panies and co-operative pig marketing companies. (See section 41 of the Amendment Act (No 5)). Section 39 introduces four new sections to the Income Tax Act - Sections 197E to 197H. These new sections relate to: Section 197EStatutory Producer Boards Section 197FMilk Treatment Companies and Corporations Section 197GPrimary Producer Co-operative Companies Section 197HCo-operative Dairy Companies Co-operative Milk Marketing Companies Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies. Statutory Producer Boards The income tax records for these organisations will be held in Special Files Section, Wellington District Office. The defini- tion of a statutory producer board refers to: (a)Any board listed in the Eighteenth Schedule to the Act, and (b)Any marketing authority established under regulations pursuant to the Primary Products Marketing Act 1953, and (c)Any other primary producer or marketing board, other than an exempt body or a State Owned Enterprise. Statutory producer boards listed in the Eighteenth Schedule to the Act are: New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board New Zealand Dairy Board New Zealand Fishing Industry Board New Zealand Horticulture Export Authority New Zealand Meat Producers Board New Zealand Pork Industry Board New Zealand Wool Board Marketing authorities within the meaning of the Primary Products Marketing Board Act 1953 are: Berryfruit Marketing Licensing Authority Game Industry Board New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority Raspberry Marketing Council All of the above derive income from members by way of levies. The income is used to provide certain promotional activi- ties for their members. 2 In addition the Apple and Pear Marketing Board and the Dairy Board purchase all export goods produced by their mem- bers, process those goods and sell them overseas. The Boards pay for goods supplied by their members according to prices determined from time to time. The Wool Board purchases some wool from members but only when guaranteed prices cannot be gained elsewhere. Where goods are purchased from members the boards operate in a similar way to co-operatives. Section 199 of the Tax Act (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) allows mutual associations to claim a deduction (within certain limits) for rebates paid to members. Statutory producer boards are also able to claim a deduction for amounts paid for produce supplied by members. Full details of the treatment of produce payments are described in the commentary relating to changes to section 199 of the Tax Act. See section 40 of the Amendment Act. A flow chart on page 10 of this Appendix shows how the New Zealand Dairy Board operates, and the effect of the rules relating to the imputation system apply. Statutory producer boards are deemed to be companies and their activities are deemed to constitute the carrying on of a business (section 197E(2)(a) and (b)). Many boards are able to charge levies for capital development. These levies are to be treated as non-taxable income in the boards’ hands and they will be non-deductible to the member in terms of section 106(1)(a) of the Tax Act. All other levies are assessable income to the board and deductible expenditure to the member. (Section 197E(2)(c)). Section 104 of the Tax Act provides that expenditure is deductible if it is incurred in gaining or producing assessable in- come, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Some statutory producer boards have a statutory right to charge levies, and do not actually incur any expenditure in gaining or producing that type of income. Expenditure is incurred after the income is derived in relation to services provided for members. For this reason section 197E(2)(d) provides that expenditure, other than capital expenditure, incurred in satisfying the pro- ducer boards’ statutory functions will be deductible for income tax purposes. Stabilisation Accounts Most producer boards retain income resulting from the sale of goods supplied by members in prosperous periods so that greater payments can be made to members in those times when prices for their produce are . Many of the boards have made representations that income retained in this way should not be subject to tax until such time as the income is paid to mem- bers. The Government has rejected these submissions. The Tax Act does not allow deductions for provisions which are set aside to cover future expenditure unless a liability actually exists to pay the debt. To allow producer boards to claim a de- duction in respect of these retentions would place boards in a more advantageous position than any other sector of the economy. Transitional Measures Basis for Depreciation Sections 197E(3), (4), and (5) prescribe the method of determining the value, for the purposes of calculating depreciation, of assets which have been used by a board while the activities of the board were exempt from tax. For assets which are depre- ciated on a diminishing value basis, the cost will be deemed to be the actual cost price reduced by the amount of deprecia- tion which would have been allowed as a deduction if the asset had been used in a taxable activity. Buildings will be depreciated on the basis of their cost price. Any questions as to the original cost price of an asset, or the date on which it was acquired is to be decided: •By agreement between the Commissioner and the board, or •Where agreement cannot be reached, by the Commissioner. Value of Stock on Hand as at 31 March 1988 (or equivalent balance date) Sections 197E(6) and (7) provide that opening stock on hand at the date when the income of producer boards commences to be taxable must be valued at the lesser of the: •Cost price, •Market selling price, or •Price at which it cam be replaced. An auditor’s statement to this effect is required before a deduction can be allowed. The rationale behind these provisions is that if producer boards were allowed to claim a deduction in respect of opening trading stock valued at any of the options available under section 85, the board would be able to select the highest option for the initial deduction, but subsequently write down trading stock to one of the lower valuation options, in this way gain- ing an unwarranted tax advantage. 3 Subsection (9) provides that producer boards are not required to deduct and any withholding tax from dividends received from overseas and derived during the 1989 income year. Milk Treatment Companies and Corporations. Since the Milk Board was abolished rnany of the companies and corporations which were previously exempt under sec- tions 61(7) and (8) have been wound up and new business structures arranged to carry on the businesses. Those new struc- tures will be subject to tax under the Tax Act in accordance with the provisions relating to the type of business structure which has been adopted. E.g. Company, partnership or co-operative. The purpose of section 197F is to provide transitional measures relating to: •The values of fixed assets for the purposes of calculating depreciation, and •The valuation of opening trading stock for organisations which previously derived income which was exempt from tax in terms of sections 61(7) or (8), or for or- ganisations which have taken over the business of such an organisation. Transitional Provisions The transitional provisions are the same as those applying to statutory producer boards: i.e., Basis for Depreciation Sections 197F(2), (3) and (4) prescribe the method of determining the value, for the purposes of calculating depreciation of assets which have been used by a milk treatment station while the activities of the organisation were exempt from tax. For assets which are depreciated on a diminishing value basis, the cost will be deemed to be the actual cost price reduced by the amount of depreciation which would have been allowed as a deduction if the asset had been used in a taxable activity. Buildings will be depreciated on the basis of their cost price. Any questions as to the original cost price of an asset or the date on which it was acquired is to be decided: •By agreement between the Commissioner and the milk treatment station, or •Where agreement cannot be reached, by the Commissioner. Value of Stock on Hand as at 31 March 1988 (or equivalent balance date) Sections 197F(5) and (6) provide that opening stock on hand at the date when the income of milk treatment stations com- mences to be taxable must be valued at the lesser of the: •Cost price, •Market selling price, or •Price at which it cam be replaced. An auditors’ statement to this effect is required before a deduction cam be allowed. The rationale behind these provisions is that if milk treatment stations were allowed to claim a deduction in respect of opening trading stock valued at any of the options available under section 85, the treatment station would be able to select the high- est option for the initial deduction, but subsequently write down trading stock to one of the lower valuation options, in this way gaining an unwarranted tax advantage. Primary Producer Co-operative Companies Under section 200 of the Tax Act primary producer co-operative companies were able to claim a deduction in respect of profits which were reinvested in qualifying primary produce activities. This concession is repealed in section 41 of the In- come Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. Transitional Measures Section 197G provides a number of transitional measures applying to taxpayers who were eligible for the concession. The measures relate to: •The valuation of opening trading stock, •The sale of any asset the cost of which had previously been taken into account in calculating a deduction allowable in terms of section 200, and •The surrender of a shareholder’s shares, or the winding up of a primary producer co-operative company. 4 Value of Stock 1 Hand us at 31 March 1988 (or equivalent balance date) This provision is essentially the same as the measures relating to statutory producer boards and milk treatment stations. Sections 197G(2) and (3) provide that opening stock on hand at the commencement of the 1989 income year must be valued at the lesser of the: •Cost price, •Market selling price, or •Price at which it can be replaced. An auditor’s statement to this effect is required before a deduction e can be allowed. The rationale behind these provisions is that if the primary producer co-operative company was eligible for a deduction in terms of section 200 when the trading stock was purchased. It was considered appropriate, therefore, for the deduction to be limited to the amount calculated in relation to the lowest valuation option available in terms of section 85 of the Tax Act. Sale of Assets Section 197G(4) repeats a previous provision (section 200(6)). Where a company sells an asset, other than trading stock, and the cost of the asset was allowed as a deduction under sec- tion 200, the proceeds from the sale are deemed to be assessable income in the year of sale. Surrender of shares Section 197G(5) repeats the repealed section 200(8) of the Tax Act. Where hsareholders surrender shares, or on the winding up of the company, receive in excess of the paid up value of their shares, the Commissioner is authorised to treat any such excess as assessable income to the extent that the amount of the excess represents an amount allowed as a deduction in any earlier year. Note1)The provisions of section 200(7) of the Tax Act are discontinued. That section provided that in the event of wind- ing up or being taken over by non-co-operative shareholders an adjustment could be made, in the year of takeo- ver or winding up, in respect of past deductions allowed under section 200. These provisions were repealed as it was considered that the policy would deler primary producer co-operatives from diversifying. 2)Transitional provisions relating to asset values are not necessary in relation to primary producer co-operative companies. The written down value of assets will be available from the tax records and depreciation will be cal- culated according to normal tax rules. Co-operative Dairy, Milk Marketing and Pig Marketing Companies. Prior to the passingof the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, sections 201, 202, and 203 of the Tax Act provided that all income in relation to: •The collection, handling, manufacture, treatment, sale, and distribution of butter, cheese, casein, dried milk, or any other dairy produce (section 201) •The collection, handling, manufacture, treatment or marketing of milk or cream or any product of milk or cream which the Commissioner determined was dairy produce (section 202) •The collection, handling or slaughtering of pigs, bobby calves, or cull cattle, or from the treatment or marketing of any product thereof which the Commissioner determined was the product of such stock (section 203) •Rent obtained from employees engaged in the activities mentioned above (section 201 202 and 203) •Payments received as a shareholder or supplier of a company which was exempt under section 61(7) of the Tax Act (sec- tions 201 and 202) was exempt from tax as long as that income was not applied to activities not covered by the exemption. Sections 201 to 203 are repealed by section 41 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. The new section 197H intro- duces transitional provisions similar to those applying, to statutory producer boards and milk treatment stations. That is: Transitional Provisions Basis for Depreciation Sections 197H(2), (3) and (4) prescribe the method of determining the value, for the purposes of calculating depreciation, of assets which have been used by the co-operative marketing company while the activities of the organisation were exempt from tax. For 5 assets which are depreciated on a diminishing value basis, the cost will be deemed to be the actual cost price reduced by the amount of deprecation which would have been allowed as a deduction if the asset had been used in a taxable activity. Buildings will be depreciated on the basis of their cost price. Any questions as to the original cost price of am asset, or the date on which it was acquired is to be decided: •By agreement between the Commissioner amd the co-operative marketing company, or •Where agreement cannot be reached, by the Commissioner. Value of Stock on Hand as at 31 March 1988 (or equivalent balance date) Sections 197F(5) and (6) provide that opening stock on hand at the date when the income of co-operative marketing compa- nies commences to be taxable must be valued at the lesser of the: •Cost price, •Market selling price, or •Price at which it can be replaced. An auditor’s statement to this effect is required before a deduction can be allowed. The rationale behind these provisions is that if co-operative marketing companies were allowed to claim a deduction in respect of opening trading stock valued at any of the options available under section 85, the co-operative would be able to select the highest option for the initial deduction, but subsequently write down trading stock to one of the lower valuation options, in this way gaming an unwarranted tax advantage. Subsection (7) provides that regulations may be made under section 433 of the Tax Act for a number of purposes. The pur- poses specified are those which were previously provided under sections 201(2), 202(3) and 203(3). Regulations made un- der those provisions are: Co-operative Dairy Companies 'Income Tax Regulations 1955 Co-operative Milk Marketing Companies Income Tax Regulations 1960 Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies Income Tax Regulations 1964 Prior to the passing of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 these regulations provided that income derived by the co-operative company which was not invested in qualifying activities was to be deemed to be assessable income. Section 41 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 repeals the operative clauses of these regulations. Note however that the other clauses remain in force, particularly provisions relating to the surrender of shares, or winding up of the co-operative. Where shareholders surrender shares, or on the winding up of the company, receive in excess of the paid up value of their shares, the Commissioner is authorised to treat any such excess as assessable income to the extent that the amount of the excess represents an amount allowed as a deduction in any earlier year. Section 40 - Profits of Mutual Associations in respect of Transactions with Members Section 199 of the Tax Act provides that where a mutual association enters into transactions with members, profits arising from those transactions are assessable income, but, within certain limits, deductions may he claimed in respect of rebates paid to members. Deductions for rebates are restricted to the amount of profit relating to member transactions. Section 199(6) of the Tax Act provides that rebates are assessable income to members only if the rebate relates to a business transaction. Section 40 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 makes a number of amendments which modifies the operation of section 199: •As it relates to statutory producer boards, and •In relation to the introduction of a full imputation system. The definition of “association” remains unchanged. “Member” is defined in relation to statutory producer boards. A member of a board is any person who: (a)Is liable to pay a levy to a statutory producer board, or (b)Supplies produce or goods to the board in terms of its statutory functions. The definition of “rebate” is virtually the same except that it excludes any: •“Cash distribution” to which a board elects to allocate an imputation credit in terms of section 394R(1)(a), •“Cash distribution” to which a co-operative elects to allocate an imputation credit in terms of section 394X(1)(a), (These distributions are treated as dividends and, accordingly, are not deductible for tax purposes) 6 •Distributions which relate to retained funds which have previously been the source of a “notional dividend” as described in section 394R(1)(b) or section 394X(1)(b), or •Distributions by a producer board, from capital levies received, on the occasion of a winding up. These distributions are deemed not to be dividends. They are therefore not assessable in the recipient’s hands, and as capital payments are non-deductible to the board or co-operative). Subsection (2) amends section 199(3) by making it subject to a new section 199(3A). The new subsection (introduced by section 41(4)) provides that: (a)Statutory producer boards may claim a deduction for all rebates or produce payments made to members, and that re- strictions on deductions for rebates applying to other co-operatives do not apply. The reason for relaxing the rules relating to the deduction for rebates is that rebates, including produce payments, paid by boards to members are in respect of business transactions and will accordingly be subject to tax in the members’ hands. (b)The producer board may elect whether a rebate is deductible in the year it is paid, or in certain circumstances the previ- ous income year. (A rebate can include an amount paid not later than 6 months after the end of the trading year of the producer board). (c)Where a producer board pays a rebate to a member which is itself a mutual association, the amount of the rebate is deemed to be assessable income in the year in which the board claims the deduction. Section 40(3) amends section 199(3)(b) which limits the deduction for rebates paid by mutual associations, other than pro- ducer boards, to the amount of the profit applicable to member transactions. The effect of the amendment is that where a deduction for rebates paid by a co-operative company is limited to the amount of profit applicable to member transactions, in calculating the amount of that profit, the co-operative will deduct the amount of any “cash distribution” (as described in section 394X(1)(a)). The reference to section 394R(1)(a) in this section is unnecessary and is to be removed.) Section 40(5) repeals section 199(7) consequent to the repeal of sections 201 to 203 of the Tax Act. Section 199(10) lists transactions which are regarded as transactions with members. Section 40(6) introduces two new types of transaction to the list. They are: •Transactions between a producer board and member involving the acceptance by the board of produce or goods in terms of the board’s statutory functions, and •Payment of levies to a producer board by a member. Section 41 - Exemptions and Deductions relating to Primary Producer and Other Co-operative Companies No Longer to Apply. This sections repeals a number of concessions, the announcement of which was made in the Government Economic State- ment of 17 December 1987. Some consequential amendments are also made. These are: •Section 200 of the Tax Act is repealed. Deductions for profits derived by primary producer co-operative companies, and reinvested in “qualifying activities” are withdrawn. See commentary on section 197G for details of transitional provisions. •Section 201 of the Tax Act is repealed. Exemption for income derived by co-operative dairy companies is withdrawn. See commentary on section 197H for transitional measures. •Section 202 of the Tax Act is repealed. Exemption in respect of income derived by co-operative milk marketing compa- nies is withdrawn. See commentary on section 197G for transitional measures. •Section 203 of the Tax Act is repealed. Exemption in respect of income derived by co-operative pig marketing companies is withdrawn. See commentary on section 197H for transitional measures. •Regulation 5 of the: Co-operative Dairy Companies Income Tax Regulations 1955 Co-operative Milk Marketing Companies Income Tax Regulations 1960 Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies Income Tax Regulations 1964 These regulations provided that income which was exempt under sections 201 to 203 could be clawed back if profit were not reinvested in qualifying activities. They are no longer necessary. For details of provisions which remain see commen- tary on section 197H. IMPUTATION Statutory Producer Boards and Co-operative Companies This Appendix deals only with special provisions relating to producer boards and co-operatives, and should be read in conjunction with the Appendix to TIB No. 1, July 1989 which deals with imputation in general. 7 General - Statutory Producer Boards - Section 394Q Statutory producer boards are liable for income tax on income derived after the commencement of the 1989 income year, and dividend withholding payment on foreign source dividends derived in the 1990 and subsequent income years. As statutory producer boards do not have conventional shareholding structures, special provision must be made for them to impute to their members credits for tax (and dividend withholding payment) paid by them. Statutory producer board is defined in section 394Q and basically means any primary producer or marketing board estab- lished by an Act. A member of a board is any resident who, during a year in question, carries on any farming or agricultural or other busi- ness and who is liable to pay a levy to the board, or who supplies produce to the board, during the year. A statutory producer board is deemed to be a company for the purposes of the Act and is therefore required to operate an ICA for each imputation year. Credits and debits arise to the account as they do for other companies under sections 394D amd 394E of the Act. That is: Credits •Income tax paid •Excess retention tax paid •Imputation credits attached to dividends received •Dividend withholding payment credits attached to dividends received •Dividend withholding payments made •Any end of year balance in a dividend withholding payment account •Any end of year balance in a branch equivalent tax account •Any reduction in dividend withholding payments payable •Any credit to offset previous debit relating to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage Debits •Imputation credits attached to dividends paid •Any refund of income tax paid •Any refund of excess retention tax •Allocation debits (occurs where a company is in breach of the allocation rules) •Any refund of dividend withholding payments •Any credit of tax to a branch equivalent tax account •Loss of commonality of shareholding •A reversal of tax payable due to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage being overturned •Company ceases to be an ICA company For full information about how the debits and credits arise see Appendix to TIB No.1, July 1989. Special provisions relating to Statutory Producer Boards and Co-operative Companies Statutory Producer Boards - Sections 394Q to 394V Co-operative Companies - Sections 394W to 394ZB A statutory producer board or co-operative company can distribute credits to members in one of two ways - by means of 1.a notional dividend 2.a cash distribufion A determination to do so must be made within 6 months after the year of determination in respect of which the determina- tion is made (section 394R(3) and section 394X(3)) 1. Notional dividend This mechanism may be used by a statutory producer board or co-operative where the board or co-operative is required to pay tax on retained income. Notional dividends allows the board or co-operative to allocate imputation credits in much the same way as a company would allocate credits to a bonus share issue. The benefit of the use of notional dividends is that a member with a marginal tax rate lower than the company rate would be able to offset excess imputation credits against tax payable on other income. 8 The producer board or co-operative may allocate imputation credits to members on the basis of: (a)the proportion of produce transactions of the member to all produce transactions during the year of determination, or (b)the proportion of levies which a member paid to the amount of levies paid by all members , or (c)a combination of (a) and (b), or (d)any other method approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner has power to determine the extent to which a board or co-operative should have made the calculation on another basis. Example Allocation on Basis of Produce Transactions Assume a producer board has two members: A - $1,000 of produce transactions during year ending 30 June 1990 B - $2,000 of produce transactions during year ending 30 June l990 Credits amounting to $1,500 are available in the producer board’s ICA to be allocated to members. The formula in section 394T(2) (394Z for co-operatives) provides for the allocation of imputation credits to members: a x c b a = amount paid to or by the member for produce transactions during the year b = amount paid to or by all members for produce transactions during the year c = all imputation credits which the producer board has determined to attach to the notional distribution. The producer board calculates the amount of credit to be given to each as follows: A1,000 x 1,500 = 500 3,000 B2,000 x 1,500 = 1,000 3,000 The producer board is deemed to have paid a (notional) dividend to each member of the following amount: a b wherea = the amount of imputation credit attached b = the resident companies' tax rate (for the income year in which the determination is made) So, in the example above, on the basis of a company tax rate of 28%, the notional dividend paid to member A would be: 500 = $1,785.71 Note: When the No. 5 Bill was passed the company tax .28rate was 28 cents in the dollar. This has now been increased to 33 cents. Member A will therefore receive a “notional” dividend of $1,785.71 with a credit of $500 attached - this is a dividend carry- ing the maximum imputation ratio. (As all notional dividends will be fully credited the allocation rules in section 394G do not apply to producer boards.) Member A will receive no cash (hence the term “notional” dividend), merely a shareholder dividend statement. The divi- dend is derived on the date of the determination by the producer board and must be included by the member in his/her assessable income for that year. Note:In all circumstances other than the receipt of a notional dividend, a non-corporate shareholder returns as assessable income the dividend received plus the imputation credit attached. The amount of the notional dividend already in- cludes the credit. Imputation credits attached to notional dividends are therefore not added to the notional dividend paid in returning assessable income. Member A will return $1,785.71 as income and claim a credit of $500. As noted earlier, the allocation of notional dividends is a means of allowing imputation credits for tax paid by the producer board or co-operative to flow through to the member. If member A is on a tax rate which is higher than the company tax 9 rate he/she will receive no cash and will be required to pay additional tax on that notional dividend. For those on the com- pany tax rate there will be no additional liability. Those on a tax rate lower than the company rate will be able to offset excessive tax credits against tax relating to other income derived. When the cash which was represented by that notional dividend is subsequently distributed it is distributed tax-free to members (section 4A(1)(j) or (k)) - this is because tax has already been assessed to a member on that amount. However the amount which is paid to the member cannot be an amount which is deductible to the producer board or co-operative - sec- tion 4A(5) deems such a distribution to be a return of capital for the purposes of section 106(1)(a) which prohibits a deduc- tion for capital. Producer boards and co-operatives are required to keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to determine whether an amount which is distributed is an amount which was included in a notional distribution. Producer boards are not required to file company dividend statements but section 394U(3) requires that they furnish with the annual return particulars of the dividend deemed to have been paid. Section 394ZA(3) similarly provides that co-opera- tives are required to furnish an annual return showing details of dividends paid. 2. Cash Distributions The second method which the producer board or co-operative may adopt for passing on imputation or dividend withhold- ing payment credits to members is to attach the credits to a cash distribution to members which would have been deduct- ible to the board but which the board has elected to treat as non-deductible. (To allow a company to attach imputation cred- its to an amount which is deductible is effectively to allow credit for tax not paid.) Cash distributions will be particularly attractive where a producer board or co-operative is in a loss position but has re- ceived a dividend with imputation credits attached. The mechanism was designed to allow members or shareholders to utilise the credits attached to the dividend. The amount of the distribution which the producer board or co-operative elects to treat as non-deductible is deemed for the purposes of the Act to be a dividend. It will be derived by the member when it is received. A co-operative may elect to make a cash distribution to all who were shareholders at any time during year X based on the proponion of a shareholder’s produce transactions with the co-operative to the total produce transactions. A producer board may also allocate cash distributions on the basis of produce transaction, but has two further options on which to allocate such distributions: (i)the proportion that levies payable by each member bear to the total levies payable by all members of the board, or (ii)any other method approved by the Commissioner. The formula for calculating the amount of imputation credits which may be attached to a cash distribution is set out in sec- tion 394S for producer boards and section 394Y for co-operatives: a x b 1 - b wherea = the amount of the cash distribution b = the resident companies’ tax rate (for the year in which the determination is made) Example Assume a producer board makes a total produce payment for the year ended 30 June 1989 of $3,000. Member A in that year was paid $2.000 in produce transactions Member B in that year was paid $1.000 in produce transactions In July 1989 a producer board wishes to allocate credits to a total cash distribution of $900 made to members of the pro- ducer board during the year ended 30 June 1989. The cash distribution would have been deductible under the Income Tax Act but the producer Board elects to treat this amount as non-deductible in determining its assessable income. The amount of credits which may be attached to the distribution in terms ot section 394S (section 394Y for co-operatives) - on the basis of a company tax rate of 28% - is 90.0 x .28 = 350 .72 Member A is to receive $600(Allocated on the basis of produce transactions) Member B is to receive $300 10 The amount of credit to be allocated to each member is calculated according to the formula in section 394S(2) (section 394Y(2) for co-operatives: c x e d wherec = the member’s share of the cash distribution d = the total amount of the cash distribution e = the amount of imputation credits attached in respect of the cash distribution Member A therefore receives600 x 350 = 233.33 900 Member A receives a $600 cash distribution with 233.33 credits attached S/he will return $833.33 (distribution plus credits) as assessable income and claim $233.33 credit of tax. Member B receives300 x 350 = 116.66 900 Member B receives a $300 cash distribution with $116.66 credits attached. S/he will return as income $416.66 and claim a credit of $116.66. Timing of Cash and Notional Distributions Co-operative companies are entitled only once in respect of each year of determination to attach a credit to a notional dis- tribution and/or a cash distribution. Producer Boards may do so as many times in a year of determination as they consider appropriate. Co-operative companies In addition to being able to allocate credits to members by attaching them to notional distributions and cash distributions, co-operative companies which are imputation credit account companies and dividend withholding payment account com- panies may pay dividends and attach credits thereto in the normal way. In relation to allocation rules, these apply only to attachment of credits to those dividends which are not notional distribu- tions or cash distributions. Notional and cash distributions are fully credited.

The Amendment Act was introduced into Parliament as the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 8). Part I of the Amendment Act contains the legisla- tion implementing the resident withholding tax regime and also extends the fringe benefit tax regime to certain non-cash dividends provided to sharehold- ers. Part II of the Amendment Act consists of sundry miscellaneous and consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 1976. A comprehensive explanation of the provisions of the Amendment Act as Appendix A to this Bulletin will be issued with TIB No. 4 in approximately three weeks. This Bulletin summarises the new legislation with particular emphasis on the resident withholding tax provisions (interest and dividend PAYE). INTEREST PAYE 1. INTRODUCTION From 1 October 1989 a 24% withholding tax which will be known as Interest PAYE will be deducted from all interest paid by a NZ resident, or by a non-resident carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment if at any time the payer either: i)Holds a certificate of exemption; or ii)Incurs the interest expense in the course of carry- ing on taxable activity. Interest will not be subject to Interest PAYE if i)The interest is “exempt interest”; or ii)The recipient holds a certificate of exemption (such persons are referred to as “exempt recipi- ents”); or iii)The recipient is a non-resident; or iv)The interest is paid between group companies. The term taxable activity means the regular ongoing activity of any individual or organisation involving the supply of goods and services. The term has the same meaning as it does for GST purposes except that it also includes exempt supplies such as financial services and residential rentals. It does not apply to wages or salary. Exempt interest is defined in the Act. Some of the more common types of exempt interest are the inter- est payments in respect of: •Hire purchase agreements •Trade credit •Specified leases •Bonus Bonds and Post Office Bonus Bonds •Inflation Adjusted Bonds 2. INTEREST For the purposes of the Interest PAYE regime, the term “interest”, which is any payment made in re- spect of money lent other than a repayment of money lent, has been expanded to include redemption payments as defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. This includes commercial bills, as well as the redemption of any other debt instrument, to the extent that it is not a repayment of money lent. Interest PAYE is deductible from the difference between the original issue price and the redemption price of the stock and not the difference between the acquisition price of the stock (if bought on the open market) and the redemption price of the stock. Example A person buys the following Government stock on 1 June 1989 for $49,000. Coupon interest rate12% Face value$50,000 Issue price$45,000 Maturity date31 December 1989 If the person holds the stock to maturity a sum of $48,800 will be received. The redemption payment (which is the interest for Interest PAYE purposes) with respect to the stock is $5,000 despite the fact that the difference between the person’s acquisition price of the stock and its redemp- tion price is only $1,000 3. $5,000 THRESHOLD A person who does not hold a certificate of exemption and who pays interest in the course of carrying on a taxable activity or who holds a Category B type certificate of exemption (e.g., tax exempt entities, non- profit bodies and tax loss taxpayers) is not required to deduct Interest PAYE from the first $5,000 of interest paid on or after 1 October 1989 and before 31 March 1990. However, the balance of any interest paid in excess of $5,000 during this period is subject to Interest PAYE. From 1 April 1990 persons in this category will only be liable to deduct Interest PAYE if the resident withholding interest in the previous year (to 3 31 March) exceeded $5,000 or if it did not, once the accumulated interest paid in the year exceeds $5,000, Resident withholding interest is the interest that is not exempt interest or paid to an exempt recipient. 4.LIABILITY OF AGENT/TRUSTEE TO DEDUCT INTEREST PAYE Where an agent receives interest on behalf of another person without tax being correctly deducted that agent must deduct tax before forwarding it to the recipient unless the agent holds a valid certificate of exemption and receives the interest as a trustee (other than a bare trustee). Agents or trustees carrying on a taxable activity through a fixed establishment in New Zealand, whether resident or non-resident, are liable to deduct Interest PAYE from interest payments they make on behalf of another person. 5. PAYMENT OF INTEREST PAYE TO THE DEPARTMENT Persons deducting Interest PAYE must pay the Inter- est PAYE to the Inland Revenue at a minimum of six- monthly intervals. Where a person estimates he or she will deduct $500 or more (in aggregate) of Interest PAYE during each month of any year the deductions are required to be paid to the Inland Revenue by the 14th of the month following the month the deduction was made. (i.e., in which the interest was paid). There are two compulsory pay in dates per year regardless of the amount of Interest PAYE deducted They are 14 April and 14 October Where the person will not deduct $500 or more (in aggregate) of Interest PAYE during each month of any year that person is required to pay the deductions to the Inland Revenue by the 14th of the month follow- ing the month in which the accumulated deductions to date total $500. 6. TAX DEDUCTION CERTIFICATES Where interest PAYE has been deducted from interest payments a tax deduction certificate giving full details of the interest and tax must be given to the recipient by the payer by 20 May in the year following the end of the income year in which the interest was paid. Tax Deduction Certificates may be issued periodically throughout the year or for the accumulated totals at the end of the year. While an Inland Revenue form is available there is provision in the Act for the Commis- sioner to approve a different format provided the information contained on the certificate meets the requirements of the Act. The recipient of the interest will be required to show this information in their end of year tax return. Al- though the Tax Deduction certificate does not have to be provided with the tax return it is necessary for it to be retained for a period of three years. 7. ANNUAL RECONCILIATION STATEMENT All payers of interest will be required to furnish to the Commissioner a reconciliation of the total amount of interest paid for the year and the total Interest PAYE deducted, which should reconcile to the total amount interest PAYE paid to the Inland Revenue. This must be supplied by 31 May in the year following the end of the income year. 8. CERTIFICATE OF EXEMPTION A certificate of exemption will allow a person or organisation to receive interest or dividends without deduction of PAYE. An application for exemption must be made in writing, using form IR 15E. The following groups are eligible to apply for a certificate of exemption: Category A - Those persons/organisations to whom the $5,000 threshold does not apply. 1.REGISTERED BANK, TRUSTEE BANK, OR BUILDING SOCIETY 2.ANY TRUSTEE COMPANY, THE PUBLIC TRUS- TEE, AND THE MAORI TRUSTEE . 3.TAXPAYERS WITH INCOME OF MORE THAN $2 MILLION 4.TAXPAYERS WITH ESTIMATED INCOME OF MORE THAN $2 MILLION 5.FINANCE HOUSE Category B - Those persons/organisations to whom the $5,000 threshold does apply, provided the $5,000 threshold was not exceeded in the preceding year. 6.CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS 7.SPORTS OR RACING CLUBS 8.IMPROVEMENT OR RESEARCH PROMOTER 9.LOCAL OR PUBLIC AUTHORITY 10.FRIENDLY SOCIETIES OR CREDIT UNIONS 11.NON-PROFIT BODIES 12.TAXPAYERS WITH LOSSES (OR ANTICIPATED LOSSES) 9.CANCELLATION OF CERTIFICATES OF EX- EMPTION Certificates of exemption will be issued for an unlim- ited period in all cases except where the exemption is granted under category B number 12. The period the exemption applies to in these cases will be printed on the certificate. 4 Certificates can be cancelled at a later date if circum- stances under which they were issued change. If a person or organisation holding a certificate of exemp- tion no longer meets the criteria under which the certificate of exemption was obtained that person/ organisation must meet certain obligations within 5 working days. Those obligations are: (a)Advise the Department that the grounds for holding the exemption no longer apply. (b)Return the certificate of exemption to the Depart- ment. The Inland Revenue may cancel a certificate of exemp- tion for any of the following reasons: (a)The person or organisation no longer qualifies for the exemption; (b)The person or organisation does not qualify for the exemption and the certificate was issued on the basis of misleading information; (c)Where the exemption was granted to persons or organisations under category A number 4 and; (i)evidence shows that the assessable income before allowable deductions was less than $2,000,000 in the relevant accounting year; or (ii)satisfactory evidence of assessable income before deductions is not provided; or (iii)Inland Revenue believe the evidence pro- vided is misleading. (d)The holder of the certificate of exemption has not paid income tax due by the due date for payment. In each case the Inland Revenue will notify the holder of the certificate that the exemption no longer applies. The holder has 5 working days to return the certificate to the Inland Revenue and to inform all persons to whom the certificate has been shown that it is no longer valid. 10. GAZETTE NOTICES Where a certificate of exemption has been cancelled or has expired the number of that certificate of exemp- tion will be published in the Gazette. Also published in the Gazette will be the number of the certificates of exemption that are reissued after a previous certificate has been cancelled or expired. 11.DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS - FOR NON- BUSINESS PERSONS After 1 April 1990, where a person or organisation pays interest (other than to an exempt recipient) which is to be claimed as a deduction from assessable income, and does not deduct Interest PAYE because the person or organisation is not carrying on a taxable activity, or because it qualifies for the $5,000 thresh- old, it must disclose to the Inland Revenue the follow- ing information with its annual return of income for the year in which the interest was paid: (a)The full name and last known address of the recipient; (b)The total interest paid to the recipient in that income year; and (c)The tax file number of the recipient. 12. DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS - FOR FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Special disclosure requirements apply to exempt recipients with respect to financial arrangements upon which interest is paid where the exempt recipients either buy such arrangements from, or sell such arrangements to a non-exempt recipient on or after 1 April 1990. If during a year an exempt recipient buys a financial arrangement from a non-exempt recipient or sells a financial arrangement to such a person that exempt recipient is required to include the following informa- tion with their annual return of income for the year in which the transaction took place: (a)The full name and last known address of the non- exempt person. (b)The date of acquisition or sale. (c)The consideration paid or received by the exempt person in respect of the acquisition or sale (exclu- sive of fees). (d)The tax file number of the non-exempt person. 13. ASSESSMENTS Assessments of Interest PAYE may be issued to Payers. The same right of objection rules apply to Interest PAYE as apply to income tax assessments. 14. ADDITIONAL TAX FOR DEFAULT Additional tax at a flat 10% of the amount of the Interest PAYE paid late or outstanding will be charged, with a further 10% being added at the end of every 6 months while the amount remains outstand- ing. 15. OFFENCES The following are listed as offences against the Act and carry severe penalties: (a)Failure to deduct Interest PAYE; in whole or in part. (b)Failure to pay the Interest PAYE deductions to the Inland Revenue. (c)Making a false or misleading application for exemption to the Inland Revenue. 5 (d)Altering a certificate of exemption, falsely claim- ing to be an exempt recipient, possession of an imitation certificate of exemption, causing or attempting to cause a person to refrain from deducting Interest PAYE by production of any document. (e)Obtaining or attempting to obtain credit for interest PAYE deductions which belong to another person. (f)Failure by an exempt recipient to inform the Inland Revenue that the grounds for obtaining the certificate no longer apply. (g)Failure to provide a tax deduction certificate for interest PAYE. DIVIDEND PAYE 1. INTRODUCTION As from 1 October 1989 New Zealand companies are required to deduct Resident Withholding Tax from dividends paid to its shareholders resident in New Zealand. This tax is known as "Dividend PAYE" and is referred to as such throughout this bulletin. For Dividend PAYE purposes there are four (4) main types of dividends. They are: •Dividends (ordinary); •Taxable bonus issues; •Specified dividends; •Dividends not liable for Dividend PAYE. Dividends (Ordinary) are dividends including taxable bonus issues, but exclude non-cash and specified dividends. Taxable Bonus Issue is any bonus issue made in lieu of a dividend, or a bonus issue the company elects to be a taxable bonus issue. Specified Dividends are dividends paid by: •a company not resident in New Zealand; •a company whose constitution prohibits all of its income from being distributed to its proprietor member or shareholders; •a tax exempt company; •a company engaged in life insurance or reinsurance; •a company when that dividend is claimed as a deduction from its income under section 194(5) of the Tax Act (i.e., dividend paid in respect of speci- fied preference shares); •a Maori Authority. Dividends Not Liable for Dividend PAYE are: •non-cash dividends subject to FBT; •dividends paid to companies whose income from dividends is not taxable; •excess remuneration treated as a dividend under sections 97 and 190 of the Tax Act; •dividends paid to holders of a “Certificate of Ex- emption from Interest and Dividend PAYE”. Several of the rules relating to Dividend PAYE apply equally to each type of dividend while some rules relate only to a particular type. This bulletin sets out, firstly, details relating to specific kinds of dividends and, secondly, points common to all types. 2. ORDINARY DIVIDENDS Dividend PAYE - On what is it Calculated? Dividend PAYE is calculated on the “gross” dividend (i.e., the amount of the dividend actually paid plus any imputation and/or dividend withholding pay- ment credit attached to that dividend but before the deduction of Dividend PAYE). Dividend PAYE - How much is it? The amount of Dividend PAYE to be deducted from ordinary dividends is calculated by multiplying the amount of the “gross” dividend by 33 cents in the $1.00. The amount calculated is then reduced by the total of the imputation and/or dividend withholding payment credits (if any) attached to that dividend. The difference is the amount of Dividend PAYE to be deducted. Example: Abacus Finance Services Ltd pays a dividend of $10,000.00. It attaches a $1,000.00 imputation credit to the dividend. Dividend paid$10,000 add imputation credits$ 1,000 “Gross” dividend (on which PAYE is calculated)$11,000 Dividend PAYE at 33% (of $11,000.00)$3,630.00 less imputation credit attached dividend1,000.00 Amount of Dividend PAYE payable$2,630.00 Dividend PAYE - Payer’s Obligation to Shareholders Whenever dividends, other than specified dividends, are paid a shareholder dividend statement must be given to the shareholder. This statement is to show: •the name of the company; •the date of the payment of the dividend; •the name and address of the shareholder to whom the dividend was paid; •the amount of non-resident withholding tax (if any) deducted; 6 •the amount of any imputation credit attached to the dividend; •the amount of any dividend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend - Note: For the purposes of advising shareholders, Dividend PAYE is included in this amount; •the total credits (imputation and dividend withhold- ing payments - including Dividend PAYE); •the total of the dividend paid to the shareholder and the total credits. Dividend PAYE is treated as dividend withholding payment credits for the purposes of shareholder dividend statements. End of Year Procedures No additional end of year work is caused by the introduction of Dividend PAYE. An annual Imputa- tion and Dividend Withholding Payment Account return (IR 4J) is still required. This will indicate what, if any, information the Inland Revenue may want in respect of Dividend PAYE deducted during the year ending 31 March. 3. SPECIFIED DIVIDENDS Dividend PAYE - How much is it? The amount of Dividend PAYE to be deducted from specified dividends is calculated by multiplying the amount of the Specified Dividend by 33 cents in the $1.00. As no imputation nor dividend withholding payment credit can be attached to a specified divi- dend, the amount of dividend PAYE can not be reduced in a manner similar to that deducted from ordinary dividends. Example: Specified dividend declared$11,000.00 Calculate Dividend PAYE @ 33%$ 3,630.00 What documentation is required when a Specified Dividend is paid? If a specified dividend is paid a “Resident Withhold- ing Tax Deduction Certificate” (IR 17) is to be com- pleted and a copy given to the recipient of that divi- dend. The IR 17 will show details of each payment, or a summary of all payments made for the tax year. It is to be given to the recipient either at the time of the payment of the dividend or annually, but no later than 20th May following the end of the tax year the dividend was paid; whichever the payer chooses. The information to be shown on the IR 17 is: •the full name and address of the payer; •the full name and last known address of the recipi- ent; •the period (year to 31 March) to which the deduc- tion relates; •the amount of dividend PAYE deducted; •total dividend (sum of amount actually paid and the Dividend PAYE deducted). End of Year Procedures Payers of Specified Dividends must, not later than 30 May, complete an annual reconciliation statement (IR 17S) and send it to: Inland Revenue Processing Centre PO Box 40-141 UPPER HUTT This will show: •the amount of the Specified Dividends paid subject to Dividend PAYE; •the amount of Dividend PAYE deducted; •the amount of the Specified Dividends paid which were not subject to Dividend PAYE. 4. TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES Companies making a taxable bonus issue will not, in effect, deduct Dividend PAYE from that issue. The taxable bonus issue has to be grossed up to a pre PAYE figure and the PAYE calculated on that grossed up value. The shareholder(s) must show in their tax return the total of the taxable bonus issue and the PAYE. 5. SPECIAL CASES (1)Agents and Trusts Dividend PAYE does not have to be deducted from dividends paid to another person if the payer is satisfied that the other person; •is a bank, building society, the Public or Maori Trustee or a trustee company, or •holds a valid certificate of exemption from interest and dividend PAYE and that certificate has not been cancelled. If an agent or trustee of a bare trust receives a divi- dend, from which PAYE should have been deducted but was not, that agent or bare trustee must; •deduct PAYE from the dividend at the time it was received if the person actually deriving the dividend does not hold a valid certificate of exemption, •pay that deduction to the Inland Revenue by the 14th day of the following month. Whenever dividend PAYE is deducted by an agent or trustee under the circumstances set out above the 7 dividend is to be treated as a specified dividend and the rules relating to those types of dividends apply. (2)Maori Authorities Distributions made by Maori Authorities are, for Dividend PAYE purposes, to be treated as Specified Dividends and the rules relating to those types of dividends apply. 6.POINTS COMMON TO ALL TYPES OF DIVIDENDS Dividend PAYE - when and where is it payable? Dividend PAYE must be paid to the Inland Revenue Department no later than the 14th day of the month following the month in which the dividend was paid. All payments of Dividend PAYE are to be made to: Inland Revenue Processing Centre P O Box 40-104 UPPER HUTT TT Once a payment has been receipted at the processing centre a replacement pay-in slip will be issued, to- gether with a self addressed envelope, facilitating easier future payments. Are there any Penalties for late Payments? Yes. If Dividend PAYE is not been paid by the due date, 10 percent additional tax will be charged on top of the amount of Dividend PAYE calculated. If the amount outstanding has still not been paid six months after the due date a further 10 percent will be added. Dividend PAYE - is it to be deducted from dividend paid to Non-residents? No. Non-resident withholding lax (NRWT) is still required to be deducted from dividends paid to persons who are not resident in New Zealand. 7. EFFECT ON SHAREHOLDERS Dividend PAYE deducted from dividends, other than specified dividends, will be shown as a “dividend withholding payment credit” on the shareholder dividend statement issued by the company. Dividend PAYE deducted from specified dividends will be shown as “Dividend PAYE deducted” on the Tax Deduction Certificate (IR 17). No matter what the deduction is called, or the type of form received, the amount of PAYE is to be taken off any income tax payable at the end of the year. Any excess is to be refunded to the shareholder. The amount of dividend to be shown in the shareholders’ returns is to include the dividend actually received plus any credits attached. These credits will include imputation/dividend withholding payment credits (if any) and Dividend PAYE deducted. As from 1 April 1990 “provisional income” will not include dividends from which PAYE has been de- ducted. Provisional tax for the 1990 tax year can be estimated to take into account any PAYE that may be deducted from dividends received from 1 October 1989. Normal penalties will apply if the amount is under-estimated. 8.FRINGE BENEFIT TAX ON NON-CASH DIVIDENDS From 1 October 1989 companies resident in New Zealand are required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) in respect of non-cash dividends paid or made available to non-corporate shareholders. Non-cash dividends are dividends other than; •dividends paid in money, •non-cash dividends. For FBT purposes the company that provides the non- cash dividends is deemed to be an employer and the shareholder recipient is deemed to be an employee. Exclusions from FBT apply to non-cash dividends paid or made available to companies, to holders of certificates of exemption, and to certain other divi- dends. Non-cash dividends that are subject to FBT are not subject to income tax in the hands of the shareholders. OTHER AMENDMENTS In addition to the legislation implementing the resi- dent withholding tax, the Amendment Act also contains the following amendments to the Income Tax Act Part I - Resident Withholding Tax •definition of the term “interest”, to clarify that the term includes payments made under third party arrangements, •definition of new terms “non-cash dividends” and “working day” •definition of the term “dividends”, to provide the 8 circumstances whereby forgiveness of debt to a shareholder gives rise to a dividend and to provide valuation rules in respect of a low interest loans to a shareholder that gives rise to a dividend, •a restriction of the Child Rebate so that it no longer applies to resident withholding income (interest and dividends), •repeal of the $200 interest and dividends exemption with a transitional provision for the 1989/90 income year, •exemption from income tax of non-cash dividends to the extent to which such dividends are subject to fringe benefit tax, •removal of the exemption that applies to companies deriving dividends that arise from for giveness of debt, •definition of the term “close of trading spot ex- change rate”, •change to the due date for payment of non resident withholding tax from the 20th of the month to the 14th of the month, •imposition of fringe benefit tax on non cash divi- dends provided to non-corporate shareholders, •changes to the pay-period taxpayer provisions, •miscellaneous amendments and transitional provi- sions relating to provisional tax, •amendments to the imputation and dividend withholding payment regimes to provide reporting arrangements for dividend withholding tax, •increase from $2 to $5 the amount of tax that the Commissioner may exercise a discretion as to whether to collect or refund, •inclusion of resident withholding tax in the defini- tion of the term “residual income tax”, •publication of names of persons convicted for failing to deduct or to account for resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax, •an amendment to the record keeping requirements of charities; Part II- Miscellaneous Amendments •clarification of the meaning of the term “trustee”, •exclusion from “dividends” of certain livestock and wine and whisky revaluation reserves distributed on winding up, •amendments relating to the imposition of fringe benefit tax in respect of low interest loans provided by private companies to shareholder employees, •in relation to the new superannuation regime, to clarify that for the purpose of determining whether an employer’s obligations to a superannuation fund are satisfied the amount of specified superannuation withholding tax is deemed to be received by the fund, •exclusion from assessable income for family support purposes of recovery of depreciation on the sale of a building, •amendments to the imputation legislation relating to the treatment of export tax credit refunds as debits to the Imputation Credit Account (ICA) and a relaxation of the provisions dealing with the limita- tion on refunds of income tax where the ICA has insufficient credit balance, •a transitional provision to ensure that interest is not charged on provisional tax payable by category 1 superannuation schemes and life insurance compa- nies in respect of any specified superannuation or annuity income for the income years ending 31 March 1989 to 30 September 1989, •clarification of the terminal tax payment dates applicable to taxpayers who are neither employees nor provisional taxpayers, •clarification of the due date for payment of penal tax being no later than the 28th day after the date of issue of the assessment of penal tax, •reduction from 40.5 cents to 33 cents in the rate of income tax payable by superannuation category 3 schemes for the income year commencing 1 April 1989 and subsequent years. Reference:Appendix A to TIB No. 3, September 1989. To be issued with TIB No. 4 9 GST - LICENSED LOTTERY PROMOTERS SUMMARY The Department has been asked to consider the GST implications where a licensed lottery promoter organ- ises a raffle or lottery. BACKGROUND A licensed lottery promoter is engaged to promote the sale of tickets in a lottery, raffle or game of chance. Section 32 to 35 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 govern who may conduct a lottery. Apart from section 33 (which allows a person to conduct a lottery, provided the prizes do not exceed $50.00) all lotteries must be conducted by a “society”. The definition of a “society” is: “means any corporation, sole, association of persons (whether incorporated or not), or local or affiliated branch of any such organisation, that is established and conducted entirely for any purpose other than a commercial one”. RULING Clearly a licensed promoter could not meet this definition and therefore would not be granted a licence. This has been confirmed by Internal Affairs. It is the person (society) to whom the licence is granted who conducts the lottery. That person engages the licensed promoter to promote the lottery. Although section 5(10) of the GST Act 1985 makes reference to licensed promoters the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 clearly states that they cannot conduct lotteries on their own behalf. They are therefore acting on behalf of the person who holds a licence to conduct a lottery or where a group of people acting co-operatively, as an agent of the group. The GST implications are as follows: Promoter Output tax on Commission (if registered) Input tax credits for any expenses, e g., motor vehicle expenses. Individual Clubs The receipts for selling tickets are payments for the supply of services. If registered for GST purposes there is a GST liability on these receipts. If not regis- tered these receipts would be taken into account in determining whether there is a liability to be regis- tered. Registered persons can also claim an input credit in respect of the costs incurred in selling of tickets. Co Op. Societies Output tax on gross receipts - less any cash prizes. Input tax credits for: •Commission paid to promoter. •Prizes of goods or services purchased (subject to tax invoice, etc., requirements). •Any other costs, e.g., printing of ticket. •Payment to any individual club that is registered for GST purposes. Reference HO REF: GST A.4.1 GST Manual- Chapter 7 Part 1.1 Lotteries - Chapter 7 Part 6 Agents SHAREHOLDER/EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION This item restates the Department’s policy in relation to the assessability and deductibility of shareholder/ employee remuneration declared after the end of a financial year. BACKGROUND It is common for proprietary companies to determine directors’ fees, bonuses or extra salaries after the end of an income year once the annual accounts have been completed. The remuneration so determined is claimed as a deduction by the company in the year to balance date. The directors and shareholder/employ- ees return the same remuneration in the following year, being the year of receipt. RULING Following TRA Case 12 (1979), 3 TRNZ 127, the Department accepted the above practice where it is clear that the company was definitely committed to the payment of a quantified amount of directors’ fees, bonuses or extra salary prior to balance dale. The company will be considered to be committed to the payment by the passing of a properly authorised resolution in the company's minute books before the end of the income year. As to the question of the assessability of the remu- neration the law is settled that salary or wages or similar types of income are derived for tax purposes at the time the income is paid or otherwise made available to the employee. This is so notwithstanding that the services giving rise to the income may have been rendered or performed in an earlier year. The timing of the payment will also determine when any PAYE tax deductions or withholding payments should be paid to Inland Revenue. 10 The Department has also accepted that where a regular pattern of backdating the deduction by the company has been established over a period of years, that practice will be allowed to continue. This would be the case whether or not the legal requirement of a fully committed resolution had been met. The depart- ment would expect that established practice to con- tinue regardless of the effects of the recent changes to the company income tax rates.

Although this has been omitted any expenditure incurred in the preparation of all annual returns is deductible pursuant to section 165 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Income Tax (Foreign Investment Fund Determina- tions) Regulations 1989 Section 245S of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides for a formal procedure, whereby a foreign entity, or any person holding rights in relation to that entity, can request a determination from the Commissioner as to whether or not the rights held constitute interests in a Foreign Investment Fund. Determination regulations known as the “Income Tax (Foreign Investment Fund Determinations) Regula- tions 1989” were passed by Order in Council on 31 July 1989 and are included as Appendix B to this bulletin. They were notified in the “Gazette” on 3 August 1989 and take effect 28 days from that date, being 31 August 1989. Whilst the determination regulations make provision for a fee to be charged to the applicant for a determi- nation, no fees will be charged in respect of applica- tions received by 31 March 1991, in relation to a request for a determination to be made in terms of section 245S of the Income Tax Act 1976. An application form IR 100B, “Foreign Investment Fund Regime - Application for a Determination under section 245S of the Income Tax Act 1976” is available for persons wishing to avail themselves of the deter- mination procedures and can be obtained from your local Inland Revenue office. The reverse side of the IR 100B provides an outline of the determination regulations and procedures. Reference:Appendix B to TIB No. 3, September 1989 PRESS RELEASES 1.Non-profit Bodies Facing PAYE Deductions “Thousands of sports clubs, charities and non profit organisations may have 24% PAYE deducted from the interest they receive from 1 October”, the Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, said today. “This is because even though they are not liable to tax and qualify for a certificate of exemption from Interest PAYE, they have not applied for one”, Mr Henry said. The Department has been advertising the availability of the certificates including a freephone service. Only 3000 have applied so far out of an expected 26,000. “If these organisations do not apply to Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption by 31 August they will not receive it in time for their bank to process, and as a result Interest PAYE will be deducted from their interest” Mr Henry said. A wide range of people and organisations qualify for a certificate of exemption and can still get one by immediately completing an application form which is available from any Inland Revenue office. The Interest PAYE freephones are still operational and can give advice or send an application form. The number to ring is 0800 802 803. Mr Henry also stressed “Once the certificate of ex- emption is received the holder will have to advise the bank or payer of interest immediately so that the bank can ensure the 24% Interest PAYE is not deducted”. If an organisation does not apply for a certificate of exemption in time and Interest PAYE is deducted that organisation will have to apply to Inland Revenue to get the tax back. 2.600 Happier Taxpayers - Problem Resolution Service Over 600 taxpayers are much happier after having their tax problems sorted out through Inland Rev- enue’s Problem Resolution Service. The Service was launched in May of this year to handle complaints from taxpayers who have been unable to resolve their problem through the Department’s normal channels. “In the two months ending June 1989, 638 taxpayers have used the service”, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, said today. “Approximately 65% were experiencing delays in receiving refunds and replies to letters. 70% of their 11 problems were the result of staff errors and work backlogs. Where it is found the errors were attribut- able to staff members, immediate training is given to reduce the likelihood of the problem reoccurring” Mr Henry said. Inland Revenue says that the Problem Resolution Service managed to sort out the majority of problems within 5 working days. “We have received a very favourable response, to the establishment of the service, from both the public and professions. Although one very upset person who contacted the service suggested that his problem could be best resolved by lynching the Commissioner. However, after using the Service his opinion of the Department had greatly improved and my neck is safe”, Mr Henry said. Another taxpayer, with a relatively minor problem which had not been sorted out through normal chan- nels, was referred to the Service. Upon checking the file it was found that the taxpayer had made a number of errors when completing his tax returns. “We found he was entitled to an additional refund”, Mr Henry said. An explanatory pamphlet on the Problem Resolution Service is available from any Inland Revenue office. HOW INTEREST/ADDITIONAL TAX IS IMPOSED Under the system operating for 1989 provisional tax, there are three ways in which taxpayers can be penal- ised, and they could in certain circumstances incur all three penalties. These penalties are: 1.Late Payment Penalty (Sec 398) Where an instalment is short paid, late paid or not paid, 10% additional tax will be imposed. This could also be subject to six monthly incremental penalties. 2.Underestimation Penalty (Sec 384) Where provisional tax is calculated using the estimate option and the amount last estimated is less than 80% of the residual income tax, a flat 10% additional tax for under estimation will be imposed. Where taxpayers voluntarily estimate, the additional tax is 10% of the lesser of; (i)the difference between the 1989 provisional tax paid up to the third instalment date and the 1989 residual income tax assessed; (ii)the difference between the 1989 provisional tax paid up to the third instalment date and the 1988 residual income tax increased by 10%. •Where taxpayers have 1989 provisional income in excess of $1,000,000, i.e., compulsory esti- mates, the additional tax is 10% of the differ- ence between 1989 provisional tax paid and 1989 residual income tax. 3.“Use of Money” Interest (Sec 398A) For (i)all non-individuals who are provisional taxpayers; (ii)all individuals in the capacity of trustees, i.e., beneficiaries’ income is excluded, and (iii)individuals where 1989 provisional income is more than $100,000 or those who estimate. Interest is calculated on a daily basis at a rate of 10% per annum and will be: •charged to the taxpayer if residual income tax is more than provisional tax; •paid to the taxpayer if residual income tax is less than provisional tax. Interest is applied to the difference between the total PROVISIONAL TAX “USE OF MONEY” INTEREST/PENALTY PROVI- SIONS Over recent weeks concern has been expressed by tax practitioners that insufficient information has been made available to them in respect of the new addi- tional tax/interest application rules, particularly in relation to interest. Obvious confusion has arisen over the differentiation between penalties and interest charged to the taxpayer and interest payable by the Department. The purpose of this item is to clarify these rules as they apply to 1989 provisional and residual income tax payments. Before giving a brief overview of how the interest provisions are applied, it is necessary that the reader understand the interest concept. That is - that the interest calculated recognises the use of money during the period from the third provisional tax instalment due date to the date interest ceases to accrue. It is not a penalty for any default in payment or an underesti- mation of liability. These latter two instances are explained in 1 and 2 below. Throughout the text reference is made repeatedly to the term ‘residual income tax’. This term relates to the difference between the total amount of tax assessed (including late payment and underestimation penal- ties) and the amount of tax paid. 12 amount of tax assessed, including additional tax for late payment and underestimation and the amount of tax paid. It is calculated on a daily basis using the following formula: a x b x c 365 where (a)is the amount underpaid/overpaid, (b)is the rate of interest - currently 10%, (c)is the number of days that interest is payable. INTEREST APPLICATION DATE Interest is imposed from the third provisional tax instalment date until the earlier of: •the date of the assessment; •the date the tax, including penalties, is paid in full; •the terminal tax due date. Should an assessment be issued more than thirty days before the residual income tax date, the amount of interest imposed at that assessment date will not change, provided the TOTAL amount assessed is paid within thirty days of the date of the assessment. The fact that residual income tax is not due until 7 Febru- ary 1990 will not avoid the incurring of interest. The interest charge is for the “use of money”. If payment is not received in full within this thirty day period, interest will continue to be charged from the date of the assessment to the residual income tax due date. In most cases this will be 7 February for 31 March balance dates. Any amounts outstanding beyond 7 February will attract late payment penalties. EXAMPLE Taxpayer is a Company 1988 provisional income is$55,000 1988 residual income tax is$26,400 Using the special company formula, 1989 provisional tax is$18,223 All instalments are paid in full on time 1989 provisional income is$75,000 1989 residual income tax is$21,000 1989 assessment issued 21 November 1989 As provisional tax paid is less than 1989 residual income tax, interest must be imposed. 1989 residual income tax is$21,000 1989 provisional tax paid is$18,223 Amount underpaid$2,777a Interest rate10%b Number of days from 7 March 1989 to 20 November 1989258c $2,777 x 10% x 258$196.29 365 The 1989 assessment would show - 1989 residual income tax$2,777.00 Interest$ 196.20 Total Payable$ 2,973.29 This amount would not increase if it was paid before 20 December 1989. Inland Revenue will not pay out interest on voluntary payments. Any interest charged or paid for use of money is neither assessable nor deductible to the taxpayer. INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF BAD DEBTS SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ACCRUALS RULES INTRODUCTION This item states the Department’s policy on the treatment of bad debts under the accrual provisions of the Act. Where the accruals provisions do not apply the Department’s policy has not changed. BACKGROUND The accruals regime applies to financial arrangements. Therefore debt that has arisen under a financial arrangement, after the implementation date of that financial arrangement, is subject to the accruals treatment of bad debts. Debt that arose before the relevant implementation date, or debt that is an excepted financial arrange- ment, is not subject to the accruals provisions and is treated in the same way as prior to the introduction of the accruals regime. COMMENT A bad debt comprising income from a financial arrangement previously returned by the taxpayer will be an allowable deduction under section 64G(1) of the Act. A deduction for principal will only be allowable under section 64G(2) where the taxpayer is in the business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and the parties to the arrangement are not associated persons. A deduction for the principal will be allowed for a dealer who is an associated person under sections 104 and 106(1)(b) of the Act if section 106(1)(a) is satisfied. If the taxpayer is not in the business of holding or dealing in such financial 13 arrangements, a deduction will not allowable for the principal. On the remission of the debt a base price adjustment is calculated. A deduction is only allowable under the base price adjustment for a holder who is (a)In the business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements; and (b)Not an associated person with the debtor, - otherwise section 64F(6) applies.

1 This Appendix to TIB No. 3 explains the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1989 which was en- acted on 26th July 1989. Part 1 of the Act contains legislation implementing the Resident Withholding Tax Regime and extends the Fringe Benefit Regime to include certain non- cash dividends paid to shareholders. Part II of the Act consists of sundry consequential and miscella- neous amendments. Note:There are a number of issues relating to the practical application of the Resident Withholding Tax regime which have been or are under consid- eration. An explanation of these outstanding issues will be issued as an appendix to a future TIB. SECTION 1 SHORT TITLE The Act shall be titled the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2 ) 1989 SECTION 2 INTERPRETATION “Non Cash Dividends” Subsection (1) amends section 2 by inserting a definition of the term “non-cash dividend” which means any dividend other than a dividend to the extent that it is paid in money; or is a taxable bonus issue as that term is defined in section 4 (3) of this Act. For the purposes of the definition, a dividend that is “paid in money” does not include any dividend that arises in terms of section 4(1)(b) to (e) of the principal Act. The new definition identifies those dividends that will be subject to fringe benefit tax when paid or made available to non-corporate shareholders refer to commentary below on section 14 of the Amend- ment Act. “Interest” Section 2 is further amended by repealing the existing “Interest” definition and inserting a new definition. The new definition adds after the words “.... in respect of money lent” the words “.... to the person making the payment or to any other per- son.” This amendment clarifies that where the original borrower on lends to a third party the transaction will be one of “money lent” and as such continues to be covered by the Interest withholding tax regime. “Working Day” Section 2 is further amended by inserting the following definition: “Working Day” which means any day of the week other than (a)Saturday, Sunday, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, Labour Day, the Sover- eign's birthday, and Waitangi Day (b)A day in the period commencing with the 25th December in any year and ending with the 15th day of January in the following year. Where there are requirements within the Act to complete certain actions within a specified number of days the use of the term “working days” will prevent difficulties arising where weekends or holidays shorten the time available. Application date. These amendments apply in respect of the tax on income derived on or after the 1st day of October 1989. SECTION 3 MEANING OF THE TERM “DIVIDENDS” 1.Section 3 amends the definition of “divi- dends” in section 4 of the principal Act. 2.Section 3(1) inserts a new paragraph (ba) into subsection (1) of section 4. The new provision makes it clear that where a company forgives an amount payable under a loan made to a share- holder the amount of the loan is treated as a divi- dend if it is virtually a distribution of profits or an amount capitalised by way of a bonus issue. 3.The amendment confirms the existing appli- cation of the definition of dividends whereby forgiveness of a loan made to a shareholder has been regarded as a sum distributed to the share- holder under section 4(1)(a) of the current defini- tion (as inserted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988) and also under section 4(1)(a) of the previous definition to the extent that the com- pany has retained earnings (Campbell v CIR) 1968. 4.The amendment outlines the circumstances in which a loan is considered to be forgiven. 5.Section 3(2) of the Amendment Act amends section 4(1 )(e) of the principal Act by removing the 2 requirement for the Commissioner to form an opinion as to whether the making available of property is virtually a distribution of an amount that would be dividends. The effect is that whether or not an amount is included as a dividend under section 4(1)(e) is to be determined on a factual basis. The provision applies to the extent that the company has shareholders’ funds available that would be treated as dividends if distributed to shareholders while the company continues to operate. 6.This amendment should facilitate the applica- tion of the fringe benefit tax payable quarterly in respect of non-cash dividends arising under section 4(1)(e). It should similarly ease the application of the non-resident withholding tax provisions and the foreign dividend withholding payment provi- sions in relation to such cross-border dividends. 7.Section 3(3) of the Amendment Act inserts a new subsection (10) into section (4) of the principal Act. The amendment applies in relation to section 4(1)(e) where the making available of property of the company for the benefit of the shareholder consists of a low interest loan that is made available as a virtual distribution of an amount that would be dividends. 8.Subsection (1)(e) of section 4 was inserted by section 31 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988 to include as a dividend property made available for the benefit of a shareholder in a company where “...the property is virtually a distribution of an amount that, if distributed other than in the course of winding up of the company, would be dividends” under the Act. 9.At the time of the 1988 amendment it was intended that the new section (4)(1)(e) would apply to low interest loans. However, the amendment did not provide any valuation rules for determining the amount of concessional interest that is to be in- cluded as a dividend under section (4)(1)(e). In view of the application of the fringe benefit tax regime to non-cash dividends from 1 October 1989 (refer to commentary below on section 12 of the Amendment Act) as well as the application of the non-resident withholding tax and foreign dividend withholding payment regimes, it is important to provide such valuation rules in relation to low interest loans. 10.Subsection (10) of section 4 provides rules for valuing the amount of dividends that arise where a low interest loan is made available to a shareholder. The new subsection essentially uses the fringe benefit tax formulation in respect of low interest loans and provides that: (a)the amount of dividends arising is to be determined on a quarterly basis and deemed to be derived on the last day of the quarter; (b)the amount of the dividend is determined as follows: the amount of interest that would have accrued on that loan had interest been calcu- lated on the daily balance of that loan in that quarter at the rate of interest specified in paragraph (c) of subsection (10) reduced by the amount of interest actually payable in respect of the loan during the quarter (whether or not the interest is paid during that quarter); (c)The rate of interest specified for the purposes of the subsection is •the prescribed rate of interest (as defined in section 336N(1)) that applies for fringe benefit tax purposes, where the amounts payable under a loan are expressed in New Zealand currency; •where the amounts payable under a loan are payable in a foreign currency, any rate prescribed by the Commissioner in re- spect of that currency in any quarter or, if no such rate is prescribed, the market rate of interest that applies on an arm’s length basis determined at the end of the quarter for a loan made on the same terms as that loan advanced in the foreign currency; •in the case of any other loan, the market rate of interest that applies on an arm’s length basis determined at the end of the quarter for a loan made on the same terms as that loan. 11.In relation to low interest loans made to a shareholder, section (4)(1)(e) applies to include concessional interest as a dividend only where the loan is made in substitution for dividends. There- fore the provision does not apply where a loan arises by virtue of a normal commercial transaction, e.g., goods purchased on current account by a parent company from a subsidiary. 12.It is important to note the relationship be- tween section 4(1)(e) and section 4(1)(b) in relation to low interest loans. There are two main considera- tions. Firstly, such loans are dividends under section 4(1)(b) if the Commissioner considers they 3 are not a bona fide investment and are virtually a distribution of profits. Where section 4(1)(b) is applied to include such a loan as a dividend in the year in which the advance was made it is acknowl- edged that it would not be a loan to which section 4(1)(e) applies. In such a case any tax paid in the interim (whether fringe benefit tax or income tax) by virtue of the application of section 4(1)(e) would have to be refunded by the Department. Secondly, where a low interest loan is repaid by a shareholder so that section (4)(1)(b) does not apply, it is appro- priate that section 4(1)(e) apply to include the concessional element of the loan as a dividend since the shareholder will have had the benefit of the money advanced during the period of the advance. In this respect there is no conflict between section 4(1)(b) and section 4(1)(e) of the Act. 13.It is also important to note the application of section 4(1)(1) in relation to low interest loans made to an associated person of a shareholder. Where, for example, a low interest loan is made by a propri- etary company to a subsidiary company, a divi- dend may arise by virtue of the application of section 4(1)(e), section 4(1)(1), and section 8 (associ- ated persons). The arrangement would give rise to a dividend in the hands the proprietary company’s shareholders. Likewise a dividend may arise where a subsidiary company of a proprietary company advances a low interest loan to another subsidiary of that proprietary company. In both instances where a proprietary company has more than one shareholder, section 4(7) provides that the dividend is to be apportioned among the shareholders in proportion to each shareholder's amount of paid-up capital. 14.The Department is currently considering the application of section 4(1)(1) in relation to the other provisions of section 4(1). Section 4(1)(1) essentially reflects the wording of the previous section 4(3) that existed prior to the amendment of definition of dividends by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. The previous section 4(3) of the Act was generally regarded as applying only where a distribution was made to an associated person outside the corporate group. Date of Application These provisions apply in relation to income de- rived on or after 1 October 1989. SECTION 4 REBATE IN CERTAIN CASES FOR CHILDREN The original purpose of the child rebate was to obviate the need for children to file tax returns. The introduction of the RWT regime along with the removal of the $200 interest and dividend exemp- tion facilitates the removal of interest and dividend income from the child rebate. Section 50A is amended to restrict the application of the Child Rebate to income which is effectively salary and wages, and specifically to deny any tax rebate to income which comprises interest and dividends. Rebate The following formula ensures that interest and dividend income is excluded from income to which the rebate applies. The rebate is now an amount equal to the lesser of $156 or an amount calculated as follows: (x - y) x 15 100 where - xis an amount equal to the assessable income of the taxpayer for that income year; and yis an amount equal to the resident withhold- ing income derived by the taxpayer in that year. Transitional provision In respect of income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1989 the expression “resident withholding income” in the above formula shall be read as “resident withholding income derived on or after 1 October 1989”. Example: Example of child rebate calculation showing apportionment Year ended 31/3/90 Income from wages$600 Income from interest (derived 1/4/89 to 30/9/89)$105 Resident withholding income (derived 1/10/89 to 31/3/90)$105 TOTAL INCOME$810 Formula ($810 - $105) x .15 REBATE$105.75 Application Date This section applies in respect of income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1989. 4 SECTION 5 THE INTEREST AND DIVIDEND EXEMPTION With the introduction of the resident withholding tax regime the existing $200 general exemption which applies to interest and dividends received by most taxpayers will be abolished. As the withholding tax regime commences partway through an income year there will be a partial exemption in relation to interest and dividend income derived in the first half of the introductory year, and a complete repeal in respect of income derived after 1 April 1990. Subsection (1) Section 61(13) is repealed with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1989. A partial exemption applies to the extent of $100 in respect of interest and dividends derived between 1 April 1989 and 30 September 1989. The existing provisos will apply in respect of this transitional provision. Subsection (2) inserts a new section 61(12A) which exempts from income tax any non-cash dividend made available after 1 October 1989 to the extent to which fringe benefit tax is payable on the dividend. SECTION 6 DIVIDEND EXEMPTION An additional limitation on exemptions is added to section 63 to take effect in relation to income de- rived on or after 1 October 1989. The amendment removes the inter-corporate dividend exemption in relation to dividends that arise in connection with any forgiveness of a loan made by a company to a shareholder company under section 4(1)(ba). This treatment is consistent with the accrual rules as, where the accrual rules treat forgiveness of debt as income to the borrower, such treatment applies regardless of whether the borrower is an individual or a company. Therefore, where the application of section 4(1)(ba) gives rise to a dividend derived by a company, the amount of the dividend will be regarded as assess- able income of the company. SECTION 7 INCOME AND EXPENDI- TURE WHERE FINANCIAL ARRANGE- MENT REDEEMED OR DISPOSED OF The base price adjustment in section 64F(2) of the accruals regime is amended to take into account any forgiveness of debt that has been included as dividends under section 4(1)(ba) and that is assess- able to a company by virtue of the amendment to section 63(3) (refer to section 6 of the Amendment Act). The amendment ensures that such dividends are not subject to double taxation. Any amount of interest or principal remitted that is assessable to the borrower as a dividend is excluded from the base price adjustment. SECTION 8 DISTRIBUTION OF TRADING STOCK Section 8 amends section 197(3) of the principal Act by removing the requirement for the Commissioner to form an opinion as to whether the price which trading stock is deemed to have realised exceeds an amount which is a return of capital. The effect is that it will be a question of fact whether the price exceeds the share capital and any determination as to the extent of a dividend does not need to be considered by the Commissioner. SECTION 9 CLOSE OF TRADING SPOT EXCHANGE RATE Section 9 amends the definition of “close of trading spot exchange rate” in section 245A of the principal Act. The definition applies in relation to converting the branch-equivalent income of a Controlled Foreign Company to NZ dollars for income attribu- tion under Part IVA of the Act. Subparagraph (a) of the previous definition speci- fies that the rate is to be “an average of the spot rates of exchange for the purchase of NZ currency quoted at 3 p.m. NZ time....by foreign exchange dealers authorised under the RBNZ Act 1964 on the market approved by the Commissioner. The previous definition, if used in relation to RWT deductions would give rise to situations for exam- ple where interest credited on a Monday in foreign currency would have to be converted into NZ dollars at exchange rates ruling on the Friday. It has been argued that this unnecessarily exposes deductors to exchange rate risks. This amendment to the definition provides a method for converting foreign currency which is set out in relation to spot contracts in determination G6A made under S 64E of the Act, and provides that rates quoted on the next business day are to apply where no rates are quoted on the relevant day. 5 SECTION 10 DATE FOR PAYMENT OF NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX The payment date by which any deductions of non- resident withholding tax which have been made are required to be paid to the Commissioner has been aligned with the payment date for deductions of resident withholding tax. This is to streamline payment procedures for persons who will be required to pay tax deductions from both resident and non-resident withholding income to the Com- missioner on a regular basis. Sections 315(1), 316, 319 and 320 are amended by changing the payment due date from the 20th to the 14th of the month following the month in which the deduction was made. This change is effective in respect of non-resident withholding tax payable on or after 1 October 1989. SECTION 11 NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTED IN ERROR A new section 326A is inserted into the Non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) provisions to enable the Commissioner (on application) to refund any overdeductions of NRWT made. 326A (1) Deductions made and paid to the Commissioner to be refunded. Where a deduction has been made, paid to the Commissioner, and exceeds the amount which should have been deducted, the Commissioner shall refund that amount to the person who derived the amount from which the deduction was made. 326A (2) Application to be in approved form The person entitled to the refund may make an application in an approved form. 326A (3) The Commissioner requires evidence The Commissioner requires evidence that the tax has been deducted and has been paid to the Commissioner. 326A (4) Refund may be applied in satisfying amounts due The Commissioner may apply any amount which is due to be refunded to any obligation of the person to whom the amount is owing. 326A (5) Power to recover where excess refund made Where an excess amount has been refunded the Commissioner may recover the amount in excess as if it were income tax. Where the person led the Commissioner to pay the refund by wilful default or neglect that excess shall be payable on the date on which the refund was paid. In any other case the amount will be payable on the 7th of the month follow- ing the month in which the person was notified that the amount was payable. 326A (6) No further appropriation is required. All money payable by the Commissioner shall be paid without further appropriation being re- quired. Date of application This section comes into force on the 1st day of October 1989 and applies to any payment (of NRWT) due to be made to the Commissioner on or after that date. SECTION 12 RESIDENT INCOME WITHHOLDING TAX A new Part IXA is inserted into the Act to bring into effect a Resident Income Withholding Tax. 327A - INTERPRETATION 327A Subsection (1) Definitions A number of terms are defined for the purposes of this Part of the Act, especially where the general definitions in Section 2 need to be expanded for the purposes of resident withholding tax e.g., the definition of “interest” is expanded for withholding tax purposes to include “redemption payments”. “Accounting Year” A new term Accounting Year which is a year, or other period ending with the annual balance date of a person’s accounts, is specifically defined for these provisions because definitions in section 2 did not meet certain situations. “Income Year” only applies to periods during which persons derive income and there may be situations where persons pay interest from which deductions should be made but do not derive income. “Year” is restricted to those periods com- mencing 1 April and ending 31 March. “Year of Assessment” means a year for which income tax is payable which assumes that an assessment will be made. The new definition is particularly applicable in the case of non-profit bodies who derive income but because of the proviso to section 61(34) do not file tax returns. Their obligation to deduct is partially based on interest paid in their previous “accounting year”. See section 327C (5) 6 “Certificate of Exemption” Section 327M provides for the issuing of “Certificates of Exemption” and details who may apply, and the conditions govern- ing their application. “Close of trading spot exchange rate” This term is defined in section 245A for the purposes of the attributed foreign income regime. A definition is required for the resident withholding tax regime to determine the exchange rate for payers to use when making resident withholding tax deductions from interest paid on foreign currency investments. The definition of “close of trading spot exchange rate” in section 245A has been amended - refer to discus- sion under section 9 above. “Company” includes a group investment fund established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967 or the Public Trust Office Act 1957 in so far as that fund pays dividends on any shares invested in the fund. “Dividend withholding payment credit” This is a term used in the foreign dividend with- holding payments regime. (Refer to section 394ZX which is discussed in the appendix to TIB No. 1. “Exempt Interest” lists the types of interest which are exempt from the withholding regime. The following types of interest are not subject to the deduction of resident income withholding tax. (a)Interest payable in respect of any debt made in accordance with generally accepted com- mercial practice for the purchase of goods or services, being a purchase made in the ordinary course of the purchaser’s taxable activity. This would include such items as interest charged on overdue accounts pay- able, or any standard trade debt incurred during the course of business. Note: This provision does not require the debt to be owed to the person from whom the goods were purchased. Example: A plumber who purchases supplies under a 30 day credit facility in the ordinary course of the plumbing business, and incurs an interest penalty on payment after 30 days, is not liable to deduct RWT from that payment of penalty interest as it is exempt interest (b)Any interest payable under a hire purchase agreement. (c)Interest exempt from tax pursuant to section 61(18) (Government borrowing from a non- resident) and section 61(50) (any income expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act) (d)Any interest payable under a specified lease (as defined in S222A (1)). (e)Interest payable in respect of bonus bonds. The “prize” draws on bonus bonds are deemed to be interest and without this exemption such prizes would be subject to tax deductions. (f)Interest which is an inflation premium payable on an inflation adjusted savings bond issued by the New Zealand Govern- ment. (g)Interest payable by the Commissioner on overpayments of provisional tax in terms of Section 413A, or on delayed refunds in terms of section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. “Financial arrangement” Terms such as “financial arrangement”, “holder”, “issued” and “issuer” (refer below) which have meanings expressly applicable for, and limited to, the accruals legislation, are used in the withholding tax provisions so they have been given an extended application to this Part of the Act. Financial arrangement means - (a)Any debt or debt instrument; and (b)Any arrangement whereby a person obtains money in consideration for a promise by any person to provide money to any person at some future time, or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events; and (c)Any arrangement which is of a substantially similar nature, - but shall not include any excepted financial ar- rangement that is not part of a financial arrange- ment. (Excepted financial arrangement is defined in section 64B (1)). “Foreign Withholding Tax” in respect to any amount of resident withholding income means any tax, other than New Zealand tax, that (a)is deducted from that amount of resident withholding income; and 7 (b)is of substantially the same nature as non- resident withholding tax. “Holder” is a person who, if all amounts under the financial arrangement were due and payable at that time, would be entitled to receive a pecuniary benefit from payment of those amounts. In general - Holder = lender = vendor = creditor i.e. the person who receives income “Imputation credit” This is a term used in the imputation regime. (Refer to section 394F which is discussed in the appendix to TIB No.1) “Interest” includes a redemption payment. The section 2 definition of interest does not include redemption payments, but for the purposes of this regime redemption payments are expressly in- cluded. The effect is that the difference between the original issue price and redemption price of a Commercial Bill (as that term is defined in section 65(1)(a) of the Act) is interest subject to RWT. Example: Mary Investor subscribes for Government stock on 1 June 1989. Details are as follows. Coupon interest rate12½% Face value$50,000 Issue price$45,000 Maturity date30 June 1992 Mary is a non-exempt recipient (does not hold a COE) and the stock is held to maturity. She is a cash-basis holder for the purposes of the Accru- als regime. RWT will be deducted from each coupon pay- ment. Mary will be assessed on the gross interest paid (inclusive of RWT deducted) and will receive a tax credit for the RWT deducted. On 30 June 1992 Mary will receive $48,800 being $50,000 less the $1,200 RWT deducted from the redemption payment of $5,000. Mary will be assessed on the redemption pay- ment (in the 1993 income year), being assessable income under the Accruals regime, and will receive a credit for the RWT deducted. Example: Facts as in above example except that Mary sells the Government Stock to George on 1 July 1991 for $49,000. George holds the stock to maturity. Mary will be assessed (in the 1992 income year) on the $4,000 profit derived from the sale of the Government stock; being assessable income under the Accruals regime. No RWT is deducted from the sale proceeds of the stock. On 30 June 1992 George will receive $48,800 being $50,000 less the RWT deducted from the redemption payment of $5,000 (being $1,200) Note: The amount of the redemption payment is not the difference between the acquisition price of the stock and its redemption price, but rather the original issue price of the stock and its redemption price. If George had sold the stock to an exempt recipient (holder of a COE) shortly before 30 June 1992 he would have been assessed on the profit derived (under the Accruals regime), but he would not incur RWT. The purchaser would receive $50,000; the redemption payment being excluded from the RWT regime as it is paid to an exempt recipient. “Issued and Issuer” “Issuer” is a person who is a party to a financial arrangement and is not a holder in relation to the financial arrangement. In general - Issuer = borrower = purchaser = debtor i.e. the person who incurs expenditure “Paid” is defined to include credited to, applied on account of, or dealt with in the interests of any person. “Pay” and “payment” have corresponding meanings. This is to ensure that persons cannot circumvent the requirement to make deductions by crediting an account or otherwise avoiding an actual payment in a narrow meaning of the term. “Resident withholding income” and “Resident withholding tax” These terms have the meanings assigned to them by sections 327B and 327C respectively. (Discussed below) “Resident withholding Tax deduction certificate” (s327H) and “Resident withholding tax deduction Reconciliation Statement” (S327I) are defined for this Part of the 8 Act to distinguish them from the definitions in Section 2 which refer to “tax deduction certificates” and “reconciliation statements” which are defined by and have reference to the PAYE provisions for Salary and Wage earners. “Shares” includes the investment of an investor in a group investment fund. “Taxable Activity” has the same meaning as in the GST Act 1985 except that it specifically includes the making of exempt supplies (e.g., provision of financial services, and residential rentals). This modification ensures that persons conducting banking type activities are required to deduct resident withholding tax. This term is used to cover a “business” in the broadest sense of the word so that situations where persons are paying interest which is tax deductible, but where the intention to make a profit is not necessarily present are still subject to the withhold- ing tax provisions. In addition, a number of public and local authorities are not conducting a business in the widest sense of the word, but they are con- ducting taxable activities. A taxable activity is: •any activity •carried on continuously or regularly •by any person •whether or not for pecuniary profit •and involves, or is intended to involve, in whole or in part •the supply of goods and services •to any other person •for a consideration. For further discussion on “taxable activity” refer to the GST Manual. “Taxable bonus issue” as in section 4(3) of the principal Act means a)any bonus issue in lieu of dividends; b)any bonus issue that a company elects to be a taxable bonus issue treated as a dividend (S4(5)(a)(i)) “Tax File Number” has a wide scope, being any number allocated to a person by the Commissioner. It would include IRD numbers which are not currently defined and GST registration numbers which are defined in the GST Act 1985 and will now include the Certificate of Exemption number issued in terms of Section 327M(4)(c). Subsection (2) Dividends paid by Friendly Societies deemed to be interest. The amendment deems “dividends” paid by Friendly Societies, Credit Unions, Industrial unions, etc. (which are incorporated in New Zealand under any Act) to be interest and not to be dividends for the purposes of resident withholding tax. The sums paid out by these organisations could be both “interest” and “dividends” as defined in the principal Act. As the withholding tax rates are different for interest and dividends it is necessary to clarify the category to which these distributed sums belong. Subsection (3) Application of the term “specified dividends” The term “specified dividends” applies for the purposes of certain sections of the withholding tax regime. Specified dividends are dividends paid by a company which is not entitled to attach imputa- tion (or dividend withholding payment credits) to dividends paid. The legislation provides for addi- tional notification requirements in respect of speci- fied dividends. The additional notification require- ments are the same as those applying in respect of resident withholding tax on interest. Specified dividends are dividends that are - (a)paid by a company which at the time of payment is •a company that is not resident in New Zealand, or •a company whose constitution prohibits all of its income from being distributed to any proprietor, member or shareholder. This would include, for example, incorpo- rated clubs and societies, or •a company the income of which is exempt from tax (e.g., an incorporated charity). However dividends derived by a com- pany the income of which consists solely of dividends exempt from tax under section 63 are not specified dividends, or •a company to which section 204 applies where that company is engaged in New Zealand solely in the business of life insurance or reinsurance and does not maintain a foreign dividend withholding payment account; or (b)dividends paid by a company in relation to specified preference shares where the com- 9 pany has been allowed a deduction in respect of those dividends; or (c)amounts distributed by a Maori Authority that are deemed to be dividends under section 236(2) of the Act. 327B Application of this Part 327B Subsection (1) This Part of this Act applies notwithstanding anything in any other Part of the Act. This is a section used whenever new forms of tax policy are introduced to ensure that other provisions of the Act do not hinder the successful implementation of the changes. 327B Subsection (2) Resident withholding income (RWI) consists of interest and dividends, paid after 1 October 1989, subject to the exceptions detailed below. INTEREST (a) (i)Exempt interest (defined in S327A ) is not RWI (a) (ii) and (b) (iv) Interest or dividends paid to a person who holds a valid Certificate of Exemption will not be subject to RWT deductions. (Section 327M discusses Certificates of Exemption) (a) (iii) and (b) (v) Interest and Dividends which constitute non-resident withholding do not constitute RWI. As residence may not always be determined until some time after a payment of interest or dividends provisions have been made for any NRWT paid to the Commissioner to be retained and credited in part payment of income tax or resident withholding tax due. (Section 326A inserted by section 11 of this Act refers.) (a) (iv) and (b) (vi) Interest and dividends derived from outside New Zealand by a person not resident in New Zealand do not constitute RWI. These paragraphs ensure that there is no obligation on payers of interest or dividends uncon- nected with New Zealand. Failure to include such provisions would leave an area of doubt. (a) (v)Interest paid between members of a Group of companies. As the grouping provisions of section 191 are in respect of an income year the test as to whether any interest is or is not resident withholding income is whether the compa- nies between whom the interest passes would be members of the same group if the date the interest was paid was the end of an income year. (a)(vi)Interest derived by a non-resident investment company from any development investments within the meaning of section 5. DIVIDENDS Dividends which do not form part of resident withholding income also include - (b) (i)Any non-cash dividends in respect of which fringe benefit tax is payable under section 336N(8) as inserted by section 13 of the Amendment Act. The term “non cash dividend” is defined in section 2 of the principal Act (refer to section 2 of the Amendment Act). (b) (ii)Dividends that are exempt from income tax in New Zealand by section 63(2) of this Act or which would be so exempt but for the exclusion in paragraph (e) of Section 63(3) (refer to commentary to section 6 of the Amendment Act). Therefore RWT does not apply to dividends that are exempt income of a company or which, under section 4 (1)(ba) are dividends derived by a company as a consequence of the forgiveness of debt (refer to above commentary on section 3 of the Amendment Act). (b) (iii)Deemed dividends which arise through the operation of certain sections of the Act: section 97 - excess remuneration paid by a partnership to a relative of a partner or by a company (other than a proprietary com- pany) to a relative of a director or share- holder of the company. This provision also applies to remuneration paid by a partner- ship to a relative of a director or share- holder of a company that is a partner in the partnership; section 190 - excess remuneration paid by a proprietary company to a shareholder or a director (or relative of same); Section 199(6) - certain rebates paid by Mutual Associations are deemed, under the proviso, to be dividends in the hands of members to the extent that they are not allowable deductions to the Association. 10 The proviso to subsection (2) clarifies the situation where beneficiary income pursuant to section 226(1) is derived also by the trustee. The proviso ensures that beneficiary income derived by a trustee who holds a valid COE is deemed not to be derived by the trustee and thus retains its character as resident withholding income in all cases where the beneficiary does not also hold a COE. The proviso only applies “for the purposes of each of the sub-paragraphs of paragraph (a) and (b) of this subsection” and does not generally apply for the purposes of Part IXA of the Act. (Thus it does not apply for the purposes of section 327M). 327C - Deduction of Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) This section provides a basic rule that all Resident Withholding Income is subject to a deduction, to be called Resident Withholding Tax, at the time of payment. The regime has been introduced to ensure that income from interest and dividends which is currently not being included in taxpayers’ returns of income is subject to taxation. Qualifying interest payments will have RWT deducted when paid or credited to the interest recipient. Dividends are also subject to deductions of RWT. The RWT to be deducted is dependent upon the amount of imputation and foreign dividend with- holding payment credits attached to the dividend paid. No RWT is deductible from a fully credited dividend. There is a full explanation of the imputation re- gime, and the terms, such as “imputation credits” and “dividend withholding payment credits”, which are used in this commentary, in the Appen- dix to TIB No 1. 327C Subsection (1) Rate of deduction. (a)Interest The rate of RWT deduction from interest, less any foreign tax credits, is specified in clause 1 of the new Nineteenth schedule to the Act. From 1 October 1989 the rate will be 24 cents in the dollar. The formula is: (a x (b + c)) - c where - ais the rate of RWT on interest expressed as a percentage bis the amount of interest paid before the deduction of resident withholding tax; cis the amount of \*foreign withholding tax paid or payable in respect of that amount of interest paid. \* Foreign withholding tax. This term is defined in section 327A (refer to above commentary). Essentially it is tax deducted from the dividend in the overseas country and which is available as a credit of tax in New Zealand. (b)Dividends The rate of RWT deduction from dividends is specified in clause 2 of the new Nineteenth schedule to the Act. From 1 October 1989 it will be 33 cents in the dollar. (The rate will normally be in line with the company tax rate to prevent any complication arising through the operation of the imputation regime.) The 33 per cent rate of deduction will apply in full where a dividend is paid without imputa- tion credits or dividend withholding payment credits attached. Where a dividend has imputation credits at- tached at the maximum imputation ratio (cur- rently 33/67) of the dividend there will be no deduction of resident withholding tax. In all other cases the following formula is used to calculate the amount of RWT to be deducted. The amount of RWT deductible is not to exceed 33 percent of the amount of the dividend paid (inclusive of credits). The formula is (a x (b + c)) - c ais the rate of RWT on dividends expressed as a percentage; and bis the amount of dividend paid (before the deduction of RWT; and cis - (i)in the case of a dividend paid in relation to shares issued by a company which is at the time of payment not resident in New Zealand, the foreign withholding tax paid or payable in respect of that dividend; or 11 (ii)in the case of any other dividend - the aggregate of - (A)any imputation credit attached; and (B)any dividend withholding payment credit attached The effect of this formula is to apply the relevant rate of RWT to the aggregate amount of the dividend paid and any credits attached to that dividend, and then to apply the withholding rate to that total. The resulting amount is re- duced by the amount of any credits attached to the dividend paid in order to determine the amount of RWT to be deducted. Example Dividend declared$100.00 Imputation credits attached$ 20.00 Aggregate amount subject to RWT$120.00 RWT @ 33c$39.60 Less imputation credits$20.00 RWT payable$19.60 Assessable income of shareholder Cash dividend (100 -19.60)$ 80.40 Imputation credits$ 20.00 Dividend withholding payment credit$ 19.60 Assessable Income$120.00 (c)Taxable bonus issues It should be noted that amending legislation has been introduced in the Taxation Reform Bill (No.6) 1989 to clarify the amount of RWT to be deducted in relation to a taxable bonus issue. The proposed amendments provide for the following treatment: (i)In respect of a taxable bonus issue made where an amount of money’s worth is offered as an alternative to the bonus issue, e.g. under a dividend election scheme or a bonus issue in lieu, the amount of RWT to be de- ducted is calculated on a similar basis to dividends, i.e., in accordance with the follow- ing formula - (a x (b + c) - c ais the rate of RWT on dividends, bis the amount of money or money’s worth offered as an alternative to the bonus issue (before the deduction of RWT), cis - (A)in the case of a dividend paid in relation to shares issued by a com pany which is at the time of payment not resident in New Zealand, the foreign withholding tax paid or payable in respect of that dividend; or (B)in the case of any other dividend the aggregate of (A) any imputation credit attached; and (B) any dividend withholding pay- ment credit attached Example Dividend declared with option available to share- holder to Receive taxable bonus issue in lieu$100.00 Imputation Credits attached$ 49.00 Aggregate amount subject to RWT$149.00 RWT @ 33 cents$49.00 Less imputation credits\*$49.00 RWT payable Nil Assessable income of shareholder Bonus issue$100.00 Imputation credits$ 49.00 Assessable income$149.00 \* It is expected that in most cases taxable bonus issues will be fully credited with imputation cred- its. (ii)In respect of a taxable bonus issue made where there is an amount capitalised in the making of the bonus issue the amount of RWT to be deducted is calculated in accord- ance with the following formula ( a x b) - c 1 - a ais the rate of RWT, bis the amount capitalised in the making of the bonus issue, cis - (A)in the case of a dividend paid in relation to shares issued by a company which is at the time of payment not resident in New Zealand, the foreign withholding tax paid or payable in respect of that dividend; or (B)in the case of any other dividend - 12 the aggregate of (A)any imputation credit attached; and (B)any dividend withholding pay- ment credit attached Example Amount capitalised in making bonus issue$100.00 Imputation credits attached$ 49.00 RWT @ 33 ¢33 x 100 = 49 - 49 = Nil 67 Assessable income of shareholder Bonus issue$100.00 Imputation credits$ 49.00 Assessable income$149.00 327C Subsection (2) RWT on Taxable Bonus Issues As deductions are not able to be made from bonus shares, subsection (2) provides for payment to the Commissioner of an amount of RWT equal to the amount of RWT which would be payable if the amount of the taxable bonus issue had been paid as a “cash dividend”. The amount payable is regarded as a deduction of RWT. 327C Subsection (3) Conversion Rate Where RWI is in Foreign Currency This subsection provides for the calculation of the amount of resident withholding tax to be deducted and credited against income tax assessed (or treated as a dividend withholding payment credit) where RWI is not paid in NZ dollars. It states that for the purposes of such calculations only (i.e. the calculations outlined in subsection 327C (3) (a) and (b), RWI is to be converted into New Zealand dollars. This does not mean that payments of RWI denominated in foreign currency have to be physically converted into NZ dollars prior to the deduction of RWT and then re-con- verted back into the foreign currency prior to payment. Rather, it means that the amount of RWT to be deducted or credited is to be calculated as if such currency conversion of the RWI had occurred. Subsections 327C (3) (c) and (d) outline the alter- native rates of exchange at which such RWI can be converted into NZ dollars. Subsection 327C (3) (c) provides for the use of the close of trading spot exchange rate on the day on which the RWT deduction is required to be made. Where a payment of RWI is made outside NZ, however, the person may elect to use the spot rate on the next succeeding day. Alternatively, subsection 327C (3) (d) provides for the use of an arm’s length exchange rate where a payment of RWI has actually been physically converted into NZ dollars at the time of payment. 327C Subsection (4) Persons Liable to Deduct A person is only required to make tax deductions from RWI if:- a)that person is, at the time of payment, either (i)Resident in New Zealand, or (ii)Carrying on a taxable activity in N.Z. through a fixed establishment. Provided that ss (4) (a) shall not apply where the Commissioner is satisfied that - (A)the payment of interest or dividends is attributable to, or effectively connected with a fixed establishment of that person outside New Zealand in the case of dividends payable in respect of shares issued by a company, that company is not resident in New Zealand. (B)all amounts payable in relation to money lent or to shares to which the RWI relates are payable in a currency other than New Zealand currency; (b)and Either (i)that person holds at the time of payment a valid COE (S327M refers); or (ii)that payment is made wholly or partly\* in the course of or furtherance of a taxable activity, whether acting as an agent or trustee or otherwise; or (iii)that payment is a dividend on shares issued by the company making the payment. \* An example of a “partly” is the case of a taxpayer who has interest expenditure appor- tioned between business use and private use where the money was borrowed to acquire a business premise which has residential accom- modation attached (e.g., a doctor, dentist, dairy owner, motel owner.) 13 327C Subsection (5) Relief from Liability to Withhold in Certain Circumstances Any person who makes a payment of resident withholding income, being interest, and (a)Either- (i)Does not hold a valid COE; or (ii)Holds a certificate of exemption issued in accordance with the following paragraphs of S 327M (1):- (g)tax exempt persons; or (h)non-profit bodies subject to Section 61(34); or Section 327M(12) certain tax loss (or anticipated tax loss) taxpayers; and (b)paid less than $5000 RWI in the previous year - is not liable to deduct RWT until RWI payments made in the year exceed a total of $5,000. Once that level of qualifying interest payments is reached, in a year, deductions of RWT are required from all further payments in that year, and in future until the payer completes a full year of payments less than $5000. The exclusion of persons who have a Certificate of Exemption issued under S327M (12) relates to those persons who have been issued with a certificate for a determined period in circumstances such as carry-forward losses or an anticipated over deduc- tion situation. It is anticipated that the $5,000 threshold exemption will remove the liability to deduct and account for RWT for a large numbers of payers who pay rela- tively small amounts of interest in a year. Where any person has not previously been deduct- ing RWT but makes a payment which takes the total interest paid in the accounting year (as defined in Section 2) over the $5000 threshold that person must deduct RWT from that payment (but only to the extent of the excess over $5,000\*), and from any subsequent payments until such time as they complete an accounting year in which they pay a total of less than $5000. Also, as a consequence of exceeding the $5,000 threshold in an accounting year RWT should be deducted from all interest paid in the following year (unless the interest is exempt or excluded interest). \* NOTE: Legislation has been introduced in the Taxation Reform Bill No.6 to change the require- ment that RWT is only deducted from the “excess over $5,000”. There are practical difficulties in deducting “only to the extent of the excess” in situations where payments are being made to more than one person simultaneously which take the total for the year over the $5,000 level. To overcome these practical problems the requirement will be to deduct from the whole of any payment which takes the total for the year over the $5,000 threshold. 327C Subsection (6) Prevention of Double Deductions Where any person (liable to make a deduction of RWT) makes or receives a payment from which RWT has been deducted either in full or in part that person is only required to make a deduction to the extent of the shortfall, if any. This is to ensure that successive deductions are not made when RWI passes through someone such as an agent or trus- tee. 327C Subsection (7) Payments Deemed not to Constitute Resident Withholding Income Where any person makes a payment to another person, or receives a payment as agent or bare trustee for another person, that person has to determine whether the interest or dividend paid or received is resident withholding income. The issue to be determined is whether or not the person deriving the interest or dividend is the holder of a COE - in which case the relevant inter- est or dividend would not constitute RWI and there is no requirement to deduct RWT. There are two tests, the first relates to the certificate and the second relates to the possible cancellation of the certificate. The requirements regarding the holder of the Certificate of Exemption are: 327C(7) (c) (i) Either (A)Where the person deriving the interest or dividend is a person to whom paragraphs (a) to (d) of S 327M(1) applies (e.g. banks, building societies, trustee banks, trustee companies etc.) the payer is only required to be satisfied that the recipient belongs to that category, and is not required to sight the COE; or (B)Where the person deriving the interest or dividend is a person to whom paragraphs 14 (e) to (g) of S 327M(1) applies (e.g. persons whose principal form of business is the borrowing or lending money and persons who have derived, or who believe they will derive $2 million of gross assessable income) the payer must be supplied with the person’s tax file number and have been notified by the person that the person holds a COE; or (C)Where the recipient of the interest or divi- dend is a person to whom paragraphs (h) and (i) of S327M (1) applies (e.g. tax ex- empts, charities, non-profit bodies etc.) or to whom S327M (12) applies (certain tax loss persons) then the payer is required to sight the certificate of exemption and take reason- able steps to be satisfied that the recipient is the person named in the certificate; and 327C(7) (c) (ii) In all the circumstances outlined above the payer also needs to be satisfied •in respect of a payment of interest made on or before 1 April 1991 that no notice of cancellation of the COE has been published in any issue of the Gazette more than 5 working days before the time the money was lent, or •in the case of a payment of dividends, more than 5 working days before the payment was made. In any case where a notice of cancellation has been published in the Gazette and a certificate has been issued with a date later than the date of publication of cancellation, the payer will need to sight such certificate; and 327C(7) (c) (iii) In the case of any payment of interest made on or after 1 April 1991 the payer will need to be satisfied that no notice of cancellation of a certificate of exemption held by the recipient has been published in any issue of the Gazette on or after 1 April 1991 and more than 5 working days before the payment of interest is made. Where there has been a notice of cancellation and a further certificate of exemption has been issued the payer can either •ascertain that there has been publication of a notice of re-issue of such certificate; or •sight a certificate with a date subsequent to the date of issue of the Gazette with the notice of cancellation; and 327C(7) (c) (iv) In addition to publication of notice of cancellation in the Gazette, there are other ways in which a payer may have been notified of cancellation. A payer therefore needs to check that there has not been a notification of cancellation received from either the Commissioner, or the recipient, that the recipient’s certificate has been cancelled more than 5 working days prior to the day on which payment is made. If the payer has been so advised, there will still be no requirement to treat the payment of interest or dividend as resident withholding income if either (A)Notice of issue of a further COE has been published in the Gazette more than 5 work- ing days before the day payment is made; or (B)the payer has sighted a certificate which has been issued with a date subsequent to the date on which the earlier advice of cancella- tion was received; and 327C(7) (c) (v) The payer does not have any other grounds for believing that the recipient is not eligible to be issued with a certificate of exemption; and 327C(7) (c) (vi)\* The payer does not have any other grounds for believing that the interest or dividends are income derived by a person other than the person to whom the payment is being made; or 327C(7) (d) In the case of a payment which consists only of dividends the payer has taken reasonable steps to confirm that the recipient is a company in whose hands the dividend income is treated as exempt income (by the application of S 63(2)) or would have been but for the application of paragraph (e) of S63 (3) (a new paragraph inserted by this Act referring to dividends arising through the forgive- ness of debt) and that the payer does not have any grounds for believing that the dividends are de- rived by any person other than the recipient. \* Note:Amending legislation has been introduced in the Taxation Reform Bill (No 6) to 15 restrict the application of Section 327C(7)(c)(vi) to payments made to banks, building societies and trustee banks. This ensures that payers of interest can not avoid making deductions of RWT by paying to a lender through a bank, building society etc which has a Certificate of Exemption. 327C Subsection (8) Relief Where Payer not Aware that Payment Constituted Resident Withholding Income Where any payer to whom paragraphs (a) to (c) of S 327M (1) applies (banks, building societies and trustee banks ) receives a payment, or makes a payment at the request of another person (i.e. as agent or trustee) for the purpose of determining whether that payment constitutes resident with- holding income such payment will not be deemed to constitute RWI if the payer could not reasonably be expected to know that the payment did consti- tute RWI. Branch Registers Section 327C applies in respect of dividends paid by a New Zealand branch share register on behalf of a non-resident company. In relation to taxable bonus issues where a non-resident company issues bonus shares through a branch register in New Zealand then RWT is payable. Where the non- resident company issues the bonus shares direct to shareholders the treatment is the same as it would be for dividends, i.e., no RWT is payable. 327D Requirement for Agents or Trustees to Make Resident Withholding Tax Deductions on Receipt of Payments Where a person receives interest as an agent or trustee for another person, that person (the agent) will only be obliged to make a deduction of RWT from that payment if the payer of that payment was liable to deduct and either failed to do so, or did not deduct the full amount. If such an event arises the first person is obliged to make a deduction of RWT (or the amount of the deficiency of that tax ) at the time of receiving the payment. 327D Subsection (1) Where - a)A payment which consist in whole or part of resident withholding income has been made; and b)The payer was liable to deduct RWT (or would have been but for the application of S327C (7); and c)RWT was not deducted from that payment, or was not deducted in full; and d)the recipient of that payment is, in relation to that payment, an agent or trustee for another person - the recipient shall deduct RWT, or any balance of RWT from that payment. The deduction shall be forwarded to the Commissioner by the 14th of the following month. 327D Subsection (2) Subsection (1) does not apply where the recipient holds a valid Certificate of Exemption and received the payment as a trustee of a trust (not being a bare trust). 327D Subsection (3) Where a person is required under this section to make a deduction of RWT from a dividend which is not a specified dividend the RWT deduction shall be treated as if the divi- dend was a specified dividend. This covers the situation where an agent who is not covered by the imputation or dividend withholding payment regime pays dividends on behalf of a principal. The recording and reporting provisions which apply to interest and specified dividends also apply to such dividends. 327D Subsection (4) Where a person would be required to make a deduction of RWT from a dividend which is a taxable bonus issue a deduc- tion is not to be made from the taxable bonus issue, but an amount equal to the amount which would be required to be deducted, if the amount of the bonus issue was paid in cash, is required to be paid to the Commissioner. Such an amount will be treated as if it were resident withholding tax. 327D Subsection (5) Except in so far as section 327C(6) applies (which relieves a payer from an obligation to deduct RWT when there has already been a sufficient deduction from a particular payment) nothing in this section shall restrict the provisions of section 327C which require any person to make a deduction of RWT. 327E Payment of Deductions of Resident With- holding Tax to Commissioner This section determines how and when tax deduc- tions which have been made from Resident With- holding Income are paid to the Commissioner. Payers of interest are required to make an estimate at the beginning of each year of the total amount of tax deductions which they will make in that year. They have been divided into two groups based on 16 the amount of tax deductions which they estimate they will be making for each month of the ensuing year. Potential payers will form part of an IRD payers’ register after completion of form IR 15R. Payers who cease to be payers pursuant to either subsection (6) or (7) will complete a Cessation form IR 15K. 327E Subsection (1) Payers Making Tax Deduc- tions of More Than $500 per Month All payers of interest who estimate that they will make tax deductions totalling more than $500 in each month of a particular year are required to pay their total tax deductions made in each month to the Commissioner by the 14th day of the month following the month in which the deductions were made. 327E Subsection (2) Payers Making Tax Deductions of less than $500 Payers of interest who estimate that they will not make tax deductions totalling more than $500 in each month of a particular year are required to pay tax deductions to the Commissioner in two instal- ments. For example, payers, such as Credit Unions, who normally pay the bulk of members’ interest either annually or half yearly thus substantially exceeding $500 in one or two months only during any year, and then paying minimal amounts under $500 in the other months, would fall into this category. Example Tax deductions made in the period between 1 April and 30 September are to be paid to the Commis- sioner by the 14th October next. Tax deductions made in the period from 1 October to 31 March are required to be paid to the Commis- sioner by the 14 April next. 327E Subsection (3) Twice-yearly Payer Exceeding the $500 Threshold Where a payer who has previously estimated that total tax deductions from payments of interest in each month for that year will be less than $500 makes deductions in any month which takes the total deductions made since the last 6 monthly payment date above $500 the aggregate of tax deductions held by that payer shall be paid to the Commissioner by the 14th of the following month. Example: 327E Subsection (4) Payers of Dividends Payers of dividends which are Resident Withhold- ing Income and from which deductions of RWT are made shall pay those deductions to the Commis- sioner by the 14th of the month following the month in which the dividends are paid. 327E Subsection (5) Information to Accompany Tax Deductions Paid to the Commissioner Payments of deductions of withholding tax for- warded to the Commissioner shall be accompanied with certain details on an authorised form - IR 15P. 327E Subsection (6) Payer Ceasing to Carry on a Taxable Activity Where a person who will not be retaining a Certifi- cate of Exemption: -ceases to carry on a taxable activity; or -ceases to carry on any such taxable activity in New Zealand, - that person shall pay to the Commissioner (by the 14th of the following month) all tax deductions which have been made and not earlier paid to the Commissioner. 327E Subsection (7) Person ceases to hold a Valid Certificate of Exemption Where a person in any month ceases to hold a valid Certificate of Exemption, and is not required to 17 make deductions due to continuing in a taxable activity, that person shall pay to the Commissioner all resident withholding tax deductions made, and not earlier paid, by the 14th of the following month. 327F - Resident Withholding Tax Deductions Varied to Correct Errors Where there has been an error in the tax deduction made from resident withholding income, the error may be corrected from subsequent payments in the same year. In the case of dividends, which are not specified dividends, corrections can only be made in the period between the date of deduction and the date of payment to the Commissioner. Because of the limitations imposed by the imputation regime on the number of credits of any sort which can accom- pany dividends there is no room to remedy underdeductions or shortfalls in deductions from one issue of dividends by an increase in deductions in a subsequent issue. 327F Subsection (1) Deductions not made, or insufficient deduction made. This section deals with a payer's liability to deduct RWT from a payment of interest or specified dividends. Where a payer has failed to make a deduction from a payment or has deducted less than the prescribed amount the payer may correct that default by either •deducting the amount in default from any subsequent payment made in the same year in which the default occurred; or •otherwise recover from the recipient of the payment a sufficient amount to correct the deficiency. Provided that this shall not apply where any other person has made good the deficiency. 327F Subsection (2) Overdeduction from interest or specified dividends resulting from payer error may be refunded Where a payer makes an error which results in an overdeduction from a payment, either of interest or specified dividends (e.g., dividends paid by a non- resident company through an agent) the payer may pay the excess to the recipient in the period be- tween the making of the deduction and the due date for payment of the RWT deduction to the Commissioner. In that event, an amended RWT deduction certificate may be required, if one was prepared at the time of making the deduction. 327F Subsection (3) Overdeduction from dividends other than specified dividends may be refunded Where a payer makes an error which results in an overdeduction from a dividend (not being a speci- fied dividend) paid by a New Zealand company the payer may pay the excess to the recipient in the period between the making of the deduction and the due date for payment of the RWT deduction to the Commissioner. In that event, an amended shareholder dividend statement shall be issued. 327F Subsection (4) Overdeduction resulting from recipient's error to be paid to Commissioner Where a payer deducts an amount in excess of the prescribed deduction due to an error or omission on the part of the recipient the full amount de- ducted shall be paid to the Commissioner on the due date. The payer shall not be liable to refund that excess to the recipient or any other person. 327G Refunds of Deductions 327G Subsection (1) Tax deductions made from interest paid to tax exempt persons and received by Commissioner may be refunded. Where an RWT deduction - •has been made in accordance with the provi- sions of this Part of the Act; and •has been paid to the Commissioner, and •is in excess of any RWT deduction (if any) which was required, an amount equal to that tax deduction may be refunded to the person deriving the payment from which the deduction was made. 327G Subsection (2) Refund application to be in writing Any person who is entitled to a refund because RWT has been deducted in error (or over-de- ducted) must make an application in writing on an approved form - IR 15F. 327G Subsection (3) Commissioner requires evidence The Commissioner shall not make a refund under 18 this section without satisfactory evidence (such as proof that the tax deduction was made, and that the deduction has been paid to the Commissioner). 327G Subsection (4) Refund may be applied to other amounts due Where any person to whom a refund is due has any amount due to be paid in accordance with any other provision of this Act the Commissioner may apply the refund towards satisfying that amount due. 327G Subsection (5) Any excess refund may be recovered from recipient Where the Commissioner is satisfied that an exces- sive amount has been refunded to a recipient that amount can be recovered as if it were income tax. The due date for recovery of an excess amount refunded shall be:- •where the recipient led the Commissioner to pay the refund by wilful default or neglect, the date upon which the refund was paid; •in any other case, on the 5th working day of the month following the month in which the person is notified that the refund is to be repaid. 327G Subsection (6) Refund to be made from Consolidated Fund without further appropriation Refunds payable pursuant to this section are to be made from the Consolidated Fund and no further appropriation is required. 327H Resident Withholding Tax deduction certificates (IR 15) This section requires payers of interest or specified dividends to provide recipients with tax deduction certificates showing gross interest paid or derived and deductions made. Certificates must be given by 20th May in relation to the previous year and must be given earlier on request in certain circumstances. They can be given in relation to total payments or each payment. A payer who pays interest of less than $20 to any particular recipient is not required to give a tax deduction certificate in respect of that interest unless requested. Where 2 or more persons are joint account holders, only one tax deduction certificate need be issued. 327H Subsection (1) Payer to prepare a certificate with details of interest or specified dividends paid and deductions made. Every payer, including persons who make pay- ments as agents or trustees) shall prepare tax deduction certificates to notify recipients of interest or specified dividends of the amount of payments made and the amount of tax deductions which have been made. The information is to be given on an approved form of certificate and will contain the information detailed in subsection (6) It is anticipated that the Commissioner will approve modifications to forms already issued by payers, such as bank statements, etc., pro- vided they meet the requirements concerning information to be supplied. 327H Subsection (2) Tax Deduction Certificate may be issued annually or at time of payment Note. In this section the term- •recipient refers to any person to whom resi- dent withholding income is paid, or by whom such income is derived in accordance with section 327D. •payer refers to any person who is making a payment direct to a recipient or to any agent or trustee who has received a payment on behalf of a recipient and is required to make an RWT deduction in accordance with S327D. A tax deduction certificate may, at the payer’s discretion, be prepared and supplied to a recipient either in respect of all amounts paid, or for each amount paid in any one year. The certificate must be given not later than the 20th of May in respect of payments in the immediately preceding year ended 31st March. 327H Subsection (3) Tax Deduction Certificate to be provided on request A recipient may, during a relevant year, request a payer to provide a tax deduction certificate in respect of deductions made during that year where a financial arrangement in respect of which a tax deduction was made has matured, been remitted or disposed of. The payer shall provide such a tax deduction certificate within 20 working days of the request being made. PROVIDED that no payer shall be obliged to 19 provide a tax deduction certificate pursuant to this section before the 20th May 1990 except where the Commissioner so requires. This proviso is in recognition of the initial difficul- ties anticipated by the financial institutions during the commencement of this regime. 327H Subsection (4) Tax Deduction Certificate to be provided on cessation of taxable activity Where a person who will not continue to hold a Certificate of Exemption, in any month: -ceases to carry on a taxable activity; or -ceases to carry on any such taxable activity in New Zealand, - that person shall prepare and provide to recipients any required tax deduction certificates by the 20th day of the following month. 327H Subsection (5) Person ceases to hold a Valid Certificate of Exemption Where a person in any month ceases to hold a valid Certificate of Exemption, and is not required to make deductions due to continuing in a taxable activity, that person shall prepare and provide to recipients any required tax deduction certificates by the 20th day of the following month. 327H Subsection (6) Information to be included on tax deduction certificates Tax deduction certificates shall contain the follow- ing information: a)the full name and relevant address of the payer; b)full name and last known address of the recipient except where the payer is unable to obtain such details of the recipient, after making reasonable enquiries; c)type of resident withholding income to which the certificate relates (either interest or specified dividends); d)the date on which the deduction was made, or the year to which the certificate relates (in cases where an annual total is provided); e)the total amount of tax deductions, and the total amount of the income from which the deductions were made; f)Such further information as the Commissioner may require. 327H Subsection (7) No Certificate where annual interest payment was less than $20 Where the total interest paid by a payer to a recipi- ent in any one year is less than $20 a tax deduction certificate need not be supplied in relation to that payment or tax deduction unless a request has been received in writing for the issue of a certificate which must be supplied within 20 working days. 327H Subsection (8) Tax deduction certificates to be retained for 3 years. Tax deduction certificates must be retained by the person to whom they are provided for 3 years unless the Commissioner otherwise permits e.g. where the Commissioner has requested earlier delivery of certificates by recipients. 327H Subsection (9) Joint Accounts Where two or more persons hold joint financial arrangements, bank accounts etc, a payer preparing a tax deduction certificate may treat those persons as one person; i.e. only issue one certificate. The certificate shall be issued in the name of the holders jointly unless the holders specify any one or more of those holders as the person(s) to whom the certificate should be supplied. 327H Subsection (10) Tax deduction Certificate deemed to have been provided A tax deduction certificate is deemed to have been provided to a recipient where it is given to the recipient personally, sent by post to the last known place of abode or business or given personally or sent by post to any other person authorised to act for the recipient. 327H Subsection (11) Transitional Provision Where the Commissioner is satisfied in relation to withholding tax deductions made in the year commencing 1 April 1989 that a person, or class of persons is unable to comply with the above require- ments the Commissioner may vary those require- ments in one or more of the following ways: a)reducing the nature or amount of information required to be included in the RWT deduc- tion certificate; b)extending the time within which the payer must prepare and provide the RWT deduc- tion certificate; c)relieving the payer from the obligation to prepare and provided RWT deduction certificates. 20 327I - Resident Withholding Tax Deduction Reconciliation statements - (IR 15S) This section requires all persons who deduct resident withholding tax in relation to interest or specified dividends to deliver to the Commissioner an annual statement showing total tax deductions which have been paid to the Commissioner, and total tax deductions which were required to be made as well as other information in respect of payments made. Copies of all tax deduction certifi- cates should accompany this reconciliation state- ment, unless the Commissioner grants an exemp- tion (an alternative). 327I Subsection (1) Reconciliation statement approved form All persons who make tax deductions from interest or specified dividends during a year are required to furnish a reconciliation statement to the Commis- sioner by the 31st May of each year. The statement will be on an approved form and will include such information as the Commissioner may require. 327I Subsection (2) Copies of tax deduction certificates and information on exempt interest recipients While copies of RWT deduction certificates which support the information contained in the Reconcili- ation statement are not required to accompany every reconciliation statement, the Commissioner is given wide powers to request such information as he may require. Copies of all RWT deduction certificates or of a particular RWT deduction certificate may be re- quested by the Commissioner from any payer who furnishes an annual reconciliation statement. Where a payer has paid interest or specified divi- dends to a person who holds a Certificate of Ex- emption, and the payer has therefore not made any tax deduction from such payments during a year the Commissioner may also request details includ- ing: -Full name and last known address of a recipient; -Total amount of interest or specified divi- dends paid to that recipient; -In the case of any payments made after 1 April 1990 the tax file number shown on that recipient's Certificate of Exemption (except where the recipient is a registered bank, building society, trustee bank, trustee company or the Maori Trustee or Public Trustee); -any other information which the Commis- sioner may require Such information shall be in such form as the Commissioner may approve. This is intended to allow for the use of electronic tape, computer discs etc when payers provide details of tax deductions to the Commissioner. 327I Subsection (3) Time by which information to be provided Any information requested pursuant to subsection (2) must be supplied to the Commissioner: -where the Commissioner has requested such information not less than 30 working days before the 31st of May, the information shall be provided with the reconciliation state- ment; -in any other case within 30 days of a request being made. Following the repeal of section 429 from 1 October 1989 the provisions of this section will enable the Commissioner to request particular payers of resident withholding income to provide informa- tion as required. At least 30 days notice of such a requirement is mandatory. Note:The expression “30 days” in being amended by the Taxation Reform Bill (No 6) to “20 working days”. 327I Subsection (4) Reconciliation statement where payer ceases business Where any payer who does not continue to hold a Certificate of Exemption - •disposes of or ceases to carry on any taxable activity; or •ceases to carry on any such business in New Zealand, in any month during a year in which tax deductions have been made, that payer must, within 40 work- ing days after the end of that month, furnish a reconciliation statement for that portion of the year during which tax deductions were made. 327I Subsection (5) Reconciliation statement where payer ceases to hold a valid Certificate of Exemption Where any payer who does not continue to be required to make resident withholding tax deduc- tions by virtue of carrying on a taxable activity, ceases to be entitled to hold a Certificate of Exemp- tion in any month during a year in which tax deductions have been made, that payer must, 21 within 40 working days after the end of that month, furnish a reconciliation statement for that portion of the year during which tax deductions were made. 327I Subsection (6) Power to vary The Commissioner may vary any of the require- ments of this section. 327J Disclosure of interest payments where no RWT deduction is required This section, which takes effect from 1 April 1990, requires disclosure of information relating to payments of RWI being interest which are deduct- ible expenditure to the payer but from which no RWT deduction has been made. It would apply in situations where, for example, a person borrows money for the purpose of purchas- ing shares. That person may return income from dividends and deduct any interest expense in- curred but is not conducting “a taxable activity”. It also applies where deductions are not made because the total interest paid is less than $5000 (Section 327C (5) refers. 327J Subsection (1) Disclosure of deductible interest from which no tax deduction has been made Any person who makes any interest payment after 1 April 1990 which: (i)is not incurred in the course of or further- ance of a taxable activity and is therefore not subject to the provisions of Section 327C; or from which no deduction is made because the total interest paid is less than $5000 (section 327C(5); and (ii)is incurred in gaining or producing assess- able income; and (iii)is paid to a non-exempt recipient; is required to provide certain information with their annual income tax return. This information includes the name, address and tax file number of all recipients of any payments of interest made during the year and the total amount of interest paid to each recipient, and such further information as the Commissioner may require. 327J Subsection (2) Interest recipient to supply tax file number to payer on request A recipient who receives a payment of interest from which there has been no tax deduction made because the payment was not made in the course of a taxable activity, or because the payer had paid less than $5000 in interest during that year, and who receives a written request from the payer for the tax file number of the recipient shall provide that number within 10 working days of receiving the request. 327K Resident Withholding Tax deductions to be credited against Income Tax assessed RWT deductions made will be credited against income tax payable by the recipient. Initially, information obtained from RWT deduction certifi- cates will be recorded in a recipient's annual return of income, but a taxpayer may be required to supply those certificates to verify information in the return. 327K Subsection (1) Income and Specified dividends include any amount deducted Where any interest or specified dividends are derived from which RWT has been deducted the amount derived shall include the amount of the deductions made. e.g.$100 interest derived $ 24 RWT deducted $ 76 actually paid, but $100 deemed to be derived for the purposes of calculating assessable income. 327K Subsection (2) Tax deductions to be credited Where resident withholding tax (excluding addi- tional tax or penal tax) has been deducted from any interest or specified dividends derived by any person in any year, the Commissioner shall credit the total tax deductions made in that year in pay- ment successively of a)any income tax payable by that person for that year; b)any income tax due and unpaid in respect of any previous year; c)any income tax due and unpaid in respect of any year after that income year, and if more than one, in the order of those years and shall refund to the recipient any tax deductions not so credited. 22 327K Subsection (3) Credits to be applied after Foreign Tax Credits or Imputation Credits This subsection provides an ordering rule so that credits arising from tax deductions shall be applied after any credit arising from Foreign Tax Credits (Section 293), or Imputation Credits (Section 394ZE). This is because those credits are not refundable whereas RWT deduction credits are. 327K Subsection (4) Information to be included in return of income The Commissioner shall not allow a credit of tax or pay a refund unless the Commissioner has received either an RWT certificate or other satisfactory evidence in writing, and any other information the Commissioner may require. The intent of this provision is that taxpayers will record in the tax return the details of resident withholding income and the deductions made therefrom. If the information is inadequate the Commissioner can then request that the actual tax deduction certificates be forward to enable the information in the return to be verified. 327K Subsection (5) Where claim is in excess of credit available Commissioner may refuse to allow claim Where the Commissioner believes that an excess amount has been claimed either as a credit or as a refund the claim may be refused. 327K Subsection (6) Commissioner may recover any amount credited or refunded which was in excess of available tax deductions. Any amount which has been credited or refunded which was in excess of the amount of tax deduc- tions made from RWI paid to a recipient shall be recoverable by the Commissioner and shall be due: a)Where the excess has been paid as a refund - (i)if the person by wilful default or neglect led the Commissioner to allow the refund, on the date upon which the refund was paid; or (ii)in any other case by the 5th working day of the month following the month in which the recipient is notified that the excess is payable. b) Where the excess has been allowed as a credit against income payable, upon the date on which was payable the tax against which the excess tax credit was allowed. 327K Subsection (7) Commissioner may alter assessments For the purposes of this section the Commissioner may at any time alter any assessment or determina- tion not withstanding anything in section 25 of this Act. (Section 25 sets time limits beyond which the Commissioner cannot reassess returns to increase a liability except in cases of fraud.) 327L Resident Withholding Tax Deductions from Dividends deemed to be Dividend With- holding Payment Credits An RWT deduction is deemed to be a dividend withholding payment credit attached to a dividend under Part XIIB of the Act for certain purposes, such as reporting to the Commissioner and notify- ing shareholders. The foreign dividend withholding payment regime therefore provides the mechanism whereby a shareholder may claim the amount of the RWT deduction as a credit of tax. 327L Subsection (1) - Definitions for the purposes of this section Certain terms which have been specially defined in various sections for purposes of the Imputation regime have to be re-defined here with reference to the original sections in which the terms are used to integrate the withholding tax regime with the imputation regime and the foreign dividend with- holding payment regime “Dividend withholding payment account company” - 394ZK “Dividend withholding payment account return” - 394ZZC “Imputation credit account company” - 394A “Imputation return” - 394J 327L Subsection (2) - Tax deductions from divi- dends deemed to be dividend withholding payment credits Any RWT deduction made from a dividend (not being a specified dividend) is deemed to be a dividend withholding payment credit and the company paying the dividend is deemed to be a dividend withholding payment account company for the purposes of the following provisions of the principal Act: a)Paragraph (h) of the definition of ‘residual income tax’ in S375; 23 This allows for credits arising through RWT deductions to be taken into account before arriving at an amount of residual income tax. b)S394ZC, Dividends to include credits for Part IV of the Act. Total dividend income derived includes the dividend paid, plus imputation credits or dividend withholding payment credits attached to the dividend. c)S394ZD, Determination of amount of credit in certain cases. Section 394ZD provides rules for determin- ing the amount of imputation credit and dividend withholding payment credit in a variety of circumstances (refer to Appendix to TIB No 1 for a discussion of that section). d)S394ZP, Credit of tax for dividend with holding payment credit in hands of share- holder. Where assessable income of a taxpayer includes the amount of any dividend with- holding payment credit the taxpayer is entitled to a credit of tax of the amount so included. e)S394ZQ, Refund to non-resident or exempt shareholders Where any dividend with dividend with- holding tax credits attached is paid to a non- resident shareholder, or to a tax exempt shareholder, the shareholder may apply in writing for a refund of the attached credits. f)S394ZR, Refund out of Consolidated Account Refunds of dividend withholding payment credits may be paid out of the Consolidated Fund without further appropriation. g)S394ZZB, Statement to shareholder when dividend paid Where any dividend withholding payment credit is attached to a dividend, a share- holder dividend statement is required to be given to the shareholder. 327L Subsection (3) - Annual Information to be provided and means of providing Where RWT deductions are made from dividends, not being specified dividends, by a New Zealand resident company certain information is to be provided to the Commissioner •In the case of a ‘dividend withholding pay- ment account company’, the information is to be provided in the company’s annual divi- dend withholding payment return. •In the case of an ‘imputation credit account company’ which is not also a 'dividend withholding payment account company', the information is to be provided in the compa- ny's annual imputation return. (The methods of providing information in connection with payments of specified divi- dends are included in sections 327H & 327I.) 327L Subsection (4) Information to be completed at time of deduction Any resident company which pays dividends, which are not specified dividends, and makes RWT deductions therefrom is required to provide certain information to the Commissioner. •Where a company is an ‘imputation credit account company’ that information is to be included in the company dividend statement prepared in accordance with section 394H. •In any other case the information is to be included in an approved form showing: •The number of shares in respect of which the dividend is declared or, in the case of a bonus issue, the number of shares included in the bonus issue; •The date the dividend is declared and the date of payment of the dividend; •The total amount paid as dividends •Such further information as may be required. 327M Certificates of Exemption (IR 15C) Certain persons can apply for a certificate of ex- emption which enables them to receive interest and dividends without the deduction of RWT. Included in this section are details of how to apply for a certificate of exemption, commentary on special rules for specific applicants, and an outline of the implications associated with the cancellation of the certificate. 327M Subsection (1) Persons who may apply for a Certificate of Exemption The following persons may apply for the issue of a certificate of exemption:- 24 (a)Any registered bank; (b)Any building society; (c)Any trustee bank; (d)The Public Trustee, the Maori Trustee or any Trustee company; (e)Any person whose principal form of business is the borrowing of money, or accepting of depos- its, or receiving of credit, or selling of any credit instrument, and the lending of money, or grant- ing of credit or buying or discounting any credit instrument; (f)Any person who has derived total assessable income before allowable deductions in excess of $2,000,000, as shown in their most recent return of income - provided all returns required to be filed under the Act have been filed by the due date; (g)Any person who believes in any income year that their income in the next accounting year will exceed $2,000,000; (This category provides for situations such as amalgamations and take-overs where future income can be estimated with a degree of certainty. It would also provide for a situation where a smaller business enters into a firm contract which will increase existing total assessable income above the $2 million criteria, and numerous similar situa- tions.) (h)Any person whose income is wholly or partly exempt from income tax through various provi- sions of Section 61. \* See Note below This includes:- S 61 (2) Local or Public Authority \* See Note S 61 (23) Friendly Society S 61 (24) Scientific or Industrial research pro- moter S 61 (25) Charity S 61 (26) Charitable Estate S 61 (27) Charity - business income S 61 (28) Veterinary Services Promoter S 61 (29) Herd improvement promoter S 61 (30) Amateur sports promoter S 61 (32) Racing Clubs S 61 (33) District Improvements S 61 (44) Cornwall Park - but the exemption only applies to the activities in respect of which the income is exempt, not to interest received for any other purpose; (i)S 61 (34) Non-profit body - however, as the exemption given to non-profit bodies under this subsection is only to the extent that the aggre- gate income of any such society or association, whether incorporated or not, does not exceed $1,000, a blanket exemption will not be available for all non-profit bodies; Note:The taxation Reform Bill (No 6) includes amendments to section 327M to: (1)clarify that nominee companies engaged in contributory finance arrangements and whose activities are governed either by rules made pursuant to the Law Practitioners Act 1982 or the Securities Act (Contributory Mortgage) Regulations 1988 are eligible for certificates of exemption. (2)provide that certificates of exemption may be issued to persons exempt from tax under other Acts and also to Local Authorities which were previously exempted under section 61(2) of the principal Act and are now exempt under section 61(2A) of the principal Act. (3)remove the requirement that persons making application for a certificate of exemption in respect of carry-forward losses, or other limited circumstances, have to complete a separate declaration in addition to the decla- ration on the actual prescribed application form. 327M Subsection (2) Application to be in writing The application for an exemption is to be on an approved form (IR 15E) and must state which category of exemption is applicable to the person applying. There will be a declaration to be signed by the applicant, or by an officer on behalf of the applicant, that the criteria are met. Note:Each company in a group of companies must apply separately for a certificate of exemp- tion. There is no provision for a single group registration. 327M Subsection (3) Commissioner may require further information The Commissioner may require further information including books of account, accounting information or any records needed in order to confirm an applicants status before the issue of a certificate of exemption. 25 327M Subsection (4) Certificate shall be valid from date stated on Certificate After receipt of an application and any further information required the Commissioner may issue a Certificate of Exemption for such period as he shall determine. The certificate will be dated and will be valid from the date on the certificate. Where the certificate is issued for a limited period the date of termination will be shown on the certificate. The applicant’s tax file number will also be shown on the certificate. 327M Subsection (5) Certificate lost or destroyed may be replaced Where the Commissioner receives a satisfactory explanation of loss or destruction of a Certificate of Exemption, a replacement certificate may be issued. 327M Subsection (6) Estimation of $2,000,000 assessable income to be supported by evidence at end of accounting year Where a person has been issued with a Certificate of Exemption pursuant to an estimate that the person will derive in excess of $2,000,000 total assessable income before allowable deductions in an ensuing accounting period, that person shall produce sufficient evidence within three months after that accounting year to satisfy the Commis- sioner that the threshold figure was exceeded. Otherwise, the Certificate may be cancelled (327N). 327M Subsection (7) Where expectation of $2 M assessable income not realised additional tax will be chargeable. Where a person has obtained an exemption in the expectation of exceeding $2,000,000 of assessable income and does not reach that threshold addi- tional tax will be charged on the amounts which would have been deducted from interest received by that person had that person not held a Certifi- cate of Exemption. Additional tax will be charged from each date on which any deduction would have been payable to the Commissioner, and will incur incremental penalties each following 6 months. (Section 327U refers) 327M Subsection (8) Group members may combine to reach $2,000,000 threshold of assessable income. Companies which are members of a group of companies (pursuant to Section 191 of the Act) may combine their income in the year to which the most recently filed returns of income relate for the purposes of obtaining a Certificate of Exemption based on the $2,000,000 threshold of total assessable income before allowable deductions. 327M Subsection (9) Group provisions apply when estimating potential income above threshold. Where a company which is applying for a certifi- cate of Exemption pursuant to subsection (1) (g) anticipates that it will be a member of a group for the relevant 12 month period that company may include the income of the whole group for the purposes of estimating that it will exceed the $2,000,000 threshold. 327M Subsection (10) Exclusion of inter group interest payments for purposes of $2 million threshold A group of companies must exclude income de- rived from inter-group transactions when deter- mining whether it satisfies the $2 million test. This is an avoidance measure targeted at group transactions which may otherwise be entered into to manipulate group profits. 327M Subsection (11) Commissioner's discretion in respect of failure to meet the $2 million threshold The Commissioner has a discretion to - a)issue a certificate of exemption; or b)permit the retention of a certificate; or c)remit the whole or part of any additional tax payable by virtue of ss (7), - where a person has failed to either maintain, or meet the expected $2 million threshold. In exercising discretion the Commissioner needs to be satisfied that the failure is solely as a conse- quence of extraordinary circumstances that are - d)beyond the reasonable control of the person concerned; and e)not likely to be repeated in subsequent years; and f)in the case of remission of additional tax, circumstances which the applicant for a certificate could not reasonably have been expected to foresee. 327M Subsection (12) Certificates may be issued where taxpayer in loss position or where aggre- gate allowable deductions not less than aggregate of assessable income Any person who is not eligible for a Certificate of Exemption under any of the above provisions may 26 be granted a certificate for a specified period in certain prescribed circumstances. The Commissioner will need to be satisfied that either - •the person will or is likely to incur a loss or •is likely to be entitled to claim aggregate deduc- tions from their assessable income which will exceed that income; or •the person would, in each income year any part of which falls in the period for which the certifi- cate is issued, be likely or entitled to claim resident withholding tax credits which would exceed that person’s income tax liability for that year by more than $500. An application for a certificate under these pro visions must be in writing on form IR 15E and should be accompanied by - •a declaration by the applicant or any duly authorised officer of the applicant stating which of the above categories of this section applies for the proposed period of the certifi- cate; and •a set of budgeted accounts detailing, for the proposed period of the certificate of exemp- tion -projected income; and -deductions; and -resident withholding tax credits; and -income tax liability of the person; and •such further information in relation to the person or to the budgeted accounts as the Commissioner may require. Note: The Taxation Reform Bill (No 6) includes an amendment to section 327M to remove the require- ment that persons making application for a certifi- cate of exemption under this subsection have to complete a separate declaration in addition to the declaration on the actual prescribed application form. 327M Subsection (13) Date of termination of Certificate to be date of Cancellation Where a certificate has been issued in terms of subsection (12) and is not immediately replaced by another valid certificate, the date of termination shown on the certificate will be treated as notifica- tion by the Commissioner to the holder of that certificate that the certificate is cancelled. All the provisions of section 327N which covers cancella- tion of certificates will apply from the date of termination. 327M Subsection (14) No notification without copy of certificate issued under Ss12 Any holder of a certificate issued in terms of subsection (12) and who notifies any other person (e.g. payers of interest or dividends) that the holder has a valid certificate of exemption, must provide the other person with a copy of that certificate. 327N Unincorporated Bodies Any body of persons may apply for a certificate of exemption if they meet the criteria discussed under S327M. The following rules apply to the members of such bodies. 327N Subsection (1) Definitions The following definitions apply to this section:- “Body” means an unincorporated body of persons; and includes a partnership, a joint venture and the trustees of a trust; “Member” means a partner, a joint venturer, a trustee, or a member of any body; “Partnership” and “Partner” have the same meanings as in the Partnership Act 1908. 327N Subsection (2) Activities of particular bodies in relation to taxable activity not activities of individual members Where any body that carries on any taxable activity is issued with a certificate of exemption in relation to the carrying on of that taxable activity the fol- lowing rules apply, for the purposes of this Part of this Act. a)The members of that body will not individu- ally be entitled to a certificate of exemption in relation to that taxable activity; and b)Any payments made in the course of that taxable activity will be deemed to be made by that body, and not by the members of that body; and c)Any payment received by any member of that body in their capacity as a member of that body in the course of the taxable activity shall be deemed to be made by that body and 27 deemed not to be received by that individual member; and d)The certificate of exemption shall be in the name of the body, or where the body is the trustee of a trust, in the name of the trust; and e)Subject to subsection (3) any change of members of that body shall have no effect. 327N Subsection (3) Members of body holding Certificate of Exemption jointly and severally liable Every member of a body which has a certificate of exemption in relation to a particular taxable activity is jointly and severally liable with any other mem- ber for all resident withholding tax payable. Where a member is an individual, in the event of that member’s death, that member’s estate shall be severally liable for any unpaid RWT. Where any such body is a partnership, joint venture or the trustees of a trust, a member will not cease to be a member until any change of membership is notified in writing to the Commissioner. 327N Subsection (4) Notice to body deemed to be served on all members of that body Any properly served notice addressed to a body by the name in which a certificate of exemption was issued is deemed to be served on that body and on all the members of that body. 327N Subsection (5) Requirement of this Part imposed jointly and severally on all members Subject to subsection (6) any requirement of this Part of the Act for any thing to be done shall be the joint and several liability of all members of the body to do that thing. Once any liability has been fulfilled by any one member that will satisfy the obligation on all members. 327N Subsection (6) Requirements where body has wide membership Subject to subsection (3) the obligations of any body which is not a partnership, joint venture or trustees of a trust, and the affairs of which are managed by members or a committee or committees of its members shall be the joint and several responsibil- ity of a)Every officer such as president, chairman, treasurer, secretary or similar; or b)In default of any such officer, every member who holds office as a member of a commit- tee. Where any obligation has been done by one of the persons in categories a) or b) above that will be sufficient compliance with any requirement. 327O Cancellation of Certificates of Exemption The Certificates of Exemption remain valid unless cancelled. This section states the circumstances in which a Certificate of Exemption may be cancelled. 3270 Subsection (1) Holder of Certificate of Ex- emption to inform Commissioner when circum- stances change, and to return the Certificate. Where any person who holds a Certificate of Exemption ceases to come within the basis of exemption under which the certificate was issued that person shall, within 5 working days of becom- ing aware of the fact that they no longer meet the criteria, inform the Commissioner in writing that the exemption no longer applies and return the Certificate of Exemption. The Commissioner may request details of all persons to whom the person has shown the certifi- cate for the purposes of gaining an exemption, and in this case that information is to be supplied within 5 working days. This is to enable the Commissioner to inform the payers of interest or dividends that the Certificate has been cancelled. 327O Subsection (2) - Commissioner may cancel Certificate in certain circumstances The Commissioner may cancel any person’s certifi- cate of exemption at any time in the following circumstances: (a)If the Commissioner believes that the basis of exemption specified in the application no longer applies; (b)If the person is not within the basis of exemp- tion applied for but has obtained the certifi- cate on the basis of misleading or insufficient information; (c)Where the certificate was obtained on the basis of an estimate that income in the fol- lowing accounting year would exceed $2,000,000 and - 28 the evidence supplied within the 3 months after the 12 month period shows that the assessable income. derived did not exceed $2,000,000; or where the person does not provide the required evidence within the 3 month period; or where the Commissioner has reason to believe that the evidence furnished by the person is incorrect or misleading; (d)If the person has not paid any income tax due and payable by the due date. Whenever the Commissioner cancels a person’s certificate notice shall be given in writing to that person that the certificate has been cancelled and that it should be delivered to the Commissioner within 5 working days. The Commissioner may also ask for details of all payers to whom the person has shown the Certificate for purposes of obtaining an exemption from deductions. Except where a certificate has been cancelled because income tax due has not been paid, the Commissioner shall not cancel a certificate of exemption where a holder ceases to meet one set of criteria while notwithstanding still meeting another set of criteria. 327O Subsection (3) Commissioner may inform The Commissioner may inform any person of the cancellation of a Certificate of Exemption at any time. 327O Subsection (4) Person whose Certificate is cancelled to inform payers Any person who is notified that their Certificate of Exemption has been cancelled shall, within 5 work- ing days of receiving notification, notify in writing all payers of resident withholding income to whom they have previously shown the Certificate that this has been cancelled. 327O Subsection (5) Publication of Cancellations By the 30th June each year the Commissioner shall publish - •a list of all Certificates of Exemption which have been cancelled during the previous year, unless a further certificate has been issued subsequently in that year; and •a list of all certificates of exemption which have been re-issued, not within that same year. i.e. where the certificate was cancelled and details of the cancellation published in a prior year. The Commissioner shall also publish quarterly, in April, July, October and January, in the last issue of the Commercial edition of the Gazette in each of those months - •a list of all certificates cancelled in the quar- ter which ended on the last day of the previ- ous month; and •a list of re-issued certificates which have been re-issued, not within that same 3 month period, i.e. where the certificate was can- celled and details of the cancellation pub- lished in a prior Gazette. 327O Subsection (6) Cancelled certificates to be returned to Commissioner Where a person who has a certificate cancelled is requested to deliver such certificate to the Commis- sioner that person shall deliver all original copies which have been issued. 327O Subsection (7) Certificate ceases to be valid 5 working days after publication or notification Where notice of cancellation of a Certificate of Exemption appears in an issue of the Gazette the certificate shall cease to be valid 5 working days after publication date. Where any person is advised by the Commissioner, or by the person to whom the Certificate had applied, the certificate shall cease to be valid 5 working days from such notice being given. These provisions incorporating a 5 working day grace period are to allow for financial institutions or other persons to update any EDP or computer programmes to commence deductions of RWT. In practice it is intended to ensure that cancellations are notified, or take effect from dates which will not interfere with the end of the month interest calcula- tions of institutions. 327P RECORDS TO BE KEPT 327P Subsection (1) Meaning of “Records” “Records” is given the same meaning as in S 428 which details many of the standard business and accounting records which are required to be kept by persons deriving income. 327P Subsection (2) Additional records to be kept by persons making deductions Every person who is required to make tax deduc- tions from resident withholding income shall keep, in English, sufficient records to enable the 29 Commissioner, at any time, to ascertain readily the following information: a)The amount of the payment before any deduction; b)The amount of the resident withholding tax deduction; c)The date of the payment; d)The full name and last known address the recipient of the payment; e)In the case of an interest payment, any number used to identify the financial ar- rangement in relation to which the interest was paid; (i.e. bank account number, etc) f)such other information as the Commissioner may prescribe. 327P Subsection (3) Records required where payments made to holders of Certificates of Exemption Every person who makes payments of interest or pays dividends, from which deductions are not made because the recipient holds a Certificate of Exemption shall keep in English sufficient records to enable the Commissioner, at any time, to ascer- tain:- a)The amount and date of each payment b)Full name and last known address of recipi- ent c)Each recipient's Certificate of Exemption number 327P Subsection (4) Details of financial arrangements Payers who are required to keep records pursuant to either subsections (2) or (3) i.e. whether or not deductions were made, shall also record in relation to each recipient of interest or specified dividend sufficient information to enable all financial ar- rangements under which interest has been paid to that recipient to be identified. 327P Subsection (5) Details in respect of payments made by non-business taxpayers and in respect of recording Tax file numbers Persons required to report details to the Commis- sioner regarding either payment of interest from which deductions are not made or details of the tax file numbers of persons receiving resident with- holding income from which deductions are re- quired to be made, shall keep those records in English to allow verification by the Commissioner. 327P Subsection (6). Records to be retained in safe custody for 10 years Reasonable precautions should be taken for the safe custody of all required records. Records required for the RWI regime are required to be retained for 10 years except where the Com- missioner has given notice in writing that retention is not required; where the records have been required to be provided to another person; or where the person is a company which has been wound up and dissolved-. 327Q RECOVERY OF RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS 327Q Subsection (1) Deduction in Trust for Crown Resident withholding tax deductions are held in trust for the Crown. They shall not be the property of the person who is required to pay them to the Commissioner. In the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of the deductor, or of any assignment for the benefit of the person’s creditors, the deduc- tions shall not form part of the deductor’s funds. 327Q Subsection (2) Ranking of unpaid deductions The provisions of S365(2) which deal with unpaid PAYE deductions made by an employer are paral- leled here. a)Any unpaid deductions which are deemed to be held in trust rank in the event of bank- ruptcy, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors of the person who made the deduc- tion, in priority after claims in respect of wages etc. and in priority to any other claims. b)In the event of a liquidation or receivership, where unpaid deductions were made by a company, the amount of the tax deduction shall rank after the debts referred to in S308 (1) of the Companies Act 1955. Where the assets of the company are insufficient to meet the amount of the tax deduction it has prior- ity over the claims of holders of debentures under any floating charge. 327Q Subsection (3) Application of section This section applies notwithstanding anything in any other Act, and in particular section 308 of the Companies Act 1955 shall apply subject to this section. 30 327R UNPAID RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS CONSTITUTE CHARGE ON PAYER’S PROPERTY 327R Subsection (1) Unpaid deductions constitute a charge on Payer’s Property Where any payer fails either to deduct the full amount of RWT deduction required, or to pay any deductions made to the Commissioner, an amount equal to the amount unpaid (together with any additional tax or penal tax ) shall constitute a charge on all the real and personal property of the payer. Where judgement (in any Court action for recovery of the amount outstanding) is obtained, any fees, costs or expenses included will also form part of that charge. 327R Subsection (2) Charge over property of person liable These provisions parallel the provisions in the source deduction regime, to enable a charge to be secured over the property of a person who fails to account for RWT deductions. The provisions of S367 detail priority of charges, registration, giving of notices, releasing, operating, enforcement, vesting orders and the effects of a vesting order. 327R Subsection (3) Ranking of charge Any amount secured under this section shall rank equally with amounts secured under S 367 ( PAYE deductions) in any receivership or liquidation of any company, or in any bankruptcy or creditors’ assignment where the payer of the RWI is an individual. 327S PERSON FAILING TO MAKE RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS 327S Subsection (1) Default deemed debt due to Commissioner from date due for payment Where a payer fails to make an RWT deduction as required, the amount which should have been deducted will constitute a debt payable to the Commissioner and will be deemed to have become due on the day on which it should have been due to be paid to the Commissioner had it been properly deducted. 327S Subsection (2) Commissioner may recover from payer and/or recipient The Commissioner has the right to recover the amount of any RWT deduction which should have been made from the payer, in addition to the right to recover the amount of income tax payable by the recipient in respect of the resident withholding income from which the deduction should have been made. The Commissioner may take whatever steps are necessary to recover the amount from both the payer and the recipient; from either of them; or partly from one and partly from the other. 327S Subsection (3) Payment made by person other than person liable Where any payer who has a debt due in respect of unpaid tax deductions can satisfy the Commis- sioner that the resident withholding tax payable by that payer has been paid by any other person that payment shall be deemed to be made by the payer with the initial liability. 327T ASSESSMENT OF RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS TO BE MADE UNDER THIS PART OF THIS ACT In circumstances where a payer has either failed to make an RWT deduction, or having made a deduc- tion fails to pass it on to the Commissioner, then a formal assessment may be made which will enable any outstanding money to be collected using the standard procedures used for outstanding income tax. 327T Subsection (1) Power to make assessments The Commissioner may make an assessment of any amount which becomes due or payable and the person to whom the assessment is issued shall be liable to pay that amount unless an objection made to that assessment, either on the grounds that the amount is excessive, or that that person is not liable to account, is upheld. 327T Subsection (2) Other sections to apply Other sections of the Act are hereby made applica- ble to an assessment issued under this section. They are S 23 -Authority to amend assessments. S 25 -Limitation of time for amendment of assess- ments S 26 -Validity of assessments not affected by failure to comply with any of the sections of the Act; 31 S 27 -Assessment deemed correct except on pro- ceedings on objection; S 28 -Copies or extracts of returns or assessments shall be sufficient evidence; S 29 - Notice of assessment to be given as soon as convenient after making the assessment, but failure to give such notice shall not invalidate the assessment; They apply as if - •the term “tax already assessed” included an amount assessed under subsection (1); and •the term “taxpayer” used in sections 23, 27 & 29 shall include a person who is assessed under subsection (1); and •the term “income tax for any year” in section 25(1) included an amount assessed under sub- section (1) of this section; and •the term “income” in section 25 (2) included an amount of resident withholding income. 327T Subsection (3) Assessment subject to objection An assessment made in connection with RWT shall be subject to the objection procedures detailed in Part III of the principal Act in the same manner as if the outstanding amount was income tax imposed under section 38. The terms “income tax” and “tax” as used in Part III shall include any amount as- sessed under this section, and the term “taxpayer” shall include a person who is assessed. 327U ADDITIONAL TAX FOR DEFAULTS 327U Subsection (1) Additional tax imposed Where any person either fails to deduct RWT or having made a deduction fails to pay the amount of the RWT deduction to the Commissioner an addi- tional tax of ten percent of the amount unpaid shall be payable from the date failure occurs. If the amount outstanding, and any additional tax is unpaid at the end of 6 months, a further ten percent of the total shall be payable. Ten percent will continue to be added for each consecutive period of 6 months thereafter until the total amount outstanding is paid. 327U Subsection (2) Time of deduction An RWT deduction is deemed to have been made at the time of payment of net resident withholding income. 327U Subsection (3) Payment by other person deemed to be made by first person for purposes of determining additional tax liability A person (the first person) who is liable to pay any amount of additional tax in relation to a failure to make an RWT deduction, or failure to pay to the Commissioner any tax deduction which has been made may be able to satisfy the Commissioner that a second person has made a deduction, or paid the outstanding amount to the Commissioner. If the Commissioner is so satisfied, for the purposes of determining the liability of the first person to pay any additional tax, the payment will be deemed to have been made by the first person. 327U Subsection (4) Nature of Additional Tax Additional tax imposed under this section is deemed to be of the same nature as the amount on which it is imposed, but will not give rise to credits under Section 327K(2) or to dividend withholding payment credits. 327U Subsection (5) Other Parts of the Act to apply Subject to this Part, other Parts of the principal Act apply to any additional tax imposed by this section as if it were additional tax imposed under section 398(2) and as if the person liable to pay were the taxpayer. A particular application relates to Section 413 which gives the Commissioner discretion to grant relief from additional or incremental tax where it is equitable to do so. 327V OFFENCES 327V Subsection (1) Specific offences are committed under this Part of the Act by any person who: a)pays resident withholding income and fails to make a required deduction; or b)having made deductions of RWT applies that deduction for any purpose other than pay- ment to the Commissioner; or c)makes any false or misleading application for a Certificate of Exemption; or misleads, attempts to mislead or gives any false information to the Commissioner or any officer of IRD, or any other person in relation to any matter or thing affecting either RWT deductions, or Certificates of Exemption; or 32 d)alters any Certificate of Exemption; or falsely claims to be the person named in a Certificate; or possesses any imitation of a Certificate of Exemption; or causes or at- tempts to cause any person to make a smaller deduction of RWT or to refrain from making a deduction by the production of any docu- ment; or e)attempts to obtain all or any part of a RWT deduction made by any other person; or f)fails to inform the Commissioner that a Certificate of Exemption should be cancelled because the grounds for the issue of the exemption no longer apply; or having had a Certificate of Exemption can- celled, fails to notify all persons from whom resident withholding income is received that the Certificate has been cancelled; or g)fails to supply either an RWT deduction certificate or a shareholder dividend state- ment where appropriate. 327V Subsection (2) Failure to Account - time of offence To determine when an offence against subsection (1) (b) occurs an RWT deduction shall be deemed to be made at the time any payment of the net amount of resident withholding income is made, and the RWT deduction shall be deemed to have been applied for another purpose if the amount of the deduction is not paid to the Commissioner on the due date. There is a proviso that no person shall be convicted of an offence under subsections (1) (a) or (b) if the Court is satisfied that the RWT deduction has been accounted for and that the reason for non payment by due date was due to illness, accident or causes outside the person’s control. 327V Subsection (3) No offence where deduction not made & payer subsequently found to be “in business” Where failure to make a deduction results from a person concluding, on reasonable grounds, that the payment was not made in the course of conducting a taxable activity no person shall be convicted of an offence. 327W PENAL TAX FOR DEFAULT IN MAKING OR PAYING RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS 327W Subsection (1) Penal Tax payable Where a payer either:- (a)fails (whether in whole or in part) to deduct resident withholding tax; or (b)having made an RWT deduction knowingly fails to pay that amount to the Commissioner,- penal tax shall be chargeable in addition to any other penalty. Any penal tax charged shall not be more than treble the amount of the deficient deduction. 327W Subsection (2) Failure to Account - time of offence To determine when an offence against subsection (1) (b) occurs an RWT deduction shall be deemed to be made at the time any payment of the net amount of resident withholding income is made, and the RWT deduction shall be deemed to have been applied for another purpose if the amount of the deduction is not paid to the Commissioner on the due date. There is a proviso that no person shall be charge- able with an offence under subsection (1) (b) if the Commissioner is satisfied that the RWT deduction has been accounted for and that the reason for non- payment by due date was due to illness, accident or causes outside the person’s control. 327W Subsection (3) Nature of Penal Tax Penal tax imposed under this section is deemed to be of the same nature as the deficient deduction and recoverable accordingly. Penal tax paid will not give rise to a RWT credit. 327W Subsection (4) Application of other Parts Subject to this Part, other Parts of this Act apply to any penal tax imposed by this section as if - a)it were penal tax imposed under section 420; b)the person liable to pay were the taxpayer; and c)the deficient deduction were deficient tax payable for the same year of assessment as that in which the deficient deduction became due and payable to the Commissioner. 33 327X AGREEMENTS NOT TO MAKE RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS TO BE VOID Any agreement not to make any resident withhold- ing tax deduction required to be made by this Part of the Act shall be void. 327Y CONSEQUENCE OF INABILITY TO PROVIDE TAX FILE NUMBERS Relieves a person from an obligation to provide a tax file number where they are unable, despite making reasonable efforts, to obtain a tax file number from an other person. This applies in respect of - S327J -Disclosure of interest payments where no resident withholding tax deduction required; S327ZB -Disclosure of transactions in financial arrangements S327ZD -General disclosure of tax file numbers 327Z NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTED IN SUBSTITUTION FOR RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX 327Z Subsection (1) Where a person makes or receives a payment which is considered at the time to be non-resident withholding income but was in fact derived by a resident there will be no subse- quent obligation to pay any amount of resident withholding tax provided that reasonable inquiries were made at the time of payment. 327Z Subsection (2) For the purpose only of deter- mining the liability under the resident withholding tax rules of any person who has acted in accord- ance with subsection (1) the payment shall be deemed to be derived by a non-resident. This means that when a recipient has had non- resident withholding tax deducted incorrectly the obligation to recover the additional amount of withholding tax which would arise because of the difference in rates of deduction will not be placed on an innocent payer. 327ZA Amount of Resident Withholding Tax Deduction deemed to have been received Where an RWT deduction is made from any pay- ment of resident withholding income the amount deducted will be deemed to have been received by the person who received the payment. It shall also be deemed to have been derived by the recipient at the same time and in the same way as the payment from which it was deducted. 327ZB Disclosure of Transactions in Financial Arrangements This section is designed to ensure that where persons are trading in negotiable instruments on the secondary market certain details of their activi- ties are disclosed to the Commissioner. It can be contrasted with the situation where a non- exempt person acquires a financial arrangement direct from the issuer, receives any coupon interest payments during the life of the arrangement less RWT deductions, and disposes of the arrangement at maturity having RWT deducted from any re- demption payment gain which is again subject to RWT. In the situations which this section covers, financial arrangements which have been traded between exempt and non-exempt persons to prevent the deduction of RWT will be disclosed to the Commis- sioner to ensure that taxable income from these arrangements is being declared by the persons deriving such income. 327ZB Subsection (1) This section takes effect from 1 April 1990. Where any person who holds a Cer- tificate of Exemption (i.e. an exempt person) at any time during a year either: a)acquires a financial arrangement from a person who was not either the issuer of the financial arrangement (borrower of funds) or the holder of a Certificate of Exemption; or b)disposes of a financial arrangement to a non exempt person; and c)the financial arrangement is one in relation to which interest is payable and which would have been subject to a deduction of RWT but for the certificate of exemption, - that exempt person shall, in their return of income that year, provide information in rela- tion to each person, and each acquisition or disposition during that year as follows: d)the full name and last known address of the non-exempt person; e)the date of acquisition or disposition; f)the consideration paid or received (less any fees); 34 g)the tax file number of the non exempt person; h)such further information as the Commissioner may prescribe; Unless the Commissioner otherwise requires the information in (d), (e) (f) (g) and (h) may be provided in the form of summary totals of acquisitions and summary totals of dispositions. 327ZB Subsection (2) Tax file number to be supplied on request Every non-exempt person who either disposes of or acquires any financial arrangement to which sub- section (1) applies shall, if requested in writing, supply their tax file number to the exempt person within 10 working days. 327ZB Subsection (3) Exempt person required to provide information to Commissioner Any exempt person who is not required to furnish a return of income in any year in which any acquisi- tion or disposition to which subsection (1) applies shall provide the information detailed in that subsection in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe, within 2 months after the end of that year. 327ZC Application of Other Provisions to Amounts Payable under this Part Subject to this Part of this Act, the other Parts of this Act shall apply to every amount that any person is liable to account for or pay to the Com- missioner as if the amount were income tax. In particular, section 99(3) which provides for adjustments of income shall apply as if the term “assessable income” were replaced with “liability to resident withholding tax”. 327ZD General disclosure of Tax File Numbers From 1/4/92 payers of resident withholding income will be required to record the Tax file number (IRD Number) of all persons to whom they pay such income. 327ZD Subsection (1) Information to be supplied This section is to take effect from 1 April 1992. Any payer of resident withholding income who is required to make a deduction of RWT from that income shall provide the following information to the Commissioner in an approved form: a)Full name and last known address of the recipient b)The total resident withholding income paid in that year. c)The tax file number of the recipient. d)Such further information as the Commis- sioner may require. 327ZD Subsection (2) Recipient to provide TFN to payer Where a payer requests the tax file number from a recipient in writing the recipient shall provide that number within 10 working days of receiving the request. 327ZD Subsection (3) Commissioner’s Discretion The Commissioner may waive all or any of the requirements to furnish the above information. Section 12 (2) A new Nineteenth Schedule is added to the Princi- pal Act. This schedule details the rates of resident withholding tax deductions. Section 12 (3) The resident withholding tax regime commences on the 1st day of October 1989 and applies to any dividend or interest paid on or after that date. Section 13 Transitional provisions in relation to resident withholding tax This provision was an emergency provision to be used to allow the Commissioner to declare that under certain circumstances that a person, or a class of persons who have made applications for a Certificate of Exemption and have not received it may make a statutory declaration which will be deemed to be a Certificate of Exemption until 31 January 1990. This provision was in case there was a hold up in the issuing of Certificates at the commencement of the Resident Income Withholding Tax Regime. It was not to be available for use by individual appli- cants but was to be used only in circumstances where it became apparent that the issue of a large number of certificates had been held up. Qualified applicants A “qualified applicant” is a person or a class of persons who have made an application for a Certifi- cate of Exemption prior to 30 September a)The Commissioner may permit qualified applicants to make a written declaration in 35 such form as the Commissioner shall require confirming that: -an application has been made; -that the applicant is a person who quali- fies for a Certificate of Exemption under section 327M; and -a Certificate of Exemption has not been issued, nor denied to the applicant. b)The declaration is deemed to be a Certificate of Exemption only in respect of resident withholding income paid on or before 31 January 1990. c)Any person who holds a deemed Certificate of Exemption in accordance with these provisions must show a copy of the declara- tion to a payer of RWI in order to prevent deductions of RWT. Subsection (2) Deemed Certificates of Exemption cancelled from 1 February 1990 Regardless of any other provisions of this Part of the Act, any deemed Certificate of Exemption issued in accordance with this Section shall be deemed to be cancelled in respect of any resident withholding income paid on or after 1 February 1990. SECTION 14 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX ON NON-CASH DIVIDENDS Application Section 14 amends section 336N of the principal Act by inserting a new subsection (8) to extend the application of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) regime to non-cash dividends paid or made available on or after 1 October 1989 by a company that is resident in New Zealand to a non-corporate shareholder who does not hold a certificate of exemption. The term “non-cash dividends” is defined in sec- tion 2 of the principal Act (refer to commentary on section 2 of the Amendment Act). Essentially, non- cash dividends are dividends that arise under sections 4(1)(b) to (e) of the principal Act. To ensure that there is no double taxation section 61 of the principal Act has been amended by inserting a new subsection (12A) to provide that a non-cash dividend paid on or after 1 October 1989 will be exempt from income tax to the extent that FBT is payable on that dividend (refer to section 5 of the Amendment Act). The payment arrangements and reporting require- ments for FBT on non-cash dividends are the same as those provided for under section 336T of the principal Act in relation to the existing FBT regime, i.e., payments of FBT will be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly FBT returns. For the purposes of the FBT regime the new subsection (8) of section 336N deems: •a non-cash dividend to be a fringe benefit, •the person paying the non-cash dividend to be an employer, •the person (i.e. the shareholder) deriving the non-cash dividend to be an employee, •any low interest loan that, under section 4(1)(e), gives rise to a non-cash dividend to be an employment related loan (this will enable section 3360(2) to apply to compute the value of a benefit in relation to a low interest loan). Exclusions The proviso (paragraph (e)) to section 336N(8) excludes from the application of the FBT regime any non-cash dividend that is: •derived by a company as income exempt from income tax by virtue of section 63(2), •an amount remitted in relation to a loan owed by a shareholder company that gives rise to a dividend derived by that company under the new paragraph (ba) of section 4(1) of the principal Act and that is not exempt from tax under the new paragraph (e) of section 63(3) (refer to commentary on sec- tions 3 and 6 of the Amendment Act), •a payment of excessive salary or wages (or an allocation of an excessive share of profits) that is deemed to be a dividend under sec- tion 97 of the principal Act or a payment of excessive remuneration that is deemed to be a dividend under section 190, •a rebate or part of a rebate paid to a member of a mutual association that is deemed to be a dividend pursuant to the proviso to section 199(6), •derived by a person who holds a valid certificate of exemption issued pursuant to section 327M, •non-resident withholding income, 36 •derived by a person not resident in New Zealand and not derived from New Zealand, •exempt from income tax pursuant to section 61(50) which exempts from income tax income expressly exempt under any other Act. The proviso (paragraph (f)) to section 336N(8) also extends the application of the FBT regime by providing that: •sections 336N(5) and (6) do not apply - the effect is that the exemptions from the FBT regime for discounts customarily allowed in respect of goods sold to employees do not apply in relation to non-cash dividends, •the proviso to section 336S does not apply - the effect is that, in relation to FBT on non- cash dividends, the general $50 exemption provided in certain circumstances does not apply. Valuation of non-cash dividends deemed to be fringe benefits The rules set out in section 336O of the principal Act to determine the value of a fringe benefit apply to compute the value of a non-cash dividend by virtue of such dividends being deemed to be fringe benefits under section 336N(8) of the Act. It should be noted however that section 33 of the Amendment Act amends section 336O to provide that the value of an employment-related loan (including a loan on current account to a share- holder) may be reduced by amounts of provisional income paid to an employee (shareholder) to the extent that such amounts are applied in repayment of the loan (refer to commentary on section 33). SECTION 15 PAY PERIOD TAXPAYERS Section 356 is repealed and a new section 356 is substituted. This is because the introduction of resident withholding tax will create a new class of persons whose income is only from interest and/or dividends from which tax deductions have been made thus bringing that class of persons on an equal footing with salary and wage earners whose income is fully subject to PAYE tax deductions. 356 (1) Definition of Interest For the purposes of this section the term “inter- est” is interest as defined in section 327A. 356 (2) Which taxpayers will be pay-period taxpayers A taxpayer will be a pay period taxpayer if the only income derived in the income year com- prises: - (a)income from employment; or (b)income in the nature of interest or dividends; or (c)A combination of any of those classes of income and in relation to that taxpayer and that year (d)the total income derived - i)Did not exceed $9,500; or ii)Did not exceed $20,000 and did not include any income from employment; or iii)Did not exceed $20,000 and did not include more than $1,500 of income in the nature of interest; and (e)a tax deduction was made from all employ- ment income; and (f)a resident withholding tax deduction was made from all interest or dividends received; and (g)where the taxpayer is a national super- annuitant, the total income from employment and from interest and dividends did not exceed $6006. 356 (3) Which taxpayers will not be pay-period taxpayers A taxpayer will not be a pay period taxpayer in relation to any year where - (a)The taxpayer derived income during that year as a shearer or a shearing shed hand; or (b)The taxpayer was an absentee that year; (c)Either the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s spouse was entitled to receive any Family Support Tax Credit during that year; or (d)The Commissioner is of the opinion that: - The reduction in income from employment is due to the retirement, death, absence or other event which ended or suspended the taxpay- er's employment; and The taxpayer is not usually a pay period taxpayer, or it appeared during the year that the taxpayer would not be a pay-period taxpayer that year. 356 (4) Deemed tax deduction from dividends Where dividend income is received from which no resident withholding tax has been deducted through the application of the formula which 37 allows imputation credits and withholding payment credits to be taken into account when determining the amount of any required deduc- tion, (e.g.,. fully credited dividends), tax deduc- tions shall be deemed to have been made for the purposes of subsection (1). Subsection (2) Tax of pay-period taxpayers to be determined by amount of tax deductions or by assessment Section 357 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the words “or Part IXA” which means that the income tax of pay period taxpayers will be deemed to have been fully paid by the deduction of either PAYE or resident withholding tax, where the provisions of the Act have been properly applied. Subsection (3) Adjustment of Excessive Tax Deductions Section 358 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the words “or under Part IXA” in para- graphs (a) and (b). This section allows for the adjustment of excessive tax deductions. Subsection (4) Various enactments repealed Various previous amendments to the Act are repealed. Subsection (5) Section to take effect from income year commencing 1 April 1990 These changes in respect of income derived by a Pay-period Taxpayer do not take effect until the income year commencing 1 April 1990. SECTION 16 AMENDMENTS TO THE PROVISIONAL TAX REGIME. SUBSECTION (1)DEFINITIONS Provisional Income now means the assessable income derived by any person in the income year (before the deduction of losses under section 188 or any inter group deductions under S191) less the aggregate of - a)any source deductions payments; b)any non-resident withholding income; and c)in the case of individuals, any RWI which constitutes dividends from which RWT required to be deducted has been deducted. Provisional Taxpayer The definition of “provisional Tax” in Section 375 is amended to exclude a pay-period taxpayer. This is because any person who derives income in the form of interest and dividends which has been fully subject to deductions of resident withholding income tax, and whose income is below $20,000 will not have any residual income tax liability. Subsection (2) Residual Income Tax The definition of “RIT” is amended by including RWT credits within the list of tax credits to be deducted from the total amount of the income tax liability of a taxpayer to determine the RIT liability of that taxpayer. Subsection (3) Application Date This section applies to any provisional tax payable on or after the 1st day of April 1990 SECTION 17 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS IN RELATION TO PROVISIONAL TAX This provision for the calculation of 1991 Provi- sional Tax is necessary to allow for the fact that the residual income tax figure for 1990 will result AFTER the deduction of RWT deductions in respect of HALF A YEAR only, i.e. from 1 October 1989 to 31 March 1990. Subsection (1) Where calculating the provisional tax payable in respect of income derived during the year com- mencing 1 April 1990, by any person who has not held a Certificate of Exemption during any part of the previous income year, the amount will be the greater of: (a)Nil; and (b)The actual 1990 residual income tax less an amount equal to: (a x b) + ((c x d) - e)) where ais the amount of interest (which is by definition Resident withholding income pursuant to S 327B (2) and which equiva- lent income will therefore have Tax deductions made therefrom in the 1991 income year) derived between 1 April 1989 and 30 September 1989 bis the rate of withholding tax on interest 38 cis the amount of dividends (which are resident withholding income pursuant to S 327B (2) ) derived between 1 April 1989 and 30 September 1989 dis the rate of withholding tax on divi- dends eis the aggregate of (i)any dividend withholding payments attached to the dividends included in item c; and (ii)any imputation credits attached to any of the dividends included in item c. Note:There are provisions relating to 1990 Provisional Tax in the Taxation Reform Bill (No 6) SECTION 18 SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND STATEMENT Section 18 repeals section 394I of the principal Act and substitutes a new section 394I. Under the new section 394I the requirement that a shareholder dividend statement is to be sent to a shareholder when a dividend is paid with an imputation credit attached is extended to apply also when a dividend is paid with a dividend withholding payment credit attached. This is because the resident withholding tax that is deducted from dividends with insuffi- cient or no imputation credits attached is passed through to shareholders as a dividend withholding payment credit. The section sets out the informa- tion required to be shown on the statement. The amendment applies in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 October 1989. SECTION 19 STATEMENT TO SHAREHOLDER WHEN DIVIDEND PAID Section 394ZZB of the principal Act provides that a company attaching a dividend withholding pay- ment credit to a dividend is required to include in a shareholder dividend statement, to be given to the shareholder, the information specified in the sec- tion. Section 19 repeals section 394ZZB and substitutes a new section 394ZZB to require a company that attaches a dividend withholding payment credit, including a deemed dividend withholding payment credit arising through the resident withholding tax regime, to include certain additional information in the shareholder dividend statement required to be issued by section 394I. As the requirements of subsection (2) of the re- pealed section 394ZZB have been incorporated into the amended section 394I, subsection (2) is no longer necessary and has been repealed (refer to section 18 of the Amendment Act and above com- mentary thereon). The amendment applies in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 October 1989. SECTION 20 POWER OF COMMISSIONER IN RESPECT OF SMALL AMOUNTS The amounts of tax about which the Commissioner may exercise discretion as to whether to collect or refund have both been increased from $2 to $5. SECTION 21 INTEREST ON TAX OVERPAID For the purpose of determining the amount of interest payable by the Commissioner on an over- payment of provisional tax (refer Section 413A (1)) the definition of the term RIT has been amended (effective from 1 October 1989) to be net of RWT credits. SECTION 22 PENALTIES FOR OFFENCES Persons who are convicted of the offences of “fail- ing to account” to the Commissioner for amounts which have been deducted in the form of either resident withholding tax or non resident withhold- ing tax are to be subject to the same penalty provi- sions as failure to account for PAYE deductions i.e. either a term of imprisonment or a substantial fine. SECTION 23 PUBLICATION OF NAMES OF TAX EVADERS The names of persons who have been convicted of the offences of “failing to deduct” or “failing to account for” resident withholding tax or non- resident withholding tax deductions may be pub- lished by the Commissioner in the Gazette. 39 SECTION 24 RETURNS OF INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS Section 429 is repealed. This section previously gave the Commissioner power to request informa- tion from banks, Local or Public Authorities, or other persons about interest paid. The new report- ing provisions included in the resident withholding tax legislation now give similar powers. This section comes into force on 1 October 1989 SECTION 25 RECORDS AND RETURNS OF CHARITIES Subsection (1) The definition of “specified body” has been extended for the record keeping provi- sions in this section to include any person who is issued with a Certificate of Exemption in accord- ance with section 327M (1) (h) or (i) of the resident withholding tax legislation. This is to ensure that all the records required to be kept for resident withholding tax purposes will be kept, and that no tax exempt person can avoid their obligations because they are not included within the existing list of specified bodies. Subsection (2) The section will apply from 1 Octo- ber 1989. Note:Tax exempt entities and non-profit bodies issued with a COE under Section 327M will be required to keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to ascertain the source and application of donations made to them. SECTION 26 CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENT TO ESTATE AND GIFT DUTIES ACT 1968 As a consequence of the amendment to section 4(1) of the principal Act to insert a new paragraph (ba) dealing with forgiveness of debt to a shareholder an amendment has been made to section 75B of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1967 by inserting a new subsection (2). This corrects a previous deficiency and ensures that gift duty is not payable where a debt forgiven gives rise to a dividend. The new subsection (2) provides that any transac- tion that is a dividend within the meaning of paragraph (ba) of section 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976, i.e., forgiveness of a loan, does not constitute a gift for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act. PART II MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SECTION 27 Interpretation Section 27 substitutes a new definition of the term “trustee” in section 2 of the principal Act. The new definition does not differ in substance from the earlier one, but simply re-orders it in a more appro- priate form. SECTION 28 Exclusions from the term “Divi- dends” This section ensures that the distribution of certain reserves, created by the concessional tax free revaluation of livestock and wine and whisky stocks, are not treated as dividends on winding up. Specifically excluded from the term “dividends” are tax free gains resulting from: (a)The transitional write-off of livestock re- valuation given by section 86E; and (b)The ongoing valuation of livestock under the provisions of the herd scheme (section 86A); and (c)The transitional 50 percent write-off of wine and whisky revaluation that can be opted for under section 87A. The exclusion does not apply to such reserves if capitalised by way of bonus issue. This amendment is retrospective in that it takes effect from the commencement of the 1988/89 income year. Any farmers wishing to take advantage of this amendment and the Winding Up Distribution Tax will have to make distributions in the course of winding up before 30 September 1989. SECTION 29 Life insurance and reinsurance agents Section 29 amends section 204 of the principal Act which relates to the taxation of life insurance and reinsurance companies in respect of their superan- nuation and annuity business. The amendment widens the application of subsection (9A) to compa- nies with a non-standard annual balance date, as well as to companies with a 31 March balance date (except to the extent that subsection (9B) caters for any non-standard year that contains 1 April 1988). 40 SECTION 30 Interpretation provision relating to trusts Section 30 amends a drafting error, making it clear that the amendment to section 226(1) of the Act that was contained in section 14(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 relates to definition of the term “beneficiary income”. SECTION 31 Valuation of loans provided by superannuation fund deemed to be income of fund Section 31 amends section 232A of the principal Act, which provides that the value of certain loans made by a superannuation scheme to its members may be deemed to be income of the scheme. The amendment limits this provision to schemes that are superannuation funds. Where appropriate, loans to members by schemes that are not superan- nuation funds will be governed by other provisions of the Act, including the new extended definition of a dividend in section 4 of the Act. SECTION 32 Surcharge paid as provisional tax Section 32 makes various consequential amend- ments to the superannuitant surcharge as a result of the introduction of the new provisional tax regime. Subsection (1) repeals section 336I of the principal Act as this section is now directly incorporated in the new provisional tax regime. Subsection (2) amends section 336F (2) (a) (i) of the principal Act to provide that superannuitants subject to the surcharge who consider that all their other income will be provisional income pay provisional tax according to the new provisional tax rules. Subsections (3) and (4) repeal sections 336(k)(2) and (3) of the principal Act. These amendments provide that taxpayers, subject to the superannuitant sur- charge, pay provisional tax under the provisional tax legislation rather than the national super- annuitant surcharge legislation. Subsection (5) provides for various consequential repeals as a result of the above amendments. Subsection (6) provides that these amendments apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1989. SECT ION 33 Value of fringe benefit Section 33 amends section 336O of the principal Act by inserting three new subsections - subsections (2A) (2B) and (2C) - relating to the value of a fringe benefit that consists of an employment related loan. The amendments are made in the context of the extension of the application of the fringe benefit tax regime to shareholder-employees of private compa- nies as provided in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988 with effect from 1 April 1989. As an employment related loan includes an over- drawn current account of a shareholder-employee the amendments are considered necessary in recognition of the practical difficulties faced by companies and to minimise compliance costs in maintaining current accounts on a daily basis in order to comply with the FBT regime. The main effect of the amendment to section 336O is to do away with the need for companies to maintain a daily record of shareholder-employees’ current accounts on an ongoing basis. The amendment to section 336O (new subsection (2A)) ensures that where the amount of salary or wages or extra emolument or dividends or interest paid to an employee (including a shareholder employee) is determined after the end of an income year the amount of the income is deemed to have been credited to the current account of the em- ployee on the later of either: •the first day of that income year, or •the day on which the balance of the current account first went into debit during that income year provided that the amount of salary or wages or other income •constitutes income of the employee derived in that income year or in any previous in- come year, and •does not constitute resident withholding income, non-resident withholding income, or income subject to source deductions under Part XI of the principal Act. Therefore, where the amount of the income credited to the current account after the end of the income year exceeds the amount of any debit balance in that account during that year there will be no FBT liability. For an example of the application of this provision refer to appendix E to TIB No. 3. The new subsection (2B) serves two purposes. Firstly, for the purposes of the references to an income year in the new subsection (2A), it provides the standard accounting year provision for employ- ers with non-31 March balance dates that furnish returns for an accounting year. Secondly, it pro- vides for the reference in subsection (2C) to an 41 income year of an employee to be the same income year as that of the employer. The new subsection (2C) outlines the circumstances in which income paid to an employee after the end of an income year and, under subsection (2A), deemed to have been applied in repayment, during that income year, of an employment related loan may be treated as having been derived in that income year for the purposes of applying subsec- tion (2A). The purpose of this provision is to cover the situation where the employee would normally return the income as income for the income year in which the amount of the income was determined rather than for the preceding income year in respect of which the income has been deemed to have been applied in repayment of the loan. The employee is required to notify the Commis- sioner in writing of the employee’s election to include the income in the tax return for the income year in which the income is deemed, under subsec- tion (2A), to have been applied in repayment of the employee related loan. The notification is required by the date the employee is required to furnish the income tax return allowing for any extension of time that may be granted. SECTION 34 Failure to deduct specified superan- nuation contribution withholding tax Section 34 corrects an error in the formula con- tained in section 336ZF of the principal Act to cater for the situation where an employer fails to deduct the appropriate amount of specified superannua- tion contribution withholding tax. At present the formula does not deal appropriately with the situation where an employer has satisfied part, but not all of the obligation. This amendment will correct that error. SECTION 35 Tax deemed for certain purposes to have been received by superannuation fund Section 35 clarifies the obligations of an employer with respect to contributions to a superannuation scheme. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 when it was passed, did not make clear the ques- tion of an employer’s obligations to a superannua- tion scheme. This section introduces a new section, section 336ZL, to the Act that for the purpose of determin- ing whether an employer has satisfied its obliga- tions to make contributions to a superannuation fund, deems the amount of any specified superan- nuation contribution withholding tax payable by the employer, to have been received by the fund. This is deemed to be received at the same time as the specified superannuation contribution actually received by the fund. This section is deemed to come into force on March 221989, the date of assent to the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 There is also a provision to ensure that, where there has been an overpayment in respect of an employ- er's obligations to the fund because of previous legislative silence on this issue, there is scope for a refund, or credit against future obligations for that employer - subject to it making a written applica- tion (to the fund) before 1 November 1989. SECTION 36 Determination of assessable income Section 36 amends Family Support to provide for a consistent treatment of the amount of depreciation recovered, by section 117 of the principal Act, on the sale of a building. The result of the amendments is that depreciation on a building is not deductible for Family Support purposes but any depreciation recovered is also non-assessable for Family Support purposes. Subsection (1) amends section 374B (1) (d) (i) of the principal Act. This paragraph provides that section 117 depreciation recovered may not be spread forward over future income years but is assessable, for Family Support purposes, in the year the in- come is actually derived. The amendment overrides this provision and allows the spread forward for depreciation recovered on the sale of a building. This income is then made non-assessable for Family Support purposes by section 374B (1) (e) (ii) of the principal Act. Subsection (2) amends section 374B (1) (e) of the principal Act by adding a new paragraph (v) providing that assessable income, for Family Support purposes, does not include any deprecia- tion recovered under section 117 of the principal Act where the depreciation recovered is assessable income, in the income year the building is sold. Subsection (3) provides that the above amendments apply to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1988 and every subsequent year. SECTION 37 Debits arising to imputation credit account Section 37 amends section 394E of the principal Act to ensure that a refund of excess export tax credits 42 or tourist promotion tax credits made under section 156F(4) of the Act is to be debited to the imputation credit account (ICA) of the company receiving the refund. The amendment rectifies the amendment made to section 394E(1)(b) by section 62(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989. That amendment did not have the effect of ensuring that section 156F(4) refunds are debits to the ICA as it is considered that such refunds are not refunds of income tax as specified in subsection (1)(b) of section-394E. SECTION 38 Imputation return to be furnished in certain circumstances Section 38 amends section 394K of the principal Act by inserting a new subsection (2A). This allows an imputation credit account company to furnish, in addition to the annual imputation return, an impu- tation return at any time during the imputation year. Such an imputation return will cover the period commencing with the first day of an imputa- tion year and ending on a day that is no earlier than 7 days before the date on which the imputation return is furnished to the Commissioner. This amendment is made in conjunction with the amendment to section 394M (refer to section 40 of the Amendment Act) which has the effect of relax- ing the restrictions on refunds of income tax where a company has insufficient credits in its ICA. SECTION 39 Further tax payable where end of year debit balance or where company ceases to be an imputation credit account company As a refund of tax credit made pursuant to section 156F(4) gives rise to a debit to the ICA of a com- pany, a company in loss that has not paid income tax during an imputation year will have a debit balance in its ICA at the end of the imputation year. In the absence of any amendment, the debit balance would give rise to a liability for further income tax equal to the amount of the debit balance as well as a liability for imputation penalty tax. In such a case the payment of further income tax would effec- tively be a clawback of the tax credit refunded. Section 39 amends section 394L of the principal Act to provide that where a company has a debit balance in its ICA at the end of an imputation year it will not be required to pay an amount of further income tax to the extent that the amount of the debit balance includes any refund of tax credit made pursuant to section 156F(4). The effect is that there will be no clawback of such a refund. SECTION 40 Limits on refunds of income tax Section 40 amends section 394M of the principal Act to allow the Commissioner to issue a refund of income tax to the extent of the amount of the credit balance in the ICA at the end of the period covered by the most recently furnished imputation return. Prior to this amendment section 394M applied to restrict refunds for overpayment of income tax to the amount of the credit balance in a company’s ICA at the preceding 31 March (end of the most recently ending imputation year). This would have created problems for, in particular, a post-31 March balance date company that would have been pre- vented from obtaining a refund for any overpay- ment of provisional tax to the extent that the over- payment occurred after 31 March, even where the tax had not been allocated as imputation credits to the company’s shareholders. By virtue of the amendment to section 394K (refer to section 38 of the Amendment Act) a company will now be able to voluntarily furnish an addi- tional imputation return at any time during the imputation year. This will enable the company to satisfy the Commissioner that the amount of any refund due does not exceed the amount of the credit balance in its ICA. Of course the refund of income tax will give rise to a debit to the ICA of the company. SECTION 41 Refund out of consolidated Account Section 394ZR is amended by inserting the word “credit” after the words “dividend withholding payment”. This corrects a drafting error in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. SECTION 42 Interest and additional tax not to be charged in respect of certain superannuation scheme and insurance company income for the year ended 31 March 1989 Section 42 is a transitional provision correcting an anomaly to the taxation of category 1 schemes, and life insurance companies to whom section 204 of the principal Act applies, which have not previously paid income tax. Section 31 (1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 removed the obligation of trustees and life companies to pay provisional tax on the income of Category 1 schemes for the 1988 and 1989 income year. 43 However Section 398A of the principal Act imposes an additional interest charge at a rate of 10% if provisional payments fall short of the residual income tax liability. Superannuation Category 1 and life companies in respect of any specified superannuation or annuity income will, as directed by statute, have paid no provisional tax by the third provisional tax instal- ment date. They are, therefore, exposed to the penalty under section 398A(4) of the Act which imposes an addi- tional interest rate of 10% if provisional tax pay- ments fall short of the residual income tax liability. Superannuation schemes and life companies with early and standard balance dates will be granted remission of this additional tax impost under section 384(3). However, this has adversely affected superannuation schemes and life companies with late balance dates whose third provisional tax payment date falls after April 1. This section ensures that interest is not charged for income years ending 31 March 1989 to 30 Septem- ber 1989. SECTION 43 Payment of tax Section 395 is amended by inserting a new subsec- tion (2). This sets a due date for payment of terminal tax for taxpayers who are neither employees nor provi- sional taxpayers. Previously all taxpayers were either provisional taxpayers or employees. With the introduction of the RWT regime there will be a new class of persons who are not employees, and where they derive either -income by way of interest of less than $3000; or -income only from dividends which have been subject to the RWT regime are not provisional taxpayers. SECTION 44 Date for payment of penal tax A new section 422A is inserted which provides that penal tax shall be paid not later than the 28th day after the date of issue of the assessment. This is to clarify the due date for payment of penal tax. SECTION 45 First Schedule amended in relation to trustees of superannuation category 3 schemes The rate of tax for superannuation category 3 schemes will be 33 cents in the dollar for the income year commencing on 1 April 1989 and subsequent years. The current rate is 40.5 cents.

The Department has not changed its policy on such bad debts. 2.2For a bad debt to be an allowable deduction it must be actually written off the books as such. Mere provision for bad debts is not deductible under section 106(1)(b). It is not necessary to exhaust all available legal remedies before deciding a debt is bad in whole or in part, but there must be no reasonable or probable expectation of recovery before a creditor is justified in regarding a debt or part thereof as bad. The debt must be genuinely irrecoverable at the point when the decision is made Bad debt which is of a capital nature is not deduct- ible under section 106(1)(a). 3.0Bad Debts Within the Accruals Regime 3.1The accrual tax accounting regime applies to financial arrangements. Thus - (a)Debt that arose before the relevant implementation date; and (b)Debt that is an excepted financial ar- rangement is not affected by the accrual tax accounting regime. 3.2While debts generally are financial arrange- ments, short term trade credits are excepted financial arrangements. A short term trade credit is any debt for goods or services where payment is required by the vendor within 63 days after the supply of the goods or services (refer section 64B(1) “excepted financial arrangement”, “financial arrangement”, “short term trade credit” and “trade credit”). 4.0Relevant Legislation 4.1Section 64L(1) provides that where an amount of income or expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement is to be taken into account in calculating a persons’ assessable income, the amount (i.e. quantum) is to be calculated according to sections 64B to 64M. 4.2A loss in the nature of a bad debt is not ex- penditure; it is a loss. Expenditure may have been incurred in creating the financial arrange- ment that is a bad debt, but in dealing with the loss we are not concerned with that expendi- ture directly. Thus, except to the extent that a provision in sections 64B to 64M relates to bad debt in its terms, the accrual tax accounting regime does not affect the income tax treat- ment of bad debts. 4.3Excluding the concessionary provisions at sections 64F(7), (7A), (7B), 64FA and 64FB, and dealt with in T.P.C's 88/2 Part 6 paragraphs 36 - 40 and 49 - 61, and 88/2 Part 7 Sections 3 & 4, the Income Tax Act 1976 provides for bad debts suffered by providers of credit at - (a)Paragraph “a”(i) of the base price adjustment (bpa) in section 64F(2) in relation to the payments receivable whether received or not, including amounts remitted (this provision deter- mines the amount taken into account in calculating the quantum of income or expenditure under sections 64B to 64M in the income year in which the financial arrangement matures or is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred); and (b)Section 64F(6) in relation to loss on sale (this provision determines the amount taken into account in calculating the quantum of income or expenditure under sections 64B, to 64M); and (c)Section 64G(1) in relation to accrued income that is not recoverable (this provision explicitly authorises a deduc- tion); and (d)Section 64G(2) in relation to principal where accrued income has been derived and is not recoverable (this provision explicitly authorises a deduction); and (e)Section 64G(3) which allows a deduction for a loss made good by a “security payment” (this provision explicitly authorises a deduction); and (f)Section 77(2) in relation to capitalised mortgage interest (this provision explic- itly authorises a deduction); and (g)Section 78 in relation to any expenditure or loss that has been taken into account in calculating assessable income and is later remitted or cancelled (this provi- sion explicitly includes such amounts within assessable income); and (h)Section 106(1)(a) in relation to losses of capital (which explicitly forbids a deduction for a loss of capital, subject to the proviso that this does not affect amounts deemed to be expenditure under sections 64B to 64M); and (i)Section 106(1)(b) (which explicitly disallows a deduction for bad debts, except bad debts which are proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off); and (j)Section 188(4) (which requires an adjust- ment to losses carried forward where an amount is received in respect of a bad debt taken into account in calculating a loss); and (k)Section 233 (which explicitly authorises a deduction, but is limited in its applica- tion to certain circumstances involving the estates of deceased taxpayers). 4.4In business the relevant provisions in the accrual tax accounting regime are likely to be (a) Section 64F(2)“a”(i); and (b) Section 64F(6); and (c) Section 64G(I); and (d) Section 64G(2); and (e) Section 64G(3); and (f) Section 106(1)(a); and (g) Section 106(1)(b). 5.Examples of the Combined Application of These Provisions 5.1 THIS IS A SUMMARY ONLY, REFERENCE TO DETAILED EXPLANATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THE APPLICATION IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE (a)Debt Forgiven In the ordinary course of their business A advances money to B.

A bad debt is a loss, not expendi- ture, and therefore cannot satisfy this proviso. 6.3The other specific provisions relevant to the subject matter of this TIB item are discussed below. Some of these have the effect of turning the amount of a bad debt into expenditure, in which case the proviso to section 106(1)(a) is satisfied. 7.Recognition of Bad Debts on an Accruals Basis 7.1Where a determination applies to a financial arrangement, the financial arrangement is to be accounted for on the basis of the determina- tion. Unless provided for in the determination, recognition of bad debts is a separate issue. 7.2Where the tax accounting treatment of a financial arrangement is dependent upon commercially acceptable practice (e.g. Deter- mination G12, section 64C(3)(b), and section 64C(4)) and commercially acceptable practice is to recognise bad debts on an accruals basis, bad debts are to be recognised for tax pur- poses on the same basis subject to any require- ment or prohibition elsewhere in the Act. 8.Writing Off Bad Debts and Remission of Debt 8.1Remission of a financial arrangement is not the same as remission of any particular amount owing under a financial arrangement. Section 64F(1)(c) sets out the circumstances in which a debt is deemed to be remitted. It has the particular purpose of defining one of the sets of circumstances in which the base price adjustment (section 64F(2)) or cash base price adjustment (section 64F(3)) is to be performed. However this definition does not apply to the remission of any amount owing or to be paid, whether under a financial arrangement or otherwise. 8.2When a creditor takes a deduction for a debt written off as bad, it is the Commissioner’s expectation that the taxpayer will have (a)Made some enquiry regarding the likelihood of collecting the debt; and (b)Ascertained that the debt will not be collected; and (c)Removed the debt from the taxpayer’s debtors ledger and from any calculation of total assets for financial reporting or income tax purposes during the income year in which the deduction is taken and that the amount written off is - (d)Working capital of the taxpayer; or (e)Income derived in the current income year or a prior year. 8.3However the taxpayer may well keep a record of the amount owing for other purposes (e.g. credit control, litigation). Having written off the debt, the taxpayer does not necessarily give up all hope of collection, and the taxpayer may pursue the debt for reasons that have more to do with a particular credit control policy than with realistic expectations of collection. In particular, the taxpayer will not necessarily forgive (i.e. remit, see section 64F(1)(c)(i)) a debt that is perceived to be uncollectable. 8.4This is explicitly recognised in section 64F(2) in the words “... where ... a financial arrange- ment ... is remitted (otherwise than by way of being written off as a bad debt)...”. These words have no purpose other than to empha- sise the difference between (a)Writing a debt off as a bad debt (which does not trigger the base price adjust- ment or cash base price adjustment); and (b)Remitting a debt (which does trigger the base price adjustment or cash base price adjustment). 9.0Time for the Calculation of Base Price Adjustment for Bad Debts 9.1The base price adjustment is intended to apply at the end of the taxpayer’s involvement with the financial arrangement. “Once a taxpayer ceases to hold an instru- ment, or ceases to be liable under it, the base price adjustment is calculated.” Information Release from the Office of the Minister of Finance - Income Tax Amendment Bill (No.2) 1986, page 11, issued at the time the Bill was introduced into the House of Repre- sentatives and reproduced in the Report of the Consultative Committee on the Accrual Tax treatment of Income and Expenditure, April 1987 Section 64F(2) requires that the base price adjustment be performed in me income year in which a financial arrangement - (a)Matures, or (b)Is remitted or, (c)Sold, or (d)Otherwise transferred. 10.Maturity 10.1Section 64F(l)(e) provides that a financial arrangement matures when the last payment contingent upon the financial arrangement is made, subject to the proviso that if (a)The financial arrangement has not matured; and (b)The amount yet to be paid is immaterial; and (c)The financial arrangement “has been structured to avoid the application of” section 64F - the financial arrangement is deemed to have matured. 10.2Presuming that the proviso does not affect the case, a financial arrangement matures when the last payment under the financial arrange- ment is made. In this context “payment” must be presumed to mean the delivery of any valuable consideration. Otherwise it would be necessary to calculate the base price adjust- ment for an agreement for the sale and pur- chase of property before the quantum of the “acquisition price” is known where payment is made before the delivery of rights in the property (refer section 64BA(l)(c) and (d), “core acquisition price” for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property that has lapsed or does not proceed). 11.Remission 11.1Section 64F(l)(c) sets out the circumstances in which a financial arrangement is deemed to be remitted. This is another set of circumstances on which the base price adjustment is to be calculated. These are (i)Where the debtor has been discharged from making all remaining payments under the debt without fully adequate consideration; (ii)Where the debtor has been released from the debt due to operation of the insolvency legislation or by any deed of composition with creditors; or (iii)The debt is irrecoverable through the lapse of time (i.e. “statute barred”, more than 6 years since the debtor last re- ceived notice of the liability). 11.2In addition a debt is actually remitted when it is remitted within the ordinary meaning of the word. It is anticipated that this is within the meaning of section 64F(1)(c)(i). 12.Sale 12.1In this context “sold” has its ordinary meaning. 13.“Otherwise Transferred” 13.1At law “transfer” is normally used in relation to transfer of property - a right or a collection of rights. However a person’s interests in a financial arrangement may comprise, wholly or in part, obligations (e.g. a debtor who, at the time appointed for repayment, has only an obligation to repay). In this context “trans- ferred” is to be given the widest possible meaning so that the base price adjustment achieves its purpose - a “wash up” to ensure that all cashflows have been taken into account in calculating the total income or expenditure over the life of a financial arrangement. 13.2There may be circumstances where rights held by a person become held by another person without any transfer at law. It has been sug- gested that this is the case where: (a)The executors or administrators of an estate take up control over that estate; or (b)Trust assets vest in a beneficiary. The IRD has commenced a project to deal with these questions, among others, in relation to trusts and estates 13.3It may appear to be necessary for a person to calculate the base price adjustment more than once in relation to the same financial arrange- ment in certain cases. For example where: (a) In the year ending 31 March 1988 Holder advances funds to Issuer and Issuer makes no payments to Holder; and (b)In the year ending 31 March 1989 Issuer makes no payments to Holder and Holder writes the debt off as a bad debt; and (c)In the year ending 31 March 1990, and for no consideration, Holder completely forgives the debt owed by Issuer it may appear to be necessary for Holder and Issuer to calculate the base price adjustment (d)In the year ending 31 March 1988, during which the last payment contin- gent on the financial arrangement is made (in this case the advance itself is the last payment made that is contingent on the financial arrangement); and (e)In the year ending 31 March 1990, when the debt is remitted. 13.4In such cases the conflict is to be resolved by reference to the principle set out at paragraph 9.1. Thus the conflict in the case set out in paragraph 13.3 is resolved as follows: (a)Although the financial arrangement matures in the year ended 31 March 1988 Holder still holds, and Issuer still has liabilities under, the financial ar- rangement, so the base price adjustment is to be performed in the later income year; and (b)When the financial arrangement is remitted in the year ended 31 March 1989 Holder ceases to hold, and Issuer ceases to have any liability under, the financial arrangement, so the base price adjustment is required to be performed. 13.5This analysis is required only where a conflict arises as to which income year the base price adjustment is to be calculated in. In particular (a)It does not apply where it is clear that there is no prospect of recovery; (b)It does not apply to non-recourse loans where there is no liability to repay; and (c)It does not apply to limited recourse loans where it is clear that avenues for recourse are exhausted in practical terms. 14.The Base Price Adjustment and Bad Debts 14.1On remission of a debt the holder does not take into account the amount that was receiv- able, but is required to include in “a” any amounts that have been remitted by the holder For example: Holder has 31 March balance date Holder advances$1,000 on I June 19x8 Issuer- required to pay$1,120 on 31 Dec 19x8 - paysnil Holder after recovery action remits$1,120 on 31 March 19x9 Holder’s Base Price Adjustment on 31 March 19x9 a - (b + c) $1,120 - ($1,000 = 0) = (+ve) $120 income to holder 14.2A deduction - (a)Will be allowed elsewhere for the loss to the extent that it represents the $120 income assessable under the base price adjustment: (b)May be allowed elsewhere for the loss to the extent that it represents a loss of principal i.e. the $1000. 14.3In calculating the base price adjustment on remission of the debt the issuer does not take into account the amount that was payable but was not paid. For example, using the facts in paragraph 14.1. Issuer's Base Price Adjustment a - (b + c) 0 - ($1,000 + 0) = (-ve) $1,000 income to holder 15.Sale at a Discount Due to Debt being Bad 15.1Where a debt is sold for a consideration lower than it would otherwise be sold for because of (a)A decline in the creditworthiness of the debtor; or (b)An increase in the likelihood that the debtor will not be able to repay the debt; or (c)Some reduction or cancellation of the debt (without equivalent consideration) the base price adjustment is to be calculated as if the debt were sold at a price that did not reflect any of those matters (see section 64F(6)). The only exception to this rule is where: (a)The holder is in the business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements of the same class (see also paragraphs 17.1 and 17.2); and (b)The holder and the issuer are not associ- ated persons. In such cases this adjustment is not required (see the proviso to section 64F(Q). 15.2For example, on 1 April 1989 Holder advances to Issuer $1m (the exception in paragraph 31 does not apply). Issuer is to pay $0.2m on 31 March 1990 $1.2m on 31 March 1991. In the event Issuer pays nothing and Holder sells the debt ex interest on 31 March 1990 (i.e. without entitlement to interest due 31 March 1990) for $0.9m, the price being influenced by the debtor’s perceived inability to pay and an increase in market interest rates. 15.3Holder is required to calculate the base price adjustment as if there had been no change in Issuer’s creditworthiness or likely ability to pay. The price that would have been received in such circumstances must be ascertained. This will involve some conditional valuation of the debt. 15.4For fixed interest debt, valuation by discount- ing using a rate based on (a)Government stock rates at the time of sale; and (b)A margin based on the difference between (i)The yield to maturity of the debt when issued; and (ii)Government stock rates at the time at which the terms for issue were determined - will be acceptable to the Commissioner. 15.5For variable rate debt issued at or about face value, face value will be acceptable. It will also be acceptable to adjust for any movement in base rates since the last interest rate review, so long as the adjustment recognises that interest rates can be adjusted back to market rates at the next review. 15.6If in this case the conditional valuation of the debt is $970,000, the base price adjustment for the holder is calculated as follows a - (b + c) (i.e.0.20m coupon + ($1m original advance) 0.97m conditional valuation) $1.17m - ($1m + 0) = (+ve) $0.17m, income to Holder. 15.7A deduction - (a)Will be allowed elsewhere for the loss to the extent that it represents the $0.17m income assessable under the base price adjustment: (b)May be allowed elsewhere for the loss to the extent that it represents a loss of principal. 16.The Cash Base Price Adjustment 16.1The base price adjustment does not apply where the taxpayer is a cash basis holder in relation to the financial arrangement when it matures or is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred. In such cases the cash base price adjustment (section 64F(3)) is to be calculated. 16.2In calculating the cash base price adjustment the holder is not required to take into account amounts not received unless the amount not received was remitted by the holder, e.g., Cash Basis Holder advances$1,000 Issuer- required to pay$1,120 - paysnil The debt is not remitted and there is no pros- pect of payment. Holder's Cash Base Price Adjustment a-(b+c) 0-($1,00+0) = (-ve) $1,000, an allowable deduction to Holder (section 64F(5)(h) refers). 16.3In other respects the law regarding the treat- ment of bad debts applies to cash basis holders essentially as it does to persons who are not cash basis holders. 16.4It should be noted that a cash basis holder will not generally have “income” bad debts (as opposed to “principal” bad debts), as the cash basis holder will not recognise income unless it is derived in terms of section 75(1). Such amounts are capital once derived. 17.The Business of Holding or Dealing in Financial Arrangements of the Same Type 17.1A person is in the business of holding financial arrangements of a particular class if - (a)The person buys such financial arrange- ments for investment purposes in the course of business (e.g. buying govern- ment stock for the purposes of a sinking fund established as a part of the per- son’s business activities); or (b)The person creates such financial ar- rangements (or such a financial arrange- ment) for the purposes of or in the course of business (e.g., trade debtors of a person in trade or business, advances made by a bank or moneylender). 17.2A person is in the business of dealing in financial arrangements of a particular class if (a)The person buys (or creates) and sells such financial arrangements; and (b)The person’s activities in buying and selling such financial arrangements constitute a business. 17.3The question of whether or not activities constitute a business is dealt with in terms of the normal tests for income tax purposes (Grieve v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,682; TPC 84/24) 17.4The question of what constitutes a “class” of financial arrangements is determined by considering - (a)Commonality of characteristics (some precision is required here in order to give effect to the restrictions intended in section 64C (6)(a) and (c), 64D(2), 64F(6) etc, see Sovereign Life Assurance Co v Dodd \[1892\] 2 QB 573,583); and (b)Comparative quality, particularly in terms of the creditworthiness of the issuer (other things being equal, are the financial arrangements substitutable one for another in the operations of the taxpayer). The same considerations are to be borne in mind when considering the meaning of “such financial arrangements” in any particular case (e.g., sections 64C(2)(b), 64C(3)(a)(ii), 64C (4)(b) and (c)(i), 64G(2), 64I(1)(c), and 64J(3)). 18.“Income” or “Coupon” Bad Debts - Section 64G(1) 18.1Section 64G(1) applies m respect of bad debts suffered for income derived under (a)Section 64C, the provision that - (i)Requires use of the accruals provi- sions in respect of financial arrange- ments in the general case; and (ii)Provides for a non-accrual basis in certain cases (refer section 64C(5)); or (b)Section 64D(3), the accruals basis adjust- ment on ceasing to be a cash basis holder in respect of a financial arrange- ment; or (c)Section 64F(4), the base price adjust- ment; or (d)Section 64I, the post facto adjustment (Note that this relief is not available in respect of the cash base price adjustment as it is not necessary. The cash base price adjustment only takes into account “consideration derived” and amounts remitted.) 18.2Where such a bad debt is suffered and - (a)The income has been derived; and (b)The income is attributable to the amount in respect of which a deduction for a bad debt is claimed; and (c)The amount is written off in the year in which the deduction is claimed - a deduction is allowable to the extent that the income is attributable to the amount in respect of which a deduction for a bad debt is claimed. If the bad debt is actually paid, the amount paid is assessable income in the year in which it is received. 18.3In summary, a deduction under section 64G(1) is available for bad debts for income derived and calculated according to the accrual tax accounting regime in any circumstance except under the cash base price adjustment and the cash basis adjustment, but note the point made at paragraph 16.4 above in relation to cash basis holders. 18.4Whether and to what extent income is attribut- able to the amount in respect of which a deduction for a bad debt is claimed is a matter to be ascertained according to the facts of each case. Factors to be taken into account include the nature of the arrangement between the parties (e.g. a current account that has fluctu- ated between DR and CR balance would not be treated the same as a term loan) and any express instructions given by the debtor in relation to the order of priority among amounts owing. Subject to such matters of fact, the provision is to be interpreted liberally for the benefit of the taxpayer - (a)Setting bad debts off against “income” before “principal”; and (b)Setting payments on account of bad debts off against bad debts for “income” before bad debts for “principal”. 18.5Note that careful consideration of individual circumstances will be required - in a receiver- ship it may be inappropriate to apply the general rule set out in subparagraph (b) above as there may be no prospect of repaying all of the “principal”, let alone any of the “income”. 19.“Income” Bad Debts - Section 106(1)(b) 19.1A bad debt in relation to a financial arrange- ment may be a bad debt of income where the financial arrangement is a debt that is working capital of the creditor - e.g. trade credits for sales. Such bad debts are dealt with under sections 104 and 106(1)(b) as they have been in the past. In addition any income bad debt not dealt with under sections 64B to 64M (e.g. income under the cash basis adjustment or the cash base price adjustment, or bad debts from associated persons) is to be dealt with under 106(1)(b). 20“Capital” or “Principal” Bad Debts - Section 64G(2) 20.1Where a person who is in the business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements of a particular type (see paragraphs 17.1 and 17.2) suffers a bad debt in respect of such a financial arrangement section 64G(2) will generally provide a deduction where section 64G(1) does not unless debtor and creditor are associated persons. It is primarily a relief for loss of principal. 20.2Where a person suffers a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement from which the person derives income under - (a)Section 64C; or (b)Section 64D(3); or (c)Section 64F (note that in this case section 64F(5), the cash base price adjustment, is included); or (d)section 64I - and the person is in the business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements, section 64G(2) applies. 20.3Section 64G(2) allows a deduction where and to the extent that - (a)The bad debt is not deductible under section 64G(1); and (b)The amount is written off in the year in which the deduction is claimed; and (c)The issuer and the holder are not associ- ated persons. 20.4Note that the amount of the deduction is only limited - (a)By excluding amounts written off under section 64G(1), and (b)To the amount actually written off Thus, subject to section 106(1)(o) and the general limitation imposed by the nature of bad debts (see paragraph 8.2(a), (b) and (c) above), section 64G(2) allows deductions for bad debts in respect of principal amounts for persons in the business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements if the debtor and the creditor are not associated persons. 20.5The deduction is allowed in the year in which the debt is written off. If the bad debt is actually paid, the amount paid is assessable income in the year in which it is received. 21.Security Payments 21.1If a debtor fails to pay a debt and the creditor calls on a guarantee, indemnity, letter of credit, bond or other security payment, the creditor may be separately assessable for the gain on the security arrangement viewed in isolation. In such cases, if no deduction is provided for elsewhere, section 64G(3) will provide a deduction for the bad debt to the extent of the gain on the security arrangement. This ensures that the net effect of the two arrangements (the debt and the guarantee or other security arrangement) is the same as if the debtor had fulfilled the obligations under the loan to the extent of the security payment. 22.Associated Persons - Sections 104 and 106(1)(b) 22.1 Where debtor and creditor are associated persons - (a)The relief provided in the proviso to section 64F(6) is not available; and (b)The relief for losses of principal under section 64G(2) is not available. However section 106(1)(b) applies to such losses It has no associated persons limitation, but is subject to - (a)Section 106(1)(a); and (b)The requirements briefly outlined at paragraph 2.2 above; and (c)The limitation (stated in Levin & Co v CIR \[1963\] NZLR 801) that an advance to an associated person may be written off as a bad debt only if the advance was made in the ordinary course of the parties’ business.

At the same time employer contributions to superannuation schemes were made subject to fringe benefit tax. On the completion of the consultation process the Taxation Reform Bill (No.5) 1988 was introduced. This Bill became the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 which was assented to on 22 March 1989. This put into place the taxed/taxed/ exempt regime for superannuation which means that: -contributions to schemes come out of tax paid income; -earnings of schemes are taxed when derived; -all benefits paid (from 1 April 1990) will be tax free. Alongside the review of the taxation treatment of private superannuation there was also a review of the regulatory regime. This resulted in the Superan- nuation Schemes Act 1989 (previously the Superan- nuation Schemes Bill 1988) which is administered by the Government Actuary’s Office. This Act provides for the reduction of scheme benefits in the light of the tax changes and provides a new regulatory regime. The regime will involve approved category 1 and 2 schemes becoming registered schemes. 2.0CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPERANNUA- TION SCHEMES The legislation ensures that contributions made by individuals, employees or employers are in effect made out of tax paid income 2.1Employee and Individual Superannuation Contributions Contributions made by employees or by individuals to personal schemes continue to be non-deductible. 2.2Employer Superannuation Contributions The legislation ensures that employer superannua- tion contributions will in effect come from tax paid income. 2.2.1Deductibility The amendments to the Act do nothing to change the existing scheme of the Act in respect of superannua- tion contribution deductibility. The section 104 tests must first be met, followed by the general denial of deductibility under section 106(1)(m), with section 150 finally governing deductibility. Section 106(1)(m) of the Act has been amended together with a new section 106(ma) (section 8 of the Amendment Act) to make it clear that accrued liabilities cannot be deducted until payment is made. (But see para 2.2.7). Section 150 of the Act has been amended (section 10 of the Amendment Act) with the basic aim of remov- ing the previous restriction on the amount which is deductible (from 1 April 1989). The scheme of the amended section 150 of the Act is as follows: (i)Subsection (2A) - allows a deduction for “employer superannuation contributions” made on or after I April 1989; (ii)“Employer superannuation contribution” is defined in section 2 of the Act (by section 2 of the Amendment Act). It covers any “superan- nuation contribution” provided by an em- ployer for the benefit of their employees; (iii)“Superannuation contribution” is defined in section 2 of the Act (by section 2 of the Amendment Act). This covers contributions of money or other property for the benefit of a “superannuation scheme”. (iv)“Superannuation scheme” is defined in section 2 of the Act (by section 2 of the Amendment Act). The definition covers the following entities and arrangements where retirement benefits are provided to natural persons: -A trust or unit trust (as defined in section 211 of the Act); -Any company not resident in New Zealand; -Any New Zealand or foreign statutory arrangement (e.g., the Government Superannuation fund). Subsection (2B) of section 150 then goes on to deny a deduction for superannuation schemes where those schemes are neither “superannuation funds” nor “companies”. “Superannuation funds” as defined in section 2 of the Act means superannuation cat- egory 1 and 2 schemes and schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. The amend- ment which includes registered schemes in the definition of “superannuation fund” is contained in the 3rd schedule to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Section 2(5) of the Amendment Act however excludes overseas schemes approved under regula- tions 29 or 30 of the Superannuation Schemes Regu- lations 1983 from the definition of “superannuation fund” from the beginning of the 1988/89 income year. “Companies” includes entities which come under the definition of company contained in section 2 of the Act. It also includes schemes or arrangements which are deemed to be unit trusts and therefore deemed to be companies under section 211 of the Act. This unit trust definition covers any scheme or arrangement which has the effect of providing facilities for partici- pation as beneficiaries under a trust by contributors in income or gains subject to that trust (excluding “superannuation funds”). This means that employer superannuation schemes to which employees con- tribute (not being “superannuation funds”) will be treated as companies for income tax purposes. This will be the situation both for New Zealand and overseas contributory schemes. Employer superan- nuation schemes which are not superannuation funds and which do not have employee contributors will not meet the definition of unit trust and unless they are otherwise a company, the employer will be unable to claim a deduction for contributions made. This continues the treatment given to non-approved New Zealand schemes and meshes with the new international tax regime introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) of 1988. 2.2.2Taxing of Contributions Monetary contributions made on or after 1 April 1989 to approved New Zealand schemes will be subject to the specified superannuation contribution withholding tax. Non-monetary contributions and all contributions to non-approved schemes will continue to be subject to fringe benefit tax. Paragraph 2.2.9 refers to certain exemptions from fringe benefit tax for approved schemes. Section 2 of the Amendment Act amends definitions contained in section 2 of the Act to make it clear that employer superannuation contributions are not: (a)Expenditure on account of an employee (Section 2(2) of the Amendment Act); (b)Monetary remuneration (Section 2(3) of the Amendment Act); and (c)Salary or wages (Section 2(4) of the Amend- ment Act). 2.2.3Employer Contributions to Approved New Zealand Schemes All contributions made by employers to approved NZ superannuation schemes (superannuation funds) on or after 1 April 1989 will be deductible (except for the situation outlined in para 2.2.8). Employer superannuation contributions made in monetary form on or after 1 April 1989 to approved New Zealand schemes (“superannuation funds”) are subject to the specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT). This tax is provided for in section 20 of the Amendment Act which inserts new sections 336Z to 336ZK into the Principal Act. New subsection (gb) of section 336N(1) of the Act (in- serted by section 19 of the Amendment Act) exempts contributions from fringe benefit tax where SSCWT applies. 2.2.3.1Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT) (a final tax) Section 336ZA(1) imposes SSCWT on any “specified superannuation contributions” made to a “superan- nuation fund” on or after 1 April 1989. Section 2 of the Act provides that a specified superannuation contribution is a contribution in money (as opposed to a contribution in kind). Section 336ZA(2) provides that the amount of the specified superannuation contribution is the aggre- gate of: (a)The amount of the specified superannuation contribution received by the superannuation fund; and (b)The amount of the SSCWT payable in respect of the contribution. This means that the SSCWT is calculated on the gross contribution (including the tax). Example: An employer makes a contribution to a superannua- tion fund of $100. The superannuation fund receives $67 specified superannuation contribution. SSCWT = a x b 1 - a Wherea =the rate of SSCWT b =the contribution received by the super- annuation fund SSCWT = 0.33 x $67 = $33 1 - 0.33 The gross contribution is therefore: $67 (the amount received by the superannuation fund) plus $33 (the SSCWT) = $100. It is proposed that, for the purpose of determining whether an employer has met his superannuation obligations in terms of a trust deed, the gross contri- bution will be taken into account. Thus, for this purpose, SSCWT will be deemed to be received by the fund. Section 336ZB requires employers to deduct SSCWT from specified superannuation contributions when they are made. Section 336ZC requires employers to pay SSCWT to the Inland Revenue Department by the 20th day of the month following the month in which the tax was deducted. Section 336ZD requires employers to furnish a statement of deductions made by the 20th day of the month following the month in which the deduction is made. Section 336ZE provides that specified superannua- tion contributions are not income of the superannua- tion fund. These contributions would already have been subject to SSCWT. Section 336ZF deals with the situation where an employer fails to make a deduction of SSCWT. It provides that the amount in default constitutes a debt payable by the employer to the Commissioner and deems it to have become due and payable on the 20th day of the month after the month in which the specified superannuation contribution was made. Section 336ZG allows the Commissioner to make assessments of SSCWT. The section also allows for objections by employers to such assessments. Section 336ZH provides for the imposition of addi- tional tax where an employer fails to deduct or pay SSCWT (Unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the employer has not been guilty of wilful neglect or default). The additional tax is applied at the rate of 10 percent of the amount of default. Further addi- tional tax is applied to the amount of default and additional tax accrues every 6 months until payment is made. Section 336ZI imposes penal tax of up to 300 percent of the amount of the SSCWT where an employer fails to pay the Commissioner. Section 336ZJ includes offence provisions for failure to deduct or pay SSCWT. This allows for fines of up to $15,000 for first offences and up to $25,000 for subsequent offences. Section 336ZK applies a number of provisions contained in Part XI of the Act (Tax Deductions) to SSCWT. These include provisions relating to the recovery of SSCWT from employers. 2.2.3.2 Miscellaneous Provisions New section 140AB of the Act (inserted by section 43 of the Amendment Act) provides that SSCWT is deductible in the income year in which the specified superannuation contribution was made. New section 106(1)(fb) provides that additional tax charged under section 336ZH of the Act is non-deductible. Section 22 of the Amendment Act includes SSCWT in section 394A to ensure that it is not an income tax for company imputation purposes. Section 23 of the Amendment Act amends section 396 of the Act which provides legislative authority for Public Authorities to pay “Income Tax” by adding the words - “or any other tax or amount under this Act”. This makes it clear that SSCWT is covered by section 396. Section 24 of the Amendment Act amends section 400 of the Act to ensure that SSCWT can be collected under that section in cases of default. Section 25 of the Amendment Act provides for the publication of the name of employers charged with penal tax in respect of SSCWT. Section 26 of the Amendment Act which amends section 428 of the Act, provides for the keeping of business records in relation to SSCWT. It provides that employers must keep a record of: (i)The amount of every specified superannuation contribution made. (ii)Details of the recipient. (iii)The date the contribution is made. 2.2.4Employer Contributions to Non-Approved NZ Schemes Contributions to these schemes have in the past been non-deductible and subject to fringe benefit tax (being superannuation category 3 schemes). From 1 April 1989 employer superannuation contri- butions to non-approved NZ schemes will be de- ductible where the scheme is deemed a company. This will be where a scheme is one contributed to by employees which meets the definition of “unit trust” contained in section 211 of the Act. Fully employer funded schemes will not be deemed to be companies and employer contributions to such schemes will not be deductible. 2.2.5Employer Contributions to Non-Approved Overseas Schemes The treatment of employer superannuation contribu- tions to non-approved overseas schemes is the same as that for non-approved NZ schemes except that companies as well as unit trusts (deemed companies) are covered by the definition of “superannuation scheme”. 2.2.6Employer Contributions to Approved Overseas Schemes This paragraph covers superannuation schemes which have been approved by the Government Actuary under regulations 29 or 30 of the Superan- nuation Schemes Regulations 1983. Employer super- annuation contributions to such schemes are to be given the same treatment as non-approved overseas schemes except for a transitional provision. This is contained in the new subsection (2C) of section 150 (inserted by section 10 of the Amendment Act). This transitional provision ensures that employer super- annuation contributions to such approved overseas schemes (which were approved at 31 March 1988) continue to be deductible up until 1 April 1990. 2.2.763 Day Deductibility Rule New subsection (2E) of section 150 (inserted by section 10 of the Amendment Act) provides a special timing rule for deductibility of employer superan- nuation contributions made on or after 1 April 1989. Where an employer superannuation contribution is made not more than 63 days after the end of the income year in respect of which (a)The contribution was required by the scheme; or (b)The amount of the contribution was calculated having regard to the amounts of the earnings paid by the employer to any employee who was a member of the scheme during that income year, The employer can elect (up to the time the return is filed) to deduct the contribution in the earlier year. 2.2.812 Month Deduction Clawback Rule New subsection (2D) of section 150 (inserted by section 10 of the Amendment Act) disallows the deduction of contributions made during the 12 month period immediately preceding the date of the receipt by that employer of a benefit from the scheme. The amount disallowed equals the amount of benefit in money or money’s worth received by the employer. New subsection (2E) of section 150 (inserted by section 10 of the Amendment Act) ensures that a deduction is not denied where the benefit received by the employer is a bona fide pension, annuity or lump sum payment received by the employer in that employer’s personal capacity. 2.2.9Fringe Benefit Tax Exemptions Section 19 of the Amendment Act provides for 3 exemptions from fringe benefit tax. These are para- graphs (ga), (gb) and (gc) of section 336N(1) of the Act. (i)Paragraph (ga) provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax in respect of low interest loans provided by a “superannuation fund”. Such benefits are to be treated as assessable income of the “superannuation fund” instead of requiring the employer to pay fringe benefit tax. (ii)Paragraph (gb) provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax on specified superannuation contributions (for which SSCWT is paid). (iii)paragraph (gc) provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax where an employer provides services to a .superannuation fund to the extent that the expenditure incurred would have been deductible to the superannuation fund if the expenditure had been incurred by that superannuation fund. 2.3Contributions In Respect of Major Shareholders Special rules relating to the treatment of employer superannuation contributions in respect of major shareholders and shareholder employees apply for the period from 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1989 (inclusive). Section 10(4) of the Amendment Act removes the limitation on deductibility contained in section 150(4) of the Act in respect of major shareholders (from 1 April 1988). This means that the normal provisions contained in section 150 will apply to major shareholders. Because fringe benefit tax does not apply to major shareholders from 1 April 1988 a new section 65A (inserted by section 6 of the Amendment Act) was inserted to tax such contribu- tions for the period from 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1989 (inclusive). This section assesses the contribu- tion to the employee. This income need not be taken into account for provisional tax purposes however. From 1 April 1989 onwards fringe benefit tax will apply in respect of such contributions and section 65A will cease to have effect. Subsection 3 of section 65A of the Act (inserted by section 6 of the Amendment Act) ensures that em- ployer superannuation contributions in respect of major shareholders are not exempt from fringe benefit tax where the company is in the course of being wound up during the period from 1 April 1989 to 30 September 1989 (inclusive). 3.0TAXATION OF SUPERANNUATION SCHEME INCOME Section 4(2) of the Amendment Act repeals the exemption from income tax for category 1 schemes (contained in section 61(21) of the Act) with respect to income derived on or after 1 April 1988. Section 4(1) of the Amendment Act amends section 61(2) of the Act to ensure that the exemption for “public authorities” does not apply to the extent to which they are superannuation schemes. Section 17 of the Amendment Act inserts new section 232D and 232E which make it clear that both the National Provident Fund and the Government Superannuation Fund are subject to tax on their income. 3.1Taxation of Superannuation Funds (Approved or Registered Schemes) Superannuation funds (category 1 and 2 schemes and registered schemes) are required to be consti- tuted as trusts. The ordinary trust taxation provi- sions will therefore apply except where there are specific exceptions. These exceptions are as follows: (i)Section 15(2) of the Amendment Act which amends section 228(3) of the Act. This amend- ment ensures that a superannuation fund is taxed on worldwide income irrespective of the residence of the settlor. (ii)Section 15(3) of the Amendment Act which amends section 228(5) of the Act. This amend- ment prevents scheme contributors (who would be settlors) from being liable for the tax liability of that fund. (iii)Section 14(1) of the Amendment Act which amends the definition of “beneficiary income” contained in section 226(1) of the Act. This amendment is needed to ensure that distribu- tions from “superannuation funds” are not taxed as “beneficiary income”. (iv)Section 15(1) of the Amendment Act which inserts new subsections (2A) and (2B) into section 228 of the Act. Subsection (2A) allows a deduction for expenditure incurred by a superannuation fund to the extent to which it is incurred in respect of developing, market- ing, selling promoting and advertising for members to the fund even where that expendi- ture might otherwise have been non-deduct- ible because it was of a capital nature. Ex- penditure incurred in acquiring fixed assets will not be deductible under this provision however. Subsection (2B) ensures that trustees of superannuation funds are not taxed on income, gains or benefits arising from the investment of funds in another superannua- tion fund policy of life insurance issued in New Zealand. This avoids the possibility of having income taxed to both the life insurance company and the trustee of the superannua- tion fund. (v)Section 16 of the Amendment Act which inserts new subsections (6) and (7) into section 231 of the Act. Subsection (6) provides that the disclosure requirements in respect of trusts do not apply to superannuation funds. Subsection (7) provides that prior to 1 April 1990 those disclosure requirements do not apply to approved overseas schemes (under regulations 29 or 30 of the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983). (vi)Section 17 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 232 into the Act to provide that the income of a superannuation fund which is a combined category 1 and 2 scheme fund be attributed to the two schemes on a basis satisfactory to the Commissioner. In general this will be the basis used currently. (vii)Section 17 of the Amendment Act also inserts a new section 232F into the Act. This section deals with the calculation of depreciation allowances for category 1 schemes for assets first used prior to 1 April 1988. Depreciation is calculated as if depreciation had been claimed since an asset was first used. Example: Superannuation scheme with a 31 March 1989 balance date. Furniture and fittings first used 25 August 1986 and cost $10,000. Depreciation calculated at 20% per annum on a diminishing value basis. Year ended 31 March 1987 Notional depreciation of $1,000 (Asset used for less than 6 months - 10% depreciation only allowed). Year ended 31 March 1988 Notional written down value of $9,000 less notional depreciation of $1,800 (20%). Year ended 31 March 1989 Notional written down value of $7,200. Depreciation of $1,440 to be claimed for the year ended 31 March 1989. 3.1.1Taxation of category 1 scheme income Para 3.1 described modification to the ordinary trust tax treatment of superannuation funds. Section 17 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 232B into the Act which provides for further modifications. This section provides for the treatment of investment gains and losses (where subject to income tax) and financial arrangements acquired before 1 April 1988 and sold or disposed of on or after 1 April 1988. Section 30 of the Amendment Act is a transitional section which caters for category 1 schemes which have balance dates (approved by the Commissioner) from l April 1988 to 30 March 1989 (inclusive). This section provides for assessable income (except for investment gains and losses and financial arrange- ments) calculated for the scheme’s income year to be apportioned on a daily basis to the period from 1 April 1988 to balance date. Investment gains and losses and financial arrangement are dealt with under section 232B of the Act. (It should be noted that a superannuation fund which is a category 1 scheme has not previously been a taxpayer and will therefore have a 31 March balance date unless an alternative balance date has been approved by the Commissioner under section 15 of the Act. Where a superannuation fund has an existing balance date approved in respect of its category 2 scheme it will use that date for its cat- egory 1 scheme) . Calculation of assessable income •Category 1 schemes with balance dates from 31 March 1989 onwards. Having calculated income under the ordinary trust treatment (as modified by the provision detailed in para 3.1) the remaining step is to deal with investment gains and losses (which are subject to income tax) and financial ar- rangement income and expenditure, under section 232B of the Act. The amount to be taken into assessable income is calculated as follows: •Where an investment (excluding a financial arrangement to which sections 64B to 64L of the Act apply) was made or acquired before 1 April 1988, any profit or loss on sale or disposal in the income year is calculated as the difference between: (i)the consideration received or receivable on the sale or other disposition of the investment; and (ii)the market value of the investment at 1 April 1988. •Where the investment is a financial arrange- ment to which sections 64B to 64L of the Act apply any income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of that financial arrange- ment is calculated under sections 64B to 64L except that the acquisition price of the finan- cial arrangement is either (at the option of the taxpayer): (i)the market value at 1 April 1988; or (ii)The adjusted base price, being, in the case of the issuer of a financial arrange- ment, the acquisition price of that financial arrangement together with all accrued expenditure incurred by the issuer, less consideration paid by the issuer in relation to that financial ar- rangement before the 1st day of April 1988, and in the case of the holder of a financial arrangement, the acquisition price of that financial arrangement together with all accrued income de- rived by the holder, less consideration received by the holder in respect of the financial arrangement before 1 April 1988. •Category 1 schemes with balance dates from 1 April 1988 to 30 March 1989 (inclusive). Having calculated income under the ordinary trust treatment (as modified by the provisions detailed in para 3.1) the remaining steps are to: (i)Apportion the income (except for investment gains and losses and finan- cial arrangements) calculated for the scheme’s income year on a daily basis for the period from 1 April 1988 to balance date. (ii)deal with investment gains and losses, and financial arrangements. Section 30(2) of the Amendment Act provides the following formula for the calculation of assessable income: a x b + c d where a -is the assessable income for the income year calculated under the “new law”. (The new law means the Income Tax Act as amended by the Amendment Act) excluding the amount of any profit or losses on the sale or disposal investments. b -is the number of days from 1 April 1988 to balance date. c -is the amount of profit or loss on the sale or disposal after 1 April 1988 and in the income year (including any financial arrangement) determined in accordance with the “new law”. This means the appli- cation of the provisions of section 232B. d -is the number of days in the income year (in most cases 365 days). 3.1.2Taxation of category 2 scheme income Para 3.1 described modifications to the ordinary trust treatment of superannuation funds. The posi- tion of category 2 schemes is further modified by the following sections of the Amendment Act. (a)Section 12 of the Amendment Act. This section inserts a new subsection (8) into section 225 of the Act This subsection ensures that section 225 does not apply to income derived by a category 2 scheme in an income year which commences before and ends after 1 April 1988. (The transitional provisions in section 30 of the Amendment Act apply for such income years). (b)Section 13 of the Amendment Act This section inserts a new section 225A into the Act. Section 225A deals with investments sold or disposed of after 1 April 1988 (exclud- ing financial arrangements to which sections 64B to 64L of the Act apply which were ac- quired before that date). It caters for the situation where gains and losses on sale or disposal of investments were subject to the specific investment gains regime in section 225 prior to 1 April 1988, but which would not be taxed after 1 April 1988 under the normal law. Section 225A operates by bringing into assess- able income amounts calculated as follows: In the case of an investment acquired before the last day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982, the difference between the market value of the investment at 1 April 1988 and the greater of: (i)The cost price or acquisition value of the investment; or (ii)The market value of that investment on the last day of the income year com- mencing on 1 April 1982. In the case of an investment acquired after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982, the difference between: (i)The market value of the investment on 1 April 1988; and (ii)The cost price or acquisition value of the investment. (c)Section 17 of the Amendment Act Where the investment gain or loss (not includ- ing a financial arrangement to which sections 64B to 64L of the Act apply) was subject to income tax under the specific section 225 investment gains regime before 1 April 1988 and under the normal law after that date, section 232B (1)(b) applies. In this situation the amount included in assessable income is the difference between the consideration received or receivable on sale or disposal of the invest- ment and: (i)Where the investment was made or acquired after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982, the cost price or acquisition value of the investment. (ii)Where the investment was made or acquired on or before the last day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982, the greater of the cost price or acquisition value of the investment on the last day of that income year. (d)Section 30 of the Amendment Act This section contains transitional provisions which cater for category 2 schemes with balance dates from 1 April 1988 to 30 March 1989 (inclusive). Section 30(3) provides the following formula for the calculation of assessable income: a + b + c + d x e f where a -is the assessable income for the income year calculated under the “new law” (The new law means the Income Tax Act as amended by the Amendment Act) excluding the amount of any profit or loss on the sale or disposal during the year of any investment (not being a financial arrangement) . b -is the amount of any profit or loss on sale or disposal during the income year prior to 1 April 1988 determined in accordance with the “previous law”. (The previous law means the Income Tax Act before amend- ment by the Amendment Act). This means gains and losses as calculated under section 225 of the Act. c -is the amount of profit or loss on sale or disposal during the income year on or after 1 April 1988 calculated in accordance with the new law. This means gains and losses calculated under section 225A and section 232B of the Act. d -is the amount of deductible expenditure determined under the “new law” applied for the whole of the income year, less the amount of deductible expenditure for the income year determined as if the “previous law” applied for the whole of the income year. e -is the number of days in the income year prior to 1 April 1988. f -is the number of days in the income year of the scheme (in most cases 365 days) The d x e part of the formula effectively removes from deductibility the proportion of expenses calculated under section 228(2A) of the Act which relates to the period prior to 1 April 1988. This was previously included in the calculation of item a of the formula. This allows section 228(2A) to apply from 1 April 1988 and not earlier. 3.2Taxation of Category 3 Schemes Section 12 of the Amendment Act inserts a new subsection (8) into section 225 of the Act. This section ensures that section 225 does not apply to income derived by a category 3 scheme after the end of the income year which commences on 1 April 1988. This has the following effects: (a)Removes the non-deductibility provision contained in section 225(d)(iii) relating to the developing and marketing of schemes. Such expenditure will be treated under the normal provisions of the Act. (b)Removes the specific investment gains regime contained in section 225(2) of the Act. Section 13 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 225A which deals with investments (exclud- ing financial arrangements to which sections 64B to 64L of the Act apply) sold or disposed of after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988. It caters for the situation where gains and losses on sale or disposal of investments were subject to the specific investment gains regime in section 225 prior to the end of the income year commencing 1 April 1988, but which would not be subject to income tax after that income year under the normal law. Section 225A operates by bringing into assessable income amounts calculated as follows: In the case of an investment acquired before the last day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982. •the difference between the market value of the investment at the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 and the greater of: (i)The cost price or acquisition value of the investment; or (ii)The market value of that investment on the last day of the income year com- mencing on 1 April 1982. In the case of an investment acquired after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982. •the difference between: (i)The market value of the investment at the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988; and (ii)The cost price or acquisition value of the investment. Section 17 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 232B into the Act which deals with investment gains or losses (not includ- ing financial arrangements to which sec- tions 64B to 64L of the Act apply) which were subject to income tax under the specific section 225 investment gains regime under the normal law In this situation the amount included in assessable income is the difference between the consideration received or receivable on sale or disposal and: (i)Where the investment was made or ac- quired after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982, the cost price or acquisition value of the investment: (ii)Where the investment was made or ac- quired on or before the last day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982, the greater of the cost price or acquisition value of the investment on the last day of that income year. (c)Removes the effect of section 225(4)(e) which stopped sections 226 to 230 of the Act from applying to category 3 schemes. Sections 226 to 230 dealt with income derived in respect of trusts. This means that category 3 schemes which are not caught by the provi- sions of section 211 of the Act (Unit Trusts) will be affected by the new trust regime from the end of the 1988/89 income year. Section 211 of the Act was amended by the Income Tax Amendment Act No 5 of 1988. This amendment (to the definition of “Unit trust”) includes contributory superannuation schemes (which are not superannuation funds) within the definition of a “Unit trust”. Summary of Category 3 scheme transition Income year commencing 1 April 1987 Section 225 applicable Sections 226 to 230 not applicable Section 211 not applicable Income year commencing 1 April 1988 Section 225 applicable Sections 226 to 230 not applicable Section 211 applicable (contributory schemes) Income year commencing 1 April 1989 Section 225 not applicable Section 225A applicable Section 225 to 230 applicable (non-contribu- tory schemes) Section 211 applicable (contributory schemes) 3.2.1Taxation of Overseas Schemes The international tax regime applying to trusts, companies and deemed unit trusts will apply to New Zealand residents with interests in overseas superan- nuation schemes. 3.3Taxation of Life Insurance Companies Section 11 of the Amendment Act amends section 204 of the Act to allow for the concessional 25 per- cent income tax rate to apply to the category 1 and annuity business of life insurance companies. It also allows for the tax deferral outlined in para 3.6 to apply in respect of that business. The current treatment given under section 204(9) of the Act remains largely intact except for the change to the definition of “Superannuation Policy” (amended by section 11(1) of the Amendment Act). This ensures that superannuation category 1 schemes given approval after 17 December 1987 are taxed under section 204(9) at the rate of 33 cents in the dollar. Section 1113) of the Amendment Act inserts 2 new subsections into section 204 of the Act. They are (9A) and (9B) which subject the remaining superannua- tion category 1 and annuity business of the life company to the 25 cents in the dollar tax rate. Subsection (9B) covers life companies which have income years with approved balance dates other than 31 March which income year contains 1 April 1988. Subsection (9A) covers all other income years. The subsection (9A) regime calculates assessable income as follows: (a/b x c) - (d/e x f) where a -is the amount of liabilities in respect of life insur- ance policies at balance date in respect of: •superannuation category 1 schemes which are deemed to be approved on or before 17 De- cember 1987 •annuities b - is the total amount of liabilities in the life insur- ance fund at balance date. (It should be noted that liabilities as it is used in the context of this section means in respect of policies of life insurance, contracts of reinsurance and annuities). c - is the amount of the profits of the company for the income year, ascertained in accordance with section 204(8) d -is the amount of liabilities in the life insurance fund in respect of: •superannuation category 1 scheme which are deemed to have been approved on or before 17 December 1987. •annuities at the end of the company’s last income year that ended before l April 1988. e - is the total amount of liabilities in the life insur- ance fund at the end of the company’s last income year that ended before 1 April 1988. f - is the amount in respect of investments sold or disposed of in the income year which were acquired before 1 April 1988, calculated as follows: •In respect of investments made or acquired before the last day of the income year com- mencing on 1 April 1982: by subtracting from the market value of this investment on 1 April 1988, the greater of (i)the cost price or acquisition value of the investment; and (ii)the market value of that investment on the last day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982. •In respect of investments made or acquired after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982: (i)All investments except for financial ar- rangements to which section 64B to 64L of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply; by subtracting the cost price or acquisition value of the investment from the market value on 1 April 1988. (ii)financial arrangements to which sections 64B to 64L of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply; by calculating the difference between the value of the financial arrangement at 1 April 1988 as if it had matured at that date; and the acquisition value and income deemed to have been derived in previous income years. The subsection (9B) regime calculates assessable income as follows: \[a/b x(g x (h-i)+ j)\] - (d/e x f) k where a -is the amount of liabilities in the life insurance fund at balance date in respect of: •superannuation category 1 schemes which are deemed to be approved on or before 17 De- cember 1987 •Annuities b -is the total amount of liabilities in the life insur- ance fund at balance date. g -is the number of days from 1 April 1988 to bal- ance date. k -is the number of days in the company’s income year (in most cases 365 days). h -is the amount of the profits of the company for the income year determined in accordance with section 204(8). i -is the amount of any profit (or loss) on the sale disposal during the income of any investment of the company determined in accordance with section 204(7). j -is the amount of any profit or loss on the sale or disposal during the income year, on or after 1 April 1988, of any investment of the company determined in accordance with section 204(7). d -is the amount of liabilities in the life insurance fund in respect of: •superannuation category 1 schemes which are deemed to be approved on or before 17 De- cember 1987. •annuities at the end of the company's income year that last ended before 1 April 1988. e -is the total amount of liabilities in the life insur- ance fund at the end of the company’s income year that last ended before 1 April 1988. f -is the amount in respect of investments sold or disposed of on or after 1 April 1988 in the income year (having been acquired before 1 April 1989) calculated as follows: •In respect of investments made or acquired before the last day of the income year com- mencing on 1 April 1982. by subtracting from the market value of the investment on 1 April 1988 the greater of: (i)the cost price or acquisition value of the investment; and (ii)the market value of that investment on the last day of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982. •In respect of investments made or acquired after the end of the income year commencing on 1 April 1982. (i)All investments except for financial ar- rangements to which sections 64B to 64L of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply. by subtracting the cost price or acquisition value of the investment from the market value on 1 April 1988. (ii)Financial arrangements to which sections 64B to 64L of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply. by calculating the difference between the value of the financial arrangement at 1 April 1988 as if it had matured at that date; and the acquisition value and income deemed to have been derived in previous income years. 3.4Income Tax Rates Section 27 of the Amendment Act amends the 1st schedule of the Act which provides the rates of income tax, with effect from the income year com- mencing 1 April 1988, in respect of: (a)Life Insurance Companies (i)For income assessable under section 204(9) of the Act the rate of income tax is 33 cents in the dollar. (ii)For income assessable under subsections (9A) or (9B) of section 204 the rate of income tax is 25 cents in the dollar. (b)Superannuation Schemes (i)For category 1 schemes which were or were deemed to be superannuation category 1 schemes on or before 17 December 1987 the rate of income tax is 25 cents in the dollar. Category 1 schemes which were personal pension schemes and which admitted new members after 17 December 1987 will not benefit from this concessionary rate. (ii)For category 1 schemes other than those referred to in (i), and category 2 schemes, will have an income tax rate of 33 cents in the dollar. (iii)For category 3 schemes the rate for the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 is 40.5 cents in the dollar. 3.5Loans to Superannuation Funds to Members Section 17 of the Amendment Act provides for a new section 232A which will deem the benefit element of a low interest loan made by a superannuation fund to a fund member to be assessable income of the fund. Section 232A will apply to superannuation funds as follows: (a)Schemes with 31 March balance dates - from 1 April 1989. (b)Schemes with other (approved) balance dates - from the beginning of the accounting year first commencing after 1 April 1989. Fringe benefit tax will not apply to such loans, however some of the fringe benefit tax provisions are utilised by section 232A (to determine the assessable income derived by the fund). 3.6Furnishing of Income Tax Returns Section 32 of the Amendment Act provides transi- tional measures dealing with the furnishing of 1988 returns for category 1 schemes and life insurance companies with category 1 business. Category 1 schemes and life insurance companies with balance dates from 1 April 1988 to 30 September 1988 are required to furnish 1988 returns in respect of their category 1 business no later than 7 July 1989 (or such later date as the Commissioner may allow). Normal filing dates will apply for other returns. 3.7Income Tax Payments Section 31 of the Amendment Act contains the following transitional provisions in relation to provisional and terminal tax payments for category 1 schemes and the category 1 scheme business of life insurance companies. (i)Subsection (1) provides that no 1989 provi- sional tax is payable (ii)Subsection (2) provides that category 1 schemes and life insurance companies with 1989 balance dates from 1 October 1988 to 28 February 1989 (inclusive) will pay their first instalment of 1990 provisional tax on their second instalment date (making 2 instalments on the second date). (iii)Subsection (3) provides that 50 percent of the 1988 terminal tax is payable by 7 July 1989 with the remaining 50 percent payable by 7 February 1989. (iv)Subsection (4) provides that 50 percent of the 1989 terminal tax is payable by the normal 1989 terminal tax date and 50 percent by the 1990 terminal tax date except where this deferral was available in respect of the 1988 terminal tax. 4.0Superannuation Scheme Benefits The tax status of superannuation scheme benefits will depend on whether the scheme is: (a)Approved/registered - a superannuation fund (b)Non-approved/non-registered Category 3 - a trust or a deemed unit trust. 4.1Benefits from Superannuation Funds The following modifications to the trust tax regime have been made in respect of superannuation funds: (i)Section 14(2) of the Amendment Act excludes superannuation funds from the definition of “qualifying trust” contained in section 226(1) the Act; and (ii)Section 14(3) of the Amendment Act provides that superannuation funds are “qualifying trusts” on or after 1 April 1990. Section 227(6) of the Act provides that distributions from “qualifying trusts” are not assessable income. The effect of these provisions is to allow for benefits from superannuation funds to be free of income tax when paid on or after 1 April 1990 (but not before). 4.2Benefits from Category 3 Schemes (a)Contributory schemes (where employee contributions are made). These schemes will be deemed to be unit trusts under section 211 of the Act. Benefits from such schemes are treated as dividends from the beginning of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988. (b)Non-contributory schemes These schemes (which are not deemed to be unit trusts) are taxed as trusts. Benefits from such schemes will generally be taxed as trust distributions. 4.3Benefits from Approved Overseas Schemes Section 3 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 4A(1)(n) into the Act. This ensures that lump sum benefits from approved overseas schemes (under regulations 29 or 30 of the Superannuation Schemes Regulation 1983) will not be taxed as dividends when paid before 1 April 1990. 4.4Life Insurance Company Annuities Section 4(3) of the Amendment Act inserts a new subsection (59) into section 61 of the Act which provides for annuities paid from a life insurance fund of a life insurance company to be exempt from income tax on or after 1 April 1990. This mirrors the treatment given to superannuation funds. 4.5National Superannuitant Surcharge Section 18 of the Amendment Act ensures that non- assessable pensions from superannuation funds and tax exempt annuities from life insurance companies continue to be included in the surcharge calculation. This is achieved by including these amounts in item a of the formula in section 336B of the Act. 4.6Family Support Tax Credit Anti-abuse Section 21 of the Amendment Act amends section 374B(1) of the Act to include in income for family support purposes from 1 April 1990 any distribution from a superannuation scheme where: (a)the recipient’s employer made contributions to that scheme in that or the two preceding income years; and (b)the recipient continues to be employed by that employer one month after the date of receipt. The section however does not apply where the distribution is made as a result of genuine retirement . 5.0 MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS Section 5 of the Amendment Act repeals the defini- tion of superannuation scheme contained in section 64B(1) of the Act. This will allow the definition contained in section 2 of the Act to apply. Section 7 of the Amendment Act inserts a new subsection (6) into section 96 of the Act. This ensures that section 96 will not have application to transfers or settlements to or on a superannuation fund. Section 9 of the Amendment Act amends section 149 of the Act to make it clear that contributions to superannuation schemes cannot be deducted under this section (instead of section 150 of the Act). APPENDIX 1 TAXATION OF SUPERANNUATION SCHEME INVESTMENT GAIN AND LOSSES Under section 225 of the Income Tax Act 1976 super- annuation category 2 and 3 schemes have been subject to income tax on investment gains (and losses) irrespective of how they would have been treated under the normal provisions of the law. As Section 225 ceases to apply investment gains will be dealt with under the normal provisions of the In- come Tax Act. These provisions will also apply to superannuation category/schemes (which have never been subject to section 225) Provisions of the Income Tax Act which subject investment gains to income tax include the following: (a)Section 65(2)(e) - Personal property sales (b)Section 65(2)(f) - Land sales (c)Section 65(2)(jb) - Accrual income (d)Sections 65(2)(k) and (ka) - Commercial bill redemptions Investment gains may also be subject to income tax where they are made as part of the income earning process of the taxpayer. This principle has been established through a line of cases relating to banks and other financial institutions beginning with “Californian Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5TC 159”. This principle will also have application to superannuation schemes and will mean that invest- ment gains will be subject to income tax in most cases.

APPENDIX E TO TIB NO.3, SEPTEMBER 1989 EXPLANATION OF INCOME TAX AMENDMENT ACT (No.5) PART IV: THE FRINGE BENEFIT TAX AMENDMENTS CONTENTSPage Part AExtension of Fringe Benefit Tax to Major Shareholder-Employees2 Part BAmendments to Fringe Benefit Tax Provisions of the Income Tax Act3 Part CAmendments to Other Provisions of the Income Tax Act4 Part DShareholder-Employees’ Loan Accounts5 Part EMotor Vehicles7 A.EXTENSION OF FRINGE BENEFIT TAX TO MAJOR SHAREHOLDER- EMPLOYEES The fringe benefit tax amendments contained in Part IV of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 5) 1988 relate to the treatment of benefits provided to share- holders who are employed by a private company. Scope and Effect of the Amendments The Amendment Act amends the fringe benefit tax and income tax provisions of the Income Tax Act. The effect of the amendments is to extend from 1 April 1989 the application of the fringe benefit tax regime to all shareholder-employees of private companies. Therefore, where a private company provides a benefit to a shareholder-employee, that company will be subject to the provisions governing the taxation of fringe benefits contained in Part XB of the Income Tax Act. Under the legislation that existed prior to the amendments contained in this Amendment Act, the income tax and fringe benefit tax treatment of fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees was dependent upon the extent of their shareholding with the company. Those shareholder-employees who held less than 10 per cent of the shares or voting rights were treated in the same manner as those employees who held no shares at all. For those who held 10 per cent or more of the shares or voting rights (“major shareholders”), the private company was subject to the income tax “add back” adjust- ments and was not liable for fringe benefit tax in respect of benefits provided to those shareholders. Shareholders Who Are Not Employees These amendments remove the percentage of shareholding distinction in respect of benefits pro- vided to shareholders who are also employees of the company. The amendments do not affect the FBT treatment of shareholders who are not employees. It should be noted, however, that the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1989, assented to on 26 July 1989, provides for the scope of the FBT regime to be extended to include certain non-cash dividends paid to all shareholders on or after 1 October 1989. In the meantime benefits provided to such shareholders will still not be subject to FBT and will continue to be non-deductible to the company for income tax purposes. Benefits to Which the FBT legislation Applies The legislation concerning the treatment of benefits provided to employees (including shareholder- employees) applies to all benefits that come within the definition of the expression “fringe benefit” in section 336N of the Income Tax Act. Where a benefit in the form of - •the private use or enjoyment of a motor vehicle, •the availability for private use or enjoyment of a motor vehicle, •a low interest loan, •subsidised transport, •discounted goods and services, •a monetary contribution to a non-approved or overseas superannuation scheme, •a non-monetary contribution to an approved superannuation scheme, •a lump sum payment by way of bonus, gratuity, or retiring allowance, •a lump sum redundancy payment in excess of specified sum calculated in accordance with section 68, and •any other benefit is provided to a shareholder-employee, the company will be subject to FBT on the value of that benefit. To the extent that the costs incurred by a private company in providing benefits to an employee who is a “major shareholder” are subject to FBT. Such costs are no longer subject to the various income tax adjustments they were formerly subject to (refer to explanation below of amendments to relevant in- come tax provisions). When Does the new Legislation Apply? For FBT purposes the legislation applies to the quarter that commenced on 1 April 1989, in respect of which the first payment of FBT was due on 20 July 1989, and every subsequent quarter, for which FBT is due on the 20th day of the next month after the end of the quarter. Deductibility of FBT Note that the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 (enacted on 22 March 1989) amends the principal Act to provide that FBT in respect of fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1989 is tax deductible (refer to commentary on page 7 of Public Informa- tion Bulletin No. 181 of June 1989). The FBT is deductible in the income year the benefits that give rise to the FBT liability are provided. This will not necessarily be the same income year as the income year in which the FBT is paid. Therefore, in the case of a company with a late balance date (e.g. 30 June 1989) the FBT paid on 20 July 1989 in respect of fringe benefits provided in the June quarter is de- ductible in the 1989 income year. B.AMENDMENTS TO FRINGE BENEFIT TAX PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX ACT Section 51 of the Amendment Act amends various provisions of the fringe benefit tax legislation con- tained in section 336N of the Income Tax Act. The purpose of the amendments is to remove the exemp- tion from fringe benefit tax in respect of benefits provided on or after 1 April 1989 to major share- holder-employees of private companies. Prior to 1 April 1989 employees who owned 10 per cent or more of the shareholding in a company were not subject to the FBT regime. From 1 April 1989 any benefits provided by a private company to such shareholder-employees will be subject to FBT. Subsection (1)(a) of section 51 amends section 336N(1) by repealing paragraph (f) of the definition of the term “fringe benefit”. The effect of this amend- ment is to remove the exclusion of benefits provided to a “major shareholder” in a private company. Subsection 1(b) consequentially repeals the defini- tions of the terms “major shareholder” and “private company” in section 336N(1). Subsection (2) repeals subsection (2A) of section 336N. Subsection (2A) referred to the shareholding interest in a company held by a relative or nominee of the shareholder in determining the percentage of shares held by a shareholder. With the removal of the distinction between “major shareholders” and other shareholders for FBT purposes subsection (2A) is no longer necessary Subsection (3) repeals the proviso to subsection (3) of section 336N. The effect is that from 1 April 1989 a fringe benefit provided directly by an employer (or indirectly by some other person under an arrangement with the employer) to a person associated with any employee or shareholder-employee of the employer is deemed to be provided by the employer to the employee. Under the repealed proviso a fringe benefit provided directly or indirectly to a person associated with a “major shareholder” of the employer was not subject to FBT. Subsection (4) amends section 336N by repealing subsection (3A) and inserting a new subsection (3A). The amendment removes the reference to subsection (2A) (now repealed) but otherwise provides a similar treatment as previously, i.e., that benefits granted by a company to an employee who holds shares in the company are deemed to have been granted to that employee as part of the employee’s remuneration and not by reason of the employee’s shareholding Subsection (5) consequentially repeals amendment provisions of previous Amendment Acts. Subsection (6) provides that the above amendments apply in respect of benefits provided on or after 1 April 1989. Note that the application date is subject to subsection (7) (refer next paragraph). Subsection (7) provides special rules in relation to companies that - •are in the course of winding up, and •the Commissioner is satisfied that the company has paid, or will pay, the correct amount of winding up distribution tax in accordance with sections 27 to 29 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1989. In the case of such companies the amendments relating to major shareholder-employees will not apply and the company will not be subject to FBT in respect of benefits provided to major shareholder- employees between 1 April 1989 and the date of winding up or 30 September 1989, whichever date comes first. It should be noted that under section 6(3) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 the exemption provided in subsection (7) of this amendment does not apply in respect of any benefit that is an em- ployer superannuation contribution made on or after 1 April 1989 and before 1 October 1989 to a non- approved superannuation scheme. It should also be noted that where a benefit is not subject to FBT it may be taxable to the shareholder as a dividend in terms of section 4(1)(b) to (e) and (k) of the principal Act if it is provided on or before 30 September 1989. From 1 October 1989 such divi- dends will be classified as non-cash dividends and will generally be subject to FBT (refer to sections 2 and 14 of the income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989). Under subsection (8), in order for the exemption provided in subsection (7) to apply either •the liquidator of the company is required to furnish the company’s final accounts to the Registrar of Companies on or before 30 Septem- ber 1989, and •the company has to pay the correct amount of winding up distribution tax on or before 30 September 1989 (including any penalty for late payment) . If neither of these conditions are met the company will be subject to FBT in respect of any benefits provided on or after 1 April 1989 to employees who are “major shareholders”. Subsection (9) allows the Commissioner to recover from the shareholder any FBT liable to be paid by the company in accordance with subsection (8) This would apply where the company •has distributed all its funds to shareholders and not paid the correct amount of winding up distribution tax, or •has wound up and not paid the correct amount of winding up distribution tax. C.AMENDMENTS TO OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX ACT Prior to 1 April 1989 benefits provided to employees who were “major shareholders” were deemed not to be fringe benefits and were therefore not subject to FBT. The costs involved in providing such benefits were deemed to be of a private or domestic nature and were not deductible to the company. With the extension of FBT to all shareholder-employees amendments have been made to those provisions of the principal Act that allowed for the separate treatment of expenditure incurred in providing fringe benefits to a “major shareholder”. Subsection (3) of section 30 of the Amendment Act amends paragraph (d) of the definition of the term “expenditure on account of an employee” contained in section 2 of the principal Act. The effect is that where a company makes a payment on or after 1 April 1989 in respect of expenditure incurred by an employee who is a shareholder, such expenditure may be treated as “monetary remuneration” of the shareholder-employee. Therefore, where a company pays for a shareholder- employee’s private purchases via an expense account the amount paid by the company is assessable income in the hands of the employee as monetary remuneration. However, the amount paid by the company is not assessable income to the employee where the expense account is operated as a loan account, i.e., the employee is required to refund any expenditure incurred by the company in acquiring private purchases via the expense account. (Refer to the explanation relating to shareholder-employee current accounts in Part D of this commentary for the treatment where an expense account operated as a loan account runs into debit.) Section 31 redefines the term dividends in the principal Act by inserting a new section 4, which provides a comprehensive definition of the term “dividends”, and a new section 4A which provides exclusions from “dividends”. It should be noted that section 4A(1)(i) excludes from the definition of “dividends” any benefits provided to shareholders where such benefits are subject to FBT. Section 34 amends section 105A of the principal Act to also allow, from 1 April 1989, a deduction for expenditure incurred by a company in providing a benefit to any employee who is a shareholder. Previously, such expenditure was not deductible in respect of a benefit provided to a “major share- holder”. Under section 105A such expenditure is in effect deemed not to be expenditure of a private or domes- tic nature and is deductible as if it were expenditure allowable under section 104 of the Act. This removes any argument that the expenditure was not incurred in the production of the company’s assessable income because it was incurred in providing a private benefit to a shareholder. Section 35(1) amends section 106(1)(j) of the princi- pal Act. The amended paragraph (j) prohibits any deduction to the extent that the expenditure or loss is of a private or domestic nature. Therefore, from 1 April 1989, any expenditure or loss incurred in the providing of a benefit to a “major shareholder” will no longer be deemed to be expenditure or loss of a private nature. Section 36 amends section 106B(2) of the principal Act so that from 1 April 1989 the record keeping obligations in respect of motor vehicles used for both business and private purposes no longer apply to private companies where any shareholder thereof was deemed to be a “major shareholder”. In effect this does away with the requirement to maintain a log book where a company makes available a motor vehicle for the private use of a shareholder-employee as there will be no requirement to make a private use adjustment in view of the amendments to section 105A and section 106(1)(j) as described above. However, refer to Part E (Motor Vehicles) of this commentary for circumstances in which a company may nevertheless choose to maintain a log book. Section 37 amends section 108 of the principal Act to allow a deduction in respect of any repairs, mainte- nance or depreciation of any asset to the extent that the asset on which the expenditure or loss was incurred is used in providing from 1 April 1989 a benefit to an employee who is a shareholder. Prior to 1 April 1989 no such deduction was allowable where the asset was used in providing a benefit to a “major shareholder”. Section 52 amends section 374E(1) of the principal Act by inserting a definition of “major shareholder” and removing the reference to the definition of major shareholder (now repealed) in section 336N. The effect of the amendment is to continue to treat major shareholders the same as self-employed persons for the purposes of the Family Support Tax Credit and the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Tax Credit. D.SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEES’ LOAN ACCOUNTS Included in the definition of fringe benefit is any loan that is owing, by the employee, at any time during the quarter in respect of which there is a concessional rate of interest. A loan includes an advance, a deposit, money otherwise let out, and a credit given (including the forbearance of a debt), whether on current account or otherwise. Therefore, in relation to the current account of a shareholder-employee, FBT will be payable by the company where there is a debit balance in the cur- rent account (i e. current account is overdrawn) and the interest charged (if any) to the shareholder- employee is less than the interest that would be charged at the prescribed rate for the quarter in which there is a debit balance. In such a case the debit balance or amount overdrawn would represent a low-interest loan to the shareholder-employee and FBT in respect of a loan to a shareholder-employee will be calculated in the same way as for any other employee loan account. Taxation Treatment Where a shareholder-employee’s current account has a debit balance a potential liability for FBT arises. Subject to the treatment outlined in subsequent paragraphs below, in this case a company has the following alternatives: (a)charge a non-concessional interest rate on a daily basis on the current account debit balance. The interest is to be charged at the end of each quar- ter, i.e., 30 June, 30 September, 31 December and 31 March, and the amount charged is to be debited to the shareholder-employee’s current account on the first day of the next quarter; or (b)pay FBT quarterly in respect of any concessional interest calculated on a daily basis on the current account debit balance. If no interest is charged, or interest is charged at a rate below the prescribed rate for the quarter, the debit balance represents a low interest loan made to the shareholder em- ployee. In recognition of the practical difficulties faced by companies and to minimise compliance costs in maintaining current accounts on a daily basis a further amendment to the FBT provisions of the Income Tax Act has been made in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1989 enacted on 26 July 1989. The main effect of the amendment to section 336O of the principal Act is that companies will, in general, not need to maintain a daily record of current ac- counts on an ongoing basis. Section 33 of the Amendment Act (No. 2) amends section 336O to ensure that where salary or wages or other provisional income of the shareholder-employee is deter- mined after the end of an income year the amount of the salary or wages is deemed to have been credited to the current account of the shareholder-employee on the later of either: •the first day of that income year, or •the day the balance of the current account first went into debit during that income year. Therefore where the amount of salary or wages credited to the current account after the end of the income year exceeds the amount of any debit balance in that account during that income year there will be no FBT liability provided the salary or wages is taxed in the hands of the shareholder-employee as income derived in that income year. Example Assume a company with a 31 March 1990 balance date votes a salary of $50,000 to a shareholder- employee on 30 June 1990. The salary will be deemed to have been credited to the current account of the shareholder-employee on the later of: (i)the first day of the income year (i.e. 1 April 1989), or (ii)the day the balance of the current account first went into debit during the year ended 31 March 1990. In the case of a late balance date company the salary voted is included in the assessable income of the shareholder-employee in the income year to which the accounting year relates. A salary declared in August 1989 in respect of the year ended 30 June 1989 will be deemed to be credited on 1 July 1988 only if the salary is included in the shareholder-employee’s 1989 return. However, where the amount of salary or wages so credited is insufficient to offset the amount of any debit balance arising during the year the amount of the debit balance will be regarded as a low-interest loan unless interest has been charged to the share- holder-employee at the rate prescribed for any quarter during which the current account is in debit. The amount of interest charged for any quarter will be regarded as having been debited to the current account on the first day of the following quarter. Interest will be required to be charged by the com- pany on the amount of the debit balance calculated on a daily basis during the period the current account is overdrawn. It is expected that the amount of interest to be charged will be determined at year end when it is established that a current account has a debit balance during the year. Any interest charged to the shareholder-employee will be regarded as assessable income of the company. Interest is not charged in respect of a debit balance in a current account for any quarter the company will be required to pay FBT on the benefit that arises by way of concessional interest. The company will be required to furnish an FBT return or an amended FBT return, as appropriate, in respect of each quarter affected and additional tax will be charged on any FBT liability unpaid by the due date in respect of the quarter (i.e. 20th of the following month). No addi- tional time will be granted for payment of FBT beyond the original due date.

NOTE: Where the current account goes into debit in any quarter interest is calculated and charged on the first day of the following quarter. Any provisional income received by a shareholder-employee in respect of an income year is treated as having been received on the later of - •1 April in that income year, or •the day the current account first went into debit. In the above example interest has been charged at a non-concessionary rate in respect of the current account debit balances so there is no FBT liability. If no interest was charged or if interest was charged at a concessionary rate then FBT would be payable. In relation to the above example, where no interest is charged FBT would be payable as follows: June 1989 quarterNil September 1989 quarter9% of 20.55 = 10.06 December 1989 quarter49% of 47.34 = 23.19 March 1989 quarter49% of 146.74 = 71.90 E.MOTOR VEHICLES Fringe Benefit A fringe benefit arises in respect of a benefit pro- vided to employees (including shareholder-employ- ees) in the form of the private use or enjoyment of a motor vehicle or the availability of a motor vehicle for private use or enjoyment. In relation to a motor vehicle, private use or enjoy- ment includes travel by a person in the motor vehicle in the course of proceeding to or from home and also includes any other travel by a person in the motor vehicle where that travel confers on the person a benefit of a private or domestic nature. Days on which a motor vehicle is used for emergency calls or on certain extended periods of absence are not counted as days during which the vehicle is available for private use. Taxable Value Fringe benefit tax is payable on the taxable value of the benefit that arises from the private use or enjoy- ment of a motor vehicle. The taxable value is calculated having regard to the Tenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The Tenth Schedule outlines how a benefit in the form of a motor vehicle is to be valued for the purposes of fringe benefit tax. In general, where a motor vehicle is owned by the company the value of the benefit, in relation to any quarter, is 6 per cent of the cost price of the vehicle to the company. For FBT purposes the Department regards the cost price as being inclusive of GST. The Tenth Schedule also provides for the value of a benefit in the form of a motor vehicle to be deter- mined in the following circumstances: •lease or rental of a motor vehicle, in which case market value applies, •where the motor vehicle forms part of a pool of vehicles. When the cost price or market value is established, the value of the fringe benefit for the quarter is calculated in accordance with the following formula: No. of days vehicle conferred as fringe benefit x 6% of cost price 90 The resulting value is then reduced by the amount of any contributions made by the employee or share- holder-employee in relation to the quarter towards the private use of the motor vehicle. As explained in Part C of this commentary there is now no requirement to make a private use adjust- ment in respect of expenditure that constitutes a benefit for FBT purposes. However, a company is still permitted to make a private use adjustment (e.g. by way of a quarterly or year end debit to the share- holder-employee’s current account) should it choose to do so. This would be regarded as a contribution made by the shareholder-employee towards the private use of the vehicle (refer previous paragraph). Where a private use adjustment is made a log book or similar record of the amount of private use may be useful in determining the amount of the adjust- ment. There is no deduction allowable to the com- pany in respect of the amount of any private use adjustment. For the purposes of the above calculation, where a motor vehicle is used by or made available to a shareholder-employee who has a controlling interest the company it is generally to be treated as being used or made available for the full 90 days (however, refer next paragraph). In other words in a private company situation it is expected that there would normally be no restriction on such a shareholder- employee’s private use of the vehicle. However, the Department will consider on a case by case basis situations where there may be genuine restrictions on the availability of a vehicle for private use. Where it is clear that there are genuine restric- tions in relation to the availability of a vehicle for private use on any particular day, the vehicle will no be regarded as being available for private use on such day or days. Motor Vehicle Owned by Shareholder-Employee Where a motor vehicle is owned by a shareholder- employee and used for the purposes of the compa- ny’s business it is unlikely that there will be any fringe benefit tax liability. There may, however, be income tax and GST implications. A fringe benefit tax liability may arise where a vehicle is being leased or rented to the company by the shareholder-em- ployee and is available for the private use or enjoy- ment of the shareholder-employee. Income derived by a shareholder-employee by way of salary or wages is regarded as income from employment for the purposes of section 105 of the Act. From the income year commencing 1 April 1989 there is now no deduction allowable under subsec- tion (2) of that section for any expenditure to the extent it is incurred in gaining or producing income from employment. Therefore a shareholder-em- ployee is not allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in relation to a motor vehicle used tor business purposes. Where a company is making payments to a share- holder-employee in respect of a motor vehicle the question of whether the payments are: •a reimbursement of expenditure, or •lease or rental payments is relevant in determining whether the company has to pay FBT on the private use of the vehicle. This would depend on the nature of the arrangement. Reimbursement Reimbursement by the company of motor vehicle expenditure incurred by the shareholder-employee for business purposes is treated the same as reim- bursement of any other expenditure under section 73(2) of the Act. To the extent that any allowance relating to employment or service constitutes reim- bursement of expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income it is exempt from income tax in the hands of the employee. The amount of a reimbursement of expenditure is exempt from tax where •the reimbursement is based on public service mileage rates and the identified annual business running does not exceed 2,000 km, •the reimbursement is based on the amount of actual expenditure attributable to business mile- age in cases where the identified annual business running exceeds 2,000 km. For this purpose depreciation cannot be taken into account in determining the amount of actual expenditure. Where the annual business running exceeds 2,000 km, reimbursement on the basis of public service mileage rates on the first 2,000 km and on the basis of actual expenditure incurred in respect of the business running in excess of 2000 km is not acceptable for the purposes of the exemption. To the extent that the amount of the reimbursement exceeds either of the above bases, as appropriate, the amount of the excess is treated as assessable income in the hands of the shareholder-employee. A log book or similar verifiable record may be necessary to identify the amount of annual business running. There is no exemption for reimbursement of any capital expenditure relating to the motor vehicle. Lease or Rental to Company by Shareholder- Employee As mentioned above the nature of the arrangement is pertinent in determining whether a payment is a reimbursement of expenditure or a payment in respect of lease or rental. In order to be regarded as a payment for lease or rental of the motor vehicle the payment would have to be made under a lease or rental agreement. In such a case the company would be regarded as having control over the use of the vehicle and, to the extent that the vehicle is privately used or made available for private use, a liability for FBT would arise. Where the terms of the lease provide that the vehicle is being leased to the company solely for the pur- poses of the company’s business use and not in relation to the use (or available for use) by any employee for private purposes no exposure to FBT will arise. However, there may be circumstances where the arrangement is not a genuine lease ar- rangement. To be acceptable the lease would have to be a bona fide lease based on commercial terms with rental being charged at market rates and not merely a reimbursing arrangement. The rental would be assessable income of the employee who would be able to claim appropriate deductions. Any deprecia- tion recovered or loss incurred on the sale of the vehicle would be taken into account in determining the employee's assessable income. Any person entering into a lease arrangement should consider the implications of the specified lease provisions in section 222A - 222E of the principle Act. Motor Vehicle Owned Jointly by Company and Shareholder-Employee Where a motor vehicle is owned in part by the shareholder-employee as well as by the company, the taxable value of the fringe benefit is reduced by 2.5% of the cost price of the vehicle to the employee (i.e. shareholder-employee’s share of the cost price. Therefore, in addition to deducting contributions by the employee in calculating the value of the fringe benefit for a quarter, the company may deduct a further amount equal to 2.5% of the portion of the cost price of the vehicle that was borne by the share- holder-employee. There is no scope for treating the employee’s contri- bution as a loan to the company. The company would not be allowed depreciation on the full cost price of the vehicle where it is reducing the taxable value of the fringe benefit to take into account the shareholder-employee’s share of the cost price. GST Implications Sale of Motor Vehicle to Shareholder-Employee Where a company sells a motor vehicle to a share- holder-employee who supplies the vehicle to the company for business running the question arises of whether the shareholder-employee can register for GST purposes. This primarily involves two issues: •Whether the shareholder-employee is employed (see 1 below), •Under a contract of service (see 1 below), or •Under a contract for service, (see 1 below). •Whether a shareholder-employee can register in respect of an activity of leasing a motor vehicle to the company (see 2 below). (1)How shareholder-employee is employed Whether a shareholder-employee is employed under a contract of service or a contract for service de- pends on the circumstances of each case. Generally a shareholder-employee would be employed under a contract of service and is therefore not carrying on a taxable activity. (a)Contract of service Where a shareholder-employee is required as a condition of the contract of service (employment) to provide a motor vehicle and is reimbursed by the company for the business proportion of running costs, the supply of the motor vehicle is an extension of the contract of employment In such a case, as the shareholder-employee is not carrying on a taxable activity, that person cannot register for GST pur- poses. This is the same treatment which is afforded to other arm’s length employees. Where a company is reimbursing an employee for the business running costs of a motor vehicle, the question of whether the company may claim input tax credits in respect of those running costs is cur- rently under consideration by the Department and will be the subject of a subsequent information bulletin. (b)Contract for service If the shareholder-employee is employed under a contract for service that person may register for GST in the same manner as any other sole trader and claim input tax credits. A supply of a motor vehicle, as a condition of the contract for services, to the company is an extension of that taxable activity. (2)Activity of leasing a motor vehicle A shareholder-employee who is employed under a contract of service may register for GST in respect of an activity of leasing a motor vehicle to the company providing the leasing arrangement does not consti- tute an avoidance arrangement and the taxable activity test is met. The shareholder-employee would be able to claim an input tax credit in respect of the purchase of the motor vehicle. The shareholder-employee’s ability to claim input tax credits in respect of running costs and maintenance of the vehicle will depend on the terms of the lease. Most commercial leases provide for the lessee (company) to meet such costs. As mentioned earlier in Part E of this commentary, it should be noted that an FBT liability may arise in a rental or lease situation as the shareholder-employee has a motor vehicle that “is available for private use”.
1 GST - MEANING OF PAYMENT SUMMARY This item clarifies what is a payment for the pur- poses of section 20(3)(a)(ia) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. BACKGROUND Subsection (2) of section 6 of the Goods and Serv- ices Tax Amendment Act 1989 inserted a new subparagraph (ia) into section 20(3)(a) of the princi- pal Act. From 22 March 1989 an input tax credit in respect of secondhand goods is only allowable to the extent that a payment has been made. The word payment is not defined in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This item discusses what the Department will accept as a payment. RULING Where the parties are at arm’s length it is not ex- pected that there will be any problem in determin- ing whether payment has in fact been made. How- ever with associated persons it is expected that “payment” will frequently be by a credit entry to an account for the shareholder, partner, etc. within the purchaser’s books of account. The mere crediting of such an account is not ac- cepted as a payment as this simply acknowledges the debt. To be treated as a payment the amount credited must be applied in some way to the ven- dor’s benefit. This would occur if the credit was offset against an amount(s) owing by the vendor or if moneys expended on behalf of the vendor are debited against the credit but only to the extent so applied. The purchaser is not entitled to an input tax credit until such time as the moneys credited are applied to the vendor’s benefit. Reference:HO. GST.S.2.1 GST Manual Paragraph 3.2.9 BACKGROUND The question has been raised as to whether compa- nies who are considering winding up have the option of either distributing dividends and paying the WUDT \[Winding up Distribution Tax\] or pay- ing dividends with imputation credits attached. Instances occur where, if a company was to pay the WUDT, it would be at a disadvantage “relative” to a company in a similar situation which declares dividends with imputation credits attached. If a company declares a taxable dividend to a share- holder in the 1990 year where the taxpayer’s maxi- mum tax rate is 33 per cent, that shareholder will be better off than if the dividend had been paid tax free after payment of winding up distribution tax. Similarly, if the shareholder in receipt of the divi- dend is able to absorb any tax assessability due to accumulated losses, the company is penalized by payment of the WUDT. RULING Section 28\[2\]\[b\] of the Income Tax Amendment Act No.3 1988 provides companies with an exemption from WUDT if the dividends in question have been included in the assessable income of the sharehold- ers. Therefore provided the dividends are assess- able income in the hands of the shareholders, winding up distribution tax is not payable by the company concerned. Reference:HO. 10.W.2.2. WINDING UP DISTRIBUTION TAX SUMMARY This item states that in the course of winding up companies may choose to distribute: (a)By dividend with imputation credits attached; or (b)Subject to winding up distribution tax. RECOVERY OF INTEREST SUMMARY This item states that the recovery of interest provi- sions under section 129 of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply to all dispositions of land where that land has been used in the production of assessable income. BACKGROUND Section 129 of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides that where land which has been used in the pro- duction of assessable income is sold within 10 years of purchase and a deduction for interest has been allowed in respect of that land, any excess of sale price over purchase and other costs, including interest, is deemed assessable income up to the amount of that interest. Technical Rulings chapter 11, part 1, paragraph 23 indicates that due to the exemption from the section of farmland sold after 12 December 1985, section 129 effectively applies only to rental ventures This is incorrect. 2 RULING The recovery provisions apply to all land disposals, unless specifically exempted by the section, where the land has been used in the production of assess- able income and interest has been allowed as a deduction. Reference: HO. 1O.S.2.2. GST - IN SPECIE DISTRIBUTIONS SUMMARY This item deals with the GST implications of in specie distributions. In each case the Department’s position is that an in specie distribution is a supply of goods for GST purposes and that there is no consideration given by the shareholder in return for the goods. BACKGROUND The Department has been asked to clarify the situation when an in specie distribution is made on the winding up of a company. An in specie distribution may be made by a com- pany that is not registered for GST purposes (and has never had a liability to be registered) or by a company that is (or was) registered for GST pur- poses either before or after its registration is can- celled. Each situation is dealt with below. In each case the Department’s position is that an in specie distribution is a supply of goods for GST purposes and that there is no consideration given by the shareholder in return for the goods. All references in this circular are to the Goods and Services Act 1985. In Specie Distribution by Company After GST Deregistration Any goods forming part of the assets on hand at the time of deregistration are deemed by section 5(3) to be supplied in the course of the taxable activity. The supply is valued in terms of section 10(8). The value is deemed to be the lesser of the cost of the goods including any GST, or their open market value. Any subsequent supply by the company by way of in specie distribution does not have any GST impli- cations for the company or the recipient. If the recipient is registered for GST purposes and the goods will be used in that person’s taxable activity the recipient is unable to claim an input tax credit for those goods. The goods have not been acquired from a registered person, therefore the provisions of paragraph (c) of the definition of “Input Tax” in section 2 must be met if a second- hand goods input tax credit is to be allowed. The amendment to this definition in the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1989 requires there to be a supply by way of sale, and an in specie distri- bution is not a sale. Prior to the amendment, the proviso to the definition of “Input Tax” would have excluded a claim as there would not have been a purchase price, therefore the lesser of the two values would be Nil. In Specie Distribution by Company Before GST Deregistration The supply from the company to the shareholder is a supply to an associated person (this is a result of the trustee relationship that arises once the com- pany is in liquidation, and the effect of the “associ- ated persons” definition in section 2 of the Act). Therefore, if the recipient is not a registered person and the goods are to be used in that person’s tax- able activity, the supply will be valued in terms of section 10(3), i.e., the supply is valued at the open market value of the goods. This will determine the company's output tax liability. When the supplier and recipient are registered persons and the goods are to be used in that recipi- ent’s taxable activity, and were a taxable supply, the provisions of section 10(3A) apply The supply is valued at the consideration given (section 10(2)). In the case of an in specie distribution the considera- tion given by the shareholder is Nil so the supply has Nil value. The output tax liability and input tax deduction are Nil. As the supply is a taxable supply it cannot come within paragraph (c) of the defini- tion of “input tax”. In Specie Distribution by Company not Registered for GST (and not any time liable to be registered for GST purposes) There are no GST implications for either party. If the recipient is registered for GST purposes, a secondhand goods input tax credit is not available for the reasons stated above. Reference:HO. GST S.7.1 DEPARTMENT’S NEW CORPORATE PLAN NOW AVAILABLE The Department’s Corporate Plan for the 15 months 1 April 1989 to 30 June 1990 represents a fundamen- tal departure from the previous Corporate Plans produced by the Department. For the first time the Plan reflects the totality of Inland Revenue’s pur- pose, functions and operations and is centered on 3 the division of the whole Department into 5 pro- grammes These are: •Legislation •Taxpayer Services •Revenue Assessment and Collection •Income Maintenance •Taxpayer Audit The new Plan sets the direction of the Department over the next 3 years and aims to give taxpayers and Government a clear view of where Tax Man- agement is heading. Copies of the Plan are available to the Public at a cost of $7.50 including GST by applying to the: Corporate Planning Officer, Head Office, Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, WELLINGTON that our computer records may be updated. Inland Revenue Department Non Resident Centre Private Bag Dunedin Payment of NRWT should also be sent to this address together with the appropriate forms IR 267 and IR 202. RETURNS FOR NON-RESIDENTS SUMMARY The non resident centre in Dunedin are receiving a large number of returns on behalf of non residents who are not required to furnish returns. BACKGROUND Section 310 of the Income Tax Act defines Non Resident Withholding Income as dividends, interest or royalties which arc subject to Non Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) pursuant to Section 311. Providing NRWT is correctly deducted and ac- counted for by the payer (or agent), that tax is generally a final tax and the income need not be included in the assessable income of the recipient. There are odd exceptions such As when the tax- payer is operating a business through a fixed establishment in NZ. COMMENTS In order to avoid the need to file returns where the income is solely Non Resident Withholding In- come, financial institutions should be advised of your client’s overseas address. They will arrange for the deduction of NRWT at source which will also ensure that the new domestic PAYE is not deducted.

An example of this is the use of the owner’s or lessee’s kitchen for the preparation of meals for guests or the use of other areas for enter- tainment or storage. The entire area of the motel set aside but not necessarily exclu- sively used by the owner or lessee should form (a) of the formula. It is expected that the formula will be appropriate in most situations but where its use gives an unrealis- tic result the matter should be discussed with the taxpayer’s local Inland Revenue Office. The above formula can be used as from the year ended 31 March 1989 (i.e. the 1989 income year and future years.) Reference:HO. 10.A.8.4 Technical Rulings. Chapter 19 Part 1, 15.1. COST OF DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENT SUMMARY In this item we outline a formula that can be used to adjust business expenditure for the proprietor’s private use of accommodation attached to a busi- ness. This adjustment is often referred to as the “cost of domestic establishment” and is particularly relevant to self employed taxpayers in the motel, hotel, boarding house and similar industries. BACKGROUND Section 106(1)(j) of the Income Tax Act 1976 prohib- its taxpayers from claiming a deduction for ex- penditure that is of a private or domestic nature. In industries such as privately owned or leased mo- tels, hotels, etc., the owner or lessee is required to make adjustments to the deductible expenditure of the business for the proprietor’s private or domestic use of the business premises, and/or services. In Public Information Bulletin No. 175 we said that the adjustments should be made on a factual basis. Recent representations from industry sources sought a more formalised basis for calculating the “cost of domestic establishment”. RULING The following formula was arrived at as a practical method of calculating the adjustment. This formula is particularly relevant to the motel industry, but can be adopted by other businesses where an adjustment is required. The formula is: a x c x 50% b where: a =Area of the motel complex designated as the owner’s quarters. b =The total area of the motel complex. c =Total expenditure on: INCOME EQUALISATION RESERVE SCHEME - INTEREST PAYE Depositors in the Income Equalisation Reserve Scheme should be aware that deposits withdrawn from the scheme after 1 October 1989 will be liable to deductions of Interest PAYE on the total interest paid.

1 QUESTIONNAIRE As we want to know what our readers think about our Tax Information Bulletin we have included a questionnaire with this issue. We would like all readers to complete the Questionnaire and return to us before 8 December 1989. (b)Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal; or (c)Livestock: \[(c) is effective from 22 March 1989\] With the exception of these specific exclusions “Secondhand goods”, takes its commonly understood meaning. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines “secondhand” as: “Not original or obtained from the original source; borrowed. Not new, having been previously worn or used by another.” It is on this concept of used or not new or obtained from the original source that the Department has based its policy. While it is not intended that the following be an exhaustive list of the goods that the Department does not accept as secondhand, it is intended as a guide. All animals, including progeny (Livestock includes domestic animals generally and any animals kept or dealt in for use or profit). Primary produce produced by a farmer, e.g., wool, meat, milk. Any goods which have been manufactured that are being supplied for the first time. Trading stock that consists of any of the above. Reference:GST - Secondhand goods GST Manual 1.1.4 GST Manual 3.2.9 TAXATION OF TRUSTS The legislation governing the income taxation treat- ment of trusts was substantially revised by part II of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 5) 1988. The new trust regime applied from the beginning of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988. The Appendix to this TIB provides an explanation of the new trust taxation legislation. Part 2 of the Appen- dix contains a general overview of the legislation, highlighting the main features. Parts 3 to 15 of the Appendix contain a detailed explanation of the legislation. GST - SECONDHAND GOODS SUMMARY This item clarifies what the Department considers to be secondhand goods for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. BACKGROUND The Department has published three rulings in respect of secondhand goods since the definition of “second- hand goods” was amended by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988. These were contained in Public Information Bulletin No 174 (following the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988), Public Information Bulletin 181 (following a subse- quent amendment contained in the Goods and Serv- ices Tax Amendment Act 1989) and Taxation Informa- tion Bulletin No 1 (which was issued to clarify the Department’s position, particularly with regard to wool). Unfortunately the item in Taxation Bulletin No.1 did not take into account the 1989 amendment which specifically included “Livestock” as an exclu- sion from “Secondhand goods”. The Department’s policy on secondhand goods is therefore restated in full. RULING Effective from 24 March 1988 “Secondhand goods” is defined as: “Secondhand goods”, does not include - (a)Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or GST - GOING CONCERNS SUMMARY This item provides further guidelines on what is a going concern for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act). BACKGROUND As a result of the Goods and Services Tax Legislative Audit the Department undertook to restate its inter- pretation of what is a going concern and to provide explicit examples of what may constitute a going concern. Section 11(1)(c) of the Act zero rates the supply to a registered person of any taxable activity (or part of a taxable activity where that part is capable of separate operation) that is a going concern. 2 Whether or not the taxable activity being supplied is a going concern is a question of fact. If it is the supply must be charged with tax at zero percent. Both the vendor’s and the purchaser’s GST liability will be established by this question of fact and not by how either or both parties to the transaction have treated it. However it is suggested that both parties reach agreement on whether the transaction is GST inclusive or exclusive and if it is GST inclusive whether in their opinion the supply was of a taxable activity as a going concern RULING A going concern should have the following character- istics: (i)The taxable activity should be capable of being carried on without interruption after the transfer from the supplier to the recipient. It is not necessary that the recipient of the supply continue the same taxable activity or any taxable activity but there must be a capacity to continue. NB In an English case \[C&E COMRS v Prem Narayan Rakshit (LON/87/716)\] it was held that the purchaser’s intention was irrelevant. (ii)There should be an express supply of good- will. A business contains an element of good- will and is not just a number of assets. The goodwill of a trade or business comprises every advantage which has been acquired by carrying on the business whether connected with premises in which the business activity has been carried on or with the name of the firm by whom it has been conducted. NB It is often not possible for this factor to be supplied concurrently with a farming activity as the value in such cases is in the livestock and the ability of the farmer to farm, not in the assets such as the land and buildings associ- ated with the farm. (iii)There should be a supply of all assets that are central to the business both of a tangible and intangible nature. The supply of a number of assets will not in itself constitute the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES All supplies are between registered persons COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS (a)The supply of a commercial building is ac- cepted as the supply of a going concern where the supplier had been letting it and 80% or more of the building continues to be tenanted at the time of supply. In establishing whether the 80% test is met the rentable floor area should be used. However the question of whether a building is supplied as a going concern is a question of fact - the 80% rule is no more than a guideline that must be applied with discretion. (b)A company constructs a commercial building and as part of the sale and purchase agreement contracts to arrange tenants for the building. This would NOT be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. FARMS (a)An established kiwifruit orchard is sold, at the end of the season after all fruit has been sold, complete with all the equipment used for spraying, harvesting, etc. This would be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. (b)A dairy farmer sells his or her farm with all plant previously used on the farm but retains the herd to take to a new farm. This would NOT be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. (c)A farm is sold at auction with the livestock, plant and machinery being sold separately from the land and buildings to various purchasers. This would NOT be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. (d)A husband and wife partnership supply their sheep farm to a trust set up for the benefit of their children. The farm is supplied “lock, stock and barrel” with the husband and wife not retaining any of the assets of the taxable activ- ity. This would be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. MANUFACTURERS (a)A company operates two factories. One is used for manufacturing children’s clothing the other manufactures plastic goods. The company sells the latter. The purchaser acquires all the plant, equipment, supply contracts and the premises. This is the supply of part of a taxable activity that is capable of separate operation and is therefore a going concern. (b)A company sells all the assets used in a taxable activity with the exception of the building from which the taxable activity was conducted. This would not be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern.

GST Z.1.6 GST Manual Paragraph 1.7.6.(2) 3 WATERFRONT INDUSTRY RESTRUC- TURING ACT 1989 - MISCELLANEOUS LEGISLATION The Waterfront Industry Restructuring Act 1989 was assented to on 11 September 1989. This Act establishes the Waterfront Industry Restruc- turing Authority with power to make payments to employers who have obligations to pay redundancy to waterside workers, as part of the port reform pro- gramme. Section 13 of the Waterfront Industry Restructuring Act 1989 (Referred to as the “Act”) provides that the Authority is exempt from income tax. To fund the payments to be made by the Waterfront Industry Restructuring Authority, levies are imposed under the Act on: \*port company shares (or the proceeds of dis- posal of those shares); and \*port related commercial undertakings held by the local authorities; and \*harbour board land. In terms of section 32 of the Act, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976, the levies imposed on the port company shares and the port related commercial undertakings are not deductible against the assessable income derived. Section 39 of the Act provides that where the net income derived from any harbour board land is assessable income to a person under the Income Tax Act 1976, that income is to be reduced by any levy paid by that person under the Waterfront Industry Restructuring Act, in that year in relation to that harbour board land. Under section 20 of the Act, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976, the payments of assistance made by the Waterfront Industry Restructuring Authority to the employers will be deemed to be assessable income of the employer in the year in which the payments are made. of late objections where decisions of the Courts or a Taxation Review Authority result in a change in the interpretation of the Law. The amended policy is necessary as a result of the Department’s decision not to appeal the High Court decision of Gisborne Mills Limited and others v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (unreported deci- sion of the High Court, Auckland Registry, M531/87, 8 June 1989, Robertson J) and the Commissioner’s decision to exercise his discretion to allow late objec- tions and issue amended assessments in favour of the taxpayers in that case. The Department’s Policy in the Light of Gisborne Mills The effect of the Gisborne Mills decision is that the Department’s general policy (that it will not apply decisions of the Courts or TRA which result in a change to the interpretation of the law as previously understood retrospectively unless there is a live objection) still applies but is subject to the proviso that each case has to be considered, in terms of sections 23 and 30(2) as appropriate, to see whether it would be unfair for the Commissioner to decline to reopen the assessment or allow a late objection. This change in policy reflects the principle in British Oxygen Ltd v Board of Trade \[1971\] AC 610 that while it is appropriate for the Commissioner to follow a stated policy he is required in law to always be willing to listen to a new submission and to be ready and willing to depart from the policy in an appropri- ate case. Administrative Aspects of the revised policy This amended policy replaces all earlier policy state- ments concerning the retrospective application of Court decisions where there is no live objection, including the parts of PIB 123 in respect of this matter. The Commissioner has decided that at this stage the delegation to exercise discretions under sections 23 and 30 (2), in cases where action has been recom- mended or requested as a result of a recent Court decision, will lie with Regional Controllers. AMENDED POLICY IN THE LIGHT OF THE GISBORNE MILLS DECISION: REOPENING OF ASSESSMENTS OR ACCEPTANCE OF LATE OBJECTIONS WHERE DECISIONS FOR THE COURTS OR A TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE INTER- PRETATION OF THE LAW.

FACTS In this case a private company (the objector) sought to have the losses of another company set off against its assessable income. The objector entered into an agreement to temporarily purchase shares in a loss company, so as to satisfy the grouping requirements of section 191, and to enable the losses to be deducted from the objector’s assessable income. An agreement was signed between the objector (as purchaser), RSC, and D Nominees Ltd (as vendors), for the sale and purchase of the ordinary shares in the company. The agreement had a clause (Clause 6) which prevented the objector from selling the shares in the loss company without the consent of the ven- dors, and required the objector to transfer the shares to the vendors, between three and ten years after the date of the agreement. This clause was removed at a later date by an amending agreement. The Commissioner in disregarding the alteration of the shareholding, thus disallowing a deduction for the losses, contended that the transfer was of a temporary nature and, had the effect of altering the incidence of income tax, therefore should be disallowed under section 191(1)(c)(i) DECISION Barber DJ, in confirming the assessment, stated that he did not accept that, “... there was nothing tempo- rary regarding the shareholding ...”, and that Clause 6 of the agreement spoke for itself. COMMENT It should be noted that in the context of this case, Barber DJ considered that a period of three to ten years qualified as “of a temporary nature” under section 191(1)(c)(i). Reference:HO. 10.C.10.7 Technical Rulings Chapter 5 Pt 26 Paragraph (2)(d) TRA DECISION - CASE L86 (1989)11 NZTC 1,492 OR TRNZ CASE 56 - WHETHER A SECONDARY VEHICLE AVAILABLE ON A LIMITED BASIS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN CALCULA- TION OF FRINGE BENEFIT VALUE - TENTH SCHEDULE. FACTS This case concerns the correct method of calculating Fringe Benefit Tax where a secondary vehicle is available to the employee on limited occasions. The objector was a bank which provided a car of a good standard to each of its nine senior executives. A further, cheaper car was purchased for use by all of the bank’s staff for bank business, and for private use by the nine executives The bank in calculating the fringe benefit value pro- vided to the nine executives took the value of each executive’s car and added it to the value of cheaper car and then divided by two to arrive at the value from which the fringe benefit calculation was done. The objector cited paragraph (e) of the Tenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976 as their authority for this basis of calculation. 5 The Commissioner assessed the objector on the basis of 6 percent on the cost price of the motor vehicle of good standard allotted to each of the nine executives in terms of paragraph (a) of the Tenth Schedule to the Act. DECISION Barber D J, in deciding for the Commissioner, decided that the cheaper motor vehicle was not available to each of the executives individually, and as such did not fall within the scope of paragraph (e) of the Tenth Schedule. COMMENT The subsequent amendment of the Tenth Schedule, which took effect from the quarter commencing 1 January 1989, means that the Commissioner’s stance in this case has been confirmed by legislation, though not retrospectively. This case is being appealed by the taxpayer. Reference:HO. 10.F.l5.1 FBT Manual Part VII Paragraph 4 apply to Inland Revenue for a special exemption certificate which can he then given to the bank or institution paying the interest. “We have issued more than 63,000 exemption certifi- cates in the few weeks since the law was passed,” the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, said today. “I am concerned that some organisations may not yet have applied for their exemption certificates or the exemption certificates may still be in the process of reaching them. If this applies then either the payer of the interest will refund the tax deducted or Inland Revenue will refund it depending on whether the tax has been paid over to Inland Revenue,” Mr Henry said. Organisations which are exempt from the withholding tax and have not yet applied for a certificate of ex- emption should do so immediately.
