NZ Government Procurement is based on principles, rules and good practice guidance. Collectively, these provide a broad framework that supports accountability for spending, sound business practice and value for money. Driving Principles – ICT Strategy and Action Plan to 2017 •Support end-to-end business processes rather than stopping at agency boundaries •Use transparent and contestable sourcing models •Adopt ‘as-a-service’ models and only invest in assets that support unique agency functions •Assemble and integrate solutions rather than build bespoke solutions •Use ICT common capabilities and re-u se existing functionality •Use open standards and industry-standard platforms. Inputs to the Sourcing Strategy -In developing the sourcing strategy for the COTS application suite of software, the following principles have been incorporated Errors and omissions excepted 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Alignment to ICT Strategy and Action Plan to 2017 ICT DirectionIR ConsiderationProsCons Support end-to-end business processes rather than stopping at agency boundaries IR active works with other agencies across product lines such as student loans and child support (Ministries of Social Development and Education) •Closer workingrelationships across business processes allow for greater collaboration and optimisation which drive a better experience for the customer. •Differentagencies can have different drivers which may not align to those of IR and its Business Transformation programme Use transparent and contestable sourcing models •IRapproved sourcing process is a multi-step process covering an Expression of Interest and using a predefined evaluation process to shortlist down to those participants who will be invited to the RFP stage. •This approach aligns to the Government Rules of Sourcing. •Complieswith Government Rules of Sourcing and various acts •IR must disclose a reasonable amount of sensitive information for anysupplier who wants to participate in a sourcing process to be able determine their own suitability to meet the requirements. Adopt ‘as-a-service’ models and only invest in assets that support unique agency functions •Inland Revenue’s core tax and social policy requirements are unique compared with other agencies. •The ease of which information can be shared with other agencies will need to be evaluated •Software-a-as -Service (SaaS) will be tested as part of the EOI process. •SaaS will be an option considered as part of the pricing evaluation of RFP. •It’s not clear from IR’s current analysis of the market that any of the leading COTS providers sell their product(s) via SaaS. •IR have had no detailed exposure to the AOG Software Acquisition Strategy so that detailed requirements can be produced. Assemble and integrate solutions rather than build bespoke solutions For each implementation reference identified the supplier will be asked to confirm that the final solution will meet the following (example) criteria: •At least ~85% of the installed functionality must have been delivered via standard features, with minimum and/or moderate amounts of configuration. •At least ~95% of the installed functionality must have been delivered via standard features, with minimum and/or moderate amounts of configuration, and with minimum and/or moderate amounts of customisation, where such customisation is non- intrusive, ie, will be fully compatible with upgrades. •No more than ~5% of installed functionality must have been delivered via non-standard or complex customisation, and/or product enhancements . Application suite of software must be able to be configured to integrate with other applications suites of software •Thedefinition used in the Consideration will help IR to determine the level of integration required. •This definition will have the most relevance at the RFP stage when the detailed requirements can be provided to participants and responses assessed. •The level of business change impact may be higher with an “off the shelf” solution. Although this will vary depending on the level of fit of the COTS solution to IR requirements and NZ tax requirements. Use ICT common capabilities and re-use existing functionality Commoncapabilities must be fit for purpose •IR will assess common capabilities •Inland Revenue will be authoritative source of information on income •IR will not break a fullyintegrated application to take up common capabilities. Use open standards and industry-standard platforms. The ease of which information can be shared with other agencies will need to be evaluated •IR has a varied technology infrastructure which is capable of support most industry standards Errors and omissions excepted 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Background The Design Phase plan assumes the following sequence of events for the Design Phase of the programme : •That a Design partner would be selected for the Design Phase, ie, following the Competitive Dialogue phase completed in April, 2014, and the RFP phase scheduled for completion by October, 2014. •That the Design Phase would incorporate three phases, as follows : D1: T he development of a High Level Design for Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, suitable for the selection of the COTS Core Solution Application Suite of Software. COTS Selection : T he selection of the COTS Core Solution Application Suite of Software, ie, via a structured multi-stage EOI then RFP process. D2: T he completion of the High Level Design for Stages 2, 3 and 4, and a Detailed Design for Stage 1, based on the selected COTS Core Solution Application Suite of Software. It is planned that the provider of the COTS Core Solution Application Suite of Software would participate in this phase of the Design process. This plan summarises the plan for activities that are required to prepare for the selection of the COTS supplier for the coreTax and Social Policy components of the Programme, as well as the high level plan for the Design Phase. It is anticipated that the time line for the D2 component of the Design process will require re-planning once the COTS supplier(s) have been selected. Any non-core COTS gaps in functionality will be identified during the selection process and additional procurements will be established to select any additional technology to support business functions. A separate procurement has already been established to establish an integration (data arbitration) layer between the legacy environment and new COTS worlds. This procurement for Foundation activity is being covered by the foundation work stream which is outside the scope of this strategy.

The application suite of software must be able to be configured to integrate with other applications suites of software. •Targets an application suite of software that align to the principles of COTS. •Threshold would remove application builders from being able to bid. •Considerfor use in the RFP as more information can be made available to participants. •In the event that IR internal business process is ‘unchangeable’ then this limit might be arbitrary and this wont be known until IR are well into the deployment of the software. On that basis it may not be fair to have this at the EOI stage. •The level of information required for a potential supplier to inform themselves is extremely high •Installed functionally would need to be defined and referenced. •Difficult for IR or the Participant to assess at the EOI stage without a detailed explanation of requirements.

Regarding both of these elements the social policy functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following: collection and/or disbursement of funds; complex multi-party relationships; facilitated payments; and income related benefits to enable Inland Revenue to deliver the social policy services described in section 6.1 (Inland Revenue at a glance). In a New Zealand context, social policy products include: Family and work related benefits (Working for families); Paid parental leave; Child support (facilitated payment); Superannuation facilitated payment (Kiwisaver); Student Loans (or similar); or Savings such as environmental restoration account. •Set a threshold that represents a high proportion of IRD effort (as high as 50% of the workload). •Allows participants to only ‘demonstrate functionality’ rather than have it site references. This mitigates the low likelihood that a participant has a solution to match New Zealand exact legislation. •No other tax and revenue authority has the same type of social policy disbursements as New Zealand and therefore the likelihood of someone having a solution to meet our requirements may be limited. Errors and omissions excepted 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •A “Fully Integrated Solution” will mean that all data and business processes that will be required will reside within one system, and be accessible by all modules within the system, without the need to develop any specific integration custom code to convert or interface such data and/or business processes. •“COTS” will mean a “Commercially Off The Shelf” Application Suite of Software, that will contain all of the essential software for the specified functions, and which will allow key functionality to be enabled and/or suppressed via configuration, with flexibility to augment such configuration via routines that can be customised as “add-ons”. All configurations and customisations must be non-intrusive, ie, will be fully compatible with system version upgrades. •“Pre-Configured” will mean that solutions within the COTS Application Suite of Software will be pre-configured and/or have customised routines, supported by the required master and transactional data, to allow the majority of the proposed business processes to be demonstrated via a fully functional demonstration system. The pre-configured scenarios will be based on industry best practice. •“Core” are software packages that automate parts or all the transactional processes that a government revenue agency typically handles: •Party relationship management: This includes multichannel interaction management, correspondence management, contact management, marketing and education; •Revenue and disbursement management: This includes taxpayer identification, return intake, return processing, taxpayer accounting, billing and collection, and revenue accounting; •Case management (incl. Analytics): This includes both generic case management capabilities, such as creating, updating, cancelling, holding, reactivating, approving, closing and auditing cases, as well as specific types of cases, such as collection, audit, delinquency and bankruptcy. •“Configuration” is undertaken by changing dip-switch settings, interface settings, jumper settings, hardware drivers, software options, etc.. Configuration determines what the system will do and how its parts will interact. •“Customisation” is undertaken using changes to programming code that changes the nature of how the components of the solution interact. This may include core code modifications, specifically defined “coding exits”, interfaces, custom reports etc. •A “facilitated payment” is a payment received from a 3rd party, and passed on to an unrelated 3rd party. Inland Revenue acts as the facilitator of this payment. It is essentially a combination of a collection and a disbursement managed by Inland Revenue. Minimum Threshold definitions Errors and omissions excepted 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The percentage of customisationin an application should be measured by the costs of the customisation compared to the other costs of owning the application. •Customisation costs during the initial implementation are only a fraction of the overall cost of customisation. On ce customisation has been started, it becomes addictive and more customisation will follow. The downstream impact is on supportability and cost to upgrade which can become prohibitive. •First, it is necessary to re cognisethat most COTS applications require a range of configuration techniques, many of which cannot be characterisedas "customisation.“ •Secondly, it is necessary to recognisethat for certain classes of application — especially large, mission-critical systems — some degree of real customisation is likely to be necessary (see "Manage ERP customisations, Don't Avoid Them"). •In order to understand how much time and effort the customisation will represent, the starting point is to have a s imple mechanism for measuring the fit of an application. •During application selection, project teams should establish the likely initial costs for customisation and then show the impact of those initial costs in all subsequent years. The COTS fit-gap analysis, which will be completed as part of the evaluation will achieve the following: •Ensure that the requirements are correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent , ranked for importance, testable and trac eable; •Determine all gaps between the capabilities provided by the COTS components and our requirements as detailed in the R TM.

Under IR’s proposed service aggregation model the role of the Solution Integrator (SI) will be required to ensure end-to-end integration of a multi solution. The SI will be required to warrant the solution that they have accountability for integrating. To enable this accountability the SI will have a lead role in the selection of the COTS provider(s). Having the same SI performing the services from the commencement of the programme can mitigate some of the grey area that will exist between business processes and the underlying technology that enable business continuity.

Decisions on how to accomplish this (ie, resources, budgets,etc.) are left to the service provider. •IR can specify the outputs required •Service provider have the flexibility to provide innovative solutions to deliver the agreed outputs •Leverages the service provider’s knowledge and experience •Creates clear allocation of roles and responsibilities between IR and the service provider •Requires significant upfront effort from IR to determine and understand requirements •IR and the service provider must proactively seek to remove as many barriers and constraints as possible to enable the service provider to successfully deliver the agreed outputs •A strong governance structure and process is a necessity for success Outcome Based Outcome based deliverables specify targets aligned with policy, strategic objectives and or organisation growth targets. There is an implicit assumption that standard task output objectives will be fully met, and the focus has moved to IR’s more strategic issues. Thisis key to triggering payment for licensing at the time IR is ready to consume the license. •Focuses on policy outcomes , strategic objectives and growth targets ie, high level benefits and outcomes associated with the Programme •IR compensates service provider primarily on achievement of specified outcomes •IR and the service provider share delivery risk •Costs associated with transfer of delivery risk to the service provider •May result in IR having less control over the Programme •Reliance on clearly defined and well understood outcomes Errors and omissions excepted 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Commercial Approach - Performance Management Performance management is an essential consideration in the procurement as it provides a means to measure and monitor whether the selected Supplier is achieving the requirements it was engaged to meet, eg, •Defining all deliverables for which the supplier is (to be) contracted •Determining the factors by which each deliverable will be measured •Establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) for each deliverable •Determining whether the KPIs are SMART (appropriate and up-to-date ) •Determining how the measures will be monitored and the frequency of measurement S pecific performance measures are mapped against IR’s key result area framework, and must align with the following investment objectives: 39 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] PricingDetail Consider/ Recommend?

There are no variations allowed under this model (ie, to account for inflation) •Can be applied to the agreed deliverables provided that the details provided to the supplier in the Procurement process are sufficiently detailed for them to price this accurately. •The supplier includes a ‘risk premium’ in their pricing, increasing the overall cost to IR or that the supplier carries the commercial risk entirely, which is not consistent with the ‘collaborative’ approach IR wants to adopt. Lump Sum - Fixed Price Variable The supplier is paid a fixed price in the contract however variations are included. This may be the provision for agreed options or variations such as inflation. •Can be applied to the defined deliverables in scope. Defining and agreeing pricing options upfront for scope changes/amendments also gives IR and the supplier commercial certainty. •This model requires a level of trust that pushes this relationship into the Partnership status, it was noted at the Investment Board on March 2013 that IR is seeking a Collaborative relationship. Management Fee Actual work paid for and a management fee on top. The management fee may be a fixed amount or a percentage of costs. •Can be applied to the requirements in scopelike unit rate. •The advantage of this method is that the profit margin can be negotiated. •This pricing method does not drive resource effectiveness and delivery as profit is % of costs incurred. Success Fee The supplier is paid for their costs and their additional compensation is an agreed percentage of the delivered BT Programme benefits. •Can be applied to the entire scope of the strategic ‘integration’ provided that the supplier has end-to-end responsibility for delivery (ie, not design only). This pricing method drives focused, fast delivery with effective use of resources. •Not commonly used in New Zealand IT industry •Requires mature benefits case Time and Materials/Fixed – (Hybrid) Agreed rate for work however the quantity is not specified. Some deliverablescould be fixed price based upon risk/certainty to IR. •Can be applied to the Requirements, in particular if the supplier deems insufficient Requirement details have been shared for them to provide any fixed pricing proposals. •This pricing method requires IR to maintain a high degree of management over the competency of the resources. Commercial Approach –Pricing (Services Options) The pricing method determines the way that the selected suppliers will be paid for the work they perform: 40 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] PricingDetailConsider Software as a Service (Opex) A software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and can be centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on- demand” software •Unlike traditional software which is conventionally sold as a perpetual license with an up-front cost (and an optional on-going support fee), SaaS providers generally price applications using a subscription fee, most commonly a monthly fee or an annual fee. •The initial setup cost for SaaS is typically lower than the equivalent Enterprise license. SaaS suppliers typically price their applications based on some usage parameters, such as the number of users using the application. •In a SaaS environment customers' data can reside with the SaaS supplier, opportunities also exist to charge per transaction, event, or other unit of value Perpetual (Capex) A perpetual license will allow the IR to use the licensed software indefinitely •Although the software license terms can very the period of‘indefinitely’ needs to be defined as incapable of being terminated. •Many software agreements tie the perpetual right to use to the ongoing payment for support and maintenance. Enterprise (Opex or Capex) A license to install software an unlimited number of times within the enterprise. An Enterprise Agreement is structured as ‘all you can eat’ but the organisation must be licensed for a specific quantity of licenses so this is not strictly an ‘Enterprise License’ model in its pure form •Time bound •Limited to a particularsoftware suite or product set ie,: specific Application Middleware, Database Commercial Approach –Pricing (Software Licenses Models Options) Software Licensing models are wide and varied, these are the most common types for consideration, although different COTS providers have different regimes for different product suites: Once a detailed analysis of total cost of ownership and value for money represents then more refinement on the different options can be made, and which proportions of each model is required to license the overall solution. Errors and omissions excepted 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] PricingDetail Consider/ Recommend? User (Opex or Capex) A license that provides access to the software to a specific number of users. All installations of the software will be counted but installations across multiple devices for the same user will be counted as one license consumption •Named User - A license that allows access to the software by a specific number of named users. In some cases, these licenses can be transferred from one user to another. When you create the license, you should allocate the license to specific users. Only installations associated with allocated users are counted. For example, if the license is allocated to users Sam and Jan, the maximum installation count is two. Any other installations of the licensed application are treated as unassigned installations. For example, if May has also installed the licensed application but has not been allocated to the license, her installation will not be shown against installations of this license •ConcurrentUser - A license which provides wider access to the software but limits the number of simultaneous users using the software. It may or may not include compliance enforcement capabilities. Typically, a concurrent license is “checked out” from the license server when the software is run, assuming a license is available. •If no license is available, the requester experiences a denial of service Appliance (Opex or Capex) A license covering use of a specific piece of hardware •Processor- A license based on the number of CPU/Processor sockets on which the software will run, and NOT the logical processors aka cores. •Core/Processor Points- A license based on points applied as a multiplier to the number of Cores/Processors in the physical server, or in some cases, the virtual machine. Some suppliers count Processor sockets and others count logical processors, or cores, but the license model is similar. For example an application installed on a 4 processor server with 100 points per processor would require a purchase of 400 processor points to cover the license liability. •These licenses are mainly used for Datacentre software licensing such as IBM. •Device - A license for a defined number of software installations. The software may be uninstalled on one computer and installed on any other computer within the same enterprise, so long as the total number of installations does not exceed the number of purchased licenses Commercial Approach –Pricing (Software Licenses Models Options) Software Licensing models are wide and varied, these are the most common types for consideration, although different COTS providers have different regimes for different product suites: Errors and omissions excepted 42 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Commercial Approach – Contract Period The contract period includes the length of the initial period of engagement and any contract extensions that apply. Below is the range of contracting approach options applicable to the BT Programme: DetailApplicableOption to TPPros + /ConsConsider Budget Cycle The contract period is based on the time Treasury funding is allocated or reviewed or re-assessed. Treasury funding is available to IR every5- years (or for Tranche 1 only), therefore the contract offered may only be for the same period. This may involve a three year contract with an optional two year extension. Creates a situation of uncertaintyfor the supplier if their service delivery spans wider than the budget cycle. Programme Cycle The contract period is based on the project plan. The supplier contract will end once delivery of the contracted phase is completed. Gives certainty to the supplieron their remuneration. If there are scope changes these will need to be dealt with at the time. Market Entry The contract period is based on consideration of the time it would take for new suppliers to enter the market and establish themselves. Supplier may have significant start up costs associated with the programme. The contract period should consider the time it will take for the contractors to recover the start up costs they have incurred. Unlikely to be in-line with the Government funding rules.In addition, the scope of work for the supplier is sufficient for the supplier to recover any set-up cost they may have incurred. Lifetimeof Solution The contract period is for the expected duration of the life of the solution for software this is indefinite until terminated. Governmentbudget periods are limited to cycles, as there will be an opex component to the purchase of any software licenses this cost when know should be build into the business case. It’s likely the COTS solutionwill be long term (the existing implementation has lasted 23 years) contracting on the basis of an indefinite term until terminated is commensurate with industry software support and maintenance models. Errors and omissions excepted 43 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Commercial Approach - I ncentives and sanctions Incentives and sanctions define the consequences of meeting (incentives) or not meeting (sanctions) the requirements of the agreed contract. The incentives and sanctions stated in the contract may be used to drive behaviour in the performance management process. It is optimal to use incentives as the primary means of driving behaviour rather than focusing on the negative implications of sanctions. This helps to develop a positive relationship with the selected supplier and informs the type of relationship IR is seeking. However, in some circumstances sanctions are appropriate. The following type of incentives and sanctions could be considered in the BT Programme: • Financial - T he use of monetary rewards or withholdings based on the work performed by the supplier. • Contract Extensions -T he use of optional contract extensions based on the work performed. This is IR’s decision as to whether or not to offer the extension. • Profit at Risk -T he provision that a specified proportion or all of a supplier’s profit paid is subject to them meeting required performance standards. IR still pays the contractor’s direct costs of performing the specified work. • Contract Period -O ffering a longer contract period to entice suppliers to offer cost savings due to receiving benefits for longer terms of investment. • Liquidated Damages - F inancial sanction incurred by the supplier as a result of delayed work that was due to be performed. It is important to note that liquidated damages are only enforceable when the financial impact of delays have been estimated prior to the contract being issued. Errors and omissions excepted 44 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] IncentiveConsider/Recommend?SanctionConsider/Recommend?

The specified portion of the profit is withheld from the contractor as a result of service delivery not meeting the required standards. Contract Period Establishing a five year contract period to encourage the service provider to offer cost savings due to ability to create efficiencies in service delivery over time. The contract extension is not taken up with the service provider.

This will require that IR: •has good visibility over the supplier’s activities so that IR may continue to drive v alue after implementation, and to also effectively manage complexities arising during the different phase(s), •develops a transparent and risk-s haring relationship with the supplier to ensure both parties’ interests are aligned for the duration of the programme lifecycle – to deliver a successful outcomes, and •captures the opportunity to work in partnership with a world class supplier to trans fer knowledge and expertise and embeds sustainable capability.

Court had jurisdiction to cure failure to file a notice of pursuit of claim
===========================================================================

2014 case note – Court had jurisdiction to cure a procedure irregularity and proceed with case and did so as no prejudice to appellant.

Case

Kin San Cheang v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

District Court Rules 2009

### Summary

The failure to file and serve a notice of pursuit of claim ("NPC") was a procedural irregularity and did not nullify the proceeding. The Court had jurisdiction to cure that irregularity, hear the strike-out application and enter judgment and did so in this case because there was no prejudice to the appellant.

### Impact of decision

The District Court Rules 2009 ("the Rules") have since been replaced by the District Court Rules 2014 (under which there is no requirement to serve and file an NPC). Therefore, the precedential value of the decision is limited.

However, Moore J did say that this judgment should not be read as authorising the late filing of any application where r 1.18.2A is engaged. The circumstances encountered in this case that permit such a course will be relatively rare.

### Facts

Mr Cheang was sued in the District Court by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") for $301,767.86. This amount arose from default assessments issued for the 2004 and 2005 income tax years.

The relevant procedure under the Rules is provided for in r 2.17:  the Commissioner was to file a notice of claim, Mr Cheang a notice of response and both parties to file information capsules, following which the Commissioner was to file an NPC. However, the Commissioner did not file the NPC, but filed only an application to strike out Mr Cheang's defence. The Rules state that failure to file an NPC within time means the proceedings are at an end (r 2.17.4). Mr Cheang therefore argued the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the Commissioner's strike-out application.

Judge Harrison in the District Court heard the strike-out application and determined that the Commissioner's failure to file the NPC was not fatal to the application because it was clear the proceeding did not go out of all existence following the failure. Since the Rules allow for the Court to extend the time for filing an NPC even after the deadline in r. 2.17 has expired (r 1.18.2/1.18.2A), the proceeding maintained sufficient existence for the Court to rule on the strike out application.

Mr Cheang appealed to the High Court.

### Decision

Moore J determined that the Court did have jurisdiction to hear the strike-out application.

Moore J first examined the purpose of r 2.17 and the effect of r 1.18.2/1.18.2A. Recognising the Rules provide for the NPC to be served on the defendant first rather than filed, he held the primary intention of the NPC is to notify the defendant the plaintiff intends to proceed. He accepted this purpose was achieved when the Commissioner filed the strike-out application and therefore the substance of the Rules was met.

Both parties acknowledged that r 1.18.2 allowed the Court to extend the time to file the NPC. However, Mr Cheang argued that the rule only operated to extend the proceeding when the time was in fact extended: if the Commissioner had applied for an extension, the Court would have had jurisdiction to hear the strike-out application but not otherwise.

Moore J rejected that argument for the reason that it would render r 1.18.2A of no effect, the proceeding would come to an end and could not be revived. He accepted the proceeding maintained a level of existence sufficient to support an extension of time application and this was supported by the fact the Rules envisaged that application to be made on notice involving the other party (which would not be the case if the proceeding had ended).

However, Moore J did not accept that just because the proceeding could support an extension of time application, it could support a strike-out application.

Rather, His Honour decided the appeal on the fact that the failure to file the NPC amounted to technical non-compliance with the Rules and that r 1.10 provides that non-compliance with the Rules is to be treated a matter of irregularity rather than a nullity. Since the Court has discretion as to how the irregularity is treated, the Court has the ability to cure the failure to file the NPC.

In deciding to exercise that discretion in favour of the Commissioner, Moore J recognised there was no prejudice to Mr Cheang, since the only effect of enforcing strict compliance would be to make the Commissioner start the claim again. Further, since the purpose of the NPC is to inform the defendant that the plaintiff intends to continue with the claim and since that purpose in this case was satisfied by the strike-out application, Mr Cheang was in no doubt the Commissioner would pursue the claim. Moore J also noted Mr Cheang had no defence to the claim, given he could not contest the correctness of the Commissioner's assessment in the District Court.

Accordingly, under r 1.10, Moore J held that the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the strike-out application and enter judgment in favour of the Commissioner.

Court News: a snapshot of recent cases
======================================

**05 April 2019**

Inland Revenue collects more than $70 billion in revenue each year – money which goes towards our hospitals, schools and society in general.

When taxpayers evade tax and don’t file returns, neglect to pay workers KiwiSaver contributions or do cash jobs they’re stealing from all Kiwis.

We rely on trust and honesty of taxpayers but when people aren’t upfront and try to cheat the system, Inland Revenue regularly prosecutes taxpayers who don’t pay their fair share. Here are sentences handed down in recent months.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Maria Kinloch**

A now bankrupt exercise trainer has been sentenced to just over six months home detention after claiming more than $61,000 in tax refunds that she wasn’t entitled to.

Maria Kinloch was sentenced in the Marton District Court on March 27. As well as home detention Kinloch also has 10 months standard post detention conditions.

Kinloch admitted she had intentionally filed false GST returns to obtain refunds that she knew she was not entitled to. Total refunds obtained $61,465.22.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ranjit Singh**

Kiwifruit contractor Ranjit Singh has been sentenced to 6 months home detention and 100 hours community work on 25 tax evasion charges.

Singh is involved in the operation and management of Sursingh Enterprises and Sursingh Horticulture and supplies seasonal workers for kiwifruit orchards in the Bay of Plenty.

Singh either filed tax returns and then didn’t pay the resulting tax bill or failed to file the tax returns for the companies. He owed $118,365.16 in core tax.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Carla Pearce**

Invercargill courier driver Carla Pearce has been sentenced to 6 months community detention with an overnight curfew on 27 charges of tax evasion.

Pearce has also been sentenced to 100 hours community work, 12 months supervision and full reparation of the $57,000 debt at $3,000 per month.

Carla Pearce didn’t file GST between October 2012 and June 2016 despite numerous letters and massages about the outstanding amount. She also failed to file income tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. Pearce was sentenced in the Christchurch District Court on March 19.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Christopher Allan Mankin**

An Auckland builder has been fined nearly $7,000 for failing to provide tax returns over a four-year period.

Christopher Allan Mankin was sentenced in the Waitakere District Court on March 15 on 30 counts of failing to furnish GST returns and 4 of failing to furnish income tax returns.

He was sent blank returns to complete; sent a reminder notice when the returns first became overdue; and advised that legal action would be taken. Public notices about due dates were also placed in national and local newspapers, and on tv and radio.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Michael Warren Stevenson**

A former Christchurch man who filed fake tax returns for a panel-beating business which never operated has been sent to jail for 22 months.

Michael Warren Stevenson tried to claim $173,497.95 in GST refunds for his business No Limits Customs Limited. But the company had no customers and no income for nearly two years.

He was charged with 11 counts of using documents (his GST returns) to gain pecuniary advantage. Stevenson was also ordered to pay reparations of $25,000 starting 3 months after his release from prison.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ross John Allan**

A Queenstown business consultant has been sentenced to 120 hours community work for failing to fill out GST and income tax returns.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Richard Ernest Neill**

A Rangiora company director was sentenced to 6 months home detention on 11 charges of tax evasion, totalling just over $275,000.

The Company failed to pay PAYE, KiwiSaver deductions, KiwiSaver employer contributions, student loan deductions and superannuation cash contributions. Neill paid creditors of the company instead of paying its PAYE obligations.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Samantha Taylor-Halliday**

Samantha Taylor-Halliday was sentenced to 3 months’ community detention on theft charges.

Taylor-Halliday filed several false tax returns and $10,000 was paid in to her account. Ms Taylor-Halliday was contacted in relation to the refund and advised not to spend the money because it was issued in error.

From November 2010 until September 2015 he sent invoices and charged GST. He was paid for the work, including the GST amount, but at no time filed GST returns for the 2011 to 2014 income years.

Inland Revenue told the court Singh’s actions were intentional and premeditated.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Chamrouen Sorm**

Former bakery owner Chamrouen SORM has been sentenced in the Waitakere District Court to ten months home detention for failing to include more than $840,000 in cash sales from her GST and income tax returns over eight years.

Significant cash sales weren’t banked into the business bank account. Her cash sales were over 50% of her daily sales for her business.

Over an 8-year period between 2005 and 2013 Sorm suppressed cash totalling $842,923.51 which she used to finance her lifestyle and acquire assets. The amount of tax evaded was just over $336,000 but Sorm repaid $316,000 prior to sentencing last November.

Company director David Peter Verschaffelt was sentenced to ten months imprisonment for failing to pay $379,350.60 in PAYE to Inland Revenue. The term was added to time already serving on unrelated charges.

Verschaffelt was a director of Atmospheric Ltd from April 2010 and became its sole director in May 2016.  

Between October 2015 and July 2016 didn’t pay the deductions it declared to Inland Revenue. Instead Verschaffelt paid it to other creditors so the business could continue to operate.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Hamiora Tamnauitera Wanoa**

A builder has been sentenced to seven months home detention for not providing GST and income tax returns for his business, and personal income tax, for more than four years.

Hamiora Tamnauitera Wanoa was sentenced in the Hutt Valley District Court on November 23.  As well as the home detention, he was ordered to complete 200 hours community work and ordered to pay $4,000 in reparation.

Wanoa ran East Coast Reofix and Formwork Limited and between 2012 and 2017 evaded $73,622 in GST and core tax of $83,857. He also evaded paying $102,419 in personal income tax.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Andrew Hui Chiu**

The operator of a Yum Cha restaurant in Lower Hutt was sentenced to three months home detention and a $6,000 fine for tax evasion totalling $45,400.

Andrew Hui Chiu ran the restaurant with his wife and another man where he managed the accounts, daily takings and purchased stock. An audit showed that over 3 to 4 years $170,787.24 in cash sales was not declared.

The money was used to purchase stock from markets and to pay a chef in cash. The court heard Chiu and two co-defendants maintained a practice of underreporting cash sales and paying employees undeclared wages for several years.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Anthony Aubrey James Morris**

Self-employed Bay of Plenty man, Anthony Aubrey James Morris, has been sentenced to nine months home detention and 250 hours community work on tax evasion charges.

Morris failed to register for GST, didn’t file GST returns or income tax returns and pay any tax between 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2016.

The amount of tax evaded was around $90,000. At trial, he denied he knew he had obligations to file returns or pay tax but other witnesses including former partners gave evidence Morris knew he had tax obligations and that he knew they were not being fulfilled.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Darren James Mills**

Chartered accountant Darren James Mills has been fined $4,000 for knowingly not providing information to the Commissioner.

Darren Mills was the sole director of Mills Consulting Limited. The company, acting has his tax agent, filed late returns for seven tax years and from 2009 to 2013 claimed expenses.

The Commissioner asked for documents to support the expenses, most of which he didn’t provide. Mills was sentenced on December 12.

2016 case note - interaction between the statutory disputes and challenge process and judicial review in a taxation context post Tannadyce v CIR.

Case

Charter Holdings v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZCA 449

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act ss 109, 113, 138E (1)(e)(iv) and Part 8A

### Summary

This was an appeal by Charter Holdings Limited (“CHL”) against the High Court’s dismissal of CHL’s application for judicial review of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) decision refusing to amend her assessments under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, ordering that the matter be referred back to the Commissioner for further consideration.

### Impact

This case is significant in the context of the scheme of the Revenue acts, particularly the interaction between s 113, s 109 of the TAA, the statutory disputes and challenge process (“SDCP”) (provided for in parts 4A and 8A of the TAA) and the role of judicial review in a taxation context post _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 (“_Tannadyce_”).

Primarily, this case indicates that, whether the SDCP could be entered into at the time of a taxpayer making a s 113 request is an important consideration that may persuade the Court that relief should not be granted, but it is not a substantive rule preventing judicial review of a decision declining the request in the first place.

### Facts

CHL appealed against the dismissal by the High Court of an application for judicial review of a decision by the Commissioner refusing to amend her assessments of CHL’s tax liability in the 2006 to 2012 tax years under s 113 of the TAA. The subject matter of this decision concerned CHL attempting to secure amended assessments reducing its tax liability for the 2006 to 2012 tax years by bringing into account losses incurred in the 2000 to 2005 tax years.

The High Court considered that application for review on the basis that CHL:

1.  had been in a position to invoke the SDCP under Parts 4A and 8A of the TAA in respect of the assessments in question;
2.  had failed to do so; and
3.  could not, therefore, use the judicial review process to dispute the quantification of its tax liability for the relevant income tax years.

The High Court, in applying s 109 of the TAA and _Tannadyce_, stated that judicial review of a decision under s 113 ought not to be used as a means to consider the merits of assessments by circumventing the SDCP. As a result of this approach the High Court did not consider the merits of CHL’s application for review, including alleged mistakes of fact in her decision making process.

### Decision

_Section 109 and Tannadyce_

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the High Court erred when it held that the judicial review of a decision under s 113 must be refused except when the SDCP could never be invoked. The Court of Appeal considered that s 113 is intended to stand outside of and be supplementary to the SDCP and that based its clear exclusion from right of challenge under s 138E (1)(e)(iv) of the TAA. While the decision whether to amend or not under s 113 cannot be subject to the SDCP, an amendment under s 113 can.

The Court of Appeal considered that the Commissioner’s power under s 113 is remedial in nature and its utilisation to ensure correctness of assessments is in accordance to s 6(2) of the TAA, in terms of protecting the integrity of the tax system.

The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that s 109 of the TAA has any impact on s 113, considering that s 109 is to ensure the SDCP is used in the case of disputable decisions. The Court of Appeal discussed _Tannadyce_, holding that the Supreme Court’s decision does not require any restriction on the general right to apply for judicial review of the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers under s 113, stating that a decision under s 113 is not a disputable decision and therefore s 109 has no direct application.

The Court of Appeal held that it did not matter that CHL’s ultimate objective was for its assessments to be amended so as to utilise losses referable to the 2000 to 2005 years. Furthermore it held that while the ability to access the SDCP will be an important consideration that may persuade the Court that relief should not be granted, it should not be elevated to a substantive rule. This would have the result of ousting the High Court’s jurisdiction to consider applications for review in the absence of a statutory direction to that effect.

_The merits of the application for review_

The Court held that the Commissioner had erred by finding that:

1.  Mr Padfield, sole director of CHL (who completed CHL’s income tax returns, failing to carry forward losses), had demonstrated knowledge of the process for carrying forward losses in his personal tax returns, leading the Commissioner to reject his claim that he had made a genuine error in not carrying forward CHL’s losses;
2.  the sale of the assets of CHL had not been a true sale, without any factual foundation for doing so; and
3.  trading income should have been recorded in the tax return for the 2005 year, while CHL was in receivership, having sold its business and assets in 2003.

The Court of Appeal considered that the factual errors made were such that they must have caused the Commissioner to doubt the genuineness of Mr Padfield’s claim on behalf of CHL.

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Commissioner’s decision to decline CHL’s request under s 113 of the TAA, ordering that the matter be referred back to the Commissioner for further consideration.

Court of Appeal confirms a lease surrender payment is a revenue receipt in the hands of the landlord
====================================================================================================

In the High Court, Ellis J concluded that the lease surrender payment received by Easy Park Limited was revenue and not a capital receipt

Case

Easy Park Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZCA 296

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007 s CB 1

### Summary

In the High Court, Ellis J concluded that the lease surrender payment received by Easy Park Limited (“Easy Park”) was revenue and not a capital receipt in Easy Park’s hands upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) classification of the lease surrender payment as taxable income. Easy Park appealed to the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal agreed with the Commissioner and Ellis J in holding that the lease surrender payment in the hands of Easy Park was revenue and therefore taxable income. The appeal was dismissed.

### Impact

This decision confirms that a lease surrender payment received by a landlord that is in the business of leasing commercial properties is considered revenue and not capital meaning it is taxable income in the hands of the landlord.

### Facts

Easy Park was a company that was formed for the sole purpose of undertaking commercial rental property investments.

In 2003 Easy Park acquired two commercial buildings in Wellington one of which was a four-storey building situated in 312 Lambton Quay (“the Whitcoulls Building”).

Easy Park purchased the Whitcoulls Building subject to a lease to Whitcoulls Group Limited (“WGL”). The lease was for a term of 12 years and three months commencing on 1 June 2003.

On 17 February 2011 WGL was placed into voluntary administration. The administrators of WGL sold its business and assets to Whitcoulls 2011 Ltd (“W2011”). W2011 took occupation of the Whitcoulls Building without an assignment of the lease to WGL.

In June 2011 W2011 publicly announced that it would be vacating the Whitcoulls Building.

In August 2011 WGL assigned its lease to W2011 with effect from 21 June 2011. At that stage there was three years and three months remaining on the lease.

In November 2011 Easy Park and W2011 entered into negotiations for early termination of the lease. Easy Park and W2011 agreed to an amount of $1.1 million to be paid by W2011 for early surrender (“the lease surrender payment”).

On 7 February 2012 Easy Park and W2011 entered into a deed of surrender of lease providing for a surrender date of 30 June 2012.

In its income tax return for the year ended 31 March 2012, Easy Park treated the receipt of the lease surrender payment as a non-taxable capital amount.

The Commissioner disagreed and assessed the surrender payment as being business income subject to income tax of $308,000. The Commissioner also imposed a shortfall penalty of 10%.

Ellis J upheld the Commissioner’s classification of the lease surrender payment as taxable income but quashed the imposition of a shortfall penalty finding that the tax position taken by Easy Park was not unacceptable.

Easy Park appealed.

### Decision

_Appellant’s argument that the lease was part of the capital asset_

The Court rejected the appellant’s argument that the lease to WGL was part of the capital asset acquired by Easy Park when it purchased the freehold in the Whitcoulls Building.

The Court agreed that Easy Park purchased the freehold in the Whitcoulls building under its sale and purchase agreement and that this was clearly a capital asset.

The Court did not accept that the lease to the Whitcoulls Building can be “tacked on” to the capital asset by virtue of the lease being in place when the property was purchased.

Easy Park did not acquire a leasehold interest in land. Easy Park acquired a freehold estate that was subject to a lease that belonged to WGL and later W2011.

_Characterisation of lease surrender payment as revenue_

The Court agreed with Ellis J and the Commissioner that the lease surrender payment was revenue and subsequently taxable income.

The Court proceeded on the basis of the principle outlined by Richardson J in _AA Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 (CA) at 11,391, that the nature of a receipt for income tax purposes depends on what the amount received was calculated to effect from a practical business point of view.

The Court held that Easy Park’s sole business was in leasing commercial properties. It generated income in the form of rent for those properties. That rent is indisputably income. The lease surrender payment essentially had the same character as the payment of rents that Easy Park generated as income when leasing those commercial properties. It was a lump sum made on account of the rent forgone by the landlord meaning from a practical business point of view, the lease surrender payment was income.

The court recognised that early surrender payment may have been determined by reference to rent lost, it was necessarily received as revenue. The authorities are clear that character of a receipt is not to be determined by the measure or method used to quantify the payment.

The Court accepted the termination of the lease and associated receipt, although unwelcome, constituted part of the ordinary business activities of Easy Park as a commercial lessor. The Court agreed with Ellis J that the lease surrender was simply an ordinary if unwanted incident of Easy Park’s core and only business of commercial leasing.

_The Court rejected the appellant’s alternative arguments_

The Court rejected the appellants submissions based on _Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick (Inspector of Taxes_) \[1966\] AC 295 (HL), _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McKenzies (NZ) Ltd_ \[1988\] 2 NZLR 736 (CA), and _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie_ \[1999\] 1 NZLR 529 (PC), distinguishing those cases from this case primarily on the basis that Easy Park was a commercial lessor. The lease surrender payment received by Easy Park was in course of its ordinary business operations and the lease was held on revenue account.

The Court rejected the appellant’s argument that the financial impact of the termination affected the structure and core of Easy Park’s business. It was noted that:

1.  In March 2011 the Wellington City Council gave Easy Park notice that the Whitcoulls Building was earthquake prone and required strengthening by 29 March 2015.
2.  Easy Park surrendered their lease with Lifestyle Gym before commencing strengthening work.
3.  While it was sensible for Easy Park to do it this way in order to secure a new tenant, however it did not follow that the lease surrender was the cause of the cost of the earthquake strengthening work.
4.  Apart from having to pay insurance on the building (which was previously borne by WGL and then W2011) Easy Park’s business continued after the earthquake work as before.

Court of Appeal confirms Commissioner's broad powers of reconstruction
======================================================================

2012 case note - Commissioner's broad powers to reconstruct assessments - template, income, loss companies, arrangement, tax avoidance, reconstruction.

Case

John George Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976

### Summary

This case was an appeal from the High Court, which found the arrangements had the purpose and effect of tax avoidance. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court judgment and further added that the overall scheme was the means by which the profits were laundered, together with other related income without paying income tax. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded that the income is to be attributed to Mr Russell because he was the governing mind of the template arrangements, which were designed to shelter the income earned.

### Impact of decision

The Court of Appeal confirmed the Commissioner's broad powers to reconstruct assessments; despite the income not being earned personally. This is a very fact-specific case.

### Facts

This is an appeal from the High Court (_Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,463). In the High Court, Wylie J concluded that Mr Russell was affected by an arrangement having the purpose and effect of tax avoidance by which he obtained tax benefits. The Commissioner's assessment of Mr Russell's income was upheld.

This appeal relates mainly to the Commercial Management Partnership ("CM Partnership") whose activities during the period 1985 to 2000 were conducted by two partners, both were companies.

Both companies were controlled by Mr Russell. In addition, the individual partners would enter agency and management agreements with tax loss companies. The tax loss companies were also controlled by Mr Russell. The partners would account to the loss companies for any income earned and that income would be sheltered by the loss in the loss company. As the tax losses of any particular company were used up, a new tax loss company would be substituted in (using agency and management agreements). However, the cash would be "banked" with finance companies controlled by Mr Russell.

On filing the appeal, Mr Russell raised the four "live issues" that were addressed in the High Court and raised a further five grounds of appeal. After exchanging submissions and further oral submissions, the Court of Appeal considered that the only additional ground for which leave would be granted was the ground dealing with section 99(4) of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("the 1976 Act").

### Issues

1.  In relation to the scope of the alleged arrangement, whether the scope of the broader arrangement was as asserted by the Commissioner and in particular, whether an arrangement requires a consensus or a meeting of minds between the parties involved that the other will act in a particular way.
2.  Was the alleged arrangement a tax avoidance arrangement?
3.  Was the appellant affected by the alleged arrangements?
4.  Did the appellant obtain a tax advantage from the alleged arrangements?
5.  Was the Commissioner correct in reconstructing the income to Mr Russell personally?
6.  Was the assessment process incomplete because section 99(4) of the 1976 Act had been ignored?

### Decision

#### _Scope of the arrangement_

The Court of Appeal agreed with Wylie J on this issue, that there was an "arrangement" as defined in section OB1 of the 1994 Act and the anti-avoidance provisions of the 1976 Act.

There was an arrangement far broader in scope than the limited form of arrangement which Mr Russell conceded in the High Court and in his submissions. The Court of Appeal held that Mr Russell had put in place one overall arrangement and operated it over the years 1985 to 2000.

The "arrangement" did not need to obtain consensus, it just needed to be a plan, which here Mr Russell created, designed and executed.

#### _A tax avoidance arrangement_

Mr Russell sought to characterise the Commissioner's complaint regarding tax avoidance as in reality arising from the fact that the principal partners in the business had tax losses "which they reduced by their share of the profits so they did not actually pay any money to the Commissioner". He contended that if the partners had not carried forward losses, they would have paid tax on their share of the profits and that tax avoidance would not have been perceived.

The Court of Appeal found that the arrangement put in place was "contrived" and "involved pretence". The Court noted that Wylie J in the High Court found "\[t\]he arrangement was in my view so tortuous that it is hard to escape the conclusion it was put in place simply to obfuscate the situation and to confuse even the most diligent tax inspector".

The Court of Appeal concluded that the arrangement was clearly tax avoidance.

#### _A person affected by the arrangement and obtaining a tax advantage_

Mr Russell has always contested that he never entered into a business transaction personally, and did not personally benefit from the arrangement.

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that Mr Russell was a person affected by the arrangement. Mr Russell was a direct party to the arrangement; he controlled all the entities involved; funds were transferred to finance companies to allow him to meet his personal obligations; and he was effectively in control of untaxed money which was generated by the arrangement.

The Court of Appeal was also satisfied that Mr Russell obtained a tax advantage from the arrangement that was more than incidental as he did not pay tax on any income that was derived from the Russell template transactions.

While the Court of Appeal considered it true that the business of the CM Partnership was carried on by means of various partnership and corporate entities, these entities also did not pay income tax because of the artificial introduction by Mr Russell of the various loss companies alongside the partners to offset the net profits earned by the CM Partnership.

The Court of Appeal differed with Wylie J's reasoning that the monies resulting from the CM Partnership business ought to be characterised as "personal exertion income". Their preference was to rest their conclusion as to the purpose of the overall arrangement and the tax advantage derived from it on a broader basis. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded that the overall scheme was the means by which the profits were laundered together with other related income without paying income tax.

#### _Reconstruction to Mr Russell?_

Mr Russell argued that the Commissioner should not have reconstructed the income to him personally. The Judges rejected this, recognising that the Commissioner has broad powers of reconstruction under section 99(3) of the 1976 Act. In Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1999\] 1 NZLR 275 (CA), Blanchard J stated:

*   Section 99(3) gives the Commissioner a wide reconstructive power. He 'may' have regard to the income which the person he is assessing would have or might be expected to have or would in all likelihood have received but for the scheme, but the Commissioner is not inhibited from looking at the matter broadly and making an assessment on the basis of the benefit directly or indirectly received by the taxpayer in question.

The Court of Appeal considered that Mr Russell "saw to it that he received only nominal income for the provision of consulting services". The Court of Appeal went on to note that substantial funds flowed into the CM Partnership and these were placed on deposit with one of the finance companies controlled by Mr Russell. The Court further noted similarities in regards to the low levels of salary received as in _Penny v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 95, \[2012\] 1 NZLR 433.

In the High Court, Wylie J considered that it was a decisive factor that Mr Russell was diverting into the CM Partnership the income which he generated by his personal exertions, but as mentioned above, the Court of Appeal had a differing view and said that where the income was earned by the CM Partnership and other entities within the structure that was set up, utilising the staff employed in the entities, this income ought not to be characterised as income earned by Mr Russell personally. Notwithstanding this differing view, the Court of Appeal concluded that the income is to be attributed to Mr Russell because he was the governing mind of the template arrangements, which was designed to shelter the income earned.

#### _Section 99(4) Income Tax Act 1976_

This ground of appeal was allowed to be brought despite the fact that it had not been pursued in the High Court. Mr Russell claims that the Commissioner has not completed the assessment process as required by this section. Section 99(4) provides:

*   Where any income is included in the assessable income … of any person pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, then, for the purposes of this Act, that income shall be deemed to have been derived by that person and shall be deemed not to have been derived by any other person.

Mr Russell contended that on its correct interpretation section 99(4) is "instantaneous and automatic" and requires the Commissioner to make an adjustment as soon as any income is included in the assessable income of any person pursuant to section 99(3). This is because the income is deemed to have been derived by the person assessed and "shall be deemed not to have been derived by any other person". Mr Russell submitted that the failure by the Commissioner to adjust as required by section 99(4) "vitiates the assessments which should be cancelled as a result". Mr Russell was asserting that other entities had been assessed for the income which was the subject of the Court of Appeal proceeding and therefore pursuant to section 99(4), the Commissioner was prevented from assessing him for the same income personally.

The Commissioner accepted that section 99(4) provided a statutory immunity so that where any income is reconstructed under section 99(3), that income shall be deemed not to have been derived by any other person. However, the Commissioner submitted that for the taxpayer to rely on this section, he would need to show the quantum of assessable income confirmed in the CM Partnership accounts had already been assessed to some other person.

The Court of Appeal considered that if any part of the assessment made by the Commissioner in respect of Mr Russell for the income years 1985 to 2000 included income deemed by section 99(4) to be income of someone else, such an assessment is not void. However, in such a situation, it is open to the Commissioner or the Authority, to remedy the position at a later point.

The Court of Appeal agreed that for the Commissioner to remedy such a situation if he is persuaded that there is a genuine inconsistency, Mr Russell would be the person ideally placed to establish the true position and bring the inconsistency to the notice of the Commissioner.

In any event, the Court of Appeal did not see any inconsistency in effectively taxing the shareholders of the template companies on the fees paid to the Russell group of companies and also attributing those fees to Mr Russell personally for taxation purposes. The Court of Appeal recognised that money paid may often be non-deductible on one side and yet assessable to another party to whom it is paid. Linking it to the present case, the Court of Appeal said the fees paid were treated as non-deductible as they were paid for a tax avoidance scheme. However, that does not make the fees any less assessable when paid to entities established by Mr Russell as payment for services rendered.

As a consequence, Mr Russell was unsuccessful in establishing any merit in the section 99(4) point.

Court of Appeal confirms decision to assess taxpayer as liable for New Zealand income tax on the basis he has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand
=======================================================================================================================================================

Appeal from a decision of the High Court upholding the CIR's decision to assess Gerardus van Uden for NZincome tax for the 2005 to 2009 years.

Case

Van Uden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZCA 487

Legal terms

Permanent place of abode

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994  
Income Tax Act 2004  
Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This is an appeal from a decision of the High Court upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s ("the Commissioner") decision to assess Gerardus van Uden ("the appellant") for New Zealand income tax for the 2005 to 2009 tax years on the basis that he had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand in those years and was therefore liable to pay tax in New Zealand on his worldwide income. A 10 percent penalty on the basis the appellant had taken an unacceptable tax position was also imposed.

### Impact

The decision confirms the interpretation of ‘permanent place of abode’ as set out in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Diamond_ \[2015\] NZCA 613, (2015) 27 NZTC22-03 ("Diamond").

### Facts

The appellant is a ship’s captain. For the past 40 years he has worked for an overseas shipping company, China Navigation Company Ltd. On average, he is at sea for approximately eight months every year.

In January 1980 the appellant married. He lived with his first wife in the Philippines until late 1987. He moved with his family to New Zealand in 1987 and lived in Mangere Bridge until 1995 when he and his first wife separated and then divorced.

The appellant remarried in 1998 and lived with his wife at 27 Evelyn Road. When the appellant met his wife she was living at 27 Evelyn Road as part of a matrimonial settlement. In April 1997 she transferred 27 Evelyn Road to a family trust. The appellant first lived with his wife at 27 Evelyn Road in November 1998 and they have, for the most part, lived there when they have returned to New Zealand thereafter. The Commissioner says that 27 Evelyn Street is the appellant’s permanent place of abode in New Zealand for the tax years 2005 to 2009.

Since January 1980 the appellant has been enrolled in his employer’s non-contributory superannuation fund (“the Provident Fund”). He also owned a small parcel of units in a Hong Kong Unit Trust.

The appellant filed New Zealand income tax returns until and including the 2004 tax year, albeit he only returned approximately half of his salary in New Zealand. For the income years ended 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2006 the appellant filed nil income tax returns. In the year ended 31 March 2007 he filed a non-resident tax return disclosing a small loss for the year. In the years ended 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 he filed non- resident tax returns.

### Decision

The Court upheld the conclusion reached by the Tax Review Authority (“the TRA”) and the High Court that, during the tax years in dispute, the appellant had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Further, the appellant was liable to pay tax on his interest on his employer’s superannuation fund and an unacceptable tax position penalty.

_Was 27 Evelyn Road a permanent place of abode in New Zealand for the appellant in the 2005 to 2009 tax years_

The Court considered s OE of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”) 1994. Subsections (2) and (3) of s OE 1 ITA 1994 provide two bright line tests, based on aggregate days in New Zealand in any period of 12 months. However, subsection (1) provides an overriding provision as to residence.

The Court referred to the meaning of the term “permanent place of abode” as discussed in Diamond. The Court considered the Diamond test calls for “an integrated factual assessment, directed to determining the nature and quality of the use the taxpayer habitually makes of a particular place of abode.” The Court found the objective, integrated factual assessment did not support the appellant’s characterisation of 27 Evelyn Road as a convenient place to stay and that he did not have the intention of using it as a home

The Court found that it is unrealistic to allow the Trust structure to obscure the fact that Mr van Uden availed himself of 27 Evelyn Road while he was in New Zealand and made it his home.

The Court was satisfied that the appellant had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The individual factors listed in Diamond supported this conclusion:

**Continuity or otherwise of the taxpayer’s presence in New Zealand and in the dwelling**

The appellant has had a continuous presence in New Zealand since 1957 except for a short stint in the Netherlands and later the Philippines. In the relevant tax years the appellant spent approximately eight months a year at sea however when he was not on the ship or travelling he would return to New Zealand and when he was not visiting family he lived at 27 Evelyn Road.

**The duration of that presence**

27 Evelyn Road has been available to, and used by, the appellant for approximately 12 years from November 1998 to June 2010.

_**The durability of the taxpayer’s association with the particular place**_

The appellant maintained significant ties with 27 Evelyn Road exhibited in both practical and financial ways. The appellant incurred regular household expenditure at a variety of stores near the 27 Evelyn Road. Further the 27 Evelyn Road address was used for SKY TV, motor vehicle registration, bills, bank statements, insurance policies and investments.

**The closeness or otherwise of the taxpayer’s connection with the dwelling**

While the appellant does not own the property, as seen in Case H97, a taxpayer does not need to own a property in his or her own name to have a permeant place of abode there. It is reasonably evident that the appellant had a close connection to 27 Evelyn Road. Whenever he returned to New Zealand and was not staying on the ship, travelling or visiting relatives he would stay at 27 Evelyn Road. Unlike the four rental properties owned by the trust, 27 Evelyn Road was not formally let until 2010. In a loan application for funding to purchase 29 Evelyn Road, 27 Evelyn Road is referred to as their home.

**Permanent not temporary place of abode**

The Court found 27 Evelyn Road was a permanent place of abode rather than a temporary place of abode. The property was always available to the appellant when he returned to New Zealand. The only time it was let was informal and when the appellant was not in the country.

**Other permanent place of abode**

The appellant no longer maintains that he has a permanent place of abode outside of New Zealand.

_Mr Van Uden’s superannuation account: taxable foreign investment fund income_

The appellant argued that because contributions to his account in the Provident Fund are paid by his employer, and he is not required to make any contributions himself, then there is no "cost of expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the appellant as regards the Provident Fund".

Section CG 15 ITA applies to the 2005 tax year and was enacted as such in 1993 (as part of the Income Tax Act 1976). The section had originally referred only to the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred by the person. The words “or on behalf of” were added several months later. The Court found the explanatory note to the Taxation Reform Bill (No 7)1993 makes the point clear. Parliament clearly intended to include employer contributions to superannuation funds. As Venning J noted in the High Court, it is the employee who benefits from those contributions – to the extent, the cost or expenditure is incurred by or on behalf of them.

In the ITA 2004 and ITA 2007 (which apply to the 2006 to 2009 years), s CQ 5(1)(d) (the equivalent of s CG 15(2)(d)) brings an interest within the FIF rules if the total cost of attributing interests in FIFs that the person holds is more than $50,000. The Court agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that there is no requirement that any particular person incurred a cost, a comprehensive answer to the appellant’s challenge as regards those tax years.

_The time bar_

The assessment for the 2005 to 2008 tax years became time barred from reassessment pursuant to s 108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA") on 31 March 2013. Notices of reassessment for those time barred years were subsequently issued on 24 February 2014. The Court considered whether, before that, the Commissioner had exercised the power under s 108(2) to lift the time bar.

The Court adopted the description of events from Venning J’s judgment in the High Court. The Court found that there can be no challenge to Venning J’s reasoning that Mr Young (of the Disputes Unit) had an authority to make an opinion under s 108(2) and he expressly stated he exercised his delegation under that section. It was, the Judge said, that opinion that was the necessary requirement for the purposes of s 108(2) rather than the language used to record it

Further, as noted in Great North Motor Company Ltd (in rec) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 328; (2017) 28 NZTC 23-022 at \[33\], when considering a tax challenge under part 8A of the TAA, the TRA is obliged to review the ruling de novo. That de novo process having been followed, and the TRA having confirmed those assessments, there is no room for any further challenge pursuant to s 108 of the TAA.

_The unacceptable tax position penalty_

The Court found that the objective assessment of the evidence supports the conclusion that the appellant’s contention that he was not tax resident in New Zealand in the relevant years was not “about as likely as not to be correct”.

Court of Appeal confirms deductions for bad debts not available as operating a “Benevolence on the Conscience Loan Fund” not a money lending business
=====================================================================================================================================================

This was a second appeal from a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”) which had been upheld by the High Court on a first appeal.

Case

Boon Gunn Hong v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZCA 336

Legal terms

Bad debt, Deductions, Reasonable care, Lending business, Business test, Financial arrangement, Shortfall penalties

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007 ss DA 1, DB 31(1), DB31(3)  
Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 15B, 138G, 141A  
Insolvency Act 2006 s 304

### Summary

This was a second appeal from a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”) which had been upheld by the High Court on a first appeal. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) had issued assessments disallowing two deductions for bad debts in the amount of $50,000 and $122,280 respectively and imposing shortfall penalties under s 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) for not taking reasonable care.

In 2005 the appellant, a barrister and solicitor in sole practice, had created a fund which he called his “Benevolence on the Conscience Loan Fund”, from which he extended loans to clients facing financial difficulties. The two loans for which the appellant had claimed bad debt deductions had been advanced from this fund in 2006. The appellant wrote the debts off, claimed deductions for them in his 2011 income tax return and carried part of the losses through into the 2012 income year. He asserted that he was in the business of dealing in or holding financial arrangements and that he had physically written off the debts as bad in the 2011 income year. The Commissioner contested these assertions.

### Impact

This is the first Court of Appeal authority on the application of s DB 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the ITA”) (or its predecessors). It confirms the approach taken by lower courts in earlier cases, including that the _Grieve v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 _(“Grieve”)_ business test is appropriate for determining whether a taxpayer carries on a business of dealing in or holding financial arrangements and that a physical write off is required to be made in whatever books of account used by the taxpayer during the income year in which the deductions are claimed. It is also the first time the Court of Appeal considers the application of s 141A of the TAA.

The Court of Appeal also confirmed that tax litigation is a specialist area of law, meaning it is reasonable to engage out of town counsel and recover disbursements for travel and accommodation for counsel attending hearing.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal found that the appellant had not shown that the loans had been written off in the books of account used by the appellant during the 2011 income year. Their Honours noted that, except for the appellant’s own assertion as a witness, there was no evidence that his office administrator, Ms Chan, had entered the write-offs in the spreadsheet during the 2011 income year. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower courts’ findings that the appellant had failed to discharge the onus of proof in respect of the physical write off requirement. The Court of Appeal also noted that the meta data which the Commissioner’s Investigator had presented as evidence in the TRA was not excluded under s 138G of the TAA as that section only excludes new issues or propositions of law (but not evidence) from being raised unless included in the parties’ Statements of Position.

The Court of Appeal further upheld the lower courts’ findings that the debtors (both being natural persons) had not been released by operation of law from making all remaining payments under s DB 31(1)(a)(ii) of the ITA. This was because neither debtor had been discharged from bankruptcy at the time when the deductions were claimed.

The lower courts were found to have correctly applied the business test in _Grieve_ and had been correct to hold that the appellant was not carrying on, even in part, a lending business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Their Honours noted the overwhelming evidence which, viewed objectively, fell well short of establishing the appellant was engaged in the business of moneylending. Despite the appellant’s repeated assertions that he subjectively intended to make a profit from his lending activities, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Commissioner’s characterisation of the lending as being better described as passive investment or charitable advancement of funds. The appellant’s profitmaking intention, while subjectively present, in reality amounted to little more than a “hope” that the client would eventually be able to pay interest or even a bonus to the appellant.

The Court of Appeal also agreed with the lower courts’ findings that there was an insufficient connection between the appellant’s legal services business and the financial arrangements for which deductions were sought. Noting the potential for a conflict of interest in advancing loans to clients and the prohibition under the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008 on engaging in conflicting business activities, their Honours’ commented that the appellant could not have it both ways.

The lower courts’ findings that the appellant failed to take reasonable care and was liable to pay shortfall penalties under s 141A of the TAA were also upheld. While agreeing with Jagose J’s finding that it will not always be necessary to take advice from a tax adviser to take reasonable care, the Court of Appeal noted that, in the present case, the appellant had neither conducted his own research nor sought advice from a professional (because he had found it expensive).

The Court of Appeal finally confirmed that costs had been appropriately awarded to the Commissioner in the High Court. Their Honours also awarded costs for a standard appeal on band A for the Court of Appeal proceeding.

Court of Appeal confirms High Court decision
============================================

The Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court decision that accounts receivable is not limited to "book debts" overturning the decision in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Northshore Taverns Ltd (2008)

Case

Strategic Finance Limited (in rec & in liq) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZCA 357

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Personal Property Securities Act 1999

### Summary

The Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court decision that "accounts receivable" is not limited to "book debts" overturning the decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Northshore Taverns Ltd (in liq)_ (2008) 23 NZTC 22,074 (HC) ("_Northshore_").

### Impact of decision

The decision affirms that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"), as preferential creditor, will have priority over a secured creditor in this context.

### Facts

Takapuna Procurement Limited (in liquidation) ("Takapuna") was a property development company involved in the development of a property at Anzac Avenue, Takapuna known as "Shoalhaven". Takapuna's directors were Messrs Robert and Kelly McEwan who were adjudicated bankrupt as of 26 February 2009 and May 2009 respectively.

Strategic Finance Limited (in receivership and in liquidation) and Strategic Nominees Limited (in receivership) ("Strategic") advanced funds to Takapuna for the completion of Shoalhaven. At the date of Takapuna's liquidation, Strategic was owed in excess of $4,800,000 plus interest and costs secured by a registered General Security Agreement.

Strategic is the only remaining secured creditor of Takapuna and the Commissioner the only remaining preferential creditor in the liquidation. The dispute relates to various categories of funds totalling $782,108.18 plus accrued interest.

The funds in question held by Messrs Burns and Agnew (the liquidators) were made up as follows:

*   refunds to Takapuna from the North Shore City Council ("NSCC") of development contributions ($451,176.94) and bonds ($3,000);
*   a goods and services tax ("GST") refund of $169,349.86 released by the Commissioner to Takapuna in error; and
*   various funds held by Takapuna's solicitors which related to earlier property developments ($158,581.38).

In the High Court, Strategic argued that the Commissioner's claim to the funds as a preferential creditor was limited to "book debts". Strategic also argued that the GST refund released in error by the Commissioner of $169,349.86 should not in any event be repaid to the Commissioner. These claims were rejected by the Court, Gendall AJ finding in favour of the Commissioner. The grounds for his decision were:

1.  it would be unfair and unconscionable for the GST refund of $169,349.86 to be retained by the liquidators;
2.  the expression "accounts receivable" in schedule 7, clause 2(2) of the Companies Act 1993 is not limited to book debts; and
3.  the funds held by the liquidators of Takapuna were "accounts receivable" and therefore payable to the Commissioner as the only preferential creditor.

Strategic challenged each of these grounds, but advanced their appeal first through grounds (b) and (c). Ground (a) arises only if Strategic is successful in their challenge to grounds (b) and (c).

### Decision

In the High Court decision, Gendall AJ concluded that the term "accounts receivable" was not limited to book debts, overturning the decision of Hole AJ in _Northshore_. The High Court held that the Companies Act 1993 expressly adopts section 16 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 definition of "accounts receivable". If Parliament had intended to limit "accounts receivable" to "book debts", it would have done so expressly.

The Court of Appeal accepted the interpretation of the High Court. They held that the definition included, but was not limited to, debts or "book debts". It would also include other legally enforceable rights under deeds, statutes and other court judgments whether or not earned by performance. They also held that money held in a bank account would be an "account receivable" because the bank will be under a legally enforceable obligation to pay the money to the account holder.

The Court of Appeal then applied the definition to the funds in this case. They held that the crucial date for determining whether the funds constituted "accounts receivable" was the date on which Takapuna was placed into liquidation.

#### Development contribution refunds

The NSCC had acted _ultra vires_ in collecting development contributions from Takapuna relying on its 2004 development contributions policy (carried over into its 2006 policy). As confirmed in _Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners (No 2_) \[1993\] AC 70 (HL) at \[103\] - \[104\], because the NSCC had collected funds from Takapuna unlawfully, the amount paid was repayable at the exact moment it was paid. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held that the refunds of the development contributions constituted monetary obligations within the definition of "accounts receivable" and should be paid to the Commissioner as the remaining preferential creditor.

#### Engineering and constructions bonds

Bonds of $3,000 paid by Takapuna were lawfully received by the NSCC in securing the performance of resource consents. The NSCC was not satisfied that the development complied with its standards until after the liquidation of Takapuna. The Court of Appeal held that, as at the date of the liquidation, they were not a monetary obligation of the NSCC and therefore not "accounts receivable" to be collected by the Commissioner as a preferential creditor.

#### GST refunds

At all materials times, Takapuna had GST arrears exceeding $3,600,000. The Commissioner is entitled to offset this debt against any credits Takapuna could raise in subsequent or prior periods. Takapuna had no right to recover that refund; the GST refund was not an existing monetary obligation within the definition of "accounts receivable". However, the Commissioner could recover the mistaken refund based on restitution principles and the rule in _Re Condon, ex parte James_ (1974) LR 9 Ch App 609 (CA).

#### Carter Atmore funds

The money held in the Carter Atmore (Takapuna's lawyers) trust account was determined "accounts receivable" because Carter Atmore, like a bank, is under a legally enforceable obligation to pay the money to Takapuna.

Court of Appeal confirms OCN arrangement is tax avoidance
=========================================================

2013 case note – Court of Appeal confirms optional convertible notes arrangement is tax avoidance - economic cost, abusive tax position.

Case

Alesco New Zealand Ltd and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that the optional convertible notes ("OCNs") arrangement entered into by the Alesco group, to claim deductions for interest using Determination G22 and the financial arrangement rules, was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Court also held the "abusive tax position" shortfall penalties were correctly imposed.

### Impact of Decision

This is an important judgment for the Commissioner. Other taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements. This case will most probably influence the outcome of those cases. The total amount of tax across all OCN cases is over $300 million including use-of-money interest.

### Facts

Alesco New Zealand Ltd ("Alesco NZ") and certain subsidiaries appealed against the High Court's decision (_Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2012\] 2 NZLR 252 (HC)) that upheld the Commissioner's assessments declaring the arrangement void as a tax avoidance arrangement. The assessments disallowed interest deductions and loss offset elections and imposed "abusive tax position" shortfall penalties.

Alesco NZ is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alesco Corporation ("the Corporation"), an Australian company. The arrangement involved the use of OCNs in an intra-group situation to finance the acquisition of two businesses in New Zealand.

Alesco NZ issued OCNs to the Corporation in return for advances totalling $78 million for a term of 10 years. At maturity, the Corporation had the option of being repaid the $78 million or converting the OCNs into shares in Alesco NZ. No interest was payable on the OCNs.

At the relevant times, the Commissioner's Determination G22 applied. The application of Determination G22 to the terms of the OCN resulted in deemed interest deductions for Alesco NZ in the 2003 to 2008 years (inclusive).

### **Decision**

The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed Alesco NZ's appeal, essentially on the same grounds as the High Court dismissed its challenge.

Alesco NZ advanced a threshold argument. It argued that tax avoidance can only be determined by having regard to the tax position hypothetically obtainable under other business or funding structures (a counterfactual). The Court disagreed and held the question is whether the particular arrangement had the effect of avoiding tax. The definition provisions in the Income Tax Act do not allow for a hypothetical point of reference. In any event, Alesco NZ did not establish an evidential foundation for a counterfactual position.

The Court held that a question that lay at the heart of the appeal was whether Alesco NZ suffered an economic cost commensurate with its claimed deductions. If Alesco NZ did not incur an economic cost, the question became whether its use of the financial arrangement rules and Determination G22 to claim deductions for expenditure incurred fell outside Parliament's contemplation.

The Court held that Alesco NZ did not actually pay interest but obtained a reduction in tax liability as if it had. Alesco NZ failed to prove that its use of the financial arrangement rules and Determination G22 to claim deductions were within Parliament's contemplation. It had engaged in tax avoidance.

On the issue of reconstruction, the Court held that the Commissioner has broad discretion. The Commissioner may have regard to an alternative funding arrangement but she is not obliged to, and should not, where the tax advantage can be counteracted simply by disallowing the impermissible deductions.

On the issue of shortfall penalties, the Court held that it is required to view the arrangement objectively and not have regard to Alesco NZ's intentions in taking its tax position. The Court held that there was no purpose for the arrangement except to secure a tax advantage. Accordingly, Alesco NZ entered into the arrangement for the dominant purpose of avoiding tax and was liable for a shortfall penalty for taking an "abusive tax position".

2017 case note - CIR obliged to form opinion on the face of a tax return that it is fraudulent or willfully misleading - time bar, removal from Companies register.

Case

Great North Motor Company Limited (In Receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 328

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 s 108 (1) Companies Act 1993 s 330

### Summary

This case was an appeal from the High Court decision of _Great North Motor Company Ltd (in rec) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 2708. In that case, Downs J found that the transaction underlying tax losses accumulated by Great North Motor Company Limited (in rec) (“Great North”) was a tax avoidance scheme.

Great North did not appeal the finding of tax avoidance, rather it focussed on its position that six of the 12 assessments amended were time barred by s108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). Downs J had found that even if the time bar had expired, the tax returns filed were fraudulent or wilfully misleading, and thus it did not apply. Alternatively, he found that the time bar did not apply because time did not accrue during the period Great North was struck off the register.

### Impact

This decision confirms the time bar approach taken in _Legarth v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1967\] NZLR 312 (_“Legarth”_) and _Edwards v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 1795, (2016) (_“Edwards”_). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) is obliged to form an opinion on the face of a tax return that it is fraudulent or wilfully misleading. In a challenge proceeding, the hearing authority stands in the Commissioner’s shoes in all respects when considering a challenge in relation to the opinion formed under s 108(2) of the TAA and forms its own opinion on whether the returns filed were fraudulent or wilfully misleading as if it is the Commissioner. However, the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the returns were not fraudulent or wilfully misleading.

This decision also confirms the test for determining whether a return was ‘wilfully misleading’ as settled by Turner J in _Babington v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (no 2)_ \[1958\] NZLR 152 at \[156\]-\[157\].

Finally, the Court found that once a company is restored to the register, s 330(2) of the Companies Act 1993 applies and neither the restored company nor third parties can challenge the validity of actions taken during the period of its removal. Accordingly, the Commissioner needs to monitor the register (or gazette) and notices of pending restoration of companies with a view to objecting to restorations where appropriate.

### Facts

Great North filed income tax returns claiming deductions for losses of about $21.7 million suffered from business activities between 1996-2001 (inclusive). The Commissioner originally allowed the claim but later disallowed it and assessed Great North on the basis that the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position. Great North challenged the Commissioner’s assessments.

The High Court found that the Commissioner was correct to conclude the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement and to impose an abusive tax position shortfall penalty. The High Court also held that the returns filed were misleading for the purposes of s 108(2) of the TAA on the basis that Mr Russell had actual knowledge that the arrangement constituted tax avoidance (or that it was highly likely tax avoidance (subjectively reckless)). Lastly, the High Court concluded that the s 108 time bar commenced only when Great North was restored to the register on 8 October 2010. Only then did the Commissioner have a “taxpayer” with whom to deal.

Great North sought to appeal certain aspects of the High Court decision but did not appeal the tax avoidance finding.

### Decision

#### Standard of appellate review

In determining Great North’s appeal, the Court of Appeal considered that it must resolve a threshold question about the appropriate standard of appellate review of the Commissioner’s opinion.

Counsel for Great North submitted that the correct approach for the hearing authority, in this case the High Court, when determining a challenge to the Commissioner’s assessments under s 138P of the TAA is to stand in the Commissioner’s shoes and consider afresh whether the return in question is fraudulent or wilfully misleading. Accordingly, the hearing authority must substitute its own view for the Commissioner’s view if she has erred. Counsel for Great North accepted that Great North carries the burden of proving it did not submit a wilfully misleading return. The Court of Appeal considered that this correctly stated the ratio of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Legarth_.

However, the Court’s attention was drawn to a later decision of the Court of Appeal, namely _Wire Supplies Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 244, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 458 (_“Wire Supplies”_) which might stand as authority for a lower threshold of appellate scrutiny, limited to simply one of review of the evidential foundation or reasonableness of the Commissioner’s opinion.

The Court noted that at first blush, _Wire Supplies_ might seem contrary to _Legarth_, which was not apparently cited in argument. However, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that in _Wire Supplies_ the Court of Appeal was answering a limited submission for the taxpayer, addressed solely to the evidential adequacy of the Commissioner’s opinion. The Court of Appeal considered the apparent differences in the approaches adopted by the Court in those two cases are reconcilable when the circumstances of _Legarth_ were examined more closely.

The Court of Appeal referred to the decision of _Edwards_, in which Williams J reviewed a number of High Court decisions addressing a same or similar issue. The Court of Appeal agreed with Williams J’s conclusion following _Legarth_, that the hearing authority’s reconsideration of the Commissioner’s time-bar ruling is not restricted to whether her opinion under s 108(2) of the TAA was honestly held and reasonably available on the evidence. The hearing authority is obliged to review de novo.

The Court considered the approach adopted in _Legarth_ to be consistent with the purpose of s 108(2) of the TAA. The Court considered that approach reflects the Commissioner’s obligation to form an opinion on the face of a tax return that is fraudulent or wilfully misleading. She has neither the time nor the resources to conduct a full evidential enquiry. In the event that the taxpayer challenges an amendment made more than four years after the Commissioner’s assessment, the hearing authority must be able to substitute its own view for the Commissioner’s opinion of the correct liability to tax having considered the application of the relevant legislation and relevant evidence. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the taxpayer bears the burden of proving to the civil standard that its returns were not fraudulent or misleading which the Court considered is an exacting requirement where the Commissioner has made compelling findings that the underlying affairs were designed to avoid tax.

#### Test for “fraudulent or wilfully misleading”

The Court of Appeal confirmed that the correct test to be applied in determining whether a return was “wilfully misleading” is found in _Babington v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_. Proof of mere negligence or breach of duty is not enough. There has to be knowledge that the return is materially inaccurate coupled with an intention to mislead. Subjective recklessness is sufficient where it is demonstrated that the person submitting the returns had no reasonable ground for believing that the returns were correct, where the only inference reasonably available is that he or she must have adverted to the probability or possibility that the returns were false, and was reckless in the sense of not caring whether they were correct or not.

The Court of Appeal considered that the Commissioner’s claim that Great North’s tax returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading required proof of two sequential elements. Firstly, whether a particular return is misleading; would the returns on their face mislead the Commissioner?

Having approached the matter afresh, the court was independently satisfied that all returns filed by Mr Russell for the relevant years were wilfully misleading within the meaning of s 108(2) of the TAA. The Court also came to the conclusion that Great North had fallen well short of discharging its onus that the returns were not wilfully misleading and to the contrary were satisfied that Mr Russell at the very least acted recklessly and with wilful disregard that the Commissioner would disallow the company’s losses as being claimed under a tax avoidance scheme.

Accordingly, the Court concluded that the Commissioner’s amendments were not time barred under s 108(1) of the TAA.

#### Section 330 of the Companies Act 1993

The Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court’s decision that retrospective validation of Great North’s existence, deemed (under s 330(2) of the Companies Act 1993) by its 2010 restoration to the register, did not have the effect of validating the company’s returns to the time of filing in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

The Court of Appeal stated s 330(2) is straightforward and fair: neither the restored company nor third parties can challenge the validity of actions taken during the period of its removal. The Court considered that ss 328(6) and 329(4) exist to protect creditors who understood they were dealing with a registered company during the period of removal and who would otherwise have no right to pursue the restored company on those transactions by enabling them to apply to the Court to wind back the clock.

The Court agreed with Counsel for Great North that the purpose of s 330 is strictly restorative and unequivocally deems that the company has “continued in existence as if it had not been removed from the register”. Therefore, the legal effect is that the returns were filed on the day they were filed as if the company was then in existence.

The Court considered that the Commissioner would have arguably been entitled to apply for judicial review of the Registrar’s decision to reinstate Great North from 10 October 2010 on the ground that Mr Russell’s purported appointment as receiver on 26 May 2005 was invalid.

In response to the Commissioner’s submission that she has neither the time nor the resource to restore companies to the register in order to comply with her statutory responsibilities, the Court stated that they would have assumed the Commissioner was monitoring closely the corporate machinations of Great North and its associates. In any event, the Court found that s 108(2) of the TAA is an effective safeguard for the Commissioner and the maintenance of the tax base. A company which was not carrying on business – neither when it was removed nor throughout the period it was struck off – had no lawful reason for filing tax returns other than to obtain a benefit to which it was not entitled.

The Court stated that had they not found that Great North’s returns were fraudulent or knowingly misleading, the four-year time bar provided by s 108(1)(a) of the TAA would apply to six of the Commissioner’s assessments.

**Result**

The appeal was dismissed and costs awarded to the Commissioner.

Court of Appeal considers Commissioner’s opposition to the restoration of companies to the New Zealand Companies Office register to protect the integrity of the tax system
===========================================================================================================================================================================

This was an appeal of the High Court’s decision restoring five companies to the Companies Register under s 329 of the Companies Act 1993.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Commercial Management Ltd \[2019\] NZCA 479

Legal terms

Restoration of company

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993

### Summary

This was an appeal of the High Court’s decision restoring five companies to the Companies Register (“the register”) under s 329 of the Companies Act 1993 (“the Act”), _Commercial Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2018\] NZHC 2224. The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s decision and held that:

1.  The applicants’ failed to provide the information that the Court needed in order to give proper consideration to the application.
2.  Restoration of the removed companies after such a long period of being deregistered would be either nugatory or contrary to the public interest.

### Impact

This decision demonstrates that where it is in the public interest, and to protect the integrity of the tax system, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) may object to the restoration of companies to the register.

### Facts

The applicants sought restoration of five removed companies (“the removed companies”) to the register under s 329(1)(b) of the Act on the grounds that it is just and equitable for them to be restored. They contended that the purpose of restoring the removed companies to the register was to enable them to be parties to any settlement negotiations with the Commissioner in relation to GST, and/or enable them to pursue GST claims against the Commissioner.

The five companies were removed from the register, variously, on 17 February 1998, on 25 September 1996, on 27 June 2000, on 23 April 1998, and on 22 December 2011.

The High Court made orders under s 329 of the Act restoring the removed companies to the register. The Commissioner appealed that decision on the basis that the exercise of discretion by the Associate Judge in the High Court under s 329 was “plainly wrong”.

The Commissioner said that the Associate Judge gave too much weight to the private interests of the applicants, and insufficient weight to the public interest factors that supported refusal of restoration of these companies, having regard to the length of time for which the companies had been removed from the register and the threat to the integrity of the tax system posed by restoration of the companies.

The applicants submitted that the Associate Judge correctly identified and applied the principles relevant to s 329 applications.

### Issues

Whether the High Court correctly exercised its discretion in finding it was just or equitable to restore the removed companies.

### Decision

Delay

The Court agreed with the Associate Judge that the long delay in making an application to restore these companies to the register is a factor that points against their restoration. They found the respondent did not satisfactorily explain reasons for the delay.

Application for restoration failed to provide necessary information

The Court noted section 329(1A) provides that the Court _must_ have regard to the reasons for the company’s removal and whether those grounds existed at the time of removal or exist at the hearing of the application. It is incumbent on an applicant associated with the removed company (such as a former shareholder or director) to provide the information that the court requires in order to consider this mandatory relevant consideration.

They held that the applicants failed to provide sufficient information, as required by s 329(1A), for the Court to properly determine the application.

Restoration either nugatory or contrary to the public interest

The Court disagreed with the Associate Judge that there is a public interest in the removed companies being permitted to pursue their proposed claims against the Commissioner. Additionally, the Court identified significant hurdles to the GST claims that the removed companies would seek if they were restored to the register in order to pursue their GST claim.

They found that the significant delay in seeking to pursue any claims that the removed companies might have had to GST refunds counted against restoration of the companies. The potential claims by the companies for GST refunds had been spotted by the companies’ tax agent by 1993 at the latest. Some 25 years then passed before any formal steps were taken to assert claims on behalf of the removed companies.

The Court held that it is not just and equitable to restore the removed companies to the register in order to enable them to pursue the claims that the applicants have identified as the sole rationale for their restoration.

They concluded that the purpose of the restoration of the companies to the register was to achieve a partial and asymmetric reversal of the GST consequences of the highly contrived and artificial tax avoidance arrangements previously entered into by these companies. In effect, when the tax avoidance arrangements that the companies had previously been a party to were set up the arrangements were a “closed loop” where the net result for GST purposes was a wash. The applicants sought to restore only one half of that loop and make claims against the Commissioner to secure a tax advantage – refunds of GST output tax paid by the removed companies.

Court of Appeal dismisses appeal of application for judicial review of child support assessment
===============================================================================================

The Court of Appeal dismissed P’s appeal and accepted the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“CIR”) had acted correctly in changing P’s child support entitlement to nil.

[TIB Volume 32 No 1 February 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no1)

Case

P(CA85/2019) v CIR & Ors \[2019\] NZCA 531

Legal terms

Ongoing daily care, Change in circumstances

Legislative References

Child Support Act 1991

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed P’s appeal and accepted the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“CIR”) had acted correctly in changing P’s child support entitlement to nil.

### Impact

The judgment confirms the result reached in the High Court. The judgment also offers some guidance regarding the relationship between amending an ongoing assessment at s 82(2) and cessing assessments under s 25.

### Facts

P was the Receiving Carer in respect of A. The liable parent (“W”) resides in Australia. The original assessment was made on the basis P was providing 100% of the “ongoing daily care” of A.

P and W agreed that A would go to Australia to stay with W. A was residing with W from December 2017 to July 2018. The Court found the evidence allowed the CIR to conclude the visit was intended to be for at least six months (par \[13\] of judgment).

The CIR decided there had been a change in circumstances and that the ongoing daily care during this period had changed: that W provided 100% of the ongoing daily care and P had provided none.

P argued there had been no change to the ongoing daily care of A and that she was entitled to receive child support payments during the relevant period. P argued that because the period of time A was staying with W fell over two child support years, there was no change of circumstances in each of the two child support years affected.

The High Court had dismissed P’s judicial review (\[2019\] NZHC 98).

### Issues

Was the CIR correct to form the opinion there had been a change in circumstances in the ongoing daily care of A in the period December 2017 to July 2018?

### Decision

The Court accepted the general scheme of the Child Support Act 1991 (“CSA”) was that the money should follow the child so that the person providing the ongoing daily care received the financial support to do so: par \[4\]

At par \[6\] the Court observed:

Where there has been a request for a formula assessment, the Commissioner is required to establish the proportion of ongoing daily care that each parent and/or non-parent carer provides. The phrase “ongoing daily care” is not defined but it is evident that this is an assessment to be made by the Commissioner on the basis of all the relevant information and with the assistance of other provisions of the Act. For example, in establishing the proportions of ongoing daily care being provided by each carer, the Commissioner is required to rely on any care order or agreement in place. However a parent or carer may challenge the establishing of proportions of care on that basis if there are reasons that a care order or agreement should not be relied on. In addition, if the Commissioner is satisfied that a care order or agreement does not accurately reflect the proportion of ongoing daily care provided, she must establish the proportion of care primarily on the basis of the number of nights that the child spends with the carer. And if the number of nights spent with a carer is not regarded as a true reflection of the proportion of care actually provided then the Commissioner must establish that proportion on the basis of the amount of time the carer is responsible for the daily care of the child.

On the facts of this case the Court of Appeal noted:

\[27\] However, during Ms P’s submissions she conceded that, faced with the fact that A would be in Mr W’s care for a continuous six-month period, the Commissioner was entitled to conclude that a change in circumstances had occurred and to have assessed the 2018 child support year on that basis. This was a responsible concession. **Although “ongoing daily care” is not defined, the ordinary meaning of that phrase conveys continuity of present circumstances into the future. Who has the ongoing daily care of a child is not a retrospective enquiry; rather, it is directed towards the current and prospective situations**. Only once that assessment is made does the past becomes relevant in order to determine (by reference to the past arrangements) whether there has been a change in circumstances. \[Emphasis added\]

The Court continued at\[28\]:

… The parties \[here P and W\] were required by s 82(1)(a) to notify the Commissioner of the change in circumstances because it was a change that might have affected the determination of the cost care percentage. Such notification is required specifically “\[f\]or the purpose of enabling the Commissioner to make or amend a calculation of child support payable in respect of a child”. **The scheme of the Act is clear that the Commissioner must respond to changes in circumstances when they occur and on a prospective basis i.e. assessing entitlements on the basis of ongoing care arrangements**. If the response was determined by past arrangements the integrity and purpose of the scheme would be undermined. \[Emphasis added\]

On these facts the CIR was right to conclude the living circumstances had changed. The combined effect of ss 25(3)(b), 86, and 87 meant the CIR was entitled to alter the existing assessment and did so.

In an obiter dicta footnote the Court specifically excluded the circumstances of this case from the ambit of 82(2) stating:

\[Footnote 36\] …Section 82(2) goes on to specify the dates on which a change of circumstances is to be treated as having occurred where the change either increases the liability of the liable parent or decreases the liability of the receiving carer or where notice of the change was received within 28 days of the change being notified to the Commissioner. **The present case does not fall within those provisions because the result in this case was that the respective liability and entitlement ceased rather than increased or decreased. Cessation of liability is specifically governed by ss 25 and 62. So although s 82 applies generally insofar as it imposes the requirement to notify of changes in circumstances, the effect of the change where liability or entitlement ceases is not affected by s 82(2)**. \[Emphasis added\]

Given the lack of a definition of the phrase “ongoing daily care” and the fact there were no earlier decisions on the phrases, the Court did not award costs to the CIR.

Court of Appeal dismisses Honk Land Trustee Limited's appeal in relation to a $1.1m management fee tax deduction
================================================================================================================

2017 case note - Court of Appeal dismissal of Honk Land Trustee Limited's appeal in relation to a $1.1m management fee tax deduction.

Case

Honk Land Trustees Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 54

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 ss BD 2, BG 1 and GB 1, Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 141B and 141D

### Summary

The Court of Appeal upheld decisions of the High Court and the Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA") confirming the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") disallowance of a $1,116,000 management fee for income tax purposes.The Court of Appeal dismissed Honk Land Trustees Limited’s ("HLT") appeal on the following alternative grounds: (1) there was no satisfactory evidence to show that management services were in fact provided; (2) there was no sufficient nexus shown; and (3) in the event the management fees were deductible, they were nevertheless part of a void tax avoidance arrangement. Additionally, the Court of Appeal agreed that the Commissioner was entitled to impose abusive tax position shortfall penalties.

### Impact

The Court of Appeal provided statements on the deductibility of management fees between related entities, including useful guidance as to what it would expect to see in order to show that management fees were in fact provided.

### Introduction

This case is a further appeal by HLT of the TRA’s decision confirming an assessment made by the Commissioner disallowing a $1,116,000 income tax deduction HLT claimed in the 2005 income year. The deduction related to a management fee that, in its capacity as the corporate trustee of Honk Land Trust ("the Trust"), HLT had paid to a related entity, Honk Land Limited ("HLL").

The High Court (per Ellis J) found that the TRA was correct to find that no management services were provided by HLL to the Trust. HLT appealed Ellis J's decision to the Court of Appeal.

The essence of the decision of the TRA, endorsed by the High Court, was:

1.  The management fees were not deductible because there was insufficient proof they related to any relevant services actually provided by HLL.
2.  Alternatively, the charging of the fees was a contrivance designed to enable the Trust to avoid paying tax.
3.  The imposition by the Commissioner of a 50 per cent shortfall penalty was appropriate on the ground that HLT had taken an abusive tax position.

### Facts

Mr David Andrew Tauber ("Mr Tauber") is the settlor and a discretionary beneficiary of the Trust, which was created in 2002. Initially, HLL was the Trust’s corporate trustee but was replaced in July 2004 by HLT.

In 2005 Mr Tauber was the controlling mind of a number of companies and other entities beneficially owned by the Trust. HLT directly owned Honk Group Limited which, in turn, directly and indirectly owned various other companies undertaking different business activities. HLL was one of those subsidiary companies.

The Trust’s financial statements in the 2005 income year included a management fee expense of $1,116,000 to HLL. The income tax effect of this management fee was that the Trust had no tax to pay. In turn, HLL offset the $1,116,000 payment it received against existing losses with the result that HLL paid no tax on the management fee income.

### Decision

_Were management services provided by HLL to HLT?_

Counsel for HLT submitted that the High Court was wrong to find that HLT had not satisfied the onus of establishing that management services were in fact supplied by HLL to HLT.

Before providing its own analysis, the Court of Appeal set out the reasoning of the High Court and TRA’s findings on this point. The Court of Appeal observed that the TRA had noted the absence of any documentary evidence other than the recording of the expense in the end-of-year financial statements for both entities, and the absence of any detailed evidence of particular services for which the management fees were charged or for what entity particular work was done. The Court of Appeal also observed that the High Court, having reviewed the transcript of the evidence given before the TRA, had concluded that Mr Tauber's evidence was “implausible, contradictory, vague and equivocal”; that there was a lack of clarity in Mr Tauber's evidence about the extent to which the fee charged included an amount for services allegedly provided in the 2004 year; and that there was a surprising and contradictory shift in Mr Tauber's evidence as to which entity had provided the services to the Trust.

While acknowledging that it was not in dispute that the Trust required some management in respect of its own assets and business, the Court of Appeal held that HLT had simply failed to meet the threshold of identifying what management services were provided to the Trust and did not prove they were performed by HLL.

The Court of Appeal referred to the following key points:

1.  in the 2004 income year, HLT paid a total of $378,393 in management fees directly to Basin Ridge Management Limited (Basin Ridge, Mr Tauber's management company) and to another entity associated with Mr Tauber's business associate. HLL did not receive any income from management fees but was charged $424,282 by Basin Ridge;
2.  in the 2005 income year (although according to Mr Tauber HLL undertook the management work for all entities in the Honk Group) HLL was charged management fees totalling $497,970 by Basin Ridge and three other providers. That was necessary because HLL had no employees of its own;
3.  the 2005 income year was the first and only time HLL charged the Trust management fees, and this expense happened to be claimed in the first year the Trust made a profit;
4.  the management fee matched the surplus profit in the Trust and had the effect of eliminating the tax otherwise payable by HLT;
5.  the management fee also enabled HLL to offset the amount received against its losses; and
6.  without the management fee payment, HLT would have been liable to pay tax of $368,280 and HLL would have had a loss of $966,788 for the year.

The Court of Appeal opined that the lack of documentary evidence and the fact that the management fee amount was decided at or after the end of the financial year (and retrospectively allocated monthly by journal entry) was not necessarily fatal for HLT. The problem for HLT was that Mr Tauber had failed to provide any detailed or convincing explanation as to what management services were provided or how the sum charged was calculated.

The Court of Appeal agreed that the proper inference to draw is that the management fees for 2005 were fixed by reference to HLT’s taxable income and for the purpose of eliminating its liability for tax in that year. There was no satisfactory evidence to support the claim that management services were provided by HLL to HLT or in what amount.

_Was the High Court correct to find there was no sufficient nexus shown between the management fees and the earning of HLT’s assessable income and/or in the course of carrying on its business?_

The authorities relating to deductibility of expenses are well known and were not in dispute. HLT submitted that it was difficult to differentiate between management services provided or required for individual entities in the Honk Group. Counsel argued that in such circumstances, with tightly held companies and other entities, it was permissible to take a global approach to the allocation of management fees. This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal for two main reasons. First, s BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“ITA”) is focussed on expenditure by the tax-paying entity concerned and which has the required nexus with the derivation of that taxpayer’s income. Second, the section permits deductions for expenditure only to the extent that it is incurred for any of the purposes identified in that section. The Court of Appeal noted that “to the extent that” contemplates apportionment between expenditure that is properly attributable to the identified statutory purpose and that which is not.

Although the Court of Appeal acknowledged that complete precision may not always be possible with regard to the division of management services between the members of a group, the Court found that the evidence in this case fell well short of even a modest degree of precision.

_Was the High Court correct to hold that if the management fee was deductible, it was part of a tax avoidance arrangement under s BG 1 of the ITA?_

The Court of Appeal also considered the Commissioner’s alternative submission that if the management fees were deductible under s BD 2 of the ITA, then the transaction was part of a tax avoidance arrangement pursuant to s BG 1. The Court of Appeal said they would have had no difficulty agreeing with the High Court that there was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the circumstances in which the management fees were fixed and charged were contrived and artificial and were clearly made for the purpose of eliminating the income tax otherwise payable. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Commissioner that another purpose and effect of the arrangement was not only to eliminate any tax obligation in HLT but was also to transfer taxable profits out of the Trust to HLL which effectively amounted to a loss offset between a company and a trust, which is not permitted.

Additionally the Court of Appeal was satisfied that it would have been unnecessary for the Commissioner to exercise the reconstruction powers available under the ITA. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Commissioner that it was irrelevant that, instead of using the management fee to transfer the Trust profits to HLL, HLT could have distributed the profit to HLL as beneficiary income. Citing the Court’s decision in _Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZCA 40, \[2013\] 2 NZLR 175 at \[39\] and \[40\]_,_ the Court of Appeal held that the question was whether the particular arrangement had the effect of avoiding or reducing any liability to income tax; the issue was not whether the taxpayer would have been equally able to avoid or reduce its liability by implementing a different and permissible arrangement.

_Was the High Court correct to hold that HLT was liable for an abusive tax position penalty under s 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”)?_

The Court of Appeal agreed that the Commissioner was entitled to impose a shortfall penalty under s 141D of the TAA. The basis for the Court’s finding included the following factors: there was clearly a tax shortfall for the 2005 income year, an unacceptable tax position was taken by HLT entering into arrangements with the dominant purpose of reducing or removing its tax liability, and HLT could not have reasonably concluded that it was appropriate to deduct management fees for services not actually provided.

Court of Appeal dismisses taxpayer's appeal in relation to an entitlement to de-register from GST
=================================================================================================

2011 case note - appeal in relation to an entitlement to de-register from GST dismissed – section 52, Lopas test.

Case

Lewis Gaire Herdman Thompson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1986

### Summary

The Court of Appeal found that the taxpayer was not entitled to deregister on 30 November 1999 and was not entitled to deregister until he could satisfy the Commissioner that his taxable supplies would not exceed $30,000 in the forthcoming year. On this basis, the Court determined that the Commissioner's assessments, which assessed output tax on three property transactions sold in the goods and services tax ("GST") period after the Taxpayer's de-registration, were correct. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision that the Commissioner was required to make output tax credit adjustments to the Taxpayer's GST returns in the relevant GST return periods.

### Impact of decision

The test in section 52 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1986 ("GST Act") is not whether a sale was "planned" or "contemplated", but whether the Commissioner has reason to be satisfied that no transaction taking **all** taxable supplies over the (then) $30,000 limit would occur.

### Facts

The land in issue was purchased in 1979 by the appellant, before the advent of GST.

#### Application to deregister for GST purposes

In 1999, the appellant completed a form requesting deregistration for GST purposes with effect from 30 November 1999. When setting out the basis for the request, the appellant selected the statement which read: "I am conducting a taxable activity but my turnover for the next 12 months will be under $30,000".

On 22 December 1999, Inland Revenue sent the appellant a standard form notification of cancellation of his GST registration with effect from 30 November 1999.

#### The land sales transactions of the Rolleston farm

The three separate sales of land effected by the appellant after 30 November 1999 were:

1.  the sale of a 49 hectare block to interests associated with Mr. Horsbrugh (settlement occurred in June 2000);
2.  the sale of a 15 hectare parcel to a family company called Armagh Investments Ltd ("Armagh") (agreement signed on 31 March 2000); and
3.  the sale of the remaining 138 hectare area to Armagh (on 29 September 2000).

### Decision

The Court of Appeal, having noted that the appellant acted in accordance with the professional advice he received, discussed the _Lopas v CIR_ \[2006\] 22 NZTC 19,726 (CA) decision and section 52 of the GST Act.

When considering the obligation to pay GST in respect of taxable supplies, the Court confirmed (following _Lopas_) that the reference in section 52(1) of the GST Act to "the amount specified for the purposes of section 51(1)" is referring to the amount specified in section 51(1)(a), namely $30,000 and that section 52(1) referred to all taxable supplies and did not exclude any sales of capital assets in the running of the business which occurred as a result of the cessation or winding down of the business.

The Court held that:

*   ... it was common ground before us that Mr Thompson was entitled to deregister at 30 November 1999 only if there was a proper basis for the Commissioner to be satisfied that the value of his taxable supplies in the ensuing 12 months would not be more than $30,000. \[24\]

#### The Horsbrugh sale

_Lopas_ identified two conditions that must be met before the Commissioner could be satisfied under section 52(1) that deregistration was appropriate. It must be the case that no sale is planned as at the date of deregistration (or at least not a sale that would mean the $30,000 threshold was exceeded) and the taxable supplies must otherwise be less than $30,000 in the next 12 months.

The appellant focused on whether a sale was planned at the date of deregistration. However, he did not deal with the other condition that if no sale proceeded, the taxable supplies would have been less than $30,000. The appellant continued to receive rent that, in the event that a sale was not planned on the proposed deregistration date, would have still exceeded $30,000.

The Court noted that the appellant emphasised the use of the word "planned" in _Lopas_ whereas the Commissioner argued "contemplated" as used in _Lopas_ better summarised the test. The Court, with respect to both counsel, considered that too much significance was being attached to the wording in _Lopas_. It was a judicial decision, not legislation, the Court in _Lopas_ properly characterised the proposed sale, on the facts in that case, as "planned" but did not suggest that this was a gloss to be placed on the statutory wording of section 52.

After applying the statutory test the Court held that it was required:

*   ... to determine whether, on the facts of the case, the relevant statutory test was met. In the present case, that requires us to assess whether there were grounds for the Commissioner to be satisfied that the value of Mr Thompson's taxable supplies in the 12 months beginning on 30 November 1999 would be not more than $30,000. Given the impending sale of part of the Rolleston property for well over $30,000, there obviously were not. That is all we need to say about this aspect of the appeal. \[35\]

#### The first Armagh sale

The Court upheld Dobson J's decision that the appellant's deregistration on 30 November 1999 was ineffective and that the Commissioner had properly reversed it:

*   ... the first Armagh transaction took place before the subsequent deregistration date of 31 July 2000 and therefore at a time when Mr Thompson remained registered for GST purposes. \[37\]

The Court noted that Dobson J considered whether the first Armagh sale was "planned" but observed that, as previously noted, the statutory test is not whether a transaction is planned but whether the Commissioner has reason to be satisfied that no transaction taking all taxable supplies over the $30,000 limit would occur and in the present case, the appellant would not have been able to satisfy the statutory test at any time before the first Armagh sale.

#### The second Armagh sale

The Court, for the reasons given in relation to the first Armagh sale, considered that the appellant could not satisfy the Commissioner as at 30 November 1999, as at 30 July 2000 or at any time in between that he would not have taxable supplies exceeding $30,000 in the forthcoming year.

However, there had been a dispute between the appellant and the Commissioner over the request to deregister from 30 November 1999 and on 22 October 2002 the Commissioner sent an automatically generated letter that said:

*   Your registration for GST has been cancelled, in terms of Section 52 of the Goods and Services Act 1985, with effect from the taxable period ending 31 JUL 2000.

The Court found that the appellant appeared to have been deregistered by an Inland Revenue Department officer holding the proper authority and was satisfied the Commissioner did deregister the appellant from 31 July 2000.

The appellant argued that a taxpayer must be registered for the relevant GST period before the Commissioner can make an assessment and that he was deregistered at the time of the second Armagh sale. The Commissioner was now time barred from overriding the 31 July 2000 deregistration and validly assessing the appellant for GST on the second Armagh sale.

The Court looked at the effect of section 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which prevents the Commissioner from making an assessment after a four-year period has elapsed from the end date of the relevant taxable period. The relevant taxable period here was 1 August 2000 to 31 January 2001 and the Commissioner did make an assessment within four years of this. A letter confirming this was sent on 24 January 2005.

After interpreting section 108A, the Court held:

*   ... The focus of s 108A is on the assessment, not on the registration ... As Mr Thompson made taxable supplies in the relevant period having a value exceeding the statutory period \[sic\], he was a "person who is required to provide a GST tax return" for the period ending on 31 January 2001. \[55\]

Even someone who has never registered for GST can be assessed if they have made supplies of sufficient value to make them liable to register. The GST Act does not oblige the Commissioner to register a person before making him or her liable for GST, the obligation to apply to register falls on the taxpayer alone.

It was concluded by the Court that the assessment for the period from 1 August 2000 to 31 January 2001 is valid and should have been upheld, and allowed the Commissioner's cross-appeal on this point.

### Results

The appeal by the appellant was dismissed by the Court.

The cross-appeal by the Commissioner was allowed in part upholding the assessment for the GST period ending 31 January 2001.

The cross-appeal by the Commissioner against the High Court decision that the assessment for the period ending 31 July 2000 wrongly included output tax and did not take into account input credits was dismissed.

The alternative tax avoidance argument was not considered. The Court also agreed with the High Court's view that a number of other circumstances might make remission of penalties appropriate and that the there is a "strong basis" for the Commissioner to "acknowledge his Department's contribution to the non-payment of GST ... by any appropriate remission of penalties".

Costs were awarded to the Commissioner.

Court of Appeal finds High Court has no jurisdiction to approve a payment proposal under s 29(1)(b)(iii) of the Insolvency Act 2006
===================================================================================================================================

2017 case note - Court of Appeal finds the High Court has no jurisdiction to approve a payment proposal under the Insolvency Act 2006.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wilson \[2017\] NZCA 100

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 2006, ss 29, 37 and Part 5 Subpart 2 Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 176, 177, 177A and 177B

### Summary

The Court of Appeal allowed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("Commissioner") appeal, finding that the High Court has no jurisdiction, neither inherent nor express under s 29(1)(iii) of the Insolvency Act 2006 ("the Act") to approve a payment proposal in the context of an application by a judgment debtor to set aside a bankruptcy notice.

### Facts

The Commissioner appealed a decision given in the Rotorua High Court, per Christiansen AJ, approving a proposal by Mr Wilson ("the respondent") to pay a debt he owed to the Commissioner (_Wilson v Commissioner of  Inland Revenue_  \[2016\] NZHC 87). The Court of Appeal noted that the Commissioner's appeal raised issues of general importance. The respondent cross-appealed the Associate Judge's order for costs to lie as they fall. The respondent claimed that as his application had succeeded, the Associate Judge should have awarded him costs.

On 17 June 2015, prior to the High Court proceeding, the Commissioner obtained a judgment of $137,353.10 against the respondent for unpaid goods and services tax. On 5 November 2015, the Commissioner served a bankruptcy notice on the respondent in relation to the judgment debt.

The respondent then made a payment proposal to the Commissioner. The Commissioner declined that payment proposal initially on 25 November 2015, and by letter dated 8 December 2015.

On 17 November 2015, after making his payment proposal to the Commissioner, but before the Commissioner had responded to it, the respondent applied to the High Court for orders approving the proposal and setting aside the bankruptcy notice. On 21 December 2015, the respondent asked the Commissioner to reconsider his payment proposal. The Commissioner did so, but on 3 February 2016 again declined the proposal.

The High Court heard the respondent's application, and on 22 April 2016, delivered judgment in favour of the respondent. Following delivery of the High Court judgment, the respondent also applied to the District Court, unsuccessfully, to set aside the judgment debt on which the Commissioner based her bankruptcy notice (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wilson_  \[2016\] NZDC 2012).

### Decision

The Court of Appeal noted that, given the Associate Judge had invoked its inherent jurisdiction in approving the respondent's payment proposal; the Commissioner's submissions had focused on the High Court's inherent jurisdiction and had advanced a detailed argument as to why it was not available.

The Court then noted that the respondent had submitted in his written submissions that the High Court had properly exercised its inherent jurisdiction. However, in his oral argument, the respondent changed direction; his primary submission being that s 29 of the Act gave the Associate Judge an express statutory power to approve the respondent's payment proposal.

_**The statutory provisions – s 29(1)(b)(iii) and part 5 subpart 2 of the Insolvency Act 2006**_

The respondent submitted that s 29(1)(b)(iii) of the Act gave the Court an express statutory power to approve a payment proposal (whether or not the creditor accepted the proposal). The Court of Appeal did not agree with this argument, stating that it did not accord with the interpretation of s 29 required by s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999.

The Court of Appeal found that the purpose of s 29 was to set out the requirements for a valid bankruptcy notice. The Court noted that per s 29 the notice must set out the options available to a debtor to avoid bankruptcy (one being set out in s 29(1)(b)(iii) - to compromise the debt).

The Court also held that the purpose of s 29 was not to confer on the High Court a power to approve a compromise, noting that its purpose was confirmed by the context of s 29 and its position in the Act. The Court found s 29 to be merely a process provision. Further, the Court said that the limited purpose and meaning of s 29 was reinforced by the scheme of the Act, stating that the ability of a debtor to make a payment proposal, and the requirements for such a proposal, were dealt with in Subpart 2 of Part 5.

The Court of Appeal then considered the appropriate meaning to be given to s 29(1)(b)(iii), which provides "\[t\]he bankruptcy notice must … require the debtor … to compromise the amount owing on terms that satisfy the Court or the creditor."

The Court agreed with the Commissioner's submission that "Court" in s 29(1)(b)(iii) should be construed as referring to the Court in its role in approving proposals under Subpart 2 of Part 5, and "creditor" as unrelated to that regime. The Court found support for the Commissioner's interpretation in the prescribed form of the Bankruptcy Notice and in principles of statutory interpretation, noting that the features of Subpart 2 Part 5 achieved results that were sensible, just and workable.

The respondent was constrained to accept that the power in s 29(1)(b)(iii) would not work in circumstances where a debtor had multiple creditors, and sought the Court's approval of a compromise with only the creditor who had served the bankruptcy notice. The Court of Appeal therefore surmised that the respondent was contending for an interpretation of s 29 that would not produce a sensible, just, and workable result.

The Court of Appeal held that the words in s 29(1)(b)(iii) do not confer on the Court the power to approve a compromise and instead the power resided in s 333 of Subpart 2 Part 5.

_**The statutory provisions – ss 177 to 177B of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

The Court of Appeal also significantly held that, where the debtor is a taxpayer seeking to compromise a debt owed to the Commissioner, the debtor must do so by applying for financial relief in terms of ss 177 to 177B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The Court listed the following, as reasons for its finding:

1.  Unique considerations restrain the Commissioner when deciding whether to accept an instalment arrangement, such as, maximising the recovery of outstanding tax, and the proscription on the Commissioner from entering into an instalment arrangement which would place the taxpayer (if a natural person) into serious hardship.
2.  The Commissioner may decline to enter into an instalment arrangement in circumstances set out in s 177B(2) of the TAA, which cannot be reconciled with the creditor voting provisions in s 331 of the Act.
3.  The ability of the Commissioner to cancel an instalment arrangement in the circumstances set out in s 177B(6), again cannot be reconciled with Subpart 2 Part 5, where if creditors vote to accept the payments proposal and the Court approves it, it is binding on all creditors.
4.  A broad application of the maxim that general provisions must yield to specific provisions.

The respondent submitted that the relevant provisions of the TAA were no longer available to the Commissioner once she had obtained judgment in court. He maintained that a "taxpayer" as defined in s 3 of the TAA ceases to be a taxpayer once that person becomes a judgment debtor. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument and stated that entry of judgment against the respondent did not discharge him from his tax obligations, whether accrued or future.

_**Section 37 discretion exercisable at the ‘s 29 stage'**_

Section 37 of the Act sets out the circumstances in which the Court may, in its discretion, refuse to adjudicate a debtor bankrupt when hearing a creditor's application. The respondent contended that the Court could exercise this discretion earlier, when considering whether to approve a payment proposal by a debtor served with a bankruptcy notice.

The Court of Appeal rejected this argument on a number of grounds. Firstly, on the basis that they had held firmly against the submission that s 29(1)(b)(iii) gave the Court power to approve a payment proposal. Secondly, s 333 of the Act (a provision in Subpart 2 Part 5) contained detailed provisions as to the Court's approval of a payment proposal. Lastly, on the ground that it "mauls" the language of s 37 to suggest that the discretion applies earlier in the bankruptcy process.

_**Commissioner bound by concession as to jurisdiction**_

The Court also rejected the respondent's final argument, that the Commissioner was bound by her purported concession before the Associate Judge "that the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to entertain … a payment proposal when considering an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice".

The Court of Appeal did not consider that the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to approve a payment proposal by a debtor, when the creditor or creditors have rejected the proposal. The Court found that such an inherent jurisdiction would cut right across the proposals regime in Subpart 2 Part 5 of the Act. The Court also noted that a party or parties cannot, by consent or by concession, vest in a Court a jurisdiction which it does not have.

The Court agreed with the Commissioner that if the respondent wished to challenge the Commissioner's decision to reject his payment proposal, his remedy was to apply for judicial review of the Commissioner's decision.

The Court of Appeal also explicitly overruled the decision _FM Custodians_ (_FM Custodians Ltd v McNally_ \[2013\] NZHC 34),(which had been relied upon by Christiansen AJ in the High Court judgment) in so far as it held s 29(1)(b)(iii) gave the Court the power to approve a payment proposal.

_**Cross-appeal**_

The Court of Appeal provided that, given their finding that the High Court lacked the jurisdiction to approve the respondent's payment proposal, the cross-appeal against the Associate Judge's costs order went away. 

_**Result**_

The Court of Appeal allowed the Commissioner's appeal and dismissed the cross-appeal of the respondent.

Court of Appeal finds in favour of the Commissioner with regard to application of casting votes at a watershed meeting
======================================================================================================================

2011 case note - confirms CIR's interpretation of when a casting vote can be used in a watershed meeting - voluntary administration, Deeds of Company Arrangement.

Case

Damien Grant & Steven Khov v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993

### Summary

A casting vote can only be used to break a deadlock between a number of creditors for or against a Deed of Company Arrangement ("DOCA"). It cannot be used to overcome a shortfall in support from the creditors representing 75% of the company's total debt.

Furthermore any DOCA which does not take into account the Commissioner's preferential debt in liquidation may be terminated by the Courts.

### Impact of decision

The ruling confirms the Commissioner's interpretation of when a casting vote can be used in a watershed meeting.

### Facts

On 5 December 2008, the appellants were appointed voluntary administrators for three publishing companies. There was common ownership and directorship of the three companies (with a minor exception). The one of particular relevance to this matter is Jones Publishing Limited.

During a voluntary administration there must be a watershed meeting. At the watershed meeting a DOCA can be proposed. Under section 239AK(2) of the Companies Act 1993 ("the Act"), for a DOCA to be passed it has to be adopted by a majority in number (of the creditors) representing 75% in value (a "super-majority" of the total debt).

Jones Publishing Limited went into voluntary administration. At the watershed meeting a DOCA was proposed. The Commissioner voted against and the seven other creditors voted for the resolution. The Commissioner was owed roughly 30% of the total debt. Therefore, the seven other creditors did not get the required 75% supermajority. The appellants argued at the watershed meeting, and continued to argue in the Courts, that they were entitled to exercise a casting vote in this situation. The Commissioner argued that the casting vote can only be exercised when required to break a deadlock in number (for example, five creditors vote for and five against) but not to break a deadlock between the number of creditors and the required super-majority of 75% of the total debt.

It is also significant to note that, while New Zealand legislation was clearly influenced by the Australian equivalent Act, New Zealand has enacted a super-majority provision whereas Australia only requires a plain majority.

The High Court had confirmed the Commissioner's view, and this was an appeal of that decision.

### Issues  

There were two issues to be considered by the Court of Appeal:

1.  The meaning of the term "casting vote" in section 239AK(3) of the Act - specifically whether an administrator, acting as chair of the watershed meeting, can exercise a casting vote when the majority of a company's creditors vote in favour of a resolution but lack the statutorily prescribed super-majority in value.
2.  Whether a DOCA is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial under section 239ADD(2) of the Act if it fails to take into account the preferential position that a creditor would have had under the Act if liquidation had occurred and, if this happened in this case, whether the Court should use its discretion to terminate the DOCA.

### Decision

Regarding the casting vote issue; the chair of a watershed meeting may only use a casting vote where (as per Stephens J):

*   the votes for and against the resolution are equal in number (Condition 1). But before the casting vote may be used, the votes in favour of the resolution must also represent at least 75 per cent of the value of the debt (Condition 2). In other words, **a casting vote can only be used to break a numerical deadlock so as to comply with Condition 1. It cannot be used to make up any shortfall in relation to value under Condition 2**.  
    \[Emphasis added\]

Regarding the DOCA being oppressive or unfairly prejudicial by not taking into account the Commissioner's preference on liquidation; the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that termination of a DOCA is likely if consequent priorities in liquidation are not acknowledged by the DOCA. Stevens J said:

*   We have no doubt that it is completely artificial to consider only the position at the time of the voting process. To exclude from the assessment what will happen on liquidation is to view only half the story … It is now the norm in cases of voluntary administration for the Commissioner's preferential debts to be recognised in the DOCA.

Court of Appeal holds doctrine of estoppel per rem judicatum applies and dismisses appeal
=========================================================================================

2016 case note – appeal dismissed on basis that the question had been previously determined - exceptional circumstances, estoppel per rem judicatum.

Case

The Webster Group of Appellants v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZCA 31

Legislative References

Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1998, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's appeal on the basis that the question for determination on appeal, namely, whether the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) erred in granting the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") an extension of time to file cases stated had been previously determined by the Court of Appeal.  

### Facts

In 2000, the TRA granted leave to the Commissioner to file cases stated against 28 taxpayers in the TRA out of time on the basis of there being exceptional circumstances.

In 2002, the Court of Appeal upheld the TRA's decision, dismissing the objectors' application for judicial review and a subsequent application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council.

The TRA then heard and dismissed the objections to the Commissioner's assessments.   Numerous challenges to the TRA's decision by way of applications for judicial review and appeal were unsuccessful.  The appellants asked the TRA to state a case for the High Court’s determination under s 26 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994.  The TRA posed 13 discrete questions to the High Court.  On 13 November 2013, Ellis J decided all questions in the Commissioner's favour.

The appellant appealed Ellis J's finding on the first question, namely whether the objections of the Webster Group should be allowed because the Commissioner should not have been granted an extension of time to file the cases in the TRA.  In relation to this question, Ellis J found that the Commissioner did not did not need an extension of time because the date on which Webster was bound to serve its points of objection notice was never formally triggered and so the time limit for the Commissioner to state cases in the TRA never started to run.  The objections should not therefore have been allowed on that ground.

In the Court of Appeal, the appellants sought to challenge the TRA's original decision granting an extension of time to the Commissioner to file a case stated on a recently new ground of challenge that the Commissioner had failed to follow the correct procedural requirements.  The appellants invoked this new argument based upon the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 ("TRAR") reg 4(3), that the Commissioner was out of time in filing a case stated in the TRA from 12 August 1996, being three months after the appellants served its points of objection.

The appellant’s proposition was that the whole hearing process was a nullity because the Commissioner filed his originating pleading in one forum, the High Court, instead of in the TRA.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal considered that the TRA should not have stated in 2013 the same question which had been finally determined in 2002 in the _Wetherill_ (_M & J Wetherill Co Ltd v Taxation Review Authority_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 577 (CA)) judicial review, namely whether the TRA erred in granting the Commissioner an extension of time to file cases stated.  The High Court should have declined to answer the same question on the basis that the doctrine of estoppel per rem judicatum applies.

In any event, the Court of Appeal considered that even if the Commissioner was out of time in stating cases, exceptional circumstances exist which would justify granting an extension under TRAR reg 8.

The appeal was dismissed.

Court of Appeal holds that expenditure incurred in deriving dividends is deductible pursuant to s DB 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007
==================================================================================================================================

In its tax returns for the 2011 and 2012 income years, NRS Media Holdings Ltd (“NRS”) claimed deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving exempt foreign dividends.

Case

NRS Media Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZCA 472

Legal terms

Expenditure, Nexus, Dividends, Capital limitation, General permission

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007, s DA 1, DA 2 and DB 55  
  

### Summary

In its tax returns for the 2011 and 2012 income years, NRS Media Holdings Ltd (“NRS”) claimed deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving exempt foreign dividends. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) disallowed those deductions on the basis that the expenditure did not have the necessary nexus with the dividends.

NRS commenced challenge proceedings in the High Court; Clark J upholding the Commissioner’s determination (NRS Media Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 2978, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-048). NRS appealed and the Court of Appeal held that the expenses for which NRS claimed deductions represent recurrent and regular business expenses, which are all manifestly revenue expenses. The Court of Appeal accordingly held that NRS ought to be entitled to a deduction for these expenses.

### Impact

This case illustrates that there is little support in the authorities that for expenditure to be deductible under s DB 55 of the Income Tax Act (“the ITA”), a taxpayer has to show a direct link between the expenditure incurred and the derivation of dividends. The authorities also do not suggest that there is any great distinction between the tests for nexus under either subs 1(a) or 1(b) of s DA 1. What is required is the application of the statutory language to the particular circumstances.

### Facts

NRS was the sole or majority shareholder of several subsidiaries (the subsidiaries). Two were incorporated in the United Kingdom, one was incorporated in Australia and another was incorporated in Canada. Those subsidiaries derived income by facilitating the purchase of media time by their client advertisers. Central to that business was software developed and licensed to them by a sister company of NRS, Persuaders Concepts (NZ) Ltd (Persuaders). For its part as parent company, NRS set the strategic plan for its group as a whole, and for each of its subsidiaries. In turn, it approved and monitored the business plans and the business activities of its subsidiaries as they operated within those strategic plans. It was in undertaking those activities that NRS incurred the expenses in question.

NRS categorised those expenses as comprising “payroll and consultants”, “marketing and travel”, “rent and occupancy” and “overheads”. These expenses totalled $1,706,568.23 and $1,963,472.31 in the 2011 and 2012 income years respectively.

NRS described the overall objective of its activities as being:

1.  to maximise the financial return to the shareholders of NRS through increased dividends from the NRS subsidiaries, for the benefit of NRS; and
2.  to enable NRS and its Board to discharge their obligations as parent company, from a legal governance perspective. The NRS subsidiaries were self-sufficient, with their own accounting, sales and management teams, and did not require support or services to be provided by NRS to operate on a day-to-day basis.

### Decision

_Nexus required under s DB 55 of the ITA_

After having considered _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Banks_ \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 (CA), as well as _Buckley & Young Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485 (CA), the Court of Appeal noted Richardson J spoke in the alternative of "the gaining or producing of his assessable income" and "with the carrying on of a business for that purpose" without distinction as regards nexus. In light of this, it concluded that Richardson J appeared to see no reason to distinguish between the approach called for on that issue as regards the two provisions.

The Court of Appeal also held that there was little, if any, support that for the claimed expenditure to be deductible under s DB 55 of the ITA, NRS needed to show that the expenditure was:

1.  directly linked to its exempt foreign dividend income in a positive way;
2.  factually and casually directed to the production of the dividend income; and
3.  incurred in the course of producing the dividend income.

The authorities do not seem to suggest a distinction between the tests for nexus under either of subs 1(a) or 1(b) of s DA 1. Rather, what is required is the application of the statutory language – here "the amount of expenditure incurred by the company in deriving the dividend" – to the particular circumstances.

The Court of Appeal also held that the case of _Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1974\] 2 NZLR 737 (CA), did not support the nexus characterisation adopted by the Commissioner and the High Court, and that _Thornton Estates Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1995) 17 NZTC 12,230 (HC), did not add much to that analysis. The legislative history also did not support the Commissioner's interpretation of s DB 55.

As to whether the nexus between NRS "expenditure and the deriving of dividend income has the necessary characteristics to support deductibility, the Court of Appeal noted that NRS" business was, as its witnesses described, to promote the interests of its shareholder investors by maximising the value of their investment and that there could be little doubt that the activities NRS engaged in for that overall purpose bore the necessary nexus with the deriving of the dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries.

After having considered Mr Gold's evidence, director of NRS, the Court of Appeal held that the necessary nexus did exist between the claimed expenditure and the exempt dividend income derived.

_Whether NRS' expenditure was of a capital nature pursuant to s DA 2 of the ITA?_

The Court of Appeal noted that the approach for determining whether expenditure is of a capital nature is settled, as demonstrated by the Court's decision in _Easy Park Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2018\] NZCA 296, (2018) 28 NZTC 23-066. Ultimately the focus must be on what the expenditure was calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view.

The Court of Appeal held that NRS' business operations were, fundamentally, the oversight of its subsidiaries. The real value in the media business operated by NRS and NRS' subsidiaries was in the intellectual property of their business systems. From a practical and business point of view, NRS' expenditure was calculated to simply facilitate the operations of the subsidiaries rather than to improve the capital of the subsidiaries. In this respect, the Court of Appeal held that the expenses for which NRS claimed deductions represent recurrent and regular business expenses that NRS was entitled to deduct.

Court of Appeal indicates that the statutory notice requirements regarding the payment of GST in property transactions cannot be waived
=======================================================================================================================================

2017 case note - statutory notice requirements regarding the payment of GST in property transactions cannot be waived – 'zero-rated', 'waiver'.

Case

Y&P NZ Limited v Yang Wang and Chen Zhang \[2017\] NZCA 280

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, ss 11 and 78F Tax Administration Act 1994, s 14C

### Summary

This is a dispute between a vendor and purchaser involving the payment of goods and services tax (“GST”) in a property transaction. The dispute concerned whether there had been a waiver of the statutory notice requirement regarding the payment of GST under s 14C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) and s 78F of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GSTA”). The Attorney-General was joined to the appeal as intervener.

### Impact

This decision indicates that courts will be inclined to find that the statutory notice requirement under s 78F of the GSTA cannot be waived.

### Facts

The appellant entered into agreements to sell various properties to the respondents (“the agreements”). The purchase price was $2,430,000 “\[p\]lus GST (if any)”. Schedule 2 to the agreements recorded that the respondents were not, and at settlement would not be, registered for GST and that they did not intend at settlement to use the properties for making taxable supplies. This meant that GST at 15 per cent was payable on the purchase price.

At settlement, a dispute arose. The appellant insisted there had not been proper notice of a change to the respondent’s GST position under s 78F(2) of the GSTA and s 14C of the TAA, which meant that GST on the purchase would be zero-rated. The respondents issued summary judgment proceedings seeking an order that the appellant settle on the zero-rated basis. They also sought an order that caveats they had lodged against the properties not lapse. The High Court held that summary judgment was not appropriate, but did, however, make an order sustaining the caveats, as in the Court’s opinion, it was reasonably arguable that in issuing zero-rated settlement statements, the appellant had waived its right to timely written notice of the relevant GST information. The current proceeding is an appeal of this decision.

### The High Court Decision

The High Court considered that, if the respondent purchasers failed to provide written notification of the matters under s 78F(2) of the GSTA, the appellant vendor was entitled to proceed on the basis that GST at 15 per cent applied. The High Court also considered that the requirement under 14C of the TAA for written notice could be waived, because the notice requirement was for the convenience of the vendor. The High Court also had the same view of the contractual obligation to provide written notice of any change to the purchasers’ GST status.

The High Court considered that it was not appropriate to grant summary judgment. First, because the respondents had not included in their pleading evidence that they informed the appellant that they did not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence, and second, as they had not pleaded that they were ready, willing and able to settle.

The High Court found that an order sustaining the caveats was appropriate because it was reasonably arguable that in issuing zero-rated settlement statements, the appellant had waived its right to timely written notice of the relevant GST information. If so, the appellant was not entitled to insist on settlement on the basis of GST at 15 per cent, its settlement notices issued on that basis would be invalid, and the agreements would remain on foot.

### The Appeal

_The arguments_

The appellant submitted that the High Court was wrong to find there was a reasonably arguable basis for sustaining the caveats. It submitted that the statutory requirement for written notice of the s 78F(2) matters cannot be waived by a vendor and that there was no waiver of the contractual requirement for notice at least two working days before settlement.

The Attorney-General supported the appellant’s submission that the requirement for notice of the s 78F(2) matters cannot be waived. He submitted that s 78F of the TAA exists primarily for the benefit of the tax base and to enable the efficient functioning of the GST system. As such, its requirements cannot be waived by a vendor. He also submitted that s 11(1)(mb) of the GSTA has a mandatory effect. Regardless of what the vendor knows at settlement, GST is zero-rated if the criteria in s 11(1)(mb) are met. Where the wrong rate of GST is applied at settlement, there are provisions to correct the position.

_The decision_

The Court stated that, in order to sustain the caveat, the respondents must establish a reasonably arguable case that they have a relevant interest in the properties.

The Court considered that it was arguable that the provision of amended settlement statements with zero-rated GST, together with a request for GST numbers which were provided, was a waiver of the contractual requirement for written notice. The Court also considered that it was arguable there was no effective withdrawal of the waiver. The respondents had proceeded on the basis that settlement would be on a zero-rated GST basis. The appellant then sought to insist on the contractual provisions on the day of settlement as though there had never been any waiver.

The Court stated that the issue of statutory waiver did not arise, because the statute requires the notice to be given by or on settlement. The respondents could have complied with the statute by giving notice on the day of settlement. The Court expressed reservations about the High Court’s view that the statutory position could be waived. Although it was not necessary for the Court of Appeal to decide this point, the Court considered that there was force in the Attorney-General’s submission that the provision is for the benefit of the tax base and not for the sole benefit of the vendor.

The Court concluded that the respondents arguably had a caveatable interest in the properties.

**Result**

The appeal was dismissed. The appellant was to pay the respondents costs for a standard appeal on a Band A basis and usual disbursements.

Court of Appeal remits Liquidation matter back to High Court
============================================================

2017 case note - Court of Appeal remits Liquidation matter back to High Court - insolvency, core debt, issue estoppel, res judicata, off-set, counterclaim.

Case

Sisson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 326

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 2006

### Summary

Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (“CPL”) was placed into liquidation by the High Court following the issuing of a statutory demand by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”). CPL appealed that decision on the basis that it was not insolvent and the debt was disputed. Following a one-day hearing in the Court of Appeal, the Court allowed the appeal on the basis that the amount of “core debt” was not quantified by the High Court (_Sisson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZCA 326). The variability in the figures relied on by the Commissioner and the unchallenged value of CPL’s assets meant that it was at least open to doubt that the Court could properly make a liquidation order.

### Facts

CPL was placed into liquidation by Associate Judge Osborne in the High Court on 6 October 2015, having failed to comply with a statutory demand for $1,231,940.11 served by the Commissioner (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chesterfields Preschools Ltd_ \[2015\] NZHC 2440, (2015) 27 NZTC 22-029.

Ms Sisson (a director of CPL) appealed that decision on behalf of CPL, and contended that CPL was not insolvent and that the Commissioner’s claim for unpaid tax, interest and penalties is disputed. The Commissioner responded that CPL is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from asserting that the claim is in dispute in view of an earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chesterfields Preschools Limited_ \[2010\] NZCA 400, (2010) 24 NZTC 24,500).

### Decision

After running through the lengthy background to the litigation, the Court held that at no point had the amounts of “undisputed core debt” or “core tax” been considered or identified by the High Court (at \[54\]). The Court found that the core tax not in dispute was $109,675.22. This was the difference between $1,136,138.36 (the amount identified by Mr Doubleday in his 2009 affidavit as being core tax plus shortfall penalties) and $1,026,463.14 (the amount paid by CPL according to the Commissioner’s letter setting out the proposed 15% reduction in penalties and interest) (at \[76(f)\]).

The Court went on to find that the evidence suggested that CPL had total assets of $1,017,094.60, made up of term deposits at ANZ Bank, the property at 854 Colombo Street, and an as yet unpaid insurance pay-out of $138,064.77 (at \[80\] – \[83\]). The Court noted that this was slightly shy of Mr Doubleday’s calculation of the total debt at July 2008 of $1,088,461.15, and exceeded by a wide margin Mr Brightly’s calculation of the total debt at December 2006 of $827,304.62 (at \[83\]).

The Court held that the difference between the revised debt claim and CPL’s asset position appeared to be comparatively narrow. Further, the variability in the figures relied on by the Commissioner and the unchallenged value of CPL’s assets meant that it was at least open to doubt that the High Court could properly have made a liquidation order (at \[86\]).

The proper course was to allow the appeal, set aside the liquidation order, and remit the matter back for rehearing in the High Court where greater scrutiny can be given to the figures of both sides.

However, that order was conditional on Ms Sisson, on behalf of CPL, paying into the High Court at Christchurch the amount of $109,675.22 within 15 working days of this judgment (at \[88\]).

Aside from the liquidation issue, the Court also held that the doctrine of res judicata applied to any challenge to CPL’s liability for 85% of the penalties. As such, the so-called Taxation Review Authority and Notice of Proposed Adjustment proceedings did not live on in isolation from the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal in the judicial review proceedings. However, the precise amount of the reduction and the consequent level of CPL’s indebtedness had not been determined, and so CPL could test the accuracy and methodology of the Commissioner’s calculation in the High Court (at \[102\] – \[103\]).

The Court also held that CPL could not rely on potential damages claims associated with the alleged failure of the Commissioner to disclose information as an off-set or counterclaim against amounts owed in core tax and penalties (at \[107\]).

Court of Appeal says omission to act can be aiding or abetting
==============================================================

2009 case note - Confirmation that director omitting to do an act can mean director aided the company's offence - Aiding or abetting, employee, officer or agent.

Case

Neil George Evans v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer appealed against a High Court decision that a director of a company had aided or abetted the company to commit a tax offence (section 148 of the Tax Administration Act). The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision and confirmed that an omission by a director to do an act can mean that the director aided the company to offend.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that the absence of the word "omission" from section 148 of the Tax Administration Act ("TAA") does not preclude the Commissioner from charging a director or any other with an offence when they have "omitted" to do an act required of them. The Commissioner can also charge an employee, officer or agent of a company under section 148 of the TAA even though section 147 is a specific section relating to employees, officers or agents of a company.

### Facts

The Appellant was the sole director of a company which was charged with a number of offences under section 143A of the TAA.  The charges related to using PAYE deductions for purposes other than payment to the Commissioner. The responsibility for paying the PAYE deductions to the Commissioner on behalf of the company lay with the Appellant. The Appellant was charged under section 148 of the TAA as a person who aided or abetted another to commit an offence against the Act.

In the District Court, the company was found guilty of the offences charged. The Appellant was found not guilty. The Judge held that the prosecution had not proved that the Appellant had actively assisted the company to commit the offences.

The Commissioner appealed to the High Court by way of case stated, the questions of law being posed by the Judge being:

*   Was I wrong in concluding in the circumstances of this case that section 148 of the TAA 1994 requires the informant to prove that the defendant actively assisted the company in its offending?
*   Was the only conclusion available to me that the sole director Neil George Evans was also guilty of the offences as a party?

In a decision dated 2 July 2008, Wylie J allowed the appeal. The Appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal.

The Appellant's main grounds for appealing were that because he did not write out a cheque for the PAYE he had committed an "omission" and that an "omission" was not an act but rather a failure to act, therefore he could not aid or abet.

He argued that section 147 of the TAA 1994 (which relates to offences by employees, agents or officers of a body corporate) has specific reference to an offence if an "omission" occurs because of them.

He also argued that sections 66 of the Crimes Act 1961 is similar to section 148 of the TAA in that it relates to parties to an offence. However the Crimes Act section captures "omissions" whereas section 148 of the TAA does not.

The Commissioner argued that the language within section 148 was wide enough for the "omission" to act to be within the "aiding or abetting" part of the offence.

### Decision

MacKenzie J giving the decision of the Court held:

Section 147 applies to a limited category of offences (committed by a body corporate) and to a limited category of persons (employees, agents or officers of the body corporate). Section 148 is a more general application and the liability it imposes may arise from the conduct of any other person. There is no necessary nexus between the two persons beyond that which creates the conduct constituting a breach of the section. Section 148 is expressly linked to all other offence provisions including section 147. **The two sections are not mutually exclusive.**

Section 148 in its use of the terms "aids, abets, incites" creates a secondary liability akin to that created by section 66(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the Crimes Act 1961. Both concepts of doing and omitting an act fall within the ordinary concepts of the word "aids". The concept of aiding is expanded on in section 66(1)(b) to apply to a person who "does or omits for the purpose of aiding". The view that section 66(1)(b) is not intended to expand the ordinary meaning of the term "aids" is consistent with section 66 being a codification of the common law concept. Section 148 of the TAA is not intended to limit the scope of "aiding" by excluding passive conduct, or an omission to act. The court also considered it worthy of note that the offence with which the company was charged (section 143A) was an act of "commission" not "omission".

Aiding does not include every omission by a person who is aware of, and has the capacity to intervene, in offending by another, _R v Coney_ (1882) 8 QBD 534. The question to be asked is whether an omission to act is that of a passive spectator amounting only to non interference to prevent a crime or whether it crosses the line so as to be an omission for the purpose of aiding the commission of the offence? That is a question of fact. The Appellant in taking the step of paying other creditors provided active assistance to the company in the commission of the offence.

In relation to whether or not both the principal and the company can be liable for the same offence the court found that the director's state of mind can constitute the necessary _mens rea_ for both the liability of the company and the accessory liability of the director, _Fleming v Ellicott_ \[1961\] NZLR 106 and _CIR v Leslie_ (1985) 7 NZTC 5,101 (HC).

On the second issue of failing to act when a legal duty is imposed to act, the court found that, it is not in general terms necessary to establish a legal duty to intervene on the part of a bystander before any failure to intervene gives rise to accessory liability, _Coney_. The duties of a director to act may be relevant to a decision of whether or not they "aided or abetted" but is not decisive of it.

Court of Appeal says Privy Council decision in relation to bank cheques and drafts binding
==========================================================================================

2009 case note – Unless the Supreme Court finds otherwise unclaimed bank cheques and drafts will be treated as unclaimed money – nature of instruments.

Case

Westpac BNZ ANZ v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Unclaimed Money)

Legislative References

Unclaimed Money Act 1971

### Summary

The Court of Appeal held that it must follow the Privy Council decision in _CIR v Thomas Cook (NZ) Limited_ (2006) 2 NZLR 722 (PC), as it considered unpresented bank cheques fell under the definition of unclaimed money in section 4 of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 ("UMA").

### Impact of decision

Unless the Supreme Court agrees to hear an appeal and finds otherwise, bank cheques and drafts which remain unclaimed, will be treated as unclaimed money under the UMA. The decision of the Privy Council in _CIR v Thomas Cook_ will apply.

### Background facts

The Appeal relates to the meaning and effect of the UMA. In the High Court McKenzie J was satisfied that in respect of bank cheques the issuing banks are holders of unclaimed monies under section 4(1)(e) of the UMA.

McKenzie J held that the decision of the Privy Council in _CIR v Thomas Cook_ \[2006\] 2 NZLR 722 (PC) was dispositive of the case. However he also reached the conclusion independently of the Privy Council decision.

The Court of Appeal indicated that if they found the decision of the Privy Council in _CIR v Thomas Cook_ binding they would not need to decide on the independent decision of McKenzie J.

### Issues and decision

Whether or not the Court of Appeal is bound in the circumstances by the decision in _Thomas Cook_? Young P and Robertson J addressed the arguments presented by Mr Kós:

##### Alleged incorrect legal or factual assumptions by the Privy Council as to the liabilities of the drawer of a bills of exchange

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that their Lordships fully comprehended the nature of the instruments involved and that the definitions contained in section 4(1) of the UMA had to be read within the context of the UMA and not just as an adjunct to the Bills of Exchange Act 1908.

##### Absence of full argument before the Privy Council on present liability to pay

Although it was apparent that the basis upon which _Thomas Cook_ was decided in the Privy Council arose for the first time in that court, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the metes and bounds of the argument were discussed, assessed and adjudicated upon.

##### Alleged assumption that the obligations of _Thomas Cook_ were within section 4(1)(e)

The Privy Council in _Thomas Cook_ ruled that the amounts for which the bank cheques and drafts were drawn are "money" within section 4(1)(e) of the UMA and were owing and payable to the banks' customers. The Court of Appeal disagreed with Mr Kós that this was a mere assumption on the part of the Privy Council. It was found that the particular issue had been live in the Court of Appeal and was resolved against Thomas Cook. The conclusions by the Privy Council that the obligations of Thomas Cook were money for the purposes of section 4(1)(e), was a necessary part of the ratio of the case and is binding on the Court of Appeal.

#### The statutory history of the UMA

Mr Kós argued that the course events took in the Privy Council meant that the statutory history of the UMA was overlooked. The overlooked statutory history was described by Robertson J as "too frail a premise" for the Court to decide that the Privy Council judgment was decided _per incuriam_. Furthermore the interpretation argued for was selective and ignored earlier, consistent definitions of "payable".

### Separate findings of Baragwanath J

Baragwanath J, agreed with Young P and Robertson J and held that the Privy Council was right because it recognised that its task was to construe the UMA not the Bills of Exchange Act 1908. Section 4 of the UMA states what unclaimed money shall consist of. He saw no reason why the money should become a "windfall" in the hands of the bank. Part (1)(e) of section 4 can be construed textually to like effect to (1)(a) to (d) and there is no reason why it should receive a purposive construction to different effect. Part (1)(e) states:

(e) Any other money, of any kind whatsoever, which has been **owing** by any holder for the period of 6 years immediately following the date on which the money has become **payable** by the holder:  
\[Emphasis added\]

He then found that the broader and not the narrower construction of "owing" and "payable" must be adopted.

The Appeal was dismissed and costs awarded to the Commissioner.

Court of Appeal upholds High Court decision declining an application for discovery of material exchanged pursuant to a Double Taxation Agreement
================================================================================================================================================

2016 case note – application for discovery of material exchanged pursuant to a Double Taxation Agreement declined - Exchange of Information.

Case

Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZCA 614

Legislative References

Sections 17 and 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 69 and 70 of the Evidence Act 2006, s 10(2)(i) of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

The Appellant brought an appeal against a decision of the High Court declining an application for discovery of material (“the Documents”) exchanged pursuant to a Double Taxation Agreement (“DTA”) between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the documents were not required to be discovered but differed from the High Court on the basis for that decision. The Court considered that the documents for which discovery was sought had not been shown to be relied on by the Appellant, or to adversely affect its case or to adversely affect or support another party’s case. Accordingly the Court of Appeal considered that there was no basis for the making of a discretionary order for discovery and dismissed the appeal.

### Facts

The Appellant appealed against a decision of the High Court declining an application for discovery of material (“the Documents”) exchanged pursuant to the DTA.

The decision of the High Court was reflected by judgments of Ellis J dated 1 September 2015 (Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZHC 2099, (2015) 27 NZTC 22-024) and 9 June 2016 (Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1234, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-053), and by minute of Ellis J dated 19 May 2016 (Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC Auckland CIV-2015-404-1013 19 May 2016).

The substantive proceeding in which the application for discovery was advanced is an application for review of decisions made by the Commissioner to issue notices to the Appellant under s 17 of the TAA for information held on various parties for whom the Appellant was the "tax agent" for the purposes of ss 33 and 34B of the TAA. (Note the judgment refers to issuing notices unser s 17 "to various parties for whom Chatfield was the 'tax agent'".)

The Appellant’s substantive litigation originally involved two causes of action. The first was that the Appellant had a legitimate expectation under operational statement OS 13/02 (_Operational Statement: Section 17 notices_ Inland Revenue, OS 13/02, 14 August 2013). The second was that the Commissioner failed to consider the terms of OS 13/02, the limited nature of the tax agent/client relationship and the DTA. The first cause of action and the first two limbs of the second cause of action were struck out by Lang J on 27 September 2016 (Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) \[2016\] NZHC 2289, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-072).

This left the allegation that in making the decision to issue the s 17 notices the Commissioner failed to consider the DTA as the last remaining cause of action.

The strike out decision has also been appealed but had not been heard as of the date of the current appeal. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal was required to proceed on the basis that only one part of the original pleading remains to be argued in the substantive judicial review proceedings.

In the decision under appeal, Ellis J concluded that the only aspect of the pleading to which the Documents would relate (namely the allegation that the Commissioner failed to take into account the DTA) was unlikely to be justiciable and the Documents were not required to be disclosed (Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1234, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-053 at \[22\]).

### Decision

The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the documents were not required to be disclosed; although on a different basis. As a result the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

The Court of Appeal highlighted that discovery in judicial review proceedings is not available as of right. The power of the Court to grant discovery in judicial review proceedings is discretionary and contrasts with the position that applies in an ordinary proceeding.

Since 1 February 2012, the High Court Rules have provided for two kinds of discovery, namely “standard discovery” and “tailored discovery”. References in the new rule to the cases of the parties means that relevance will still be a hallmark of what has to be discovered. The relevance of a document for discovery purposes must be assessed having regard to the pleaded claim.

The sole effective pleading, following the strike out by Lang J, was that the Commissioner failed to consider “the DTA, and in particular the terms of Article 25 of Schedule 1 to the DTA”.

The Court noted the difficulty that immediately rose for the Appellant is that it is clear that the Commissioner did consider Article 25; it was only by virtue of this Article that the Commissioner was able to issue the notices under s 17 of the TAA.

The Court was not persuaded by the Appellant’s attempts to particularise the last remaining cause of action at hearing and did not consider it was enough to support a discovery order under s 10(2)(i) of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972. In light of this, the Court of Appeal considered that the application indicated that the Appellant was “fishing”.

The Court noted the fundamental point to be made is that the pleading as it stands makes an assertion that is apparently incorrect on its face since it is clear the Commissioner did take the DTA into account. There is no basis in the pleading for making a discretionary order for discovery. Whilst there are important issues at stake when the Court is asked to order discovery in a case involving a request made by a foreign state under a DTA, when examined against the last remaining cause of action, the documents for which discovery is sought have not been shown to be relied on by the Appellant, or to adversely affect its case or to adversely affect or support another party’s case.

Court of Appeal upholds High Court's decision granting Commissioner's transfer application
==========================================================================================

2015 case note – Court of Appeal upheld High Court decision granting CIR's application - transfer, precedential value, complexity, likelihood of appeal.

Case

Kensington Developments Limited (in Receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision granting the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner's") application to transfer the challenge proceeding filed by Kensington Developments Limited's (in receivership) ("Kensington") in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") to the High Court.

### Impact of decision

This decision endorsed the factors set out in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Erris Promotions_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 506 (CA) ("_Erris_"), which are required to be considered by the Court in determining whether to grant a transfer application under s 138N of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). This decision is also authority that the important precedential value of a proceeding alone can be determinative in favour of granting an application for transfer.

### Facts

Kensington has been in receivership since 1994 with Mr John Russell ("Mr Russell") as the receiver.

Kensington has claimed interest expenditure deductions for a purported loan from BNZ that has never been paid. It has also claimed deductions for interest expenditure in respect of a debenture held by Downsview Finance Ltd. Mr Russell and his wife are the beneficial owners of those shares.

Kensington has also acquired debentures over 14 companies, with Mr Russell being the receiver of each of those companies. Many of these companies have claimed similar interest expenditure deductions to Kensington. The challenge proceeding filed by Kensington, which is the subject of the Commissioner's transfer application, concerns only the losses claimed by Kensington. These losses total $15,756,946.76.

The Commissioner's position in the challenge proceeding is that the interest expenses have not been suffered by Kensington and that the deductions should be denied as part of a tax avoidance arrangement.

In April 2013, the Commissioner's application to transfer the challenge proceeding filed by Kensington in the TRA to the High Court was successful.

Kensington has appealed the High Court's decision granting the Commissioner's transfer application.

### Decision

#### _Approach on appeal_

The Court began its decision by stating that the appeal was a general appeal and that the approach described by the Supreme Court in _Austin, Nichols & Co Inc v Stichting Lodestar_ \[2007\] NZSC 103, \[2008\] 2 NZLR 141 at \[4\]applies. This is that the appellant bears the onus of satisfying the appeal court that it should differ from the decision under appeal.

#### _Presumption that the taxpayer's choice of hearing authority should prevail_

Kensington argued that in considering an application to transfer a challenge before the TRA to the High Court, the Court is obliged to apply a presumption that the taxpayer's choice of hearing authority should prevail, particularly when that choice is the TRA. Kensington acknowledged that the principles identified in _Erris_ were against it on this point but Kensington said that the discussion in _Erris_ was obiter and asked the Court of Appeal to clarify the law.

Kensington argued the existence of the presumption emerges from the legislative history and the existing scheme of the legislation. In particular, it referred the Court to the objections regime, the Income Tax Act 1976 and the TAA in support of its submission. Kensington argued that the use of language in s 136(4) of the TAA and in particular the words "general or public importance" and "extraordinary difficulty" convey Parliamentary intent that the TRA is the usual first instance hearing authority, with the High Court reserved for truly important or extraordinary cases.

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the High Court Judge applied the correct test and that the _Erris_ principles gave proper effect to the statutory provisions. The Court of Appeal stated that while the factors set out in s 136(4) of the TAA may be relevant to a transfer decision in a particular case, the High Court held that those factors do not create a presumption that the hearing should be in the TRA. Further, the Court of Appeal held that there is a clear indication that the Court's discretion in respect of applications under s 138N was not intended to be constrained by the considerations listed in s 136(4), given the absence of a similar provision in Part 8.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal did not see any merit in Kensington's arguments regarding a presumption in favour of the TRA over the High Court.

#### _No grounds made out for transfer_

Kensington argued that whether or not the presumption it argued applied, there were no proper grounds made out for the transfer. The Court of Appeal having heard arguments considered that the Judge was correct to order transfer. When making its decision, the Court considered the following factors.

#### _Precedential value_

The Court of Appeal stated that the determinative consideration in reaching the above view is the precedent that a decision in the challenge proceeding will establish. The Court of Appeal noted that the Commissioner is currently involved in two other disputes and has active investigations in progress that raise identical issues to the challenge that is the subject of the transfer application. These disputes and investigations all involve an insolvent taxpayer company in receivership (with Mr Russell as the receiver). The company has continued to claim deductions for interest owing under a debenture held by a company of which Mr Russell is a director and/or receiver. The taxpayer company has been in receivership for a period exceeding 10 years and has during that time accrued millions of dollars' worth of purported losses. In each of these cases, the Commissioner is alleging that the taxpayer company entered into a tax avoidance arrangement, which is void as against her pursuant to s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

Kensington argued that the precedent the decision will establish carries little weight since Mr Russell does not accept that the finding will dispose of the other disputes and investigations. The Court of Appeal considered that a decision from the High Court in the challenge proceeding would be binding on the TRA in future disputes that involve identical issues. Further, the Court of Appeal held that it would be binding on other similarly positioned taxpayers and would be a significant precedent even if Mr Russell chooses to argue otherwise.

#### _Complexity_

The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court Judge that an additional reason for transfer is the complexity of the proceeding. The Court of Appeal also agreed with the High Court's assessment that the challenge case is of moderate complexity. It was held that even though that area of law may be relatively settled, its application to new facts may not be straightforward. No weight was attached to the Commissioner's contention that it is significant that the court hearing will have to consider the duties and best practice of a receiver under the Receivership Act 1993 because this bears upon the commerciality of the arrangements. Although the Court of Appeal recognised that the law in connection with the duties and obligations of receivers is traditionally administered in the High Court, the Court of Appeal expected that the TRA would have no difficulty interpreting the statutory framework and body of case law that has emerged since the Receivership Act came into force.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the moderate complexity weighed in favour of transfer to the High Court but could not on its own be decisive.

#### _Vendetta_

The Judge in the High Court considered that the administrative law challenges mounted by Kensington weighed in favour of transfer to the High Court. The Court of Appeal noted that counsel for Kensington says it would abandon those challenges if it meant the difference to a transfer decision. The Court of Appeal stated that although allegations including vendetta, abuse of power and actions amounting to fraud on the taxpayer may weigh in favour of transfer to the High Court in some cases, in this case it was not a determinative factor. The Court of Appeal did not consider the issue further in light of Kensington's indication.

#### _Delay_

Kensington argued that the High Court Judge was wrong to view delay in applying for a transfer as a neutral factor. However, it could not show any particular prejudice arising from the delay, pointing only to the fact that, until the application, Kensington had been preparing on the basis that the hearing would be in the TRA. The Court of Appeal considered this did not amount to prejudice. In the absence of prejudice attributable to delay, the Court of Appeal held that the issue of delay was irrelevant to this issue of transfer. Further, the Court of Appeal noted that the Commissioner gave an explanation for the delay, which helped to moderate the significance of the issue.

#### _Likelihood of appeal_

Finally, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the likelihood of appeal is relevant to consideration of the application. The Court of Appeal noted that as stated in _Erris,_ even if the TRA can provide an earlier hearing date, this would not necessarily mean less delay in final resolution where appeal is likely, as starting in the TRA adds a further layer of appeal. The Court of Appeal considered that appeal is very likely in the challenge proceeding as the matters at issue are significant for the parties, particularly given the extent of similar disputes involving the Commissioner and companies controlled by Mr Russell.

Court of Appeal upholds strike-out of remaining Trinity tax challenges
======================================================================

2015 case note - Court of Appeal upholds strike-out of remaining Trinity tax challenges - Issue estoppel, tax avoidance, mutuality of interest, privity.

Case

Muir and Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the Trinity investors against the decision of the High Court striking out their tax challenges. The Court of Appeal considered that issue estoppel prevented the appellants from challenging the tax years already decided by the Supreme Court. In respect of other years, the appellant was unable to recreate or sever off facts or components of the Trinity scheme to suit his new purpose and the investors faced the absolute bar of a finding that the Trinity Scheme was tax avoidance. In awarding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) indemnity costs, the Court considered the appeal was a collateral attack on the Supreme Court’s decision and brought for an improper purpose.

### Impact

The preliminary view of the impact of the judgment is as follows:

1.  If there is a sufficient mutuality of interest between (as here) a stayed case and a test case, then the final determination of the test case will bind the stayed case.
2.  The sequence of analysing if the deduction is technically available and then considering whether the general tax-avoidance provision applies, may not need to apply where the features of the arrangement which make it tax avoidance under one provision must inevitably also apply if the scheme, steps or elements are used to seek a deduction under another provision.

### Facts

This is an appeal by Garry Muir and Peter Maude against the decision of the High Court to strike out their Trinity scheme challenges and appeals.

Messrs Muir and Maude appealed the strike-out decision on two related grounds. Firstly, that they were not privies to the Supreme Court _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115 (“_Ben Nevis_”) judgment for the 1997 and 1998 years and, secondly or alternatively, that they could claim deductions from 1999 onwards under subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“ITA”). Mr Maude adopted Mr Muir’s arguments and the Court of Appeal judgment refers to Mr Muir alone, effectively as representing the interests of both appellants.

The Commissioner had successfully applied in the High Court to strike out the appellants’ proceedings on a number of grounds, arguing that they could not argue they were entitled to the deductions originally claimed under subpart EG and now claimed under subpart EH. _Ben Nevis_ had determined the appropriate legal analysis of the Trinity scheme in terms of subpart EG.

### Decision

**_1997/1998 tax years_**

The first ground of appeal challenged the High Court’s conclusion that an issue estoppel arose because the appellants were privies to _Ben Nevis_ and two later Supreme Court judgments (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd_ \[2012\] NZSC 94, \[2013\] 1 NZLR 804 (“_Redcliffe_”); and _Bradbury v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZSC 174, (2014) 26 NZTC 21-112 (“_Bradbury_”)) as they had sufficient mutuality of interest with the parties to the various proceedings.

The Court rejected Mr Muir’s submission that issue estoppel can only arise if the parties, the facts and the issue in both proceedings are identical.

Firstly, there is no dispute that where a New Zealand Court having competent jurisdiction over the parties to and subject matter of the litigation has pronounced a final judicial decision, any party or its privy is estopped from disputing the decision on its merits in subsequent litigation.

Privity in this context does not require a complete identity or coincidence of legal interests between parties. The law allows for a more flexible standard, consistent with a Court’s power to determine whether issuing a fresh proceeding would produce an unfair or unjust result. The prerequisite is proof of a derivative interest such that a mutuality of interest exists. The question is whether the appellants had the same kind of interest as Redcliffe in _Ben Nevis_ or its subject matter.

In looking at the question of interest it was noted that Mr Muir owned 80% of Redcliffe’s shares and Mr Maude owned 10%. Mr Muir also acknowledged that the losses associated with Redcliffe’s investment were transferred to its shareholders including the appellants. Redcliffe, as their loss attributing qualifying company (“LAQC”), was party to the _Ben Nevis_ appeal. Redcliffe had no interest independent of its shareholders in perusing the _Ben Nevis_ litigation. The Court concluded that the mutuality of interest between Redcliffe and the appellants as its shareholders could not be more compelling.

The Court of Appeal noted that from reviews of the scheme in the numerous judgments, it is a safe inference that Mr Muir encouraged investors by projecting the extent of deductions their participation could generate under subpart EG. The Court considered it would be disingenuous for such a designer to distance himself from the corporate conduit he used to participate in the scheme, for the purposes of attempting to run at a later date a different construction of the arrangements once he appreciated that the Courts were satisfied the scheme was implemented for the purpose of avoiding liability to tax.

The Court also dismissed Mr Muir’s arguments that Redcliffe could not have claimed a deduction under subpart EH in its 1997 and 1998 returns noting numerous attempts to re-analyse _Ben Nevis_ in terms of subpart EH have already been litigated and dismissed.

The Court was satisfied that _Ben Nevis_ created an issue estoppel against Messrs Muir and Maude and it was also an abuse of process to attempt to re-litigate issues which could have been determined in a previous proceeding. These proceedings were no more than another collateral attack on _Ben Nevis_, continuing what has become an extended pattern or course of conduct_._ The first ground of appeal must fail.

**_1999 onwards_**

Mr Muir’s second ground of appeal was that for the taxation years from 1999 onwards, he and Mr Maude could arguably pursue subpart EH deductions on a different factual foundation from the deductions in 1997 and 1998.

Mr Muir alleged the existence of a financial arrangement in terms of the accrual rules under subpart EH and what he called “the statutory facts” under which subpart EH deductions may be claimed, which he says are very different facts from _Ben Nevis_.

The Court found that Mr Muir’s argument fell at two related hurdles. Firstly, the transactions considered in _Ben Nevis_ were identical to those upon which Mr Muir seeks to rely. The Court considered what Mr Muir calls different facts are no more than arguments based on the same facts, designed to support a different result from _Ben Nevis_ for taxation purposes.

Secondly, the syndicate’s liability to pay a licence premium to Trinity was the foundation for claiming the existence of a deferred property agreement, and thus a financial arrangement under subpart EH. However, based on the findings in _Ben Nevis_, a Court would necessarily conclude that the agreement to pay the licence premium was an essential step in a tax avoidance arrangement.

The Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis_ found that the 50-year timing mismatch between investors incurring the liability to pay the licence premium and the date of due payment could only be justified for tax avoidance purposes.

In some cases where the Commissioner resorts to the general anti-avoidance provision to disallow deductions claimed under one taxing provision, her analysis might not be transposable to assert a tax avoidance purpose if the taxpayer sought to claim a deduction under different provisions. As a matter of sequence, the Commissioner must first accept the deduction claimed is technically available to the taxpayer and resort to the anti-avoidance provision where the use of the specific provisions were not within Parliament’s purpose and contemplation.

Mr Muir’s argument was that the Commissioner could not use the defence that the scheme amounted to tax avoidance until she had also analysed the taxpayer’s entitlement to claim the deduction under subpart EH.

While there may be cases where the sequence must be followed, the Court was satisfied that the features of the Trinity scheme which make it a tax avoidance arrangement when deductions are claimed under subpart EG, must inevitably also apply if the scheme or steps in or elements of it were used to seek a different deduction under subpart EH. Mr Muir’s argument depended upon adopting the same contractual instrument—the agreement to pay the licence premium—which the Supreme Court found lacked commercial force and was part of an illusory arrangement with tax avoidance as its purpose or effect.

Mr Muir is unable to recreate or sever off facts or components of the Trinity scheme to suit his new purpose. He would always face the absolute bar of a finding that the agreement to pay a licence premium had no commercial purpose and could only be justified as part of a wider scheme to avoid tax.

The Court concluded it would be an abuse of the Court’s processes to allow Mr Muir to continue his claim, it would commit judicial resources for no purpose and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It would also be unfair to require the Commissioner to expend further costs in defending a position on taxation liability which has been unequivocally and authoritatively answered in the Commissioner’s favour.

The Court of Appeal considered the appeal was hopeless from the outset. Further, it was a collateral attack on the Supreme Court’s decision and brought for an improper purpose. Accordingly, an award of indemnity costs to the Commissioner was justified.

Court of Appeal upholds TRA's tax avoidance findings for property development
=============================================================================

2007 case note – arrangement with gaps of up to 20 years between the right to claim input tax and the liability for output tax held to be tax avoidance – section 76.

Case

Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Act 1985

### Summary

An arrangement in terms of whether there were gaps of up to 20 years between the right to claim input tax and the liability for output tax was held to be tax avoidance

### Background

This was an appeal from the decision of the High Court upholding the Taxation Review Authority conclusion that the Commissioner was correct in disallowing input tax credits claimed by respondent.

### Facts

In 1996 and 1997, Nigel Ashby incorporated a total of 114 companies, all registered for GST purposes on a payment basis.

Michelle Wilson, a friend of Mr Ashby's former wife, registered Ch'elle in July of 1998 and for GST purposes, it was registered on a monthly invoice basis. The taxable activity was "property trader".

On 5 November 1998, each of the 114 Ashby companies entered into conditional contracts to purchase from Waverly Developments Ltd a lot in a subdivision in Papakura for $70,000.00. Each contract provided for a $10 deposit on execution with the remainder of the deposit to be payable on the date for settlement specified in the contracts which was 31 August 1999.

On 21 May 1999 Ch'elle entered into conditional contracts with the 114 Ashby companies to purchase these properties for a total price of $80 million; an average of about $700,000.00 per contract.

Settlement was deferred for between 10 to 20 years. An initial deposit of $10 was payable on execution, with the balance of the deposit (29,990.00) being payable subsequently. The vendor did not hold the deposit as a stakeholder but during the deferred period, the vendor was to construct a house on each. Each of the vendors issued an invoice to Ch'elle for the total ultimateprice.

In June 1999 Ch'elle filed a GST Return for the period ending 31 May 1999 claiming input tax credits of $398,333.00 in relation to 13 property transactions, including 10 of the 114 transactions. On 20 October 1999, Ch'elle filed a further GST return for the remaining 104 properties claiming $9 million in input tax credits based on the estimated market value on the respective settlement dates 10 to 20 years into the future.

The Commissioner issued notices disallowing the claims and all 114 contracts between Waverly Developments and the companies were cancelled for failure to settle on the stipulated date of October 1999.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal considered whether the arrangement defeated the intent and application of the GST Act. In doing so it held that it is the objective assessment of the arrangement which will determine the issue.

Secondly, the fact that the arrangement complied with the black letter terms of the Act was not determinative of whether section 76 applied because section 76 provides for an overview and assessment of the combined effect of the individual components of the Act. It is necessary to assess the scheme and purpose of the Act to assess whether section 76 is triggered.

The Court went on to hold that the longer the time gap between the taxpayer's eligibility for an input tax credit and its liability for an output tax, the less likely the arrangement will conform with the intent of the Act. In the present case, the gap of between 10 and 20 years between the input claims and output tax liabilities defeated the intent and purpose of the Act and triggered section 76.

Further, the proliferation of vendor companies had no rationale or utility but to create a mechanism to exploit atax advantage by coming under the $1 million threshold. This exploited a mismatch between the invoice and payments accounting bases and defeated the intent of the Act.

Court's earlier decision confirmed
==================================

2012 case note – Court's earlier decision confirmed and appellant's application for review dismissed - disputable decision, mischievous, frivolous, vexatious.

Case

Clarence John Faloon v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, High Court Rules

### Summary

Mr Faloon ("the appellant") sought review of a decision of an Associate Judge, wherein that Associate Judge made an order striking out the appellant's pleading and dismissed the proceeding before him. The appellant's case was that the respondent made a statement in a letter to the appellant that equates to a "disputable decision" for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and he sought to challenge that decision accordingly.

The Associate Judge held that:

*   it was not reasonably arguable that the statement in the letter was a "disputable decision"; and
*   the pleading was mischievous, frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the Court.

Peters J of the High Court agreed with the Associate Judge and dismissed the appellant's application for review.

### Impact of decision

This decision provides confirmation that the Associate Judge was correct in his earlier judgment. It also confirms the willingness of the Court to consider applications to strike out, in their entirety, before dismissing proceedings as frivolous or vexatious.

### Facts

The appellant commenced judicial review proceedings in the High Court against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") on 15 October 2010. He claimed he was entitled to a review of a decision by the Commissioner not to assess him for income that the Commissioner says he did not receive.

Rather than filing a statement of the defence, the Commissioner applied in November 2010 to have proceedings struck out.

On 8 August 2011, the appellant filed an amended statement of claim. No further applications were made by the Commissioner and the matter was heard before an Associate Judge on 3 November 2011.

The appellant argued the following with regard to the amended statement of claim:

*   He is a trustee of a trust named "the 1977-Year Diversion of Kawau Stream Trust" ("the trust") and that for the purposes of income tax legislation, he, as a trustee, is an "associated person" of a "holder" of a "financial arrangement" for the "disposition" of land and therefore, must file returns in respect of accrued income (alleged $8,790,852.46) as is due to the trustee.
*   His Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") (which proposed to adjust the income of the trust by $7,677,702.90) was not rejected by a Notice of Response ("NOR") within two months and therefore, the Commissioner was deemed to have accepted the NOPA.
*   The Commissioner's decision to decline to take any further action regarding the NOPA is itself a "disputable decision".

The Associate Judge considered the arguments raised by the appellant. However, he ultimately struck out his pleading because:

*   it was not reasonably arguable that a statement made in a letter from the Commissioner to the appellant was a disputable decision; and
*   the pleading was mischievous, frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the Court.

### Decision

Peters J was satisfied that the Associate Judge was correct to strike out the pleading in the basis that it was frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process.

When looking at the appellant's second ground of review, Peters J held that although there is a real controversy, the Court may have regard to wider considerations and held that the Associate Judge correctly exercised this consideration. Further, her Honour was satisfied (after reviewing the Commissioner's bundle of authorities) that the Court's previous findings were as the Associate Judge described them.

When considering the appellant's additional grounds for consideration, Peters J held:

*   the Associate Judge made his statements based on the authorities which were made available to him (as well as knowledge from previous proceedings) therefore there was no error in judgement;
*   on an application to strike out, the Court tends to proceed on the basis that the matters alleged in the statement of claim will be established, unless it is plain that they cannot be correct;
*   it was for the Judge to receive such authorities as he saw fit;
*   there was no contradiction or relevancy to the issues which arise on an application for review;
*   the Associate Judge was aware and considered the amended statement of claim as he referred to it in his decision; and
*   it was clear that the Associate Judge was striking out the statement of claim under rule 15.1 as mischievous, frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of Court process.

After the above findings, Peters J accordingly dismissed the appellant's application for review.

Variation in relation to the definition of “finance lease” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007
===============================================================================================

This variation applies to a person who has entered into an operating lease of an asset, but the lease term has been extended beyond 75% of the estimated useful life of the asset, and so in the absence of this variation it would be reclassified as a finance lease for tax purposes, with associated complexity and compliance costs.  The variation is subject to the conditions that the lease was entered into before 14 February 2020; that the lease term was not more than 75% of the estimated useful life when the lease was entered into; and that the lessee was prevented or discouraged from returning the lease asset at scheduled maturity, or because the lessee’s business has experienced a significant decline in actual or predicted revenue related to COVID-19 meaning the lessee had difficulty in satisfying their existing lease agreement.

Variation to sections 33E, 68CB(2) and 68CC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994
=================================================================================

This variation applies to a person who is filing a research and development supplementary return for the 2020-2021 tax year or who is seeking the Commissioner’s approval of their research and development activities by filing a general approval application for the 2021-2022 income year under s 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or who is seeking the Commissioner’s approval of their research and development activities by filing a criteria and methodologies application for the 2021-2022 or 2022-2023 income years under s 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 

The variation recognises that the impact of COVID-19 means the planning or conduct of research and development or the ability to obtain information, seek advice and formulate an application or complete a return may have been delayed.

Variation in relation to s RP 17B(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to extend time for tax pooling transfers
========================================================================================================

In order to use funds in a tax pooling account to satisfy a tax obligation for the 2021 income year, section RP 17B(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires a transfer request to be made on or before either 75 or 76 days after the terminal tax date.

For the 2021 income year, an extension may be granted if certain criteria has been met. Customers or their tax agents must confirm to the tax pool they meet the criteria set out in COV22/15 in writing and have a contract with the tax pooling intermediary in place on or before 21 June 2022 to purchase tax pooling funds.

For those who qualify for the extension, Inland Revenue will extend the tax pooling indicator to prevent most policing action. Note this cannot prevent all output. Customers may see amounts owing in MyIR or on statements of account.

If the extension is granted, the time within which a request must be made will be the earlier of 183 days after a person’s terminal tax date for the 2021 income year or 30 September 2022.

COV 22/15 was amended on 6 April 2022 to clarify that the last date upon which a taxpayer can make a transfer request is 30 September 2022.

COVID-19 response variations
============================

To help customers manage the impacts of COVID-19, the Commissioner now has a discretion to vary a requirement under an Inland Revenue Act (including for these purposes the Unclaimed Money Act 1971).  This discretion is found at ss 6H and 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and applies from 17 March 2020 to 30 September 2023.

There is existing flexibility for the Commissioner to accommodate taxpayers affected by COVID-19.  These include the ability to change some due dates by Order in Council.  However, the process and time required for an Order in Council or applying other existing provisions may not be timely in the current environment.   

The Commissioner also has other available discretions including the discretion to remit or not impose late filing penalties or UOMI when a taxpayer files or pays late and is affected by COVID-19. The new ss 6H and 6I provide the Commissioner with an additional discretion to vary a due date, deadline, time period, timeframe or procedural or administrative requirement where the variation would provide an advantage to a taxpayer or class of taxpayers. 

This power is intended to be used only when the Commissioner considers that an appropriate outcome is not possible or is difficult to achieve under the terms of an existing provision (such as the remission discretion). The Commissioner can exercise the discretion when it would be impossible, impractical or unreasonable for a customer to comply with timeframes or procedural requirements due to:

*   the impact of COVID-19; or 
*   the response measures taken by the Government to COVID-19.

Customers can choose not to apply the variation to their circumstances. You can make that decision by taking a tax position, such as in a tax return, or by telling us. If you’ve already complied with the existing legislation in taking a tax position, we will consider that you have not chosen to apply the variation.  

COVID-19 variation determinations
---------------------------------

A number of issues have been raised with the Commissioner for her to consider under this new discretion.  Variations have been made to address some of these issues and they are set out below.  Variations have not been made for all issues raised because some of these issues were not able to be addressed under the new discretion, and some were able to be addressed under existing provisions.

[**Browse COVID-19 variations**](/whats-new?publication_type={0D1B2DE5-D058-453E-AB57-F0C91766D5A1})

If you have any questions about any of the Covid-19 variations already issued, contact us at ****[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4c0c6ddd5d3d199d7ddc6c2d5c6ddd5c0dddbdaf4ddc6d09ad3dbc2c09adace)****

The **COVID-19 variation determinations - decision status table** summarises the issues raised with the Commissioner and shows their current status. See table at bottom of page.

How you can raise an issue
--------------------------

If you think that because of the impact of COVID-19 that the Commissioner should extend a due date, deadline, time period or timeframe or vary a procedural or administrative requirement, you can raise this with us using our dedicated email address:

[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cf8fee5edebe9a1efe5fefaedfee5edf8e5e3e2cce5fee8a2ebe3faf8a2e2f6)

So that we best understand the issue and to get the quickest possible response, you should include as much of the following as possible:

*   The issue affecting you, including an explanation of how the issue arose because of COVID-19;
*   How the current procedural requirement or process is impacting you and the difficulties you are facing in complying with the legislation;
*   Why another available discretion in one of the Inland Revenue Acts was not suitable in the circumstances;
*   Any suggested solutions to resolve the issue; and
*   Key timeframes.

What happens next
-----------------

A specialist team will consider the issue to determine whether it is appropriate to use the COVID-19 response variation power.  It will consider whether there may be another provision in one of the Inland Revenue Acts which may be suitable in the circumstances.  

Where a variation is made, it will be published on the Inland Revenue website and through other appropriate channels (for example the Tax Information Bulletin, Agent Answers). Links will be available from this page.

A decision by the Commissioner whether (or not) to exercise the discretion (and to make a variation) under s 6I is not a disputable decision for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP)
==============================

Applications closed for the COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP) on 5 May 2022. We cannot accept late applications.

Three fortnightly payments were available.

The periods covered by these payments were:

*   First CSP – 16 February 2022 to 4 April 2022
*   Second CSP – 7 March 2022 to 4 April 2022
*   Third CSP – 21 March 2022 to 4 April 2022

The CSP was a payment to help support [viable and ongoing](/api/glossary/item?id={C174A092-A89C-4325-A808-C72069FE3C59})
 businesses or organisations which experienced a 40% or more drop in revenue as a result of 1 or more of the following COVID-19 circumstances:

*   the widespread presence of COVID-19 in the New Zealand community
*   the public health legislative measures taken in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the New Zealand community
*   any business circumstances that are, or are reasonably likely to be, a consequence of the circumstances described above.

The COVID-19 circumstances included, but were not limited to:

*   businesses not being able to operate to usual levels due to staff having to self-isolate
*   businesses impacted by New Zealand based supply chain disruptions
*   lower retail and recreation movements in a region (for example in a CBD) due to customers working from home or self-isolating.

They did not include circumstances where businesses that were able to operate under the Red setting of the COVID Protection Framework, but had chosen to close temporarily without taking all reasonably practical steps to minimise their revenue losses. Additionally, they also did not include business circumstances that were a result of any border restrictions imposed or any overseas related impacts of COVID-19 such as global supply chain issues, lack of overseas travellers or customers. 

Applicants were not eligible for the CSP where they:

*   had not taken all reasonably practical steps to minimise revenue losses
*   were a regulated business or service under the Covid Protection Framework and were not complying with the COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate requirements (where applicable). 
*   were a self-employed individual that has received, has an application pending for, or is going to apply for or receive in future, funding under the Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Fund: Grant for Self-Employed Individuals administered by Manatū Taonga - Ministry for Culture and Heritage (this only relates to the first CSP and not the second or third CSPs). 

Each CSP payment had an affected revenue period 
------------------------------------------------

The affected revenue periods for each CSP payment were as follows.

*   First CSP – 16 February 2022 to 4 April 2022.
*   Second CSP – 7 March 2022 to 4 April 2022.
*   Third CSP – 21 March 2022 to 4 April 2022.

To work out a drop in revenue, the revenue in an [affected revenue period](/api/glossary/item?id={582E59C5-1679-4F25-B3C4-AA702E455B8D})
 was compared to the revenue earned in the comparison period. The comparison period was a typical 7-day revenue period in the 6 weeks between 5 January 2022 and 15 February 2022. Alternatively, a typical 7-day revenue period in the 6 weeks between 5 January 2021 and 15 February 2021 could have been used.  

### Seasonal businesses and organisations

Businesses or organisations with highly seasonal revenue must have met the drop in revenue test set out above. However, the applicant could have selected a 7-day comparison period which is before 5 January 2022, and may be from a past year, which reflects typical revenue. For these purposes a 7-day comparison period that is at a similar point in the revenue earning cycle as the 7-day affected revenue period should have been selected, so similar periods were compared for the purposes of the revenue decline test.

[Maximum size of payments](/covid-19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment/eligibility-for-the-csp/maximum-size-of-payments)
 

Receiving payments and tax obligations 
---------------------------------------

The terms and conditions in the application state that the CSP must be applied to business expenditure. If it is not applied to business expenditure, it must be paid back to Inland Revenue.

### If the CSP is not fully applied to business expenses in the income tax year of receipt

If the full amount has not been used in year 1, then the balance should be rolled over and used in the following year(s). The amounts cannot be claimed in the income tax return. If the business closes before the grant has been entirely used, the remaining grant should be returned to Inland Revenue.

We may check that the CSP has been used correctly at a future date. Sufficient records must be held to be able to show the CSP(s) received, what the CSP was applied to, that it is not included in the tax return, and the carry forward balance of any amount not used for business expenses in the current tax year.

### Income tax and expenses 

CSP payments do not get included  as income in an income tax return if they are used for business expenses. Businesses will also not be entitled to claim a deduction for these expenses at the end of the tax year. 

### If you're registered for GST 

If registered for GST, the business will have to return GST to us on the CSP payment(s). GST can also be claimed for items paid for out of the CSP.

Published as COV 20/01 DIG-002 Tax on sale of residential property (s CB 6A of the Income Tax Act) Whether income should not be liable to tax under the bright-line test where residential land was acquired to erect a dwelling but those plans change as a consequence of COVID-19. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not allow the CIR to vary the 5-year bright-line rule because of the impacts of COVID-19 where taxpayers purchased a property for development and use as their main home, but sold it because of the impacts of COVID-19. The discretion to extend timeframes and vary procedural or administrative requirements cannot operate to exclude a sale in these circumstances. DIG-003 Overseas based borrowers (s 112(1)(b) of the Student Loans Scheme Act) Some overseas based borrowers may incur additional interest as a result of being unable to pay on time due to COVID-19. Relief is available but requires individual application. The issue is whether the Commissioner can consider a class of case variation that may be applied to all overseas based borrowers affected by COVID-19. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not allow the CIR to vary the payment dates for a student loan borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligations as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. Individual borrowers should advise the CIR they are experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations. DIG-004 Effective date for change of GST filing period Whether the time limit for changing GST filing frequency from a 6-monthly basis to a monthly basis can be extended. Published as COV 20/03. DIG-005 Does s 183ABAB remission use up grace period? Whether a customer who is granted remission under the new section 183ABAB of the TAA will “use up” their grace period in respect of late payment penalties charged under section 139B of the TAA. These customers ordinarily would not have paid late and would continue to have the grace period available to them had they not been affected by COVID-19. No variation should be made. Any such issues can be considered when and if they arise under existing remission provisions and based on the relevant circumstances. UNCLASSIFIED 2 Updated as at 17 May 2023 DIG-006 Change date for when return filed for provisional tax (s RC 5(3) of the Income Tax Act) Whether returns filed by 30 March can be treated as filed on 31 March so that the requirements of s RC 5(3) could be met and the 2018 RIT be used for P2. This would then enable lower amounts of provisional tax to be payable for P2. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not allow the CIR to treat an income tax return filed by 30 March as having been filed on 31 March so that the requirements of s RC 5(3) are met. The discretion to extend timeframes and vary procedural or administrative requirements cannot operate to alter the date when a return is received by the CIR. DIG-007 Extension of time to file and pay RWT Whether an extension of time should be made for filing and paying RWT. Further information was sought after this request was originally made. It appeared that this was not a widespread issue and that most affected customers were complying. Accordingly, no variation was made. DIG-008 Whether application required for UOMI relief Whether relief can be given where someone has paid late, not made an instalment arrangement for a debt due on or after 14 February 2020, and not requested remission of interest. No variation should be made. The variation of s 183ABAB that is sought would not be limited in its effect to only providing relief from UOMI for taxpayers whose ability to make payment on time has been affected by COVID-19 but would provide relief for late-paying taxpayers generally, something not within the purpose of the variation power as expressed in s 6H(2). DIG-009 Extension of term of operating leases Whether to permit extensions to leases without triggering the conversion of an operating lease into a finance lease, even if the extension meant the term extended beyond 75% of the property’s useful life. This would be time-limited and restricted to situations where a lease is extended due to hardship as a result of COVID-19. Published as COV 20/08. DIG-010 Late elections for change of provisional tax method Whether to extend the date for electing to use the GST ratio method to set provisional tax. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to extend the deadline for electing to use a GST ratio method as existing provisions enable an appropriate outcome. The CIR has used her care and management powers in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA to allow any person unable to make a GST ratio election before the start of the 2021 income year due to the effects of COVID-19 or the imposition of COVID-19 UNCLASSIFIED 3 Updated as at 17 May 2023 response measures, to have until 19 August 2020 or the day before the start of the 2021 income year (whichever is the later) to inform the Commissioner of their election. See the website for further details. DIG-011 Extension of time for filing GST returns Whether an extension of time should be made for filing and paying GST. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not allow the CIR to vary the due dates and payment dates for GST returns as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. Customers should advise the CIR if they are experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations. DIG-012 Tax pooling – 365-day timeframe for 2019 tax year transfers Whether to extend the date for allowing transfers under tax pooling arrangements. Published as COV 20/05. DIG-013 Extension of time for filing R&D loss tax credit forms Whether to extend the deadline allowed for filing a statement in relation to R&D loss tax credits and R&D repayment tax under s 70C. Published as COV 20/07. DIG-014 Spread timber income under s EI 1 Whether to extend the date for electing to spread income from the sale of timber back over previous years. Published as COV 20/02 and COV 20/06 (the latter extending to include 30 June income years) DIG-015 Extension of time for filing 2019 income tax returns (s 37 of the Tax Administration Act) Whether to provide a blanket extension of time for filing 2019 income tax returns. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to extend the due dates for all 2019 income tax returns due by 31 March 2020 as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. The CIR has already decided that any late filing penalties will be waived for returns filed late due to the impact of COVID- 19. Extending the due date would introduce complexity and uncertainty as it would also alter the timing required in many other provisions. UNCLASSIFIED 4 Updated as at 17 May 2023 DIG-016 Smoothing income (FATCA) Ability to smooth income when testing whether a trust is a financial institution for FATCA and CRS (volatility of rental and financial asset income may move them in and out of the FI definition). No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I provide the CIR with a discretionary power in relation to an Inland Revenue Act. This request asked the CIR to vary the effect of international agreements. However, if you do need an extension for filing your disclosures because of COVID-19, please get in touch with us so we can work something out. Email us at either: fatca@ird.govt.nz or global.aeoi@ird.govt.nz DIG-017 Bad debt write-offs Whether to extend the time by which a debt must be written off as bad in order for a deduction to be available in the 2020 income year. Published as COV 20/04. DIG-018 Usual location test (s YD 1 of the Income Tax Act) Ability to apply a 'usual location' test for the 183 days personal tax residency test or to say that a mandatory stay in NZ does not count as a day in NZ. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to alter the application of the test for determining whether a person is personally present in New Zealand or to extend the 183 day requirement as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. The CIR has instead used her care and management powers in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA to allow a changed application of the law in some circumstances. Published on IR website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/international/tax-residency DIG-019 Employer premises Ability to confirm that home, for those working from home, is the employer's premises for FBT purposes. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to vary what is the employer’s premises for the purposes of the FBT rules. H owever, the key issue raised was whether FBT arises for employees using employer provided motor vehicles for home to work travel during COVID-19 restrictions. The CIR has already confirmed that under the existing FBT provisions no FBT will arise in these circumstances where an employee was required to work from home because of COVID-19. P ublished on IR website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-1 9/business- and-organisations/employing-staff/fringe-benefit-tax UNCLASSIFIED 5 Updated as at 17 May 2023 DIG-020 Beneficiary income for the 2019 income year (s HC 6(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act) Whether to allow late distributions of beneficiary income for the 2019 income year. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to extend the time period within which distributions of “beneficiary income” can be made for the 2019 income year as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. The CIR has instead used her care and management powers in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA to extend the date for making payments of beneficiary income to 15 July 2020 in some circumstances. Published on IR website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and- organisations/specific-income-tax-issues/beneficiary- distributions DIG-021 Provisional tax 3 rd instalment Whether to extend the due date for the payment of the 3rd instalment of 2020 provisional tax. No variation should be made as there are existing processes that more appropriately deal with any COVID-19 related difficulties that customers may have in paying their provisional tax instalment by 7 May 2020. DIG-022 FBT return date Whether to extend the due date for filing the FBT return for the quarter ended 31 March 2020. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not allow the CIR to extend the due date for filing FBT returns due 31 March 2020 as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. Customers should advise the CIR they are experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations. DIG-023 Extension for filing 2020 income tax returns Whether to extend the due date for filing income tax returns for the year ended 31 March 2020 for customers without tax agents or extensions of time. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not allow the CIR to extend the due date for filing income tax returns due 7 July 2020 as existing provisions enable relief to be granted depending on individual circumstances. Customers should advise the CIR they are experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations. DIG-024 Excluding foreign exchange gains occurring at 31 March 2020 Whether to exclude foreign exchange gains from needing to be accounted for at 31 March 2020 that arose because of significant currency fluctuations related to COVID-19. No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to exclude unrealised foreign exchange gains under the financial arrangements rules as at 31 March 2020. This would require the variation of a Determination (G9A) UNCLASSIFIED 6 Updated as at 17 May 2023 which is not an Inland Revenue Act and therefore cannot be varied under this power. Also, even if the power was available, the discretion to use it should not be exercised as the foreign exchange gains that have arisen are indicative of currency fluctuations that the rules are intended to tax, or may be part of a wider arrangement that has not made a gain. Therefore, the Determination should apply as usual. DIG-025 Extension of timeframe under s 52(3) GST Act Whether the CIR can extend the 12-month timeframe for cancelling a customer’s GST registration where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the taxable activity will, in the future, be carried on. Published as COV 20/09. DIG-026 R&D tax incentive general approval due date Whether the CIR can provide a 6-month extension to the time to file the R&D tax incentive general approval notice for the 2020-21 year. Published as COV 20/10 (3-month extension). DIG-027 Residency – 183 day rule and transitional residence Whether residency (183 day rule) should commence on arrival in NZ, or on completion of a mandatory period of quarantine or managed isolation; and whether the 10 year period for transitional residency should be reduced in some circumstances No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to make the variation sought in relation to the 183-day rule. In any case no variation should be made as a key aspect of the commencement of a person’s tax residency is the taxation of their worldwide income and being in mandatory isolation or quarantine should not alter that. The transitional residence rules should not be modified as a modification would create unfairness and affect perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. DIG-028 Effective date for change of GST filing period Request for extension of COV 20/03 (DIG-04) to allow immediate change to one-monthly GST filing. Published as COV 20/11. DIG-029 GST change of use adjustments Query regarding DIG-25 and whether change of use adjustments are needed for short-stay accommodation providers. No variation should be made. The CIR’s discretionary power under ss 6H and 6I should not be exercised to vary the application of the change of use adjustment provisions in the GST Act for short stay accommodation providers who change to making exempt supplies. This is because it is not consistent with the intent of the adjustment provisions to UNCLASSIFIED 7 Updated as at 17 May 2023 defer payment of adjustments in circumstances where it is likely that some customers will not return to 100% taxable use. DIG-030 Extension of term of operating leases Request for extension of COV 20/08 (DIG-009). Whether to permit extensions to leases without triggering the conversion of an operating lease into a finance lease, even if the extension meant the term extended beyond 75% of the property’s useful life. This would be time-limited and restricted to situations where a lease is extended due to hardship as a result of COVID-19. Published as COV 20/12. DIG-031 Effective date of election to form imputation group. Request for an extension of the time period to elect to form an imputation group for the 2020 income year. Published as COV 21/02. DIG-032 R&D tax incentive due dates Whether due dates can be extended for various RDTI returns and applications Published as COV 21/01 extending the due dates for 2020 supplementary returns and 2021 criteria and methodology approvals. DIG-033 Extension of term of operating leases Further request for extension of COV 20/08 (DIG-009). Whether to permit extensions to leases without triggering the conversion of an operating lease into a finance lease, even if the extension meant the term extended beyond 75% of the property’s useful life. This request was based not on physical inability to return vehicles or financial hardship but on delays in being able to obtain replacement vehicles. No variation should be made. In the circumstances described in the request the nexus with COVID-19 is more remote, and compliance with the finance lease rules (including transitional calculations) is not now “impossible, impractical or unreasonable”. DIG-034 Extension of s 183ABAC of the TAA to the 2021-22 tax year Whether the variation power allows s 183ABAC of the TAA to be varied so it applies to the 2021-22 tax year (the provision currently applies to the 2020-21 tax year only). No variation should be made. Sections 6H and 6I do not enable the CIR to make the variation sought in relation to s 183ABAC of the TAA. UNCLASSIFIED 8 Updated as at 17 May 2023 DIG-035 Effective date for change of GST filing period Whether s 15D(2) of the GST Act can be varied to allow a change in GST filing frequency from a 6-monthly basis to a 1-monthly basis. See also COV 20/03 (DIG-004) and COV 20-11 (DIG-028). Published as COV 21/03. DIG-036 Request for amendment of COV 20/10 in relation to RDTI GA filing deadlines, and extension for 2021-22 CAM applications. COV 20/10 extended 2020-21 RDTI GA filing deadlines by 3 months. However, at the time of issue, the CIR’s COVID variation power ended on 30 September 2021. Consequently, late balance date businesses could not benefit from the full extension whereas early and standard balance date businesses did. Extension for 2021-22 CAM applications sought on basis of recent lockdown. Extension of time GA filing deadlines for late balance dates published as COV 21/04. Extension for CAM applications published as COV 21/05. DIG-037 Extension of term of operating leases Further request to permit extensions to leases without triggering the conversion of an operating lease into a finance lease, even if the extension meant the term extended beyond 75% of the property’s useful life. This request is based on physical restrictions and financial hardship due to the recent (and continuing) Alert level 3 & 4 in Auckland and other parts of the country. Published as COV 21/06. DIG-038 Research & Development tax incentives Request for extension of time for 2021-22 General Approvals where Criteria & Methodology applications are still pending. No variation should be made. Pending legislative change to s 68CF(2) of the TAA will provide an additional three months for a General Approval application from the date the CIR notifies the person of the outcome of their CAM application. DIG-039 Residence (s YD 1: 183-day test) for a natural person stranded in New Zealand Whether to extend the 183-day test for residence of a natural person, when they are unable to leave New Zealand (s YD 1(3) and (5)). Also considers ss CW 19, CW 21, and RD 8. Published as COV 22/06, COV 22/07, COV 22/08, COV 22/09. DIG-040 Time bar for late filed returns (s 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Whether to reduce the time bar for returns filed late and therefore filed in the next tax year for the purposes of calculating time bar. No variation should be made. Under s 6H(3) the variation power is not available as an appropriate outcome can be achieved under the terms of an existing provision. UNCLASSIFIED 9 Updated as at 17 May 2023 The CIR has instead used her care and management powers in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA not to devote resources to compliance action for 2021 returns that are filed late due to COVID-19, subject to certain conditions.

DIG-047 Working for Families Tax Credit (return filing and 8-week grace period) Whether to extend time for filing IR3 return for WfF payments, and 8-week period to provide IRD number for a new child to continue to receive WfF.

A variation has been made in respect of the 8-week grace period, allowing this to be extended in certain circumstances. Published as COV 22/13.

DIG-054 Extension of term of operating leases Further request to permit extensions to leases without triggering the conversion of an operating lease into a finance lease, even if the extension meant the term extended beyond 75% of the property’s useful life. This request is based COVID-related supply chain issues. Published as COV 22/16. UNCLASSIFIED 11 Updated as at 17 May 2023 DIG-055 Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) exit rules Request for an extension of time under s HM 25(3)(a) of the ITA 2007 for a PIE to remedy a failure to satisfy the requirements of ss HM 14 (minimum number of investors) and HM 15 (maximum investor interests).

DIG-056 Relief from attribution rules in ss GB 27 to GB 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Whether attribution rules can be varied if a company undertook work primarily from one source (and that work was performed by the working person) because COVID-19 affected both the company and a major client. No variation should be made.

COVID relief fraudster sentenced
================================

**23 October 2024**

A Te Kauwhata man has been sentenced to home detention after ripping off the support schemes set up to help businesses trade through the COVID pandemic and filing false tax returns.

Jarryd Delroy Hector appeared in the Manukau District Court on 21 October for sentencing on 16 charges of making false claims for the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP), COVID Support Payment (CSP) and Small Business Cashflow Scheme loan (SBCS) – help he wasn’t entitled to – and filing false GST and income tax returns (grossly understating income and overstating expenses).  
  
Hector will serve 11 months home detention and do 150 hours community service.  
  
The three COVID-relief schemes were introduced under urgency between April 2020 and February 2022. They used a high trust model to ensure those adversely affected by the pandemic could access funds to support their businesses.  
  
Hector was a self-employed contractor in the property management sector until February 2021.  After that, he started working for salary and wages and didn’t have his own business.   
  
Even though he didn’t meet the eligibility criteria, Hector applied to Inland Revenue in December 2021 for 4 RSPs, totalling $13,900. Each application he said he had a viable and ongoing business which had operated for at least a month and had a minimum 30% decline in revenue. He said he would use the grant for business expenses only.  
  
Between February and March 2022, he applied for 3 CSPs of $4,400 each and confirmed he met all the criteria for receiving the payments.  
  
Hector also applied for 2 SBCS loans, confirmed he met the criteria and would only use the money for core operating costs.  
  
During interviews he told IR he couldn’t remember how he had used the COVID relief money he received and said he didn’t keep records.   
  
IR started auditing Hector in 2022 and repeatedly asked him for information about his income tax and GST returns, but none was ever provided. However, an analysis of Hector’s bank accounts showed he “invented” his income and expenses. Both income and expenses were overstated, causing significant tax discrepancies.  
  
Hector tried to get a total of $196,453.36 from his false COVID relief applications and GST and income tax returns. He received $53,400.00, mostly from COVID relief payments, which has not been repaid.  
  
The offending was repetitive and premeditated and amounts to theft from the community.

In accordance with the provisions of Determination DET 09/02, as published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume 21, Number 4 (June 2009), Inland Revenue advises that, for the 2012 income year:

1.  The variable standard-cost component will increase from $3.29 per hour per child to $3.34 per hour per child; and
2.  The administration and record keeping fixed standard-cost component will increase from $321 per annum to $326 per annum, for a full 52 weeks of childcare services provided.

The above amounts have been adjusted in accordance with the annual movement of the Consumers Price Index for the twelve months to March 2012, which showed an increase of 1.6%. For childcare providers who have a standard 31 March balance date, the new amounts apply for the period from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012.

Cracking down on tax dodgers and restoring fairness
===================================================

**17 May 2018**

New initiatives to make the tax system fairer and a crackdown on tax dodgers are expected to provide the Government with an extra $726.3 million of revenue over the next four years, says Revenue Minister Stuart Nash.

“The Coalition Government is committed to being fiscally responsible. Creating more fairness in the tax system is a critical part of this,” says Stuart Nash.

“Extra revenue from cracking down on those dodging their tax obligations, while levelling the playing field, will help the Government address significant under-resourcing of critical public services. We are reducing distortions in the tax system and ensuring everyone pays the right amount of tax.”

“Budget 2018 gives Inland Revenue $31.3 million of operating spending over the next four years, including $23.5 million to ensure outstanding company tax returns are filed. This is expected to recover approximately $183.3 million.

“It also includes $3.0 million of operating funding over the next four years to analyse the potential to improve tax compliance in specific industries through the use of third-party reporting and withholding taxes.

“Recently announced initiatives to reduce distortion in the tax system and boost productivity will also provide more revenue. Ring-fencing rental losses will mean speculators and investors can no longer offset tax losses from residential properties against other income to reduce their tax liabilities.

“This is expected to boost revenue by at least $325 million over four years and further dampen property speculation, while encouraging investment in the productive economy.

“Meanwhile, offshore suppliers of low-value goods will be required to register for, collect and return goods and services tax (GST) just like New Zealand retailers have to. This is estimated to provide $218 million in new revenue over the next four years, and is expected to increase each year as online shopping continues to grow.

“This Government’s plan includes adequately funding health, education and housing, increasing police numbers, and lifting more children out of poverty. We are not changing tax rates. But we do need a tax system that is simple, balanced and fair – where people and businesses comply with their obligations, and where those in similar circumstances pay the same amount.

“Our Tax Working Group is also tasked with making recommendations for a fairer and more balanced tax system. It will report back in early 2019 and no significant changes recommended in the Group’s final report will come into force until after the 2020 election,” says Stuart Nash.

Crediting may not constitute payment
====================================

2016 case note - High Court held that crediting to a shareholder's account where there were insufficient funds for full amount did not constitute payment.

Case

Lesley William Fugle v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1997

Legislative References

Subpart EH Income Tax Act 1994Ç?¶ÿand 138G Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court held that crediting an amount to a shareholder's current account in respect of an existing liability in circumstances where there were insufficient funds for the shareholder to draw down the full amount, did not constitute payment.  Because there was no final payment under the financial arrangement in this case, a base price adjustment ("BPA") was not required.

### Impact

Where the crediting of a shareholder account reflects a pre-existing liability and all the funds are not actually available to be placed unreservedly at the disposal of the account holder, the crediting of a current account may not constitute a final payment under a financial arrangement, so as to trigger a BPA.

The decision is also an example of the difficulty in preventing new documents being introduced before a hearing authority  under s 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Facts

The appellant is the sole shareholder and director of Bathos Properties Ltd ("Bathos"). In 1986, Bathos became indebted to the Bank of New Zealand ("BNZ").  The appellant personally guaranteed the lending and Bathos gave BNZ a debenture over its assets as security. Bathos then ran into financial difficulty and BNZ appointed receivers.

The resulting litigation between BNZ and the appellant was settled by an agreement whereby the appellant agreed to pay BNZ $90,000 in return for Bathos' debt to BNZ, which amounted to $2,659,442.06, being assigned to him. The agreement was formalised in a Deed of Admission of Liability and Settlement ("Deed").

Between 1996 and 2004, Bathos did not trade. In 2004, after Bathos commenced trading, it credited $2,659,442 (being the amount of the debt assigned under the Deed) to the appellant's current account.

Financial statements for Bathos for the 2005 to 2007 income years showed net drawings over this three year period of $2,238,592. The assigned debt was not recorded in the financial statements as a term liability.

The appellant returned no taxable income for the 2001 to 2010 income years. The appellant had no bank account. He did not draw a salary from Bathos and drew money from his current account to fund family living expenses.

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found that the payment by the appellant of $90,000 to BNZ to acquire Bathos' debt was a financial arrangement for the purposes of the accrual rules in Part EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA"). The TRA further found that the financial arrangement had matured in 2005, which meant a BPA was required in that year. The appellant appealed to the High Court.

### Decision

The appeal was allowed.

_Was the credit to the current account a "payment"?_

Cull J distinguished the authorities relied on by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") where funds which had been credited into current accounts were held to be "payments" for the purpose of paying dividends and director's fees. She noted that in those cases, the dividends or salary credits constituted an allocation of income or retained earnings which were not previously payable. She also noted that crediting to a current account will only amount to payment where it is done with the shareholder's consent.  

In this case, Cull J found that the crediting to the appellant's current account was recognition of an existing liability, there had been insufficient funds available to pay the appellant had he demanded immediate payment of the full amount, and there had not been a decision by Bathos to make a payment to the appellant in the 2005 tax year. Accordingly, the Court held that the crediting to the current account in the present case did not constitute a "payment".

_Had the financial arrangement matured?_

Cull J did not accept the Commissioner's submission that even if there were insufficient available funds the appellant could have drawn down funds from related entities and written off the remaining $690,000 as a bad debt. The Court again distinguished the cases relied upon by the Commissioner, noting that in those cases money was placed unreservedly at the disposal of the directors or shareholders, whereas in the present case there was not a sum of money to constitute payment, but rather an assignment of debt. The Court found that because there had been no final payment under the financial arrangement, a BPA had not yet been triggered. Accordingly, the Court found that it would be premature to tax the full credit sum in the 2005 tax year as no taxable event had occurred in that year.

_Should the application by the appellant to admit documents have been allowed?_

On the day of the TRA hearing, the appellant sought leave to produce further accounting documents dated between 1992- 2003. The TRA relied on s 138G(2) of the TAA to refuse to admit the documents. The TRA held that there was a new issue being raised, that the documents could have been located before the hearing and that there was no manifest injustice to the appellant. Leave was refused under r 8.31 of the District Court Rules to admit the documents because of the risk of prejudice to the Commissioner.

The High Court found that the TRA erred in refusing to admit the documents. Cull J held that the documents did not raise a new issue, but corroborated the evidence of the appellant that there was no payment in 2005. Her Honour considered that, as the documents were supportive of the appellant's position, it was in the interest of fairness that they should be admitted. Any prejudice to the Commissioner could have been overcome by adjourning the hearing. As the TRA is a Commission of Inquiry, the Judge found that it should have received the documents as evidence that would have assisted it to deal effectively with the subject of the enquiry under s 4B(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908.

_Did the crediting to the appellant's account take place in 2005 or prior, and if prior to 2005, what significance, if any, should be attached to the date of crediting?_

The Court noted that the amount of the assigned debt had been owing to the appellant for a decade. Referring back to her earlier finding that the crediting did not constitute "payment", Cull J went on to say that the only significance which could be attached to the date of the retrospective crediting to the appellant's account was that Bathos recommenced trading in 2005. So Bathos was then in a position to enable the appellant to draw down part of the debt owing to him.

_Other matters_

_Receipt of benefits under the accrual rules_

The Court did not accept the Commissioner's submission that the movements of benefits have to be taken to tax under the accrual rules. The Court noted that there is no reference to benefits within the accrual rules under the ITA.

_Obligation on disputant to show that the assessment is wrong and by how much_

The Court was satisfied that the appellant had discharged the onus of proving why the Commissioner's assessment was wrong.

_Alternative spreading method_

The Court was not satisfied that the Commissioner’s proposed alternative spreading method in s EH1(2)-(7) was applicable. It noted that it was now open to the Commissioner to reassess the appellant’s income tax liability, in light of the High Court’s decision.

Ngā whiu taihara Criminal penalties
===================================

The penalties for criminal offences apply to all taxes and duties. A conviction for tax crime can mean a fine, and in serious cases you can go to prison.

Absolute and strict liability offences
--------------------------------------

Absolute and strict liability offences are when you:

*   do not keep the books and documents as required by law
*   do not give information (including tax returns and forms) to us
*   do not provide taxable supply information within 28 days of a request
*   claim more than 1 amount of GST input tax for the same taxable supply.

Knowledge offences
------------------

Knowledge offences are when you know your tax obligations but choose not to meet them. The types of offences include:

*   not keeping legally required books and documents
*   not providing information, including tax returns and forms, when required to
*   providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information
*   not accounting to us for tax deducted or withheld
*   not deducting or withholding tax when required to.

We will not prosecute if you did not have information we requested for reasons beyond your control.

Evasion offences
----------------

Certain actions can be evasion offences if they’re done to:

*   evade the assessment or payment of tax by yourself or anyone else
*   get a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that you are not lawfully entitled to
*   enable someone else to get a refund or payment of tax, knowing that they are not lawfully entitled to it.

Criminal offences for evasion can include:

*   not keeping legally required books and documents
*   not providing information, including tax returns and forms, when required
*   providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information
*   not making a legally required deduction or withholding of tax.

It's also an offence to pretend to be another person for purposes relating to tax law.

We can seek a court order to get the information we need to carry out our legal duties. Not complying with the court order can mean a conviction and a fine and/or prison sentence.

Electronic sales suppression tools
----------------------------------

Electronic sales suppression tools help a business evade tax by manipulating sales data in electronic point-of-sales systems such as EFTPOS and hiding records of income received from customers.

It's an offence to manufacture, supply, acquire or possess electronic sales suppression tools. Anyone:

*   acquiring or possessing electronic sales suppression tools may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $5,000.
*   manufacturing or supplying electronic sales suppression tools may be liable for a criminal penalty of up to $250,000.
*   acquiring or possessing electronic sales suppression tools may be liable for a criminal penalty of up to $50,000.

Any penalties can be reduced if you make a voluntary disclosure.

[Make a voluntary disclosure](https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/fixing-mistakes-in-my-return/make-a-voluntary-disclosure)

Obstruction, aiding and abetting
--------------------------------

Trying to stop us from doing our lawful duties, or using our lawful power, is an offence. It is an offence to help someone else commit an offence.

Offences made by employees and officers
---------------------------------------

If you’re a taxpayer's employee, agent or officer you are accountable when you are responsible for the taxpayer committing an offence.

We will penalise you if the principal offence was caused by you, your omission or with your knowledge. To convict you, we must prove beyond reasonable doubt that you:

*   meant to commit the offence
*   knew what you were doing.

We’ll check to see if you were following the instructions of a senior officer, and knew an offence was being committed.

We will not penalise you if we find only the taxpayer has committed an offence.

Executive Summary Taxpayer information is required to administer New Zealand’s tax system effectively. This information can be supplied by taxpayers, or it can be collected by Inland Revenue during an audit. Broadly, the government’s current legislative position is that this information is not shared with other government departments on the basis that it is ‘tax secret’. However, there are instances where sharing taxpayer information relating to serious crime could bring offenders to justice, support the goals of other government departments, and offer the State broad efficiencies. This study investigated the potential impact on the integrity of the tax system of sharing taxpayer information with other government departments to identify, stop, or disrupt serious crime. Participants in the research included senior government officials; experts in the tax, law, media and information communication technologies fields; tax agents and intermediaries; and members of the business community. The study employed a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative in-depth interviews with an online survey. In relation to addressing serious crime, the research sought to understand what information-sharing activities or practices are considered acceptable; the types of information that should be shared; and if increased information-sharing would have an impact on the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. Four hypothetical information-sharing Scenarios were developed for use in this study. The first involved Inland Revenue sharing information with Police after discovering a serious crime during an audit; the second involved Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information with members of a taskforce; the third related to sharin g a set of risk assessment scores with Police; and the final Scenario involved Inland Revenue supporting the Department of Internal Affairs with expertise and information. The Scenarios were deliberately designed to test the boundaries of acceptability of Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross-government information-sharing actions. Key findings Overall, Inland Revenue’s participation in information-sharing actions to address serious crime was found to be acceptable if it was fit for purpose. If Government proceeds down this path, the following concerns raised by participants should be considered. These include balancing the: • individual’s right to privacy with the benefits to society; • nature of the serious crime with the type and breadth of information requested; • authority of the information with the ability of the Department to supply it; and balancing the • intended and potential use of the information with the risk of error and its misuse. It is clear from the interview and survey data that cross-government information-sharing to address serious crime is an all-of-government issue; it is not specific only to Inland Revenue. Further, legislation must underpin any fit for purpose information-sharing action and this should outline the permission, control, and transparency mechanisms the public requires. Finally, tax secrecy does not appear to be a significant concern when considering Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross-government information-sharing to address serious crime. However, the potential impact on the public’s trust in Inland Revenue, and subsequent impact on the integrity of the tax system, needs to be considered. If Government communicates, on behalf of Inland Revenue, that specific taxpayer information will be shared under specific circumstances, both trust and integrity will be maintained in spite of selectively relaxing tax secrecy regulation to identify and stop serious crime. 4 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Section 2. Introduction To administer New Zealand’s tax system effectively Inland Revenue requires information from taxpayers. This information can be supplied by taxpayers themselves, such as when they file a tax return or advise Inland Revenue they have changed their place of residence, or it may be collected by Inland Revenue during an audit. Broadly, the government’s current legislative position is that this information is not shared with other government departments on the basis that the information taxpayers supply or that Inland Revenue encounters during the course of its duties is ‘tax secret’. H owever, Inland Revenue is aware of instances where sharing taxpayer information that relates to serious crime would bring offenders to justice, support the goals of other government departments and offer broad efficiencies for the State. For example: • Inland Revenue could proactively share taxpayer information with Police and/or the Serious Fraud Office when evidence of serious crime is detected in the course of Inland Revenue’s work; • Police could share taxpayer information with Inland Revenue when a crime is detected in the course of its work; • taxpayer information could be shared within a cross-government taskforce focused on organised crime; and • taxpayer information could be shared between departments for statistical, research and policy evaluation purposes more frequently and in more depth than it is now. It is important, however, that Inland Revenue understands if there is likely to be any impact on the integrity of the tax system 1 of sharing taxpayer information to identify, stop or disrupt serious crime or prosecute those involved, before such actions are taken. Objectives This study was designed to explore the following questions: • What information-sharing activities or practices do stakeholders in the tax system consider acceptable to identify and/or stop serious crime? • What types of information do stakeholders consider acceptable to share to identify and/or stop serious crime? • What impact would increased information-sharing have on stakeholders’ perceptions of the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system? Method The research adopted a multi-method design, employing qualitative in-depth interviews and an online survey. The 48 interviewees were selected from the government, academic, tax and law, and general commercial sectors. The participants included chief executives, members of senior management teams, and senior academic staff. The 323 online survey respondents were from the same sectors as the interviewees, with the additi on of the tax agent and intermediary sector. 1 Section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 advises this involves taxpayers’ perception of the tax system’s integrity, their compliance with the tax system, and their rights to confidentiality and fairness, as well as the responsibility of those administering the law to ensure confidentiality and fairness. 5 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Both the interview topic guide and the online survey incorporated four hypothetical information-sharing Scenarios, deliberately designed to test the boundaries of acceptability of Inland Revenue’s participation in cross-government information-sharing actions. They were not intended to accurately reflect current or potential information-sharing actions. The first Scenario involved Inland Revenue sharing information with Police after discovering a serious crime during an audit; the second involved Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information with members of a taskforce; the third involved sharing a set of risk assessment scores with Police; and the final Scenario involved Inland Revenue supporting the Department of Internal Affairs with expertise and information. A full description of the methodology is available in Appendix A. This paper reports on the findings from both the interviews and the survey. 6 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Section 3. Findings This chapter presents the findings of the study. To illustrate the range of responses, participants’ comments are included. General views about cross-government information- sharing to address serious crime Participants were asked for their general views about sharing information between government departments and agencies, to help identify, stop or disrupt serious crimes. Several themes were identified in their responses and these are presented below. Survey respondents’ support for cross-government information-sharing emphasised individual and social outcomes: “Sharing of relevant information is critical in all aspects of our control over anti social acts, security of and the integrity of those end users of this information is what must be of huge concern to all parties sharing information.” (BusCom #179)2 “Mo re user friendly departments who can assist people to make the right choices. A culture of cooperation with the public rather than uncooperative self-serving public servants.” (Bus Com #186) “Collectively Government Departments hold a lot of information on individuals & businesses. To the extent that people & businesses are able to behave criminally because information held by one agency is not shared with another current sharing of information practices should be increased.” (Tax Agent #149) Analysis of the interview data revealed a wide variation in opinions about sharing information to address serious crime. This was based on interviewees’ philosophical and practical considerations. For example: “IRD is part of ‘Government Inc.’” (Stakeholder #4) “The tax system is extremely important as a bastion of ... lawfulness in a country.” (Stakeholder #2) “\[Although\] it is very important for information to be kept confidential, that is changing.” (Govt #12) “... there would be general support for finding ways to reduce serious crime and the impact that serious crime has on society.” (Stakeholder #15) “... for them you could get consumer benefit by sharing ‘cause it just saves them having to duplicate what they need to share between the different agencies and ... people sort of believe that is already happening anyway.” (Stakeholder #5) 2 The respondent made this comment in block capitals; it has been re-formatted for presentation in this paper. 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “There are not many benefits \[to increased cross-government information-sharing\] and the value is overstated.” (Stakeholder #13) While it was generally accepted by the majority of interviewees that some degree of cross-government information-sharing should occur in order to achieve efficiencies within government, the level of detail required to address serious crime may be different. Many interviewees raised the potential for error, particularly the risk of false positives – erroneously investigating innocent people: “OK with Inland Revenue sharing data collected for the purpose of tax administration but it means that the accuracy of the information is very important – ensure there’s no false positives.” (Govt #12) And the potential for misuse: “The sharing of information should not be used as a back door for, say, using Inland Revenue to do police work, so that when they go in and investigate their tax case they shouldn’t go and ask some sly information that is to do with other things.” (BusCom #4) However, New Zealand’s democracy was considered to be a protective feature for citizens. Many felt the small risk of misusing data would be protected by the style of governance and the intended benefit to society. A future state scenario Interviewees were asked to imagine a future state where all taxpayer information was shared freely between government departments and agencies for the purposes of addressing serious crime. Again, the variation in philosophical and practical considerations was evident. Some interviewees felt it was inefficient not to share across government; others felt public concern should be balanced with State goals, or that information-sharing without a ppropriat e controls could undermine the State’s own objectives. The benefits to society of cross-government information-sharing were typically seen as more important than the individual’s right to privacy – if the individual was involved in a serious crime. Examples of the benefits included cost efficiencies for government and achieving specific goals for society. However, the potential for error and for abuse in this future state scenario were frequently raised. Interviewees stated the need for both legislative and policy caveats and controls. For example, these participants commented: “As long as there’s clear rules I don’t have any problem with agencies sharing for the ... purpose that it’s meant. It’s the situation where the information could get out, and not be used for the purpose for which it’s meant.” (BusCom #2) “... you don’t want your personal information available fully to the public ... the bigger issue is you know the risks ... of accidental disclosure to the public, ... that seems to happen quite a lot, and it’s probably possible to prevent it from happening.” (Govt #3) “...only information that has an obvious and relevant connection to crime, not all information. And you should be transparent about the agencies involved, what’s shared, and the purpose or the relevancy of the sharing.” (Govt #12) “You have to set a threshold that society will be comfortable with.” (Govt #2) 8 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime The types of legislative and policy caveats and controls identified by interviewees included: • limiting the amount and type of information shared to that which is ‘fit for purpose’ and relevant to the investigation; • controlling staff access to personal information, and using secure systems to store and share information; • citizens’ awareness of what is shared, with which departments, for what purpose, and when; and • legislation to provide a clear definition of serious crime, the legal approval to share information across government, as well as a system of redress for citizens. At stake is citizen trust in government – not just trust in Inland Revenue – and participants felt that adhering to the caveats and controls would improve government’s integrity “across the board”. Several interviewees noted that New Zealanders have high levels of trust in government and once that trust is lost, it is difficult to regain. 9 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Hypothetical information-sharing scenarios Participants were presented with four hypothetical information-sharing scenarios, each designed to test the boundaries of the acceptab ility of sharing Inland Revenue’s information in order to address serious crime. Participants’ responses illustrating the themes identified are presented after each Scenario. Scenario 1 Imagine Raj is one of Inland Revenue’s audit staff. During his audit of Company C, he found information that the company is obtaining property from crime. Inland Revenue notifies the Police. The Police ask Inland Revenue for the information Raj collected from the audit, including its accounts and lists of its suppliers and clients. Inland Revenue also gives the Police the last five years of tax and financial data it has on the company. The Polic e also ask Inland Revenue for the names, addresses, and the tax and financial details of the company directors, its employees, and clients. Just over half of all survey respondents (55%) reported they were comfortable with the information-sharing describ ed in this Scenario, while one in three (32%) reported they were not. As can be seen in Figure 1 below , there were significant differences across the groups. Respondents from the tax and law stakeholders (43%) and tax agents (49%) groups were significan tly less likely to indicate they were comfortable with this Scenario than those in the government (66%) and business (64%) groups. Figure 1: Level of comfort with Scenario 1 Analysis of the interview data also showed participants’ support for this Scenario, however concerns about the breadth of information requested and shared were more evident. The need for caveats to balance their concerns was frequently raised. “I nland Revenue staff may provide factual data to NZ Police. It is not their role to make criminal judgement decisions or scores. That is a criminal and legal jurisdiction that Inland Revenue staff should have no influence over.” (Stakeholder #101) 10 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “Safeguards would need to be introduced so that if incorrect information was shared then an individual/company need only appeal to one government body rather than to every different government department. Otherwise the effort involved in clearing your name/correcting your record would be prohibitive.” (BusCom #130) Components of the Scenario The Scenarios each described different information-sharing actions, involving different government departments and agencies and different types of information. Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each of these components. Analysis of the survey data showed a clear delineation in terms of which components were considered acceptable or unacceptable to share (see Figure 2 overleaf ). Sharing Inland Revenue information about employees, clients, and suppliers was found to be unacceptable. Similar attitudes about the types of information deemed acceptable to share were expressed by the interviewees. Further, these participants believed that all information requested needed to meet a test of relevance, and the authority of the agency supplying the information was paramount. For example: “And ... there’s this notion of authoritative information which is every department is authoritative for a subset of information. The fact that Inland Revenue holds taxpayer information doesn’t make it the authoritative source of that information and so the Police or anybody else needs to get information from the authoritative source not from a secondary source like Inland Revenue. So, just picking up on, for example, company directors and employees, etc., Inland Revenue isn’t the authoritative source for that information the Companies Office is.” (Stakeholder #15) ‘Rules’ about the information-sharing activity were also apparent in the qualitative data: • the Inland Revenue staff member escalates the information to senior Inland Revenue staff with the appropriate seniority and expertise; • the Police are notified by senior Inland Revenue staff with the appropriate delegation and seniority; • the request from Police is for information that relates explicitly to the serious crime in question, and is staggered; and • care is taken not to involve innocent parties. The following comments illustrate these points: “Okay as long as the front line person is not deciding on their own ... \[that it has\] senior sign off, by someone who is fully conversant with any changes to s.81, and \[has the right\] delegations ... and front line staff need to know the procedure if they see something.” (Govt #14) “So Police have to have their own checks and balances. Now if they conclude that the information that Raj provided them is an indication, in their view, of a crime being committed they have their own processes that kick off.” (Stakeholder #15) “The Police should be finding out if these people are linked in some way to crime. And they could do that without looking at their financial data.” (Govt #9) “...people have a right to privacy, and they shouldn’t have to provide their information just because they’re innocent.” (Stakeholder #13) 11 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 2: Agreement with components of Scenario 1 Impact on the integrity of the tax system The perceived impact that Scenario 1 would have on the integrity of the New Zealand tax system was mixed (see Figure 3). One in three survey respondents (33%) indicated that sharing information to address serious crime as described in Scenario 1 would improve the integrity of the tax system; similar proportions thought it would have a negative (30%) or no (27%) impact; and the remainder were unsure (10%). Group differences were evident – respondents in the tax and law stakeholder group were significantly more likely to believe this Scenario would have a negative impact on the integrity of the tax system (43%), compared with those in the government (26%), tax agents (31%), and business groups (21%). “Not all information kept by Inland Revenue is correct and/or up to date ... The whole basis of confidentiality of data both for and against the taxpayer should stay with Inland Revenue alone.” (Tax Agent #82) “The integrity of the tax system needs to be measured against tax compliance and encouraging people to meet their tax obligations. This requires disclosure of information to IRD and taxpayer honesty. As taxpayers discover sensitive information provided to IRD is readily available for other government agencies, the risk is that compliance and overall tax integrity declines over time.” (Stakeholder #246) 12 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 3: Perceived impact on the integrity of the tax system with Scenario 1 In contrast, interviewees generally considered the information-sharing action in this Scenario would support the integrity of the tax system although the risks of poor implementation were raised. Some suggested it would have a negative impact on the overall amount of revenue collected by Inland Revenue because the company engaged in crime would cease trading. “It will depend ... on how broad the knowledge is that this information is available. Well, if this is passed \[between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police\] and nobody actually knows then there’s no impact is there? Or if it’s passed and the only people that know really are those are very closely involved in this and perhaps a court case, subsequent court case, then again there’s minimal impact. But if it’s broadly known everywhere and there’s enormous commentary around it, I guess, then there might be a larger impact. But again I would have thought that those who are going about lawful business shouldn’t be alarmed by that at all. In fact they should feel very pleased that the tax system is helping to fight crime. I mean the thing being there that the crime, is injuring our communities, our societies.” (Govt #17) Scenario 2 To investigate and stop an international money laundering ring, imagine that a taskforce is formed. The taskforce includes staff from: • the Police; • the Serious Fraud Office; • Customs; • Ministry of Economic Development; and • Inland Revenue. The taskforce investigates New Zealand taxpayers who set up and sell companies to people in New Zealand and in Australia. The members of the taskforce are asked to share information they hold about the taxpayers and companies that are being investigated. Inland Revenue has information about the taxpayers and companies being investigated. This includes the names, addresses, and tax and financial details of all the individuals involved in the companies under investigation. Inland Revenue shares this information with the members of the taskforce. The taskforce passes this information to the Australian Police which is targeting individuals linked to the ring in Australia. 13 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Overall, the level of comfort with information being shared in Scenario 2 (see Figure 4) was relatively positive amongst survey respondents. Almost two-thirds (62%) of all respondents indicated they were comfortable with this Scenario, while one in five (21%) were not. The group patterns of difference in levels of comfort with this Scenario were similar to those for Scenario 1. Figure 4: Level of comfort with Scenario 2 Respondents in the tax and law stakeholders (47%) and tax agent (55%) groups were significantly less likely to indicate they were comfortable with the type of information being shared in this scenario than those in the government (71%) and business (76%) groups. “Sharing of relevant information is critical in all aspects of our control over anti-social acts, security of and the integrity of those end users of this information is what must be of huge concern to all parties sharing information.” (BusCom #179) “Some additional flexibility is justified to prevent/stop serious crime and fraud, but huge safeguards needed!” (Stakeholder #322) As with Scenario 1, the majority of the interviewees supported the information-sharing action described in Scenario 2 – however this support generally depended on two caveats or safeguards: • all staff of the taskforce have appropriate seniority and security clearance; and • all information shared in the taskforce is only used to investigate the serious crime for which the taskforce was formed. Comments illustrating opinions about Inland Revenue participating in the taskforce included: “For me, stopping serious crime is always going to top protecting people’s privacy \[if they are involved in the crime\].” (Stakeholder #4) “If the only vehicle to get at them is a tax vehicle, then make sure the tax system is empowered to do it.” (Stakeholder #2) 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “But you know again the taskforce would be set up for a specific purpose. Everyone would, I’m assuming ... sign an oath of what you can and can’t, what you need to protect. You’re probably secured to at least a secret clearance so you know you’re not going to use the data that you’ve obtained for, for your own specific purposes. So I’d be fine with that.” (Govt #9) Components of the Scenario When survey respondents were asked about the components of Scenario 2 (see Figure 5 overleaf ), nearly one third (29%) disagreed with the taskforce passing New Zealand taxpayer and company information to the Australian Police for investigation. “...strongly disagree with sharing this data with overseas agencies of which New Zealand citizens have little democratic control.” (Stakeholder #101) “Information should be shared with other nations in a limited sense – i.e. I am happy with names, addresses, phone numbers, business addresses/names etc. BUT not complete details of every affair of individuals.” (Tax Agent #237) The strongest support was for Inland Revenue to share the names and addresses of the companies under investigation with the taskforce (73%). Similarly, there was mixed support for the cross-jurisdictional sharing component of this Scenario amongst interviewees. The concern focussed on the reputation of the Australian Police and the lack of control over what the organisation might do with the information provided. However, many participants were comfortable with this component of the Scenario if legislation allowed cross-jurisdictional information-sharing to occur. Comments illustrating these views include: “We’re a sovereign state, why should we give our information to another government?” (BusCom #1) “...potentially acceptable, but may not be. Australia is a close neighbour of New Zealand and is aligned with us. I’d like to see it as limited as possible. Control of that information becomes harder and I’m not sure of their legislation – maybe they’ll share it with corporates. If New Zealand and other countries had real teeth in how they secure data then I’d be more relaxed.” (Stakeholder #13) “...because the globe is such a small place and crime is so transportable. That there’s crime being committed that impacts on New Zealand but it’s being committed in other places and we can’t actually touch it. But by working with Australian jurisdictions, US jurisdictions and many others, we can have an effect, a really positive effect, in New Zealand by enabling them to do policing in their country.” (Govt #17) 15 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 5: Agreement with components of Scenario 2 Impact on the integrity of the tax system Regarding the perceived impact that Scenario 2 would have on the integrity of the tax system (see Figure 6), the survey results were mixed. Two out of five survey respondents (39%) indicated it would improve the integrity of the tax system, while one in five (19%) said the opposite, that it would have a negative impact. A further one in three (31%) indicated that the type of information-sharing in Scenario 2 would have no impact on the integrity of the tax system. Interviewees generally believed the integrity of the tax system would be strengthened by sharing information within the taskforce. They thought the benefit to society was significant and could be clearly established, and there was a close fit between the purpose of the taskforce and the information shared. Many assumed this Scenario was current practice. Comments included: “Absolutely. I think it would support the integrity of the tax system because Joe Q taxpayer would know that we take these things very seriously and we’re not letting monies move into Swiss bank accounts or where it’s going to be tax free, or supporting if it’s proceeds of crime, or if it’s support terrorism or anything like that. Because you never really know how far the international rings are working and what they’re doing with that money. So I think, I think citizens around the world would be satisfied that governments were doing this.” (Govt #9) “People know that this can happen, it makes them more honest.” (Stakeholder #9) Figure 6: Perceived impact on the integrity of the tax system with Scenario 2 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Scenario 3 This Scenario introduced the concept that Inland Revenue could share a risk assessment with another government department or agency. Research has shown that people who evade tax also break other kinds of laws. Imagine that, as part of its work to stop tax evasion, Inland Revenue develops a way to score how likely a taxpayer is to evade tax. Inland Revenue shares the scores for each taxpayer with Police. Police combines the scores with its own information to develop a profile of people most likely to commit a serious crime in New Zealand. Scenario 3 tended to polarise both survey respondents and interviewees. For example, when asked to indicate the level of comfort with the information-sharing action described in Scenario 3 (see Figure 7 overleaf ), half of all survey respondents (49%) said they were not comfortable, while just over a third (36%) said they were. No significant differences were observed across the respondent groups. “Profiling I have some issues with if it means people are under scrutiny simply because they fit a profile...” (Stakeholder #173) “...’profiling’ the compliance risk of a person is a sensitive area, in my view there is stronger justification for profiling only those who have proved to be non-compliant in the past. Therefore for those who have proved compliant there is no need to share anything. Finally, I think transparency of what information and why and in what circumstances are important factors in mitigating the risk to the integrity of the tax system, as well as the very careful use of any information that is shared (sometimes the info will be wrong...).” (Govt #122) Analysis of the interview data revealed comfort with this Scenario was split. Half the interviewees supported this Scenario: “This is no different to me going to a credit agency and saying “what’s my credit score?” (BusCom #3) “It would be a good investigative aid.” (Govt #13) “See, I think this is great. .... But I think what we’re really talking about is a particular kind of likely criminal who are the people who kind of bypass the tax system and bypass most others ... So you’re more in the serious fraud kind of end of things. And I think this is quite useful for a combined sort of look at risk.” (Govt #8) 17 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 7: Level of comfort with Scenario 3 But often only if checks and balances were present: “It’s a question of not ... allowing things to come forth that can cause accidental harm.” (BusCom #2) “I’d be a bit concerned about individual information being dispersed here but not the insights of research that was based on that information.” (Stakeholder #1) “Inland Revenue should only be sharing information with Police about people they suspect as evading tax, not everyone’s information.” (BusCom #6) Others found this Scenario unacceptable as they felt it was too close to a ‘fishing expedition’ and many were concerned about ‘false positives’ and the significant personal risk for those wrongly investigated: “No, I don’t like that. Because ... you’re assuming guilt without any kind of proof. I really wouldn’t like it at all. Sure, taxpayers that evade taxes may break other laws but I ... I probably can’t articulate very well why it bothers me so much but that in my opinion would be very close to violating civil rights. It really is.” (Govt #9) “...are you using information obtained without someone’s consent ... or overriding the right to avoid self- incrimination?” (Stakeholder #6) “...squeaky clean in other areas ... \[and\] end up on the Police radar for no reason.” (BusCom #1) 18 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “...trying to predict future behaviour on a scoring system for your own purposes is okay because you use it to segment your customer base ... Quite often it is wrong – ask any Customs Officer who does profiling at the border how many times they get it wrong – And think of the consequences that they put people through. And when you combine Inland Revenue scoring subjectively with Police scoring? Forget it. ... out of the three scenarios I would say this is to me by far the least acceptable because of the inability to get it right. The false positives are very high.” (Stakeholder #15) Losing the public’s trust in government was also a concern: “Don’t like it – a fishing expedition - ... not as valid, the public would not be okay with it, Inland Revenue would get criticised, half of evaders would claim it’s just a mistake, and the public won’t react well ... If you go too far you will get a broader distrust of the government by the public.” (Govt #14) Components of the Scenario Inland Revenue developing risk assessment scores for its own use was generally supported by survey respondents (55% agreed), but just one third (31%) of respondents agreed the scores should be shared with New Zealand Police. Comments included: “Honest citizens need not fear from the legitimate activities of Police or the IRD to ensure they comply with a lifestyle that has integrity and does not 'steal' from others in the process. Time to toughen up an approach that has been seriously eroded over the last 25 years.” (BusCom #58) “I fully support sharing of information but not necessarily everything. For instance scenario 3 ---- IRD form base but only share top say 5%. Why should details of an average law abiding family have details exposed to a large number of organisations/people.” (Tax Agent #75) “There needs to be a sufficient case put to the court before disclosure is made. i.e. The Inland Revenue should not assist the Police or others in ‘fishing expeditions’ as this is an infringement on our personal rights as citizens, particularly those of privacy.” (Tax Agent #44) Survey respondents’ levels of agreement with the components of this Scenario are presented in Figure 8 below. Similarly, while interviewees acknowledged the subjective nature of the risk assessment scores they were comfortable with Inland Revenue using them for its own purposes. Most interviewees were concerned about sharing the scores with New Zealand Police for its use. This was because they were unsure of the strength of the connection between tax evasion (or the risk of tax evasion) and serious crime, and so doubted the scores were fit for purpose. Comments included: “Data’s data, and you kind of want it to be qualified information ... and anything that’s subjective to me shouldn’t be shared, because it’s up to an individual organisation’s policies and procedures as to how they’ve formed a view on it.” (Stakeholder #5) 19 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “It’s an un-testable correlation that is being assumed, and it’s absolutely wrong for such loose judgments to be made about every citizen in New Zealand and seen as having any value.” (Stakeholder #2) “...you really have an issue of context-sensitive information. So this notion that a taxpayer who evades tax is also going to break the law in other areas, I find that really suspect. But even if you assume that that is true, the threshold has to be much, much higher. So a convicted sex offender has a very high possibility of re-offending – that’s a fact. And that’s why society designs systems for intrusive monitoring. That’s a very high barrier.” (Stakeholder #15) Nearly two-thirds (63%) of survey respondents disagreed that New Zealand Police should be using the risk scores to develop a profile of people most likely to commit a serious crime. Comments from respondents included: “...we would have to trust that the Police were only going to use this for the purposes that it was intended. ... there would have to be, you know, some kind of checks and balances to say the Police were only going to use it for certain things, and not to, you know, do surveillance on a thousand risky taxpayers.” (Govt #9) Figure 8: Agreement with components of Scenario 3 Impact on the integrity of the tax system The perceived impact that Scenario 3 would have on the integrity of the New Zealand tax system was mixed. Almost half of all survey respondents (46%) indicated this would have a negative impact, whereas less than one-third (2 9%) indicated it would have a positive impact on the integrity of the tax system (see Figure 9). Similarly, analysis of the interview data revealed wide variation in perceptions of the effect this Scenario would have on the integrity of the tax system. Comments illustrating the range of views include: “... I think this is quite supportive of the integrity of the tax system, this one, because I think it underscores that tax evasion isn’t just a misdemeanour.” (Govt #8) 20 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “Because people will genuinely want to stay out of trouble and therefore they will say “Well, I’d rather pay my tax than ... have it affect my credit rating”” (BusCom #3) “Integrity doesn’t just rely on it being locked away.” (Stakeholder #4) “...the general statement ... that ‘Inland Revenue assists Police through the supply of some specific information to combat organised crime’ in my view will enhance \[the integrity of the tax system\].” (Govt #17) “...\[advising the public\] we do share information but we do not share information on individuals unless there’s a particular, proven case.” (Stakeholder #10) “People, businesses, would all operate undercover, underground, I think.” (Govt #9) Figure 9: Perceived impact on the integrity of the tax system with Scenario 3 21 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Scenario 4 The last Scenario introduced the concept of Inland Revenue lending its expertise to another government department or agency. To investigate compliance patterns, Inland Revenue has expertise in finding the links between taxpayers. Imagine that the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) is investigating a ring of sex offenders who are trading photographic material. The DIA asks Inland Revenue to use its expertise and tax information to find the connections between the people they are investigating. The DIA also asks Inland Revenue to see if these people are strongly connected to anyone else. Inland Revenue shares the results with the DIA. While the majority of survey respondents were in support, similar to Scenario 3, it tended to polarise interviewees. The level of comfort with Scenario 4 (see Figure 10) was relatively positive amongst survey respondents. Three-fifths of all respondents (61%) indicated they were comfortable with the Scenario, whereas one-quarter (26%) were not. There were significant differences between the groups. Just one in ten (12%) business respondents reported they were uncomfortable with this Scenario compared to one in three of the tax and law stakeholders (37%) and the tax agents (30%). This respondent explains: “Information should not be shared to raise suspicion that a taxpayer may be involved through a tenuous link to a suspect criminal. That is the basis for a police state.” (Tax Agent #231) As with Scenario 3, support for Scenario 4 amongst the interviewees was mixed. Most interviewees supported the Scenario due to the gravitas of the nature of the crime involved: “...in cases like this there’s a very strong public interest in finding sex offenders. And a lot of other offenders too, but particularly for sex offenders. And I think there’s a very strong feeling by New Zealanders that every source of information available, lawfully available, should be used. Sex offenders who pay their tax probably won’t agree but they’ll be the only ones I think who don’t. We’ll probably even have organised criminals who say, yeah, that’s fair enough.” (Govt #17) “...it’s \[a\] balance between the needs of society and security and safety and revenue, so if we’re ... through this we actually stop the crime and there’s obviously a cost that would have been incurred if that crime occurred, is more than the revenue generated if we didn’t do it, well then I would agree that this is a better way of doing it.” (Stakeholder #9) Others worried emotion would tip the balance: “No one likes sex offenders, but substitute a political objector and...” (Stakeholder #14) “Emotionally it’s OK, but logically I think it’s wrong.” (B usCom #4) 22 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “...the fact that \[Inland Revenue has\] information and can map things can be used for good or bad; that ability can be abused. It all depends how big the scope is.” (Stakeholder #13) Figure 10: Level of comfort with Scenario 4 Components of the Scenario Survey respondents were relatively comfortable with Inland Revenue supporting the DIA in its investigation (see Figure 11), but one third (33%) were uncomfortable with Inland Revenue exploring if the DIA’s suspects were linked to anyone else. Comments from survey respondents illustrating these concerns included: “Any sharing of information should be done only when there are strong indicators of crime, sharing information just because you can (profiling / fishing for information) risks a slide towards an Orwellian society.” (Govt #79) “Scenario 3 and 4 contain a bias which implies the Inland Revenue know there has been a crime or are sharing information which could lead to many innocent people being investigated inappropriately because of information that is shared. It will have an impact on our justice system which is why I am strongly opposed to the sharing of the information. Much of the information suggested as being able to be shared is likely to be available to the Police through other sources and they should go through proper procedures to obtain it. The integrity of the tax system itself is dependent on the taxpayer’s affairs remaining private between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue.” (Tax agent #120) Many interviewees explained the Scenario tested the outermost boundaries of Inland Revenue’s role and its strengths, and that it bore no relationship to revenue administration. Others felt it was an innovative use of Inland Revenue’s abilities and that it supported the joined-up government model to achieve better outcomes for New Zealanders. Comments included: “Why would IRD be mapping social networks amongst taxpayers?” (Stakeholder #5) 23 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “I suspect Internal Affairs is far, far better than \[Inland Revenue at mapping social networks\]. Nevertheless ... why I am saying it’s not right is because Inland Revenue is not the authoritative source of social networking mapping in New Zealand thankfully.” (Stakeholder #15) “... again, you’ve got a really serious crime here and sex offenders tend to connect with other sex offenders. So I think this would be really, really useful information and I think the public interest is served. It isn’t really what the tax system is for, but you’ve got a really serious crime.” (Govt #8) Howev er, interviewees also feared that innocent individuals would be erroneously included in the analysis, and they considered the legal and reputational consequences of this extreme. Many considered it a ‘fishing exercise’ and several found the Scenario entirely unacceptable. “I think it’s just going beyond what people would perceive the legitimate activity ... of the IRD \[to be\]. It’s basically snooping on people.” (Stakeholder #7) “Not exactly a curbing of individual freedoms but has overtones of surveillance for potential law breaking that may not be serious enough to warrant it.” (Govt #4) Figure 11: Agreement with components of Scenario 4 Impact on the integrity of the tax system Two out of five (43%) survey respondents indicated Scenario 4 would have no impact on the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system (see Figure 12 above); just one in five (20%) believed it would have a positive impact. Group differences were observed. Just a handful (3%) of respondents in the tax and law stakeholder group believed Scenario 4 would have a positive effect on the integrity of the New Zealand tax system, compared with one third (36%) of the business respondents. 24 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime “Some additional flexibility is justified to prevent/stop serious crime and fraud, but huge safeguards needed!” (Stakeholder #322) “Expanding information-sharing to speculative sharing or profiling will inevitably increase levels of distrust in Inland Revenue and therefore erodes tax compliance. It would only take one front-page-of- the-Dominion false accusation case to start a tax revolt. People don’t like paying taxes anyway. Don’t poke the bear.” (Govt #84) Most interviewees thought the impact on the integrity of the tax system would be positive or that it would have no effect at all as it would be “done behind the scenes” (BusCom #4). This finding illustrates how interviewees perceived the information-sharing Scenarios as all-of-government actions rather than peculiar to the tax administration. Figure 12: Perceived impact on the integrity of the tax system with Scenario 4 Sharing specific types of information Inland Revenue holds different types of information about taxpayers (including individuals and businesses). Surve y respondents and interviewees were asked to indicate which types of information they felt would be acceptable to share with other government departments and agencies to address serious crime. The word clouds presented below provide a graphical representation of these results, with the size of the words corresponding to the frequency with which each element was selected. The largest words represent those most frequently identified as being acceptable to share; the smallest words represent those identified as being least acceptable. As illustrated in the first word cloud (see Figure 13), there are two tiers of information that survey respondents consider acceptable to share. The first, supported by two thirds of the survey respondents, comprises identity- related information about taxpayers. This is information that Inland Revenue is not the authority on. The next tier of acceptable information, supported by more than half of respondents, comprises information that is tax- and finance-related – which Inland Revenue is the authority on. The types of information survey respondents considered least acceptable to share were about relatives (25%), children (26%), clients (32%), spouse (34%), suppliers (35%), and employees (41%). 25 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 13: Word cloud of informational elements survey respondents considered acceptable to share Comments from respondents indicated the relevance of the information to the serious crime, the risks if citizens were wrongly implicated, or if the data were misused were reasons for these differences: “...the information disclosed needs to be directly relevant to the crime under investigation.” (Stakeholder #12) “Information-sharing needs to be on a need to know basis and appropriate to the circumstances. It should not be a ‘free for all’ scene as information that has no relevance to a crime can be disclosed or viewed by inappropriate persons. How is a person’s clients relevant to disclosure when in most likelihood a client would not know their supplier is involved in a serious crime and/or fraud?” (Tax agent #7) “I am not confident all info should be passed, I am particularly concerned about... commercially sensitive business information, particularly around R&D type work etc., that Inland Revenue may hold – Corporate taxpayers may well hold back information from Inland Revenue in the future if they feel it will fall in the hands of agencies that cannot be trusted with it.” (Government #245) Survey respondents from government and the business community had more favourable attitudes towards sharing the first tier of informational elements to address serious crime. Respondents in the tax agent and tax and la w stakeholder groups had less favourable attitudes towards these elements. These results were generally supported by the interviewees, as evidenced in the second word cloud ( see Figure 14), and suggests that information-sharing should be done in several stages, with the first stage establishing whether or not the “correct John Smith” has been identified, followed by sharing more information only if directly relevant to the serious crime or the investigation. “\[I have seen\] 2 people with similar names, born in the same year and in the same hospital, with very similar IRD numbers. One was on a benefit, and there were mix-ups between the two with our client being accused of benefit fraud, and pursued for child support payments...” (Tax Agent #40) 26 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 14: Word cloud of informational elements interviewees considered acceptable Other than playing a part in data-matching and ensuring the correct person has been identified, interviewees tended to consider ethnicity and gender irrelevant to a serious crime. These elements appear to have had more importance to survey respondents. The results depicted in the word clouds reiterate participants’ assertion that any information to be shared should be fit for purpose, particularly that the information is relevant to the serious crime in question. Given the variety of serious crimes (from interpersonal violence and murder to forgery and money laundering), participants’ perception of the relevance of specific informational elements will depend on the type of crime. Summary In summary, the survey results revealed cautious support for Inland Revenue’s participation in cross- government information-sharing actions for the purpose of addressing serious crime, as described in the Scenarios. The re was considerable variation between the groups in their comfort with the Scenarios. For example, the tax agent group was the least comfortable with Inland Revenue passing on information resulting from an audit (the business group was also uncomfortable with this Scenario). The tax and law stakeholders group was the least comfortable with any Scenario, while the comfort of the government group varied according to the information-sharing actions described. Diversity in perspective was apparent within the respondent groups, too; some respondents in the tax and law stakeholders group were vehemently in favour of the information-sharing actions described. Further, these trends need to be considered with the comments respondents supplied. For example, while the majority of respondents in the tax agents and intermediaries group indicated their discomfort with the information- sharing action in the audit scenario, several explained this was because they felt the tenets of the action involved checks and balances that were not adequately outlined in the description given. Overall, survey respondents indicated a high level of comfort with Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information, in order to stop serious crime, with those government departments and agencies that have a strongly visible role and mandate in law enforcement activities. Respondents indicated considerably less support for Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information with government departments and agencies that do not. These findings, when combined with the ratings of the acceptability of sharing specific types of information, illustrate how important ‘fit for purpose’ is in driving the acceptability of the information-sharing actions described. Analysis of the interview material confirmed and extended these results. Amongst interviewees there was strong support for the information-sharing actions described in Scenarios 1 and 2, but there was also strong interest in the legislative and policy controls to balance their concerns about the breadth of the information requested and shared. This was particularly focussed on preventing unnecessary risk to innocent third parties, and there was considerable tension about sharing information about New Zealand taxpayers with the Australian Police. The concept of sharing an analytical business product – a risk assessment – polarised interviewees. While interviewees were generally comfortable with Inland Revenue developing risk scores for 27 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime its own use, most were uncomfortable with sharing these scores with New Zealand Police on the grounds that they were subjective and that the data set would be too broad. Similarly, the concerns about the connection between the crime and the potential for false positives strongly influenced interviewees’ overall comfort with the hypothetical example in Scenario 4. In conclusion, although survey respondents and interviewees considered the prospect of cross-government information-sharing for the purposes of addressing serious crime had merit, it must be undertaken with many caveats and controls. The most important of these is that information-sharing actions must be ‘fit for purpose’. Being fit for purpose involves: • legislation providing the definition, permission, control, and transparency to share information, as well as providing citizens with an avenue of redress; • information that is relevant to the investigation of the serious crime (this includes the nature of the information requested and the breadth of the request); • authoritative information requested from the relevant government agency; and • taking care not to erroneously involve third parties’ information with no relationship to the serious crime in question. Specifically, that Inland Revenue’s expertise and information: • is shared with government agencies that have a logical and visible role in law enforcement activities, for the purposes of addressing serious crime; • is focussed on already-identified suspects of a serious crime unless there is good reason to expand this focus; • is limited to identity-related and IR-specific information: names, addresses and the tax and financial details of individuals and companies already under investigation, unless there is good reason to expand; and • does not disadvantage individuals not directly related to the investigation. The survey results and interview findings also show there is potential to positively affect the integrity of the tax system if Inland Revenue plays a role in bringing already-identified suspects to justice. Any action beyond this – such as activities that can be perceived as unwarranted and broad information exchanges – has the potential to damage the integrity of the tax system. 28 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Section 4. Discussion This chapter presents the key themes of the project’s findings. Support for information-sharing actions to address serious crime The data from the interviews with a broad range of government officials, tax and law experts, and the business sector yielded significant insights into the philosophical and practical reasoning behind support (or otherwise) for Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross-government information-sharing to address serious crime. Overall, there was support for Inland Revenue’s involvement in this activity. The most frequently raised reasons to support this relate to societal benefits – a safer society, improved public service delivery, and higher levels of trust and transparency. These are discussed below. Social good and citizen-centricity There were a number of benefits to society of Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information cited to identify and/or stop serious crime. Support was positioned firmly on the basis that it would help create a safer society and thus increase the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders. In relation to improving safety, two aspects were raised. First, information-sharing could become one of the tools available to help prevent serious crime. Second, serious crimes are not victimless crimes, and inform ation-sharing would assist in bringing the perpetrators of serious crime to justice. However, these views were based on the premise that the crimes in question were indeed serious, and that societal benefits are balanced with the individuals’ right to privacy. In addition, it was noted that tax secrecy comes with the condition that taxpayers are honest in the information they provide, and there exists an ethical conundrum around government collecting revenue from crime. One final benefit raised was that cross-government information-sharing actions could increase the integrity of information held by all government departments, as it would facilitate checks in the quality and accuracy of the information each department held. This would only be possible, however, if there were common processes, protocols and language relating to data held by departments. In this regard, there were some concerns about government’s ability to provide adequate systems, security, and protection to achieve this. Trust and Transparency Maintaining and improving the community’s trust and governmental transparency is important. There was a general view that trust in Inland Revenue and in the government would improve if Inland Revenue shared taxpayer information to address serious crime. New Zealanders would see that Inland Revenue was taking action, and that government was listening to society’s view that serious crime needs to be addressed. Within a joined-up model of service delivery, information-sharing will have implications for government in its entirety, not only the tax system. The need to be transparent in its information-sharing actions includes being open about the purpose of collecting the information, what information is being collected, how government is going to use it, when it is likely to be shared across government, with whom, and under what circumstances. Should Inland Revenue become involved in sharing information to address serious crime, some argued its role would be changing. This may require building additional capability beyond investigating tax evasion, and could even result in Inland Revenue becoming an ‘intelligence leader’. Importantly, any information-sharing actions must be ‘fit for purpose’. That is, they should only involve government agencies relevant to the serious crime in question, and any involvement by Inland Revenue should be to address crime or assist other agencies to achieve that goal. In relation to sharing information across jurisdictions through cross-government taskforces, concerns about information from the New Zealand-based 29 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime taskforce being shared with, for example the Australian government, were commonly raised. This said, it was recognised that many crimes cross traditional State borders; if there were benefits for New Zealand citizens then cross-jurisdictional information-sharing should occur. Controls on information-sharing to address serious crime Research findings indicated that the misuse of citizen data must be guarded against, and information-sharing actions should only occur under strict conditions. Legislation and operational protocols are key to mitigating these risks. Other concerns related to the cultural differences (including reputation) that exist between government departments in their approaches to data collection, storage, and sharing information. These are discussed below. Conditions, checks and balances Participants in this study highlighted the need for balance between societal benefits of information-sharing and the individual’s right to privacy. Having a system of ‘checks and balances’ was frequently raised as the way to achieve this balance. The types of legislative and policy controls suggested included: • information being fit for purpose, and sourced from the appropriate agency; • common standards and definitions of core government datasets, to ensure accuracy of government information; • appropriate technical capability of government’s information systems to address serious crime including accurate real-time systems, adherence to privacy principles, and maintenance of the integrity of the information; and • protocols at chief executive, senior government staff, and ministerial level to determine the appropriateness of requests and information-sharing actions relating to serious crime. These types of checks and balances would reduce the risk of citizen data being misused. It would ensure only appropriate staff have access to the information, and prevent ‘fishing expeditions’. In addition, the controls should assist in preventing information getting into the public domain where it could be used improperly, for example for marketing or against specific individuals. The role of legislation in any cross-government information-sharing actions was considered crucial to balance societal benefits with the risk of harm to the individual. Currently, where legislation doesn’t exist, Memoranda of Understanding are used, but many government participants advised that legislation change may be required in the future. The r ole of the Privacy Commissioner was considered to be pivotal. There was support for an independent body to govern information-sharing actions – accountable to the Crown and not the Government of the day. This body would also give citizens an avenue of redress if needed. In addition, having an Information Commissioner and an Information Ombudsman would signal that a strong stance on the security and use of public information was taken. Government culture, reputation, and citizen needs There are perceptions of variation in information security practices across government departments, and this was seen to be driven by the different departmental cultures. Inland Revenue was considered to have a culture of integrity and participants in the study assumed this is a key reason for the high levels of citizens’ trust in Inland Revenue. For example, it is ‘known’ that within Inland Revenue, data is ring-fenced and access is controlled. Data leaks and losses publicised in the media influence citizens’ perception of the government agency involved. Based on these perceptions, different government departments have a ‘reputation’ and associated level of trust about the way citizens’ information is managed. Information-sharing policies need to consider this, and any protocols for information-sharing must set a high standard based on best practice to build a positive culture across the whole of government. Embedded in departmental information-sharing approaches is the need to recognise that, although the law is indis criminate in its application, the effects on individuals vary depending on circumstance. For example, 30 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime sharing seemingly innocuous information such as an individual’s address has significant implications for those affected by restraining orders or who are part of the witness protection programme. Further, socio-cultural views of information and information-sharing actions, including the way information is collected, used and stored, vary amongst the populace. Any cross-government information-sharing protocol developed will need to consider the perspectives of tangata whenua, Pasifika, and Asian peoples. These points reiterate that there is a ‘human side’ to all information systems. Striving for the right efficiencies A joined-up service model of government may result in greater efficiencies for the State primarily due to reducing the state sector workforce working with citizen data. However, some concerns were raised that, without detailed taxonomies and ontologies, important institutional knowledge about information held by government departments could be lost in a joined-up service model. Developing a formal and comprehensive understanding of the information government departments hold – including which department is the authoritative source of spec ific data – is a required control of any cross- government information-sharing action. It was also noted that the information shared across government to achieve efficiencies might require a different level of detail to that which is shared to address serious crime. Impact of information-sharing on the integrity of the tax system A key objective of this research was to investigate any potential impact on the integrity of the tax system of information-sha ring to address serious crime. Inland Revenue was described as a government department that already has considerable powers. In relation to increasing the authority of Inland Revenue to share information, care would need to be taken to mitigate against the impression that the department is too powerful or too ‘heavy-handed’. Participants in the study thought that such an impression would undermine the integrity of the tax system. Some concerns were raised that information-sharing actions could negatively affect voluntary compliance, particularly amongst the criminal fraternity and amongst individuals of low socio-economic status. Previous research 3 has indicated that those with low socio-economic status are generally less-trusting of government, and they have fewer resources and/or less ability to challenge it. As mentioned above, any information leaks would undermine citizens’ trust in government. However, any leaks involving Inland Revenue would undermine the integrity of the tax system. In contrast, it was perceived that if Inland Revenue proactively shares information to stop serious crime it would maintain and strengthen the integrity of the tax system. The caveat here is that any information- sharing action would need to balance the risks with the societal benefits of sharing, and would need to follow necessary protocols. Currently Inland Revenue is part of cross-government taskforces, but usually in an observational capacity. It was considered that the integrity of the tax system would be reinforced if Inland Revenue was an equal member of taskforces, sharing information and expertise as other members do. 3 Lips, M., Eppel, E., Cunningham, A., and Hopkins-Burns, V. (2010). Public Attitudes to the Sharing of Personal Information in the Course of Online Public Service Provision. Wellington: Victoria University of Wellington. 31 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Fit for purpose The overarching theme in relation to the acceptability of cross-government information-sharing to address serious crime was that it must be ‘fit for purpose’. There are a number of criteria used to describe what fit for purpose means: • the agencies involved in the information-sharing action should be authoritative sources and justifiable users of the information; • the identity and authority of the information sharer should be validated; • the information requested or shared should be the minimum required to meet the needs of the agency requesting it, and it should relate explicitly to the serious crime in question; and • the quality of the information must be assured or confirmed by another authoritative source. In addition, a range of other considerations were raised in relation to the acceptability of information-sharing. These include Inland Revenue not sharing information of a commercially sensitive nature; all information- sharing actions should be guided by the Crimes Act (or other relevant legislation); some types of information to be shared are more acceptable than others, and the acceptability of the information or the sharing action will vary by the individual; Inland Revenue uses third party data, but third parties should not be able to obtain information shared across government; and that information given to government under amnesty should be treated differently than information freely given. Conclusion The purpose of this research was to investigate the acceptability of Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information with other government departments to identify and/or stop serious crime. In particular we were interested in determining whether there would be any impact on the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. Overall, information-sharing undertaken to address serious crime was found to be acceptable if that action was fit for purpose. Should the government proceed down this path, a number of concerns raised must be balanced. These include balancing the: • individual’s right to privacy with the social benefits to society; • nature of the serious crime with the type and breadth of information requested; • authority of the information with the ability of the Department to supply it; and balancing the • intended and potential use of the information with the risk of error and its misuse. It is clear that cross-government information-sharing to address serious crime is an all-of-government issue; it is not sp ecific only to Inland Revenue. Legislation must underpin any fit-for-purpose information-sharing action and this should outline the permission, control, and transparency mechanisms the public requires. Finally, tax secrecy does not appear to be a significant concern when considering Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross-government information-sharing to address serious crime. However, the potential impact on citizens’ trust in Inland Revenue and subsequent impact on the integrity of the tax system need to be considered. If Government communicates, on behalf of Inland Revenue, that specific taxpayer information will be shared under specific circumstances, both trust and integrity will be maintained in spite of selectively relaxing tax secrecy regulations to identify and stop serious crime. 32 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Appendix 1. Methodology The study employed a multi-method approach, using qualitative in-depth interviews and an online survey. The methodology is described below. Interviews Interviewing was selected to provide an in-depth and detailed understanding of different stakeholder groups’ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions in relation to cross-government information-sharing to stop serious crime. Opinions about any potential impact of information-sharing actions on the integrity of the tax system were also elicited from the interviewees. The interview sample was a purposeful sample with selected representatives from the following sectors: • senior staff of relevant government departments and agencies; • senior stakeholders in the tax, law, media and information communication technologies fields; and • members of the business community, including large enterprises, small-to-medium enterprises and across a variety of sectors and expertise. A purposeful sampling approach was used to achieve comprehensive and knowledgeable responses of the subject area. A purposeful sample is not representative of the wider population and the findings should not be interpreted as being reflective of the general society. Interview candidates from the government, academic, and tax and law sectors were selected by researching the websites of relevant government departments, industries, and academic programmes. Participants included chief executives, members of senior management teams, and senior academic staff. The tax agents and business community interview candidates were randomly selected from Inland Revenue’s administrative data. All potential interviewees were approached initially by Inland Revenue, to introduce the research topic, and then by Litmus 4 , to arrange the interview at a time and location convenient to the interviewee. The 42 interviews (with 48 participants) were conducted either in person at the interviewees’ place of work, at Inland Revenue or Litmus’ offices, or by telephone. The interviews were completed during 29 May-29 June 2012, and conducted by trained researchers from Inland Revenue and Litmus. The interview topic guide was designed jointly by the research team from Litmus and Inland Revenue. It incorporated four hypothetical information-sharing Scenarios designed to test the boundaries of information- sharing actions. To do this, the Scenarios purposely omitted detail and incorporated assumptions related to seri ous crimes, legislation, and the government departments and agencies involved. They were not intended to accurately reflect current or future information-sharing actions. A copy of the interview topic guide is attached (see Appendix 2). 4 Litmus is a market research provider. 33 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Online survey The online survey questionnaire was designed by the research team. It incorporated the four hypothetical information-sharing scenarios used in the qualitative interviews. A copy of the survey questionnaire is attached (see Appendix 3). The survey sample was also a purposeful sample and included selected representatives from the same sectors as those for the interviews, with the addition of tax agents and intermediaries. The sampling lists of government officials, tax and law stakeholders, tax agents and intermediaries, and business respondents were supplied digitally by Inland Revenue. The online survey was conducted between 18 June 2012 and 2 July 2012. The questionnaire was piloted with a small sample, before going live. The survey was open for three weeks and a total of four reminder emails were sent during that time. Both the response and co-operation rates were calculated for this study. The online survey achieved an overall adjusted 5 response rate of 71%. The co-operation rate is the number of people who, once contacted, were prepared to complete the survey. The overall co-operation rate for this survey is 87%. The adjusted rates for the different respondent groups were: • government – 82% (co-operation of 94%); • tax and law stakeholders – 81% (co-operation of 95%); • tax agents and intermediaries – 70% (co-operation of 87%); • business community – 53% (co-operation of 69%). As the population size of this purposeful sample cannot be determined, the margin of error calculation for a simple random sample has been used. There were 323 respondents to the online survey. The results have been weighted to a total sample size of N=500 to ensure statistically robust subsamples for the purposes of analysis and reporting. Results based on the (weighted) total sample are subject to a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 5.5% (at the 95% confidence level). Margins of error at both the 90% 6 and 95% confidence levels have been applied to the different sample groups discussed in this report. 5 The online survey system was unable to separate non-response due to invalid email addresses from those who genuinely did not respond or who self-selected as not being the right person to complete the survey. The adjusted response rate therefore removes all non- responses from the total sample. 6 The maximum margin of error (simple random sample) at the 90% confidence level is 3.7%. 34 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Appendix 2. Interview Topic Guide Introduction and purpose \[5 minutes\] Introduce self/role, independent researchers, candid views all opinions correct, confidentiality/anonymity, one hour in duration, audio recording. Inland Revenue has commissioned this research to uncover perceptions of the impact of cross-government information-sharing to stop serious crime, and the impact that might have on the integrity of the tax system. By integrity, we mean that the tax system operates well and taxpayers are willing to provide information to Inland Revenue and willing to pay their fair share of tax. We’ll discuss this in the interview and we also want to identify and understand the areas of risk, as well as the tipping points. This will help us develop the right policies. Respondent introduction \[5 minutes\] Tell me about your background and your current role or any other relevant experience? Key question areas \[20 minutes\] \[Introduce the list of definitions and allow interviewee to read through it\] What comes to mind straight away when you think about serious crime and sharing taxpayer information between government departments? \[For non-govt interviewees only\] What do you think happens currently, and how do you feel about it? • Is it acceptable? Is there enough sharing of information between departments? Is there too much sharing? \[For govt interviewees only\] Tapping into your professional experience, what happens in your organisation with regard to sharing information between government departments to stop serious crime? • In your experience, what works, and what doesn’t? Going to the extreme end, imagine a future state where all information about taxpayers and citizens is freely shared between government departments in order to identify and stop serious crime. • What do you think about this? • Would it be acceptable? Unacceptable? • What would be the benefits for people and what would be the risks? • Would people trust the government, do you think? Would people think the government was acting in their best interests by sharing the information? So, let’s come back a bit and think of the information Inland Revenue holds about a taxpayer. Inland Revenue needs this information to operate the tax system, and the law says that taxpayers have to provide it. 35 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime If Inland Revenue shared this information with another government department, to identify or stop serious crime, would that be wrong? • Would it affect the integrity of the tax system, do you think? Could it improve it? • Is there any information you think would be unacceptable for Inland Revenue to share with government departments to identify or stop serious crime? Why? • \[Govt and Experts only\] Specifically, in what ways can taxpayers’ rights to confidentiality and the information needs of Inland Revenue and different government agencies be managed? (Privacy Act & tax secrecy laws) • What is the balance between society and individuals in sharing information to stop serious crime? Hypothetical scenarios \[30 minutes\] OK, you’ve talked about your view of where information is, or could be, shared between government departments to stop serious crime. Let’s look at some specific examples that involve sharing the information about taxpayers that Inland Revenue holds, and discuss how these examples might affect your perception of the Department and the tax system. For each, we’re going to consider if they enable or erode the integrity of the tax system and we’ll discuss any elements that might be tipping points where sharing becomes more or less acceptable given the circumstances described. • How does this scenario affect the integrity of the tax system? Does sharing information between the government agencies help or undermine the tax system? Why? • In this scenario, under what circumstances do you think it is acceptable and not acceptable for taxpayer information to be shared? • Does the type or nature of the crime matter? What happens if the crime involves hurting someone? • What about how the crime was discovered in the scenario, and how it was escalated? What are the issues there? • What do you think about the direction of the sharing in the scenario? Does it matter which government department or agency asks for it first? • What about the type of taxpayer information that gets shared in the scenario? Card sort Finally, here are some elements of information that Inland Revenue holds about taxpayers. Can you please sort them according to those that you feel would be acceptable for Inland Revenue to share with another government agency to stop serious crime, and those that you feel would be unacceptable? \[Standard thanks, and close\] 36 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Section 5. Appendix 3. Online Survey Survey introduction Litmus is an independent research and evaluation company. Inland Revenue has commissioned Litmus to survey academics, the business community, and Government. The purpose of this survey is to understand people’s views on when it is acceptable for government departments to share information to stop serious crime, and understand how the ‘integrity of the tax system’ might be affected. By the integrity of the tax system, we mean: How well the tax system operates in general, how willing taxpayers are to provide Inland Revenue with the information it needs, and how willing taxpayers are to meet their tax obligations. Your response to this survey is confidential. Your views will be grouped anonymously with others in the final report to Inland Revenue. The surv ey will take about fifteen minutes to complete. The survey must be completed in one sitting. Once the survey window is closed, you will not be able to return to it. We’d appreciate your response by Monday 25th June. If you have any questions about the research itself or the survey, please contact janette@litmus.co.nz , ph: 04 473 3883. Section 1: Scenarios Here are four hypothetical scenarios that have been specially developed to help us understand when you think sharing information to stop serious crime is acceptable or not. Please answer the questions about each scenario. \[Rotate scenarios\] Scenario 1 Imagine Raj is one of Inland Revenue’s audit staff. During his audit of Company C, he found information that the company is obtaining property from crime. Inland Revenue notifies the Police. The Police ask Inland Revenue for the information Raj collected from the audit, including its accounts and lists of its suppliers and clients. Inland Revenue also gives the Police the last five years of tax and financial data it has on the company. The Police also ask Inland Revenue for the names, addresses, and the tax and financial details of the company directors, its employees, and clients. 37 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Q1.

Thinking about how sharing information in Scenario 1 would affect the overall integrity of the New Zealand tax system, in your opinion, would it... • 1-Improve the integrity of the tax system • 2-Have no impact on the integrity of the tax system • 3-Have a negative impact on the integrity of the tax system • 4-Unsure Scenario 2 To investigate and stop an international money laundering ring, imagine that a taskforce is formed. The taskforce includes staff from: - the Police; - the Serious Fraud Office; - Customs; - Ministry of Economic Development; and - Inland Revenue. 38 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime The taskforce investigates New Zealand taxpayers that set up and sell companies to people in New Zealand and in Australia. The members of the taskforce are asked to share information they hold about the taxpayers and companies that are being investigated. Inland Revenue has information about the taxpayers and companies being investigated. This includes the names, addresses, and tax and financial details of all the individuals involved in the companies under investigation. Inland Revenue shares this information with the members of the taskforce. The taskforce passes this information to the Australian Police who are targeting individuals linked to the ring in Australia.

Imagine that, as part of its work to stop tax evasion, Inland Revenue develops a way to score how likely a taxpayer is to evade tax. Inland Revenue shares the scores for each taxpayer with the Police. The Police combine the scores with their own information to develop a profile of people most likely to commit a serious crime in New Zealand. Q7.

Imagine that the Department of Internal Affairs (the DIA) is investigating a ring of sex offenders who are trading photographic material. The DIA asks Inland Revenue to use its expertise and tax information to find the connections between the people they are investigating. The DIA also asks Inland Revenue to see if these people are strongly connected to anyone else. Inland Revenue shares the results with the DIA. Q10.

Demographic and Comfort Profiles of Survey Respondents Demographic profile The demographic profile of respondents to the online survey is considered to be representative of the purposeful sample described in the Methodology (see Appendix 1). The results may be summarised as follows: • just o ver two thirds (69%) of the respondents were male; and • respondents represented an older work force, with slightly more than half (54%) of all respondents being aged 50 years and over. Figure 15: Sex of respondents Figure 16: Age of respondents 43 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Significant differences in age were observed between respondent groups; with respondents from the tax agent and/or intermediaries and business groups being significantly more likely to be aged 50 years or more compared with those from the government and tax and law stakeholder groups. There were no significant age differences between male and female respondents. Comfort segmentation profile The survey data was further segmented by respondents’ degree of comfort with information-sharing as described in the four hypothetical Scenarios presented in the online survey. Three broad groups emerged: • Comfortable with all – comprising survey respondents who indicated they were comfortable with the information-sharing action in all four Scenarios presented. • Not comf ortable with any – comprising respondents who indicated they are not comfortable with the information-sharing action in any of the Scenarios presented. • Depends – comprising those whose responses varied between comfortable or not comfortable, depending on the Scenario presented. This was the largest group of respondents. The results are summarised below, and represented in graph form on the following pages. Respondents 50 years of age or older were significantly more likely to be comfortable with all Scenarios presented (26%, compared with 18% for those aged under 50 years). The relationship between the respondents’ comfort ratings and their ratings of the acceptability of the components in the Scenarios is almost linear. That is, those who indicated they were comfortable overall with the information-sharing presented in each Scenario tended to agree with the components of the Scenarios. This was also the case for those who indicated they were not comfortable; these respondents tended to disagree with all the components presented. There were no significant differences between male and female respondents. Figure 17: Comfort segment by respondent sex 44 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Cross-government Information-sharing to Identify, Stop or Disrupt Serious Crime Figure 18: Comfort segment by respondent age Younger respondents were significantly more likely to vary their comfort ratings, depending on the conditions of the Scenario (73%, compared with 63% for those aged 50 years or more). Respondents from the tax and law stakeholder group were significantly more likely to indicate they were not comfortable with any of the Scenarios presented than government or business groups (13%, compared with 5% and 6% respectively). Respondents from the government group were significantly more likely than those in the tax and law stakeholder and tax agent groups to vary their comfort ratings, depending on the conditions of the Scenario (76%, compared with 60% for stakeholders and 64% for tax agents). Results by group are presented in Figure 19 (below ). Figure 19: Comfort segment by respondent group 45 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public

This has provided opportunities for offshore tax evasion. New Zealand (NZ) is one of many jurisdictions that has committed to a global initiative led by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) on the automatic exchange of financial account information using the CRS. This information is required by law to be collected by financial institutions around the world for reporting to tax authorities. Tax authorities will exchange this information to ensure everyone pays the right amount of tax. Tax pays for services we all need and to improve the communities we live in. Inland Revenue will act as an intermediary between New Zealand Financial Institutions (NZFI’s) and reportable jurisdictions, in addition to providing services to collect and securely store CRS-related information from NZFI’s and third party service providers. The collected information will then be transmitted in a timely manner through to the relevant jurisdictions. Annual CRS reporting is between 1 April and 30 June for NZFIS’s submitting information to Inland Revenue, for the previous reporting period ending 31 March. 30 September is the final date for Inland Revenue to exchange CRS information with other reportable jurisdictions. 2.2 Purpose The purpose of this user guide is to provide information and guidance to NZ reporting entities. You will learn how to: • Register for the CRS • Report your CRS disclosures • Gain and grant access to third party services • View history of your disclosures, and • Cancel CRS registration. 2.3 Inland Revenue’s Support Role If you require assistance you can phone Inland Revenue on 0800 377 774, between 8.00am – 4.30pm Monday to Friday. From a mobile or overseas, the phone number is +64 4 978 0779. Alternatively you can email us at global.aeoi@ird.govt.nz 2.4 Due Diligence We expect all CRS-reporting entities to read and understand the CRS Due Diligence requirements available on our website www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: CRS), before proceeding with the rest of the document. 2.4.1 Nil reports Nil reports are not required to be received by Inland Revenue; however a Nil Report can be filed in myIR. We expect NZFI’s to fulfil their due diligence obligations, and retain these records for the statutory seven year period so that you can demonstrate your compliance, if required. 6 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - Inland Revenue User Guide 2.4.2 Reporting Options Inland Revenue is providing three options for financial institutions to send their CRS disclosures. These are: Filing OptionDescription Online Form• Consists of online screens you complete in your myIR account. • Screens consist of; Financial Institution contact information, account balance details, account holder information (individual or organisation), and payment information. • Useful for Financial Institutions that have low volume disclosures. Excel File• An Excel file that is uploaded via myIR. • Option is suitable for Financial Institutions that have medium volume disclosures. • Maximum number per Excel file is 1,000 • The Excel file consists of 3 tabs; General information, Account information and Controlling Persons information. • Excel file is subject to change due to schema updates. The Excel file available via myIR will always be updated and is recommended that this be used each time you submit via the Excel file option. XML • An XML file that is uploaded via myIR. • This option is suitable for Financial Institutions that have a high volume of accounts to report and have the specific in-house capability to deal with the technical nature of XML. • Validations run in myIR will not allow XML files to be submitted with errors. • Maximum file size 350mb Each reporting option is discussed further in this user guide. 3 Registration 3.1 Register with Inland Revenue Before a Financial Institution can register with Inland Revenue for the CRS to file disclosures, it will need to be registered with Inland Revenue and have an IRD number. 3.1.1 With an IRD Number If you have an IRD number, you will be able to register for the CRS via myIR. If you do not have a myIR account, you can create one on our website www.ird.govt.nz For more information about Reporting NZFI’s, refer to Section 3 or the Inland Revenue CRS Guidance (IR1048) which can be found at www.ird.govt.nz 3.1.2 Without an IRD Number Customers without an IRD number will need to contact Inland Revenue via email (global.aeoi@ird.govt.nz) to discuss your situation. 7 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - Inland Revenue User Guide 3.2 Register for the CRS To register for the CRS you will first need to determine if registration is required. This requires self-assessment based on the below questions. Further information regarding these questions can be found on www.ird.govt.nz/crs Source CRS Imp HB p.35 8 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - Inland Revenue User Guide 3.2.1 Registration If you have determined that you are required to register for CRS and have reporting obligations, you can register through myIR.

Note: Third party intermediaries or service providers are unable to register on behalf of NZFI's. This process only provides access for reporting purposes. However, tax agents are able to register and report on behalf of a client that they are linked to. To grant access to a third party intermediary using the token method, this can be done through Manage intermediaries under your CRS account in myIR. Figure 5. Here you will be able to determine the account permissions (file, full account access, make payments or view) that the third party will have and send them a token. Before granting access, you will need: • Active myIR accounts • The email address of the person you’re granting access to; and your IRD number, which the intermediary will need to know. To grant access to the intermediary: 1. Go to Manage intermediaries. Read ‘What to expect’ and click Next. 2. Click Add a record 3. Complete the ‘New intermediary link’ form (figure 6) with the intermediary’s details and the account permissions you want them to hold then Click Add. Figure 6. 11 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - Inland Revenue User Guide 4. Select the Financial Institution's IRD number from the drop down box then click Next. Note: The third party will need to know this IRD number in order to verify their token. 5. Confirm the details and click Submit. This will send an email with a token to the third party intermediary to redeem in their myIR. Once they have access, you will be able update or cancel their access under your logon settings. 12 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - Inland Revenue User Guide Access requests received via myIR If a third party has requested third party intermediary access through their myIR, you will receive an email to approve or decline the request. Clicking the link will redirect you to myIR, where you will be given further details of the request e.g. type of permission requested. If you weren’t expecting this request you should decline it. Otherwise, select Ye s and click Submit to approve third party access. Note: If you receive a request for multiple accounts, you will not be able to decline one and accept others. Instead you need to decline or accept all. Figure 10. 13 Common Reporting Standard (CRS) - Inland Revenue User Guide 4.2 Gain third party Access If you are a third party intermediary completing CRS reporting obligations on behalf of a client, you will need to approach the client to get a ‘token’ (one token for each client). Alternatively you can request access through your myIR account. IMPORTANT: Tokens will expire after 24 hours. If the token expires, your client will have to issue you a new token. Access via token method Once your client has sent the token, you will receive an email with the token.

### **Interpretation**

“Crown contribution” means the contribution made by the Crown under section 226 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, and the amount of tax credit under section MK 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, that is treated as a Crown contribution for a member under section MK 5 of that Act.

1.  developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty countries; and

“KiwiSaver member’s account” in relation to a member of a KiwiSaver scheme, includes any account held by that member in the KiwiSaver scheme.

“KiwiSaver scheme” is defined in section 6 of the FMC Act, and means a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme under the FMC Act.

“Retirement or pension account” means an excluded account that satisfies the requirements of subparagraph C(17)(a) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

As outlined above, a KiwiSaver scheme is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme under the FMC Act. the register is maintained by the Financial Markets Authority. In order to be included on the register, a KiwiSaver scheme must fully meet the registration requirements as set out in sections 126 to 128, and other relevant provisions, of the FMC Act.

Three of the additional registration requirements in section 128 are that a KiwiSaver scheme:

*   Is a trust, established and governed by a trust deed, under NZ law;
*   Has a purpose of providing retirement benefits directly to individuals; and
*   Has a manager who has at least one director who is a New Zealand tax resident.

The policy intent behind KiwiSaver schemes is to encourage long-term savings habits and asset accumulation by individuals principally through the workplace. Only natural persons can become members of a KiwiSaver scheme. A member must meet the New Zealand requirements which include:

*   Being a NZ citizen, or being entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely under NZ law; and
*   Living, or normally living, in New Zealand.

KiwiSaver members who are in paid employment have minimum contributions deducted from their earnings and paid to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system along with their employer’s contributions. Inland Revenue then distributes the funds to each KiwiSaver member’s allocated KiwiSaver scheme which allocates the funds to that member’s account. If a person changes employment or leaves the workforce their KiwiSaver member’s account goes with them.

KiwiSaver members who are not in paid employment can choose to make contributions directly to their KiwiSaver scheme or to Inland Revenue. All KiwiSaver members can also make voluntary contributions into their own, or into another, KiwiSaver member’s account.

All KiwiSaver contributions are locked in until the later of:

*   When a member is eligible for New Zealand Superannuation; or
*   After five years of membership;

unless a member makes another type of permitted withdrawal in accordance with the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act 2006.

A KiwiSaver member’s account:

*   Is principally a retirement account;
*   Is subject to regulation under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the FMC Act, the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994;
*   Is subject to AML/CFT procedures under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009;
*   Has information reported regularly to Inland Revenue;
*   Attracts a Crown contribution by way of an annual limited member tax credit for individual members contributing a minimum amount each year; and
*   Only allows members to make permitted withdrawals.

A KiwiSaver member’s account has substantially similar characteristics to a retirement or pension account in subparagraph C(17)(a) of Section VIII of the CRS standard, and has other substituting characteristics which indicate that such an account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

Determining that a KiwiSaver member’s account is an excluded account, and specifying this under NZ law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Scope of determination**

A KiwiSaver member’s account does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a retirement or pension account in subparagraph (C)(17)(a) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

This determination is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and applies to a member’s account in a KiwiSaver scheme where:

*   The KiwiSaver scheme is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme, under the FMC Act; and
*   The KiwiSaver scheme continues to maintain its registration on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme, and its manager complies with the relevant on-going registration requirements under the FMC Act.

### **Determination**

A KiwiSaver member’s account in a KiwiSaver scheme, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the reporting period beginning 1 July 2017, and subsequent reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Dated at Wellington this 16th day of May 2017.

In order to be included on the register, a KiwiSaver scheme must fully meet the registration requirements as set out in sections 126 to 128, and other relevant provisions, of the FMC Act.

Three of the additional registration requirements in section 128 are that a KiwiSaver scheme:

A KiwiSaver scheme:

*   Is principally a fund to provide retirement benefits to its members;
*   Is subject to regulation under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the FMC Act, the ITA and the TAA;
*   Is subject to AML/CFT procedures under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009;

A KiwiSaver scheme has substantially similar characteristics to a Broad Participation Retirement Fund in subparagraphs B(1)(b) and B(5) of Section VIII of the CRS standard, and has other substituting characteristics which indicate that such a scheme presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

Determining that a KiwiSaver scheme is a NRFI, and specifying this under NZ law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Determination**

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the reporting period beginning 1 July 2017, and subsequent reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Dormant accounts
================

CRS 2017/003 (22 Jun 2017) determines that a dormant account is an excluded account for the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard requirements.

Determination CRS 2017/003 – A dormant account is an excluded account for the period of its dormancy for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### **Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Group Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of that Act.

### **Interpretation**

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

“Annuity contract” means an annuity contract as defined in Section VIII(C)(6) of the CRS standard.

“Cash value insurance contract” means a cash value insurance contract as defined in Section VIII(C)(7) of the CRS standard.

“CRS applied standard” means the CRS standard as modified by section 185O for the determination of requirements under the Tax Administration Act 1994.

“CRS publication” means the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

“CRS standard” means the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information, as amended from time to time, which is a standard—

1.  developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty countries; and
2.  agreed by the Council for the Economic Co-operation and Development on 15 July 2014; and
3.  contained in Part IIB of the CRS publication.

“Dormant account” means a financial account, other than an annuity contract, with an aggregate balance that does not exceed 1,000 United States dollars (USD) (which the Reporting NZFI that maintains the account can treat as 1,000 New Zealand dollars (NZD)) and that satisfies either of the following:

1.  the account is treated as a dormant account under applicable laws or regulations or the normal operating procedures of the Reporting NZFI that are consistently applied for all accounts maintained by the Reporting NZFI in New Zealand, provided that such laws or regulations or such procedures contain substantially similar requirements to those set out in point 2 below; or
2.  The account satisfies the following:
    *   the account holder has not initiated a transaction with regard to the account or any other account held by the account holder with the Reporting NZFI in the previous 3 years; and
    *   the account holder has not communicated with the Reporting NZFI regarding the account or any other account held by the account holder with the Reporting NZFI in the previous 6 years; and
    *   in the case of a cash value insurance contract, the Reporting NZFI has not communicated with the account holder regarding the account or any other account held by the account holder with the Reporting NZFI in the previous 6 years.

“Reporting NZFI” means a reporting financial institution as defined in Section VIII(A)(1) of the CRS standard that is resident in New Zealand under the CRS standard (excluding branches located outside of New Zealand), or is a branch of a non-resident financial institution that is located in New Zealand.

### **Discussion** (which does not form part of the determination)

The CRS commentary contemplates (at pages 190-191) that a dormant account with a balance or value that does not exceed USD 1,000 can be treated as an excluded account (during the period of the dormancy) for the purposes of the CRS standard under Section VIII, subparagraph (C)(17)(g).

Determining that a dormant account is an excluded account, and specifying this under New Zealand law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Scope of determination**

A dormant account, as defined in this determination, does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a savings or investment account in subparagraph (C)(17)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

This determination is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and applies to an account that meets the definition of a dormant account, as set out above, where:

*   The account is subject to regulation.

### **Determination**

A dormant account, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is an excluded account for the period of its dormancy for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless the Reporting New Zealand financial institution that maintains the dormant account elects not to treat the account as an excluded account. A Reporting NZFI that elects not to treat a dormant account as an excluded account will be required to carry out any required due diligence (and potential reporting) on the account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and the requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the reporting period beginning 1 July 2017, and subsequent reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Dated at Wellington on the 22nd day of June 2017.

“Whai Rawa scheme” means the Whai Rawa Unit Trust Fund which is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund under the FMC Act.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

As outlined above, the Whai Rawa scheme is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund under the FMC Act. The register is maintained by the Financial Markets Authority. In order to be included on the register, Whai Rawa must fully meet the registration requirements as set out in section 127, and other relevant provisions, of the FMC Act.

The Whai Rawa scheme was established to encourage long-term savings habits for members of the Ngāi Tahu Whanui.

A Whai Rawa member must meet the following registration requirements. They must be:

*   An individual (natural person) or parent, guardian or other relation of the applicant if the applicant is a minor, provided that the person is less than 65 years at date of entry.
*   Registered (or eligible to be registered) as a tribal member with TRONT; and
*   Able to provide a valid birth certificate.

Whai Rawa members can make voluntary contributions into their own, or into another, Whai Rawa member’s account. TRONT also matches the savings of certain members up to a maximum of currently $200 per year or an additional $100 for newborns enrolled on their first birthday.

All Whai Rawa scheme contributions are locked in until the member reaches the age of 65 years; or unless a member makes another type of permitted withdrawal in accordance with the requirements of the Whai Rawa Unit Trust Deed. The member is not able to withdraw funds from Whai Rawa for any purpose other than tertiary education, first home purchase, retirement from age 55 years onwards, for special circumstances due to significant financial hardship, or hardship due to serious illness, or due to the member’s death (where amounts can be withdrawn on behalf of the member).

A Whai Rawa member’s account:

*   Is subject to regulation under the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011, the FMC Act 2013, the ITA 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994;
*   Is subject to regulation under the ITA 2007 as a retirement account, with Whai Rawa administering taxation obligations on behalf of its members for RSCT payable on TRONT contributions at the individual member’s personal RSCT rate, and with Māori Authority tax credits available as a subsidy (partial or full – depending on the member’s marginal tax rate) against the RSCT that is payable on TRONT contributions.
*   Is subject to AML/CFT procedures under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009;
*   Has information reported to Inland Revenue; and
*   Only allows members to make permitted withdrawals. The member is not able to withdraw funds from Whai Rawa for any purpose other than tertiary education, first home purchase, retirement from age 55 years onwards, for special circumstances due to significant financial hardship, or hardship due to serious illness, or due to the member’s death (where amounts can be withdrawn on behalf of the member).

A Whai Rawa member’s account has substantially similar characteristics to a retirement or pension account in subparagraph C(17)(a) of Section VIII of the CRS standard and a savings account in subparagraph C(17)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS standard, and has other substituting characteristics which indicate that such an account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

Determining that a Whai Rawa member’s account is an excluded account, and specifying this under NZ law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Scope of determination**

A Whai Rawa member’s account does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a retirement or pension account in subparagraph (C)(17)(a) of the CRS standard and an investment/savings account in subparagraph C(17)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

This determination is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and applies to a member’s account in the Whai Rawa scheme where:

*   The Whai Rawa scheme is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund, under the FMC Act; and
*   The Whai Rawa scheme continues to maintain its registration on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund, and its manager complies with the relevant on-going registration requirements under the FMC Act; and
*   The member of Whai Rawa is a natural person; and
*   The member’s annual contributions into the Whai Rawa account do not exceed United States $50,000 per annum (including any applicable aggregation rules set out in the CRS); and
*   The member is not able to withdraw funds from Whai Rawa for any purpose other than tertiary education, first home purchase, retirement from age 55 years onwards, for special circumstances due to significant financial hardship, or hardship due to serious illness, or due to the member’s death (where amounts can be withdrawn on behalf of the member).

### **Determination**

A Whai Rawa member’s account in the Whai Rawa scheme, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Dated at Wellington on the 22th day of June 2017.

Share purchase scheme account maintained by CRS Nominees Limited
================================================================

Determination CRS 2018/006 – share purchase scheme account maintained by CRS Nominees Limited is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994

Determination CRS 2018/006 – share purchase scheme account maintained by CRS Nominees Limited is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### **Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Interpretation**

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

“Benefit” means the value of a benefit that an employee receives under a share purchase scheme.

"CRS applied standard" means the CRS standard as modified by section 185O for the determination of requirements under the Tax Administration Act 1994.

“CRS publication” means the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

“CRS reporting period” means the period from 1 July 2017-31 March 2018 and any subsequent period from 1 April-31 March.

"CRS standard" means the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information, as amended from time to time, which is a standard—  
(a) developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty countries; and  
(b) agreed by the Council for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on 15 July 2014; and  
(c) contained in Part IIB of the CRS publication.

“Employee” means (depending on the context) an employee of Fletcher Building Limited (FBL), Genesis Energy Limited (GEL), or Meridian Energy Limited (MEL).

“Employer” means (depending on the context) FBL, GEL, or MEL.

"Financial account" means an account defined as a financial account in Section VIII(C)(1) of the CRS standard.

“Good leaver” means when an employee with a share purchase scheme account leaves the share purchase scheme in any of the following situations – death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement (where required by the employer), or the relevant part of the employer being sold, closed down or otherwise ceases to be part of the employer.

“Share purchase scheme” means a share purchase scheme maintained by CRS Nominees Limited for an employee of any of the following companies:

*   FBL;
*   GEL; or
*   MEL.

"Share purchase scheme account" means a share purchase scheme financial account maintained by CRS Nominees Limited for an employee of any of the following companies:

*   FBL;
*   GEL; or
*   MEL.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

CRS Nominees Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Computershare Investor Services Limited) acts as nominee and trustee in respect of the shares purchase schemes created by FBL, GEL, and MEL. FBL, GEL and MEL are listed on the NZX Main Board and are not in the business of providing financial services to customers.

CRS Nominees Limited’s role is to hold the legal title to the equity securities (being ordinary shares in FBL, GEL and MEL) on behalf of employees that participate in the share purchase schemes.

CRS Nominees Limited is a Reporting New Zealand financial institution for CRS purposes.

### **Scope of determination**

A share purchase scheme account, as defined in this determination, does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a savings or investment account in subparagraph (C)(17)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

This is determination is issued subject to the following conditions being satisfied (in relation to CRS Nominees Limited, each of the respective employers, each of the share purchase schemes, and each of the share purchase scheme accounts):

*   The employer administers the share purchase scheme, and is not a financial institution under the CRS applied standard;
*   CRS Nominees Limited holds the legal title to the shares as trustee of the trust established by the employer for the purposes of the share purchase scheme;
*   The employer remains subject to applicable disclosure requirements under both the NZX Listing Rules and the Companies Act 1993;
*   The share purchase scheme accounts are available to all of the employees of the employer on the same basis;
*   The employee contributions to the share purchase scheme accounts are limited to the following amounts:
    *   $5,000 per year (deducted from payroll);
    *   any dividends declared by the employer companies that are reinvested in the share purchase schemes (for employees of FBL and GEL);
    *   any bonus issues made subject to the share purchase schemes; and
    *   any renounceable rights issues (or other forms of capital re-organisation) that are required to be cashed up and the proceeds used to subscribe for ordinary shares in the share purchase schemes.
*   The employer contributions to the share purchase scheme account on a “2 for 1 basis”. This applies as follows (depending on who the employer is):
    *   FBL: The employer contributes 1 “award share” to the account for every 2 shares that the employee acquires (with their employee contribution).
    *   GEL: The employer contributes 1 “award share” to the account for every 2 shares that the employee acquires (with their employee contribution).
    *   MEL: The employer contributes a $1 “award amount” for every $2 that the employee contributes to the account.
*   An employee is generally only able to receive the full benefit of the employer contributions to the share purchase account upon holding the account for three years. The only exception to this is if they are a “good leaver”;
*   All benefits provided to the employees in relation to the share purchase scheme accounts are reported to Inland Revenue; and
*   The total contributions (employer and employer) to the share purchase scheme accounts are limited to USD 50,000 per CRS reporting period. This includes the following amounts which may (depending on the context) be contributed to the account:
    *   Employee contributions;
    *   Award shares; and
    *   Award amounts.

The MEL share purchase scheme provides that the employer’s contribution is broken down into two parts, firstly a cash bonus provided that the shares are held for the 3 year qualifying period and secondly, a cash performance award bonus provided that MEL’s total shareholder return exceeds the average for the industry. In other words, an employee of MEL that holds a share purchase scheme account will only be eligible to receive the full “cash bonus”, if MEL achieves defined performance requirements.

### **Determination**

A share purchase scheme account, as defined in this determination, is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and the requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If any of the above conditions are not satisfied for a particular share purchase scheme account this determination will not apply to that account (i.e. the account will not be an excluded account).

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the CRS reporting period 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018, and subsequent CRS reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Foundation North
================

Determination CRS 2018/007 – Foundation North is a non-reporting financial institution for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### **Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Interpretation**

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

"CRS Applied Standard" means the CRS Standard as modified by section 185O for the determination of requirements under the Tax Administration Act 1994.

“CRS Publication” means the _Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters_, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

“CRS reporting period” means the period from 1 July 2017-31 March 2018 and any subsequent period from 1 April-31 March.

"CRS standard" means the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information, as amended from time to time, which is a standard -

1.  Developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty countries; and
2.  Agreed by the Council for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on 15 July 2014; and
3.  Contained in Part IIB of the CRS Publication.

“Charitable Trusts Act” means the Charitable Trusts Act 1957.

“Community Trusts Act” means the Community Trusts Act 1999.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

Foundation North is one of 12 community trusts that were originally established under the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988 to be vested in the ownership of the then government-owned shares in each regional trustee bank.

Most of these community trusts have sold their trustee bank shares and now manage significant and diversified portfolios of investments for the community public benefit in their local area or region in New Zealand. They are regulated by the Community Trusts Act, and are subject to the terms of their trust deeds (which are also regulated by that Act).

The statutory purpose of the community trusts is to hold property (and property vested in them) on trust to be applied for charitable, cultural, philanthropic, recreational, and other purposes that are beneficial to their communities, principally in their area or region (see section 12 of the Community Trusts Act).

Foundation North is also an incorporated charitable trust under the Charitable Trusts Act.

As a community trust providing grant funding to a range of Auckland and Northland based community organisations and entities, Foundation North has substantially similar characteristics to a “governmental entity” that is a “controlled entity”, as described in subparagraphs B(2) and B(2)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS Standard, and has sufficient substituting characteristics which indicate that such a community trust presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

Foundation North is an investment entity under Section VIII(A)(6)(b) of the CRS Standard as its gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets, and it is managed by another entity that is a financial institution.

Foundation North:

*   While not wholly government owned and controlled, the Crown effectively is its settlor and protector, and is responsible (along with its trustees) for its governance and operational oversight;
*   Is regulated under the Community Trusts Act, Charitable Trusts Act, and other New Zealand law, including Crown governance and oversight;
*   Has objects that are solely for public benefit purposes within its specific area or region (under the Community Trusts Act and its trust deed);
*   Only provides grant benefits to community based organisations and entities, in terms of the Community Trusts Act and its trust deed;
*   Does not seek external funding for investment, but derives its income from the investment of its original Crown endowment;
*   Derives investment income that is _not_ derived from the carrying on of a commercial business providing financial services to private persons; and
*   As an incorporated charitable trust, if it was ever liquidated or dissolved, the treatment of any surplus assets would be determined by the High Court of New Zealand.

### **Scope of determination**

Foundation North does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a “governmental entity” that is a “controlled entity”, as described in subparagraphs  
B(2) and B(2)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS Standard.

This determination is issued subject to the following conditions being satisfied by Foundation North, that:

*   It continues to _not_ operate a commercial business that provides financial services to private persons;
*   It continues to be a community trust that is subject to the Community Trusts Act;
*   It continues to be an incorporated charitable trust under the Charitable Trusts Act; and
*   Because of its status as also being an incorporated charitable trust, if ever liquidated or dissolved, the High Court of New Zealand will decide how any of its surplus assets are vested, and that such a decision will be consistent with the objects of its trust deed and the scheme of the Community Trusts Act.

### **Determination**

Foundation North, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is a non-reporting financial institution for the purposes of the CRS Applied Standard and the requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the CRS reporting period 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018, and subsequent CRS reporting periods under the CRS Applied Standard.

“CRS applied standard” means the CRS standard as modified by section 185O for the determination of requirements under the Tax Administration Act 1994.

“CRS publication” means the _Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters_, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

“CRS reporting period” means the period from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018 and any subsequent 12-month period from 1 April to the following 31 March.

1.  developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty countries; and

3.  contained in Part IIB of the CRS Publication.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

The trustees of the Scheme (in that capacity) primarily conduct a business of investing, administering, or managing financial assets or money on behalf of the Scheme and its Members. Therefore, in terms of the CRS standard, the Scheme is an investment entity and a reporting New Zealand financial institution.

The Scheme is registered as a restricted workplace savings scheme under the FMC Act 2013. The Scheme is a defined contribution scheme.

As a workplace savings scheme the Scheme has the purposes of providing retirement, disability and death benefits as well as benefits to Members on ceasing employment with the Employer (whether immediately on ceasing that employment or subsequently).

### **Scope of determination**

A Member’s Account does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a retirement or pension account in subparagraph C(17)(a) of Section VIII of the CRS standard, and has other substituting characteristics which indicate that such an account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

This determination is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and applies to a Member’s Account in the Scheme where all of the following conditions are satisfied:

*   The Scheme continues to maintain the Member’s Account as part of a registered workplace savings scheme under the FMC Act 2013;
*   The Scheme continues to be subject to the AML Exemption Requirements (and, if those requirements are not met, to AML procedures);
*   The Member satisfies either of the following:
    *   The Member is an Employee that is working in New Zealand for the Employer or is an Employee of the Employer that is working overseas on an Overseas Secondment; or
    *   The Member is a former Employee that was working in New Zealand (and/or on an Overseas Secondment) at the time the Employer and the Member made contributions to the account;
*   The Member is a natural person;
*   The Member is not present in New Zealand on a Work Visa;
*   All Employer contributions are or have been subject to tax at source where New Zealand law requires or has required (e.g. ESCT);
*   All Employee contributions (including past employee contributions) are deducted from payroll (salary or wages), are capped at a percentage of the Member’s salary, and are subject to PAYE (or to equivalent source deduction payments made where the Employee is working overseas on an Overseas Secondment);
*   All Temporary Absence contributions are capped at the frequency and amount of the Member’s contributions immediately prior to the start of the agreed absence from work;
*   Annual contributions (including both Employer and Employee contributions) to the Member’s Account continue to be equal to or less than USD 50,000 per annum (including any applicable aggregation rules set out in the CRS);
*   Investment income from the account is subject to income tax at the Scheme level and occurs at source (i.e. not subject to the Member filing a tax return);
*   All such taxation is reported to Inland Revenue by the payer, and not the Member;
*   The Scheme continues to only allow Members to make Permitted Withdrawals;
*   Any transfers into the Member’s Account on or after 1 July 2017 from sources other than the Employer or Employee contributions referred to above are from entities or Financial Accounts that meet the requirements of subparagraph (C)(17)(a) or (b) of Section VIII of the CRS or from one or more retirement or pension funds that meet the requirements of any of subparagraphs B(5) through (7) of Section VIII of the CRS. Any transfers into the Member’s Account made prior to 1 July 2017 from sources other than the Employer or Employee contributions referred to above were from entities or Financial Accounts that would, based on a reasonable assessment by the Scheme, in conjunction with the Employer as necessary and based on information in their possession, have been exempt under the above provisions, as if the CRS had applied prior to 1 July 2017. A Member’s Account that otherwise satisfies the USD 50,000 contributions threshold outlined above will also not fail to satisfy this requirement solely because the Account may receive assets or funds transferred from such excluded accounts or excluded funds.

Determining that a Member’s Account in the Scheme is an excluded account, and specifying this under New Zealand law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Determination**

A Member’s Account in the Scheme, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If any of the above conditions are not satisfied for a particular Member’s Account this determination will not apply to that account.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the reporting period beginning 1 July 2017, and subsequent reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Dated at Hamilton this 27th day of November 2018.

### **Scope of determination**

This determination is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and applies to an i-Select scheme account where:

*   The i-Select scheme is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund and a registered superannuation scheme and legacy scheme, under the FMC Act;
*   The i-Select scheme continues to maintain its registration on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund and a registered superannuation scheme and legacy scheme, and its Manager complies with the relevant on-going registration requirements under the FMC Act and schedule 12 of the FMCR 2014;

*   The i-Select scheme reports information to Inland Revenue for tax purposes in accordance with its statutory obligations. This includes the reporting of taxation paid by the scheme on investment income earned for the account;
*   The account only accepts:
    *   ROPS contributions; and
    *   Transfers from:
        *   Entities that meet the requirements of Section VIII(B)(5)-(7) of the CRS; and/or
        *   Financial Accounts that meet the requirements of Section VIII(C)(17)(a) or (b) of the CRS;
*   These contributions/transfers are reported to HMRC where required under the ROPS rules and under UK law;
*   The member of the i-Select scheme is a natural person;

*   Any transfers into the account from other entities or Financial Accounts comply with the following:
    *   If the transfer occurs on or after 1 July 2017 it is from entities or Financial Accounts that meet the requirements of subparagraph (C)(17)(a) or (b) of Section VIII of the CRS or from one or more retirement or pension funds that meet the requirements of any of subparagraphs B(5) through (7) of Section VIII of the CRS; and
    *   If the transfer occurred prior to 1 July 2017 it was, based on a reasonable assessment by the i-Select Scheme from information in its possession, from entities or Financial Accounts that meet the requirements of subparagraph (C)(17)(a) or (b) of Section VIII of the CRS or from one or more retirement or pension funds that meet the requirements of any of subparagraphs B(5) through (7) of Section VIII of the CRS.

An i-Select scheme account that otherwise satisfies the contribution threshold condition referred to above would not fail to satisfy that condition solely because the account receives transfers from such excluded entities or accounts.

*   The i-Select scheme compiles with the following withdrawal rules:
    *   The ROPS withdrawal rules including:
        *   Withdrawals upon retirement (from the age of 55 - being the UK standard retirement age), upon death, or as a result of serious illness; and
        *   The circumstances where withdrawals need to be reported to HMRC in the UK; and
    *   Compliance with any applicable **additional restrictions** on withdrawals under New Zealand law; and
*   i-Select remains on HMRC’s ROPS list¹.

Determining that an i-Select scheme account is an excluded account, and specifying this under New Zealand law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Determination**

An i-Select scheme account in the i-Select scheme, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If any of the above conditions are not satisfied for a particular i-Select scheme account this determination will not apply to that account.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the reporting period beginning 1 July 2017, and subsequent reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Dated at Wellington this 27th day of March 2019.

Community trust – Non-reporting financial institution determination
===================================================================

Determination CRS 2019/010 - A type of Community Trust, that comes within the scope of this determination, is a non-reporting financial institution for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAW of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Interpretation**

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

"CRS Applied Standard" means the CRS Standard as modified by section 185O for the determination of requirements under the Tax Administration Act 1994.

“CRS Publication” means the _Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters_, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

“CRS reporting period” means the period from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 and any subsequent 12-month period from 1 April to 31 March.

"CRS Standard" means the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information, as amended from time to time, which is a standard –

1.  developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty countries; and
2.  agreed by the Council for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on 15 July 2014; and
3.  contained in Part IIB of the CRS Publication.

“Charitable Trusts Act” means the Charitable Trusts Act 1957.

“Community Trust” means a Community Trust that is defined in section 4 of the Community Trusts Act (being a Community Trust established under Part 2 of the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1998 to acquire the shares in the capital of a trustee bank’s successor company and for the purposes specified in that Act).

“Community Trusts Act” means the Community Trusts Act 1999.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

There are currently 12 Community Trusts in New Zealand that were originally established under the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988 to be vested with the ownership of the then government-owned shares in each regional trustee bank.

Most of these Community Trusts have sold their trustee bank shares and now manage significant and diversified portfolios of investments for the public benefit of the community within each of their statutory area or region in New Zealand. They are regulated by the Community Trusts Act and are subject to the terms of their trust deeds (which are also regulated by that Act).

The statutory purpose of these Community Trusts is to hold property (and property vested in them) on trust to be applied for charitable, cultural, philanthropic, recreational, and other purposes that are beneficial to their communities, principally in their area or region (see section 12 of the Community Trusts Act).

Each of these Community Trusts provides annual grant funding to a range of regional community-based organisations and entities.

The Community Trusts that are the subject of this determination are:

*   Incorporated charitable trusts, incorporated under, and subject to, the Charitable Trusts Act; and
*   Managed investment entity financial institutions under Section VIII(A)(6)(b) of the CRS Standard, as their gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets, and their assets are managed (in whole or part) by other entities that are financial institutions.

Each of this type of Community Trust, that is a managed investment entity financial institution:

*   While not wholly government owned and controlled, the government is effectively its settlor and protector, and responsible (along with its trustees, and the Crown) for its governance and operational oversight;
*   Is regulated under the Community Trusts Act, Charitable Trusts Act, and other New Zealand law, including government and Crown governance and oversight;
*   Has objects that are solely for public benefit purposes within their specific geographical area or region (per the Community Trusts Act and its trust deed);
*   Only provides grant benefits to community-based organisations and entities (and not directly to private individuals), in terms of the Community Trusts Act and its trust deed;
*   Does not seek external funding for investment, but derives its income from the investment of its funds (which originally arose from the Crown endowment);
*   Derives investment income that is **not** derived from the carrying on of any commercial business that provides financial services to private persons; and
*   As an incorporated charitable trust, if it was ever liquidated or dissolved, the treatment of its surplus assets would be determined by the High Court of New Zealand. Such a decision would be consistent with the object of its trust deed and the scheme of the Community Trusts Act.

### **Scope of determination**

For the avoidance of doubt, this determination only applies to a type of Community Trust that is a Financial Institution under the CRS Standard and that satisfies all of the following conditions:

*   It continues to _not_ operate a commercial business that provides financial services to private persons;
*   It is, and continues to be, a Community Trust that is subject to the Community Trusts Act (originally established under Part 2 of the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1998);
*   It is, and continues to be, an incorporated charitable trust under the Charitable Trusts Act; and
*   Due to its status as also being an incorporated charitable trust, if ever liquidated or dissolved, the High Court of New Zealand will decide how any of its surplus assets are vested, and such a decision would be consistent with the objects of its trust deed and the scheme of the Community Trusts Act.

A type of Community Trust that fully meets the scope and requirements of this determination is considered to fully satisfy the requirements for having substantially similar characteristics to a “governmental entity” that is a “controlled entity”, as described in subparagraphs B(2) and B(2)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS Standard.

Determining that a type of Community Trust outlined above is a non-reporting financial institution, and specifying this under New Zealand law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS Standard.

### **Determination**

A Community Trust that meets all the above conditions and requirements, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is a non-reporting financial institution for the purposes of the CRS Applied Standard and the requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the CRS reporting period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, and subsequent CRS reporting periods under the CRS Applied Standard.

Dated at Wellington this 27th day of March 2019

Cryptocurrency tax guidance extended to cover employee share schemes
====================================================================

**06 September 2019**

Inland Revenue is extending its guidance on cryptocurrencies to cover their use in employee share schemes.

This follows three other public rulings issued in June and July that detail the tax implications when crypto-assets are used to pay salary and wages, bonuses or when an employer issues its own crypto-assets and offers them to an employee.

Public Rulings Director Susan Price says similiar to the other rulings, Inland Revenue is simply laying out the tax implications for when crypto-assets are used as remuneration, rather than sanctioning their use.

“As far as we’re aware, there’s no widespread use of cryptocurrencies as a form of remuneration, nor is there an increasing demand.

“Our guidance is mostly in response to queries from our customers who want to know how the use of crypto-assets can be applied to exisiting tax laws so that’s all we’re providing here.”

The latest guidance states that when crypto-assets are issued to employees in the form of a “share” in the company that is issuing them, they may be part of an employee share scheme package.

It’s anticipated that the share could be created as part of an initial coin offering or some other sort of token generating event. The ruling explains how a crypto-asset can qualify as a share. However, Inland Revenue considers that most such assets will not have features of shares and so will fall outside of the employee share scheme rules.

“Similar guidance is being produced by other tax authorities around the world as we all work out how crypto-assets can be incorporated into existing tax laws.

“We will review our position in three years’ time as is usual practice with the issuing of rulings,” Susan Price says.

The recent public rulings on crypto-assets can be viewed here: [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/public-rulings/](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/public-rulings/public-rulings-main-index.html "Inland Revenue Public Rulings")

| Important | **New tax rules on accommodation** |
| On 30 June 2014 the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 was enacted. This legislation introduced changes to the tax rules that deal with the taxation of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments made by employers to cover employee expenditure. In general these new tax rules, as they relate to accommodation, apply from 1 April 2015. However, in some circumstances it is possible for employers to elect that some of the changes regarding employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments can apply to a period prior to 1 April 2015 in accordance with section CZ 30 of the ITA 2007. In circumstances where an employer chooses to apply the new accommodation rules retrospectively, to the extent that these new rules differ from the existing rules, CS 12/01 and its appendix will no longer apply to that arrangement from the retrospective date chosen by the employer.<br><br>However, where no election is made by the employer to apply the new rules retrospectively or the employer is unable to make such an election (e.g. the employer had taken a tax position that the accommodation was taxable before 6 December 2012 - section CZ 30(2)), and to the extent that the current rules continue to apply until 1 April 2015, the Commissioner considers that CS 12/01 and its appendix still sets out her position as to how those existing rules apply.<br><br>A [special report on the new rules](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2014-sr-employee-allowances/overview "Link opens in new window.")<br> is on the Tax Policy website in advance of full coverage of the new legislation in the [_Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 26, No 7, August 2014](/internet/ird/aboutir/newsletters/tib/previous-volumes/tax-information-bulletin-vol-26.html)<br>. |     |

_The following should be read with the Commissioner's Statement CS 12/01. It illustrates the treatment of temporary shifts, and the factors that need to be taken into account in determining when a shift is likely to be regarded as temporary._

_The comments below are illustrative, but different factors may alter the tax treatment._

Generally, accommodation payments made by an employer or the value of accommodation provided by an employer are taxable in the hands of the employee. However, these payments or the value of the accommodation provided may not be taxable when they relate to a temporary shift for work purposes.[1](#1)
 This is because expenditure related to this accommodation is unlikely to be of a private or domestic nature. A temporary shift for work purposes is where the employee, in the course of doing their job, is required to stay temporarily away from the place where they live (i.e. their home base).

It is not unusual for an employee to work away from home on temporary assignment. In these situations the employer may provide or pay for accommodation for the period of the assignment. While the employee is physically absent from their residence or home base, generally they have not relocated. While it is a matter of fact in every case, it is expected that the place where they "live" for all practical purposes remains their home base. In the Commissioner's view, for the purposes of determining the tax treatment of accommodation, where a person lives is not determined solely by the location of the house or dwelling that they live in on any particular day. Rather it is determined on the basis of the person's circumstances. Clearly, if the location of the house or dwelling is also the centre of their domestic life and where their substantive employment is located, that location is the place where they live.

The Commissioner considers that the appropriate test for determining whether an employee has temporarily shifted to another location (or alternatively whether they have relocated), is to determine whether they live in their home base or in the new location.

Determining where a person lives involves a weighing of all the factors.

Factors to consider when determining whether a current employee has made a temporary shift include:

*   Has the employee relocated and established that they are living in a new location?
*   Does the employee retain their substantive employment position in the original location, or has the employee relocated to take up new employment?
*   What is the duration of the transfer? The shorter the transfer period the more likely it is that the transfer is temporary. Equally, the longer a transfer the more likely it is that the transfer is more than temporary.
*   Does the original location (where their substantive job is) remain the centre of the person's domestic life?
*   Is the payment from the employer effectively paying the employee's mortgage for a property at the new location? The acquisition of property in the new location suggests a more than temporary move.
*   Has the employee retained a home (either owned or rented by them) in their old location which is available to them? This is relevant not because of the costs incurred but rather what it suggests about the nature of the arrangement. Along with other factors, the retention of a home can sometimes suggest an intention to return and may imply that the arrangement is temporary and work related rather than personal. However this factor alone is not determinative.

When an employee shifts to take up a new job with a new employer this is not considered to be a temporary shift. This is because they have not shifted in the course of doing their job. Rather, they have shifted to enable them to take up new employment. This new employment may be on a temporary or permanent basis. Any accommodation or accommodation payment they receive from their new employer will be subject to tax unless the exemption in section CW 17B for work-related relocations applies.

| Examples |     |
| The following examples are intended to demonstrate the application of the above factors. The examples do not cover the way in which the accommodation to the employee is provided or paid, which can affect the tax treatment of the accommodation.<br><br>A works for a firm of accountants. The accountants have two offices - one in Auckland and a smaller office in Dunedin. A's job is based in Auckland, where he lives with his parents.<br><br>1.  A is sent to Dunedin to assist with an audit. He is away from Auckland for three nights, and stays in a hotel in Dunedin. After the audit, he returns to Auckland.  <br>      <br>    _A is staying short-term away from his home location in the performance of his employment duties. Therefore, the cost of his hotel is not taxable._<br>2.  When one of the accountants in the Dunedin office falls ill, and is required to be away from work for six weeks, A is asked to fill-in for that 6 week period. A agrees with his employer that he will come back to Auckland for a 3 day weekend after 3 weeks, but otherwise will stay in Dunedin for the whole period. His employer will put him up in a motel for the whole period (including the period he is back in Auckland).  <br>      <br>    _A is undertaking the work in Dunedin at the request of his employer. The duration of the work in Dunedin clearly indicates that this is a temporary shift. His job remains open in Auckland and he is staying in a motel while he is in Dunedin. Therefore, it is considered that A has not relocated to Dunedin. The cost of his motel is not taxable as this is a temporary shift to another location as part of the performance of his current employment duties._<br>3.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, it turns out that the Dunedin staff member cannot return to work. The staff member's position is being advertised, but A has agreed to extend his stay in Dunedin for an additional 10 weeks (four months in total). Other than a couple of long weekends in Auckland during the extended period, A will stay in Dunedin (and the motel paid for by his employer) for the whole time. A has made it clear to his employer that he is not staying in Dunedin and will be returning to Auckland at the end of 4 months.  <br>      <br>    _The job in Auckland remains available to A and the intention of the parties is that he will return to Auckland at the end of the four-month period. While the duration of his stay is longer than the original 6 weeks, it still indicates a shift which is temporary in nature because it is of a limited duration. It is considered that A has not changed the place where he lives. Rather, it suggests that this shift is temporary in nature and therefore the cost of his motel is not taxable as the shift occurred as part of the performance of his current employment duties._<br>4.  A's circumstances change as he has established a new relationship in Dunedin and wants to live in Dunedin permanently. He applied for the vacant Dunedin position, and has been appointed, becoming a permanent staff member in Dunedin at the end of the four month period. However, the firm has agreed to pay for a further six weeks in the motel, after which he will be expected to find (and pay for) his own accommodation.  <br>      <br>    _As A has now become a permanent staff member in Dunedin it is considered that he has relocated to Dunedin. The additional six weeks in the motel will be taxable to A, unless the requirements in the relocation exemption in section CW 17B are met._[2](#2)<br>    <br>5.  Some time later, A is now settled in Dunedin. He is married, has a mortgage, and a young child. His employer asks him to temporarily manage the firm's Auckland office and he agrees to be the temporary manager there for three months. He travels from Dunedin to Auckland each Monday morning, returning on Friday evening. During this time the firm brings in a contractor to cover A's job in the Dunedin office.  <br>      <br>    _Although A is now working in Auckland on a temporary basis, as his wife and family and the home that they own remain in Dunedin, the centre of his domestic life is Dunedin. The shift to Auckland is intended to be temporary in nature and it is envisaged that he is able to return to his substantive job in Dunedin at the end of the three-month period._  <br>      <br>    _A has not changed the place where he lives and therefore it is considered that this is a temporary shift undertaken at the request of the employer. As such, the cost of the hotel accommodation in Auckland is not taxable to A._<br>6.  The job in Auckland turns out to be bigger than expected, and is extended for a further three months (making six months in total). Commuting is becoming too difficult, so A's family join him in Auckland for the period, and they all move into a serviced apartment, which the firm pays for. He keeps his house in Dunedin, where it remains empty. The contractor covering A's job in Dunedin has their contract extended indefinitely.  <br>      <br>    _The total period for A's temporary shift is now six months and for the final three months the family is now based in the apartment in Auckland. This could be seen as suggesting a more than temporary shift._  <br>      <br>    _However, A's job in Dunedin remains available to him. In addition, his house in Dunedin remains empty. A and family are clearly living in temporary accommodation. The total duration of six months could still be seen as temporary. The intention of the parties is that the arrangement is temporary._  <br>      <br>    _After an evaluation of these factors, it is considered that this is still likely to be a temporary shift and that the cost of the serviced apartment is not taxable to A._<br>7.  The job in Auckland is extended for a further nine months. A and his family move into a rented house in Auckland that the firm pays for. A rents out his house in Dunedin for a nine month lease.  <br>      <br>    _A has moved the family to Auckland and they are living in rented accommodation in Auckland. The Dunedin house has been rented out. It is considered that the centre of A's domestic life has moved to Auckland. The duration of the arrangement, being a further nine months, also tends to suggest that A may have relocated where he lives to Auckland._  <br>      <br>    _While A's job in Dunedin remains open and he continues to own a house in Dunedin, it is considered based on an evaluation of all the factors that A has now relocated the place where he lives to Auckland. As such, the shift is more than temporary in nature and the accommodation payment received is taxable to A._<br>8.  A agrees to continue in his job in Auckland permanently and A and his family continue to live in the house rented by his employer. The employer pays market rent of $500 a week but as part of A's new contract, A will pay $200 per week to the employer as a contribution to the rental.  <br>      <br>    _As A has permanently relocated, this is no longer a temporary shift and the accommodation is taxable. As the employer is providing A with subsidised rental accommodation, A is taxable on the market value of the subsidised accommodation A is receiving, which is $300 per week._<br>9.  A's employer is seeking to appoint a new partner to the firm. B, formerly employed in Sydney, takes up the new partnership position in the firm and shifts to Auckland. B retains her house in Sydney and leaves her adult children living in the Sydney house. As part of B's contract, her new employer agrees to pay B an accommodation payment of $100,000 annually.  <br>      <br>    _As B has relocated to Auckland to take up a job with her new employer, the accommodation payment will be taxable, unless the requirements in the relocation exemption in section CW 17B are met._<br>10.  C, a Dunedin-based employee of a national firm is asked to work in Christchurch as part of the rebuild for nine months. C's employer owns an apartment in Christchurch which is provided to C during the period he is working in Christchurch. C's temporary secondment to Christchurch is extended to 12 months. C commutes to Christchurch every week on Monday and returns to Dunedin on Friday evenings. Throughout this period C's family remain in the family home in Dunedin.  <br>      <br>    _The total period of C's temporary work shift is 12 months and this could be seen as strongly suggesting a more than temporary shift._  <br>      <br>    _However, C's job in Dunedin remains available to C and the intention of the parties is that C will return to Dunedin at the end of the 12 month period. C's family remain in the family home in Dunedin. C commutes back from Christchurch to Dunedin every weekend._  <br>      <br>    _After an evaluation of these factors, it is considered that, on balance, this is still likely to be a temporary shift and that the accommodation provided to C is not taxable to C._  <br>      <br>    _The Commissioner considers that a shift of between 6 and 12 months could potentially be a temporary shift but that a shift of over 12 months is likely to be more than a temporary shift unless exceptional circumstances exist._<br>11.  D is an engineer in a national firm, based in Auckland. He is offered a development opportunity by the firm to manage the firms engineering work in Christchurch for the length of the Christchurch rebuild. This involves living in Christchurch and it is anticipated that this will continue for several years. His wife and children remain in Auckland and continue to live in the family home. D travels home most weekends to see his family. While in Christchurch, D lives in an apartment paid for by the firm.  <br>      <br>    _It is considered that in spite of the fact that D's family remain in Auckland and the fact that ultimately the Christchurch rebuild will have a finite life, the length of time involved indicates that the work arrangement that has been entered into is more than temporary. Where D works is now Christchurch. Effectively D has relocated for work purposes and is taxable on the market value of the accommodation provided, unless the requirements in the relocation exemption in section CW 17B are met._<br>12.  E is employed by a multinational firm. E has been sent to Auckland from her home in Sydney on a two year contract assisting the firm's New Zealand operations. The firm has provided E with a serviced apartment to live in Auckland. E's family remain in Sydney and E travels to visit them regularly. However, E spends most of her time (including weekends) in Auckland.  <br>      <br>    _Although E's family remain in Sydney it is considered that E lives, for the duration of the contract, in Auckland. Auckland is where her work is and where she spends most of her time. In addition, the length of the contract strongly suggests the arrangement is more than temporary. E is taxable on the market value of the serviced apartment, unless the requirements in the relocation exemption in section CW 17B are met._ |     |

### _Operational Application_

If an employee, while working for their current employer, shifts to a new location for work related purposes for a period of less than six months (and it was always intended that the shift be less than six months), the Commissioner generally considers that the shift is likely to be temporary in nature and, therefore, the accommodation payments or the value of the accommodation provided is not taxable. In these circumstances, the CIR has decided, pursuant to the CIR's care and management powers, that Inland Revenue will not be devoting any resources to investigate such arrangements that are less than six months in duration. This approach does not apply if the person has shifted to take up a new job with a new employer.

| Important | **New tax rules on accommodation** |
| On 30 June 2014 the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 was enacted. This legislation introduced changes to the tax rules that deal with the taxation of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments made by employers to cover employee expenditure. In general these new tax rules, as they relate to accommodation, apply from 1 April 2015. However, in some circumstances it is possible for employers to elect that some of the changes regarding employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments can apply to a period prior to 1 April 2015 in accordance with section CZ 30 of the ITA 2007.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Introduction

We have been asked to set out the Commissioner's position on the existing income tax treatment of accommodation payments, employer-provided accommodation and accommodation allowances made by employers to employees.

In some circumstances an employer may fund the cost or provision of accommodation to employees. This can be arranged in various ways. This Statement covers the Commissioner's position on:

*   the provision of accommodation or the payment of an accommodation allowance by an employer to an employee;
*   payments made by an employer that relate to accommodation expenditure incurred by an employee (expenditure on account).

This Statement also sets out the Commissioner's approach to correcting tax positions taken by taxpayers prior to the release of this Statement.

### Summary

In summary, the Commissioner considers that accommodation is generally treated as income of an employee and therefore subject to PAYE. This is the case whether it is paid for by an employer on behalf of an employee, paid through an allowance or directly provided by the employer. However, in certain circumstances, overnight and temporary accommodation related to an employee's job will not be taxable.

### The provision of accommodation or an accommodation allowance

Under section CE 1(1B), the _market value_ of accommodation provided by an employer to an employee is income of the employee. Equally, the _market value_ of an accommodation allowance paid by an employer to an employee is income of the employee. The employer must account for PAYE.

Issues arise most often in the situation of relocation or temporary accommodation arrangements.

Taxpayers have argued that where the employee is still maintaining a home in another location, employer-provided accommodation or accommodation allowances are not taxable. Taxpayers argue this is because there is no net benefit provided to the employee; the value of any accommodation or allowance received by the employee is nil as the employee continues to pay the cost of their own house.

The Commissioner does not agree with this view. The law does not support a net-benefit approach.

The Commissioner acknowledges there has been some uncertainty and inconsistent practice, by both Inland Revenue and taxpayers, regarding the taxation of employer-provided accommodation and accommodation allowances. The Inland Revenue Technical Rulings Manual paragraph 57.11 reflected a net- benefit approach to determining the value of employer-provided accommodation and accommodation allowances. However, taxpayers were advised in September 1998[1](#1)
 that the Technical Rulings Manual was being discontinued and that Technical Rulings should not be relied upon as representing Inland Revenue's views or practice. In addition, the legislation has changed considerably since the relevant Technical Rulings chapter was written.

The Commissioner's position is that determining market value is a practical matter involving an objective valuation. The market value of accommodation provided is the price that a willing provider would accept from a willing customer. The market value of an accommodation allowance is the actual amount of the allowance. It is irrelevant that a person may be maintaining a house in a different location.

_Commissioner's operational approach_

If you consider you have adopted a tax position for employer-provided accommodation or accommodation allowances that differs from the Commissioner's, we suggest you discuss the matter with your tax advisor, or us, and consider making a voluntary disclosure.

Taxpayers making such voluntary disclosures will only be required to account for PAYE for the **two year** period prior to the date of issue of this Statement.

Given the previous uncertainty and inconsistency, taxpayers making voluntary disclosures will not be subject to use of money interest or shortfall penalties.

Where taxpayers, on the basis of explicit current advice given to them by Inland Revenue in writing, have incorrectly treated the provision of accommodation or an accommodation allowance as non-taxable, the Commissioner will not seek to adjust the treatment adopted by them in periods prior to the issuing of this Statement. However, these taxpayers cannot rely on that advice in the future and should contact us to discuss their position.

### Accommodation payments made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (expenditure on account)

The Commissioner's position is that accommodation payments made by an employer that relate to expenditure on accommodation incurred by an employee (expenditure on account) are usually income of the employee under section CE 1(1)(b) and PAYE should be deducted. An example of expenditure on account is where a tenancy agreement is entered into and signed by the employee and the rental payments are then paid by the employer directly to the landlord (or property manager) on behalf of the employee.

Accommodation costs are usually considered private in nature, as everyone needs shelter of some form. Often accommodation is about the employee getting themselves into a position to work. There will be limited circumstances where an accommodation payment that is expenditure on account will be exempt from tax under section CW 17. For example, where an employee works away from their usual office at the direction of their employer and incurs hotel accommodation costs directly in their own name, where their employer pays the account directly to the hotel this would not be taxable.

Aside from the limited exemption in section CW 17, the Commissioner's position has always been that accommodation payments that are expenditure on account are generally subject to income tax. The Commissioner's position on this matter is unchanged.

We note that some taxpayers have attempted to extend the net-benefit approach to expenditure on account cases. However, the net-benefit approach, as reflected in the Technical Rulings Manual, never applied to expenditure on account cases.

We also note that reimbursements for employee accommodation costs are treated in the same manner as expenditure on account for income tax purposes.

_Commissioner's operational approach_

If you consider you have adopted a position for accommodation payments that are expenditure on account that differs from the Commissioner's, we suggest you discuss the matter with your tax advisor, or us, and consider making a voluntary disclosure.

In circumstances where PAYE should have been paid, the Commissioner is not prevented from adjusting those previous periods as no statute bar applies.

However, taxpayers making voluntary disclosures in this circumstance will only be required to account for PAYE for the **four year** period prior to the date of issue of this Statement.

Incorrect tax positions taken will be subject to use of money interest and potentially shortfall penalties.

### Overnight and temporary accommodation

The Commissioner considers that the provision of accommodation, the payment of an accommodation allowance, or accommodation payments that are expenditure on account, will not be taxable when they relate to overnight or other short-term stays by an employee in a location other than their home location in the performance of their employment duties. The cost of such temporary arrangements is not considered private in nature.

Similarly, the provision of accommodation, the payment of an accommodation allowance, or accommodation payments that are expenditure on account, may not be taxable when they relate to a temporary shift by an employee to another location. That is, where the employee has not relocated permanently but needs to be based in a different location for a temporary period as part of the performance of their current employment duties. However, this will depend on the facts of each case, including the duration of the temporary shift and the structure of the arrangement.

### "Work-related relocation"

This Statement does not apply to accommodation related to a "work-related relocation" under section CW 17B. For example, an employee permanently relocates to another city and the employer funds the accommodation costs for three months.

### Making a voluntary disclosure

When making a voluntary disclosure (and for the purposes of applying the correct tax treatment going forward), care must be taken in determining the facts of each case. Inland Revenue has seen a number of arrangements where the employment agreement has provided for the payment of an accommodation allowance to a particular employee. However, an examination of what has actually occurred has revealed that no allowance was paid but rather a payment was made by the employer on behalf of the employee (expenditure on account).

Guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure are contained in our booklet _Putting your tax returns right_ (IR280) and Standard Practice Statement 09/02 _Voluntary Disclosures_ (May 2009).

OECD information sharing requirements for taxpayer rulings and determinations
=============================================================================

CS 16/01 informs taxpayers of the new OECD requirements to exchange certain cross-border taxpayer rulings and determinations with other OECD countries.

_The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter. The Statement is not a consultative document._

Following the release of the report _Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ in February 2013, OECD and G20 countries adopted a 15-point Action Plan to address Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) activities. As a member of the OECD, New Zealand is involved in this process.

Action 5 of the BEPS Action Plan, titled _Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance_, requires OECD and G20 countries, including New Zealand, to exchange information spontaneously about taxpayer-specific rulings issued on cross-border activities. This is a “minimum standard” that New Zealand, as a member of the OECD, and a party that has approved and endorsed the OECD Council of Ambassadors’ recommendations, is required to comply with.

The OECD has identified six categories of taxpayer-specific rulings that, in the absence of compulsory spontaneous exchange of information, could give rise to BEPS concerns:

1.  Taxpayer-specific rulings related to preferential regimes (although New Zealand does not have any preferential regimes).
2.  Cross-border unilateral advance pricing agreements (APAs) and any other cross-border unilateral tax rulings (such as ATRs) covering transfer pricing or the application of transfer pricing principles.
3.  Cross-border rulings providing for a unilateral downward adjustment to the taxpayer’s taxable profits that is not directly reflected in the taxpayer’s financial/commercial accounts.
4.  Permanent establishment rulings, ie rulings concerning the existence or absence of, and/or the attribution of profits to, a permanent establishment by the country giving the ruling.
5.  Related party conduit rulings.
6.  Any other type of ruling that, in the absence of spontaneous information exchange, gives rise to BEPS concerns.

The information exchange obligations will apply to:

*   past rulings (those issued on or after 1 January 2010 that were still in effect on or after 1 January 2014); and
*   future rulings (those issued on or after 1 April 2016).

The Commissioner’s information exchange obligations cover all private and product rulings, advance pricing agreements and financial arrangements determinations that come within the above criteria. The Commissioner will receive rulings information from other countries on a reciprocal basis, which will provide helpful intelligence.

The Commissioner is required to ensure that information regarding rulings considering the above issues is exchanged within three months of the ruling being issued. The Commissioner will decide whether a ruling falls into any of the above categories. If it does then the Commissioner will prepare a summary of the ruling to be shared. The summary must include the date of issue, the period covered by the ruling, the type of ruling and a short summary of the issues covered, along with some basic information on the applicant (ie, IRD number, name, address and business activity). This may be followed by an exchange of the ruling itself on request.

Each case will need to be determined on its specific facts and circumstances, as not all cross-border rulings will be subject to the new exchange requirements. Consistent with the Commissioner’s approach for sharing information under double tax agreements and the _Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters_, the Commissioner will not be notifying taxpayers when their rulings or information are shared.

The nature of the ruling will determine the countries the information has to be provided to. However, they will usually include the countries of residence of all the parties materially impacted by the transactions covered by the ruling, and the country of residence of the ultimate parent company, and immediate parent company, of the applicant. To protect the secrecy of taxpayer information, information will only be shared with countries where New Zealand has a double tax agreement in place, and with parties to the _Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters_.

A backdated remedial payment of holiday pay is an employment-related remedial payment under the Income Tax (Employment-related Remedial Payments) Regulations 2017 (the regulations) and should be treated as an extra pay from 18 August 2017. This treatment also applies to a remedial payment made to a former employee. 2. The remedial payment is taxed at the current tax rates and deductions made from the remedial payment should be recorded in the Employer Monthly Schedule (EMS) at the time of payment. There is no requirement to adjust the EMS for the past periods to which the entitlements relate. 3. PAYE, as well as other deductions such as student loan repayment and KiwiSaver contributions, should be deducted at the time of payment. 4. Where a former employee cannot be found and the amount of remedial payment is not paid out for 6 years, that amount will be subject to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Background 5. It was identified recently that for a number of years some employers have been underpaying their employees’ holiday pay entitlement. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) is aware that employers are undertaking an exercise to remedy this by calculating and repaying the shortfall to the affected employees and former employees in a lump sum payment. 6. This Statement provides guidance to employers on how the backdated remedial payments are to be treated for tax purposes. “Backdated” in this context means a payment that is being made because an earlier payment was insufficient. The backdated payment satisfies that shortfall. Such a payment will be referred as a “remedial payment” in this Statement. 7. Please note that this Statement is concerned only with the tax treatment of the backdated remedial payment and not the calculation of the backdated holiday pay entitlement itself (or any matters of a contractual nature for instance). 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation Remedial payment treated as extra pay 8. From 18 August 2017, an employment-related remedial payment is declared to be included in the definition of extra pay under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) by the regulations. 9. An employment-related remedial payment is defined as a payment that, but for the regulations, would be a payment of salary or wages or an extra pay, or a combination of both, and is made to a person to satisfy all or part of a shortfall in 1 or more previous payments to the person in respect of the person’s entitlements under the Holidays Act 2003 or an employment agreement, or both. This means an employment-related remedial payment covers more than just holiday pay. It covers a payment made to correct other types of entitlements under the Holidays Act (e.g. sick leave) and entitlements under an employment agreement (e.g. long service leave). The regulations do not apply to a payment that is made to satisfy a failure to pay any salary or wages at all (e.g. wages that are paid late). 10. Prior to the regulations coming into force, a backdated remedial payment of holiday pay entitlements was treated as salary or wages, or an extra pay, or a combination of both, depending on the circumstances which gave rise to the original payment of holiday pay. It is the Commissioner’s view that, but for the regulations, the tax treatment of a backdated payment of holiday pay follows that of the original payment, had it been paid correctly. A backdated payment of holiday pay that would have been salary or wages should be treated as salary or wages at the time of the backdated payment. Similarly, a backdated payment of holiday pay is an extra pay if the original payment would have been an extra pay. 11. However, from 18 August 2017, as a backdated remedial payment of holiday pay entitlements made to an employee or a former employee falls within the definition of an employment-related remedial payment under the regulations, it is treated as an extra pay for tax purposes. Current tax rates apply 12. While the remedial payment is made up of holiday pay entitlements relating to previous tax years, the deficit amount is not calculated and paid until a current year. It is the Commissioner’s view that the individuals who receive the remedial payment derive the payment as income when it is received, and are properly assessed for tax in the year of receipt. There is no ability under the ITA for a person to spread the payment back to the years to which the entitlements relate. 13. This means that the current tax rates are applicable when withholding PAYE from the remedial payments. There is no expectation that employers make adjustments to the Employer Monthly Schedules (EMS) for the previous tax years. The amount of the remedial payment and amount of PAYE withheld simply needs to be recorded in the EMS for the period in which the payments are made. 14. Please refer to the Inland Revenue website for more information on how to calculate PAYE for extra pays. 3 UNCLASSIFIED Deductions other than PAYE 15. Where applicable, other deductions, such as student loan repayments and KiwiSaver contributions, should be made in the usual manner for current employees. Remedial payment made to a former employee 16. A backdated remedial payment of holiday pay made to a former employee also falls within the definition of employment-related remedial payment under the regulations and should be treated as an extra pay. The same methods of calculating PAYE are to be used. 17. When determining the correct extra pay withholding rate, an employer is required to annualise the PAYE income payments made to the employee in the 4-week period prior to the date of the extra pay payment (see section RD 17 of the ITA). It is the Commissioner’s view that the PAYE income payments required to be annualised are those paid by the employer making the remedial payment. The employer making the remedial payment is not expected to ascertain the PAYE income payments that are made to the former employee by other employers (for example, the former employee’s current employer). 18. A former employee who notifies the former employer of their tax code may choose the tax rate for the extra pay in the same manner as a current employee. The rate that the former employee chooses must not be lower than the applicable rate had the annualised value method been used. Student loan repayment deductions 19. If the former employee notifies the former employer of a student loan tax code, then student loan repayments should be deducted from the remedial payment. KiwiSaver contributions 20. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 applies to a remedial payment made to a former employee if they are a KiwiSaver member. Employee is defined in the KiwiSaver Act as a natural person who receives salary or wages (salary or wages in the KiwiSaver context includes extra pay). An employer, for the purposes of the KiwiSaver Act, is a person who pays or is liable to pay salary or wages to a person who is not a private domestic worker. 21. If the former employee has given the former employer a KiwiSaver deduction notice (either while they were in employment or at the time a remedial payment is made), then the contribution deduction rules are triggered and the employer must deduct KiwiSaver contribution from the former employee’s remedial payment in accordance with the deduction notice. The employer is encouraged to ascertain the former employee’s current KiwiSaver status as circumstances may have changed since they were in employment (e.g. the former employee may have been granted a contribution holiday). 22. As a general rule, if an employer is required to deduct KiwiSaver contribution from a payment of salary or wages, that employer is also required to pay compulsory employer contribution. 4 UNCLASSIFIED 23. A remedial payment made to a former employee who is not a KiwiSaver member at the time of payment will not be considered “new employment” and will not trigger the automatic enrolment rules under the KiwiSaver Act. Deceased employees 24. If the person eligible to receive a remedial payment is deceased, that remedial payment should be made to the executor or administrator of the deceased employee’s estate and PAYE should be deducted at the time of payment. When former employee cannot be located 25. The Commissioner foresees that there will be instances where a former employee (or their executor) cannot be located and a payment cannot be made. An employer’s obligation to withhold and pay PAYE to the Commissioner arises at the time the PAYE income payment is paid, i.e. actual payment to the employee. Therefore, where no remedial payment is made, it is not necessary for the employer to deduct PAYE, even if the backdated entitlement has been calculated. If the former employee is subsequently located and payment is made then PAYE will need to be deducted at the time of payment. 26. It is the Commissioner’s view that the remedial payment will eventually become unclaimed money and the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 applies if a former employee cannot be found and the remedial payment is not paid out for more than 6 years. Application 27. This Statement applies to remedial payments made on or after 18 August 2017. 28. For employers who have, prior to 18 August 2017, treated the remedial payments made as either salary or wages, or an extra pay, the Commissioner will not be devoting resources to determine whether the payments were salary or wages, an extra pay or a combination. However, if employers have failed to deduct any PAYE at all from the remedial payments, they should contact Inland Revenue. Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel Date of issue: 18 August 2017
1 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner’s Statement CS 18/ 01 Determining “Market Rental Value” of Employer-Provided Accommodation – Boarding Schools The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter. The Statement is not a consultative document. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). Introduction In Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02, the Commissioner provided guidance to assist taxpayers in estimating the likely market rental value of employer-provided accommodation. This Commissioner’s Statement is supplementary to Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02, and sets out concessionary treatment that will apply in respect of on-site accommodation provided to employees of boarding schools only. Accommodation provided to employees of boarding schools is taxable income of that employee. As it is treated as a PAYE income payment, the value of such accommodation is subject to the deduction of PAYE. The Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02 applies to accommodation provided to employees of boarding schools. However, it is recognised that on-site boarding school accommodation is likely to be subject to reduced market value, compared to comparable off -site accommodation, that is not readily quantifiable, due to unique restrictions and expectations that would apply to any tenant. This Commissioner’s Statement therefore sets out what the Commissioner will accept as an appropriate reduction off the market rental value that would otherwise apply. The effect of such a reduction is to reduce the amount to be treated as taxable income of the employee. Market rental value and appropriate reductions Boarding schools generally provide accommodation to employees. Such accommodation is either provided off-site or on-site. On-site accommodation is, for the purposes of this Statement, either “separate”, “embedded”, or “adjoined”. The starting point for all employer provided accommodation is that the taxable value of such accommodation is the market rental value of the accommodation. Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02 sets out the guidance provided to assist in estimating such a market rental value, and should be referred to. When school-owned accommodation is provided off school grounds, it is not considered that the market rental value of such accommodation will differ to any relevant degree. 2 UNCLASSIFIED However, it is considered that, broadly speaking, accommodation that is located within the grounds of a school could be subject to restrictions that would generally not occur in a residential tenancy. For example, bearing in mind the presence of students and the location of the dwelling within the grounds of a school, the tenancy arrangement may be subject to restrictions on smoking or drinking, whether inside or outside the dwelling, the ability to receive guests or visitors (including overnight guests), or greater expectations of tidiness or general behaviour. In addition, it is accepted that schools owe a fiduciary type duty to their students, and that duty could also be imposed on any tenants of accommodation located within the school grounds, regardless of whether or not the tenant was an employee of the school. Such restrictions could, of course, be taken into account in a professionally prepared market rental valuation, as it is appropriate to have regard to the specific terms of the tenancy. However, it is also acknowledged that restrictions that are appropriate in respect of boarding school on-site accommodation may not be as common, or generally applicable to other tenancy arrangements. Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02 allows an estimate of market rental value to be based on a review of comparable properties on internet sites that advertise rental properties, such as Trade Me. Such sites are unlikely to include sufficient detail of the terms of applicable tenancy agreements, and it is unlikely that there would be sufficient comparable properties to allow an accurate estimate to be made. Therefore, the Commissioner has concluded that as a reasonable proxy, it will be acceptable for a standard reduction of the market rental third party information to be applied. That reduction takes into account, in the Commissioner’s view, specific reductions in the market rental value of accommodation applicable to boarding schools. The extent of the restrictions, and therefore the amount of the applicable reduction, will depend on the nature of the accommodation provided. For the accommodation provided to employees of boarding schools, it is necessary to establish the applicable arm’s length market rental value. That market rental value can then be reduced by the amount specified in the following table. Accommodation type Reduction Off-site accommodation – not on or adjacent to school grounds, and sufficiently separate from the school grounds as to not be readily associated with the school. No reduction On-site accommodation – separate (within school grounds but with direct off-site access, or immediately adjacent to school grounds). 20% of the market rental value On-site accommodation – separate (within school grounds but without direct off-site access and not physically attached to student accommodation). 35% of the market rental value On-site accommodation – adjoined to student accommodation (separate access - not through student accommodation). 40% of the market rental value On-site accommodation – embedded within the student accommodation (no separate access – only access via student accommodation). 50% of the market rental value 3 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation of applicable reductions and categories Off-site accommodation Off-site accommodation is accommodation that is not provided within the grounds of the boarding school. This includes accommodation that is owned by the school, and might therefore be regarded as school property. It is considered that the market rental value of such accommodation will not differ, to any relevant degree. Example 1 Edward is a teacher at Prince Albert College, a boarding school in a New Zealand city. As part of his employment terms, Edward is provided with a house, free of charge. The house is owned by the College, but is located off school grounds. No reduction is applied to the market rental value of that accommodation. On-site accommodation – separate (with direct off-site access, or without direct off -site access) This category refers to accommodation that is provided within the grounds of the boarding school or immediately adjacent to it, and which is separate from any student accommodation. This category is further separated into two further sub-categories to distinguish between accommodation that has direct off-site access and that which does not. Example 2 Victoria is the Principal of Prince Albert College. She is provided with a three bedroom house, located within the grounds of the school. The house is not attached to the student accommodation and does not have direct off-site access. On the basis of a review of similar rental properties available in the same part of town as the school, the market rental value has been estimated at $500 per week. This amount can be reduced by 35%, giving rise to taxable income of $325 per week. Example 3 Victoria’s colleague, Helena, also has an on-site house, which is separate from the student accommodation. However, Helena’s house is on the boundary of the school grounds and has direct off-site access. The market rental value has also been estimated at $500 per week, but as this can only be reduced by 20%, giving rise to taxable income of $400 per week. Accommodation that is not within the school grounds, but is immediately adjacent to the school grounds, and to all casual observers would be regarded as part of the school grounds, may also be included in this category (rather than as off-site accommodation). On-site accommodation – embedded or adjoined This category refers to accommodation provided to an employee where that accommodation is more directly associated with student accommodation. There are two categories of such accommodation: embedded accommodation which has its only access 4 UNCLASSIFIED through the student accommodation, and adjoined accommodation which is attached to, or immediately adjacent to, student accommodation, but which has access separate from the student accommodation. It is considered that in such cases the privacy of the employee will be reduced, levels of student related noise may be higher, or further behavioural restrictions may apply. Example 4 Alice is also employed by Prince Albert College. Her role is as a matron, responsible for the pastoral care of the students who have accommodation in the Prince Harry Student Dormitory. Consistent with that role, she is provided with a 1 bedroom flat located within the dormitory. Her only means of access is shared with the students, via the dormitory. On the basis of a review of available rental properties, a comparable property is considered to be a 1 bedroom apartment in a nearby block of flats. The market rental value has been estimated at $300 per week. This amount can be reduced by 50%, giving rise to taxable income of $150 per week. Example 5 Carl is also a teacher at Prince Albert College. He also has a 1 bedroom flat similar to Alice’s. While Carl’s flat can also be accessed from within the student dormitory, it has alternative access direct to school grounds. The market rental value for Carl’s flat is also estimated at $300, and after a reduction of 40% his taxable income is $180 per week. Application This statement sets out the reduction in respect of the specified classes of accommodation that the Commissioner considers appropriate and which she will accept. It does not apply to any other taxpayers or classes of employee. The use of the reductions set out in this statement is not mandatory. All taxpayers may take a tax position that differs from the reductions that have been set out. Sufficient records and evidence should be kept so that taxpayers can demonstrate the basis of any such greater reduction. The reductions set out in this statement may be used in respect of PAYE periods commencing on or after 1 April 2015, or for the 2016 and later tax years. This aligns with the application date of Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02. Any employee of a boarding school, who has accommodation that falls within the scope of this statement, may apply the reductions in this statement to reduce their taxable income. If necessary, employees may request the Commissioner amend their assessment. However, the use of the reductions requires that taxable income has been returned based on a calculation of market rental value consistent with CS 16/02, or alternatively the reduced amount must be calculated consistently with the combined effect of this statement and CS 16/02. Boarding schools and employees of boarding schools otherwise need only apply CS 16/02, to calculate the market rental value of accommodation supplied by the school from 1 April 2019, or to PAYE periods falling on or after 1 April 2019, if they have been, 5 UNCLASSIFIED and are, calculating an amount of taxable income in respect of such accommodation. That calculation need not have been consistent with CS 16/02. However, a ny school that has not been calculating the market rental value of such accommodation at all, and has not been accounting for any PAYE on that value, must start immediately. If you are unsure about how this statement applies to you, s pecific guidance should be sought from appropriately qualified tax professionals or valuation experts. If you have any concerns about compliance with the tax obligations discussed in this Commissioner’s Statement, you should discuss the matter with a tax professional or Inland Revenue.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner’s Statement CS 17/01 Determining “value” of shares received by an employee under a share purchase agreement \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter. A Commissioner’s Statement is not a consultative document. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”). Introduction 1. Changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force on 1 April 2017 1 , introduce new reporting rules for employers when shares are issued 2 to employees pursuant to a share purchase agreement (“SPA”). 2. The new reporting rules require employers to report the value of any share benefit received by an employee under an SPA in the relevant employer monthly schedule (“EMS”) for which the share benefit arises. In addition, the new rules also allow employers to elect to withhold PAYE on share benefits received by employees. 3. In order to comply with the new obligations, an employer will need to determine the value of the share benefit received by each employee under an SPA. 4. Having regard to the requirements of the law, valuation uncertainties and employer compliance costs, the Commissioner will accept the methods of valuation set out in this Statement provided that the SPA is conducted on arm’s length commercial terms. 5. While this Statement provides taxpayers with safe harbour valuation methodologies which the Commissioner will accept, this Statement will not apply to any arrangements which are subject to any anti-avoidance provisions in the Act. 6. This Statement also provides guidance in regard to the information the company 3 should retain to support the valuation (in addition to any constitutional and Companies Act 1993 requirements). 7. This guidance relates to the new provisions and any other aspects of the current provisions relating to the valuation of shares acquired by an employee under an SPA. 1 The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016. 2 Note that the phrase “shares are issued” refers to shares (or rights to shares) which are issued or transferred to an employee. 3 Please note that “company” refers to the employing company even if the shares in question are issued or transferred to the employee by another entity. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 8. This Statement is not intended to provide a definitive and comprehensive set of valuation techniques, and so companies may still apply other valuation methodologies that determine the value of the share benefit. If another valuation methodology is used by a company, the valuation must reflect the market value of the shares on the acquisition date. Employment Income 9. Benefits received by an employee under an SPA are employment income. 10. An SPA is defined in section CE 7 of the Act as: ...an agreement to dispose of or issue shares in a company to an employee that is entered into in connection with the employee’s employment or service, whether or not an employment relationship exists when the employee receives a benefit under the agreement. 11. An SPA involves the acquisition of shares in a company by an employee (or another person for the benefit of an employee). These cover a wide range of share schemes and may involve the immediate transfer of shares, the granting of share options or deferred share schemes where shares vest or are transferred at a later date. 12. A taxable share benefit arises when an employee acquires shares under an SPA and the amount paid by the employee for the shares is less than the market value of the shares. 13. Section CE 2 of the Act determines the value of the benefit the employee receives and the allocation of the benefit to a particular year. 14. Section CE 6 of the Act outlines when shares are acquired by an employee (“acquisition date”) under an SPA. 15. Section CE 6(2) provides that, for the purposes of sections CE 2 to CE 4 and CE 7: (a) shares are treated as having been acquired on the date on which the right or option to acquire them is exercised; and (b) if shares or rights are acquired or transferred under an agreement by a trustee for the benefit of an employee to whom section CE 2 applies, the employee is treated as having acquired or transferred the shares or rights. 16. The obligation to report the value of a share benefit and the election to withhold PAYE is limited to share benefits arising under sections CE 2(2) and CE 2(4) of the Act. 17. Section CE 2(2) relates to shares acquired by an employee under an SPA: If an employee acquires shares under a share purchase agreement, the value of the benefit to the employee is the amount by which the value of the shares when they were acquired is more than the amount paid or payable for them. The employee receives the benefit in the income year in which they acquire the shares. 18. Section CE 2(4) relates to shares acquired by an associated person of the employee under an SPA: 3 UNCLASSIFIED If, following 1 or more transactions between associated persons, an associated person acquires the shares under a share purchase agreement, the value of the benefit is the difference between the value of the shares on the date of acquisition by the associated person and the amount paid or payable for them. If the difference is negative, the value is zero. The employee receives the benefit in the income year in which the associated person acquires the shares. Value of Share Benefit 19. In order to determine the value of the share benefit arising for an employee or associated person, an employer will need to determine the following:  The value of shares on acquisition date; and  The amount paid or payable for them. 20. The Act does not define “value”, nor does it prescribe any methods for determining the value of shares acquired under an SPA. 21. The Commissioner considers the term “value” for the purpose of section CE 2 refers to the market value amount at which the shares would be exchanged between two non-associated third parties, on an arm’s length basis. This value is required to be determined even if the shares cannot be sold or there is no market for the shares. 22. For completeness, the definition of “market value” in section YA 1 does not apply to this Statement. Acceptable Valuation Methods 23. Where the company adopts one of the methods outlined in this Statement and retains the necessary documentation to support the valuation, the Commissioner will accept the share value and therefore the benefit ascribed to the employee under section CE 2. 24. Absolute accuracy is not expected in all scenarios (as accuracy depends in part to the data sets available and in some situations on subjective judgement), but it is expected that a reasonable, appropriate process is followed when determining the share value at the time the shares are issued. 25. It is also expected that the valuation method and any input assumptions used to prepare the valuation should be fully documented and retained as the Commissioner may request to examine the documentation. 26. Where a company adopts a method not outlined in this Statement, the company should retain the documentation outlining the reasons for adopting the alternative method as the Commissioner may request to examine the documentation. 27. The methods which the Commissioner will accept will depend on the type of shares issued to the employee under an SPA – shares in a listed company; shares in an unlisted company; or shares in an unlisted start-up company. 28. Outlined below are the methods the Commissioner will accept for the three types of shares. 4 UNCLASSIFIED Listed Shares 29. Where the company issuing shares to an employee has shares listed on a “recognised exchange” the Commissioner will accept the share value reached (applicable to the class of shares, and any rights attaching to them, to which an SPA applies) using one of the following methods:  Option A: Volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) over the last five trading days (including the acquisition date) for the listed share; or  Option B: Closing Price of listed share on the acquisition date; or  Option C: If on the acquisition date the employee disposes of the shares at market value on a recognised exchange, the actual proceeds of sale on that date and, if the proceeds of sale are in a foreign currency, the New Zealand Dollar equivalent by applying the close of trading spot price exchange rate on the sale date. Recognised Exchange 30. A recognised exchange is defined in section YA 1. 31. Outlined below are the relevant factors included in the section YA 1 definition:  A recognised exchange market in New Zealand or anywhere else in the world which has the following features:  the exchange market brings together buyers and sellers of shares or options over shares; and  the exchange market involves the listing of prices, whether by electronic media or other means, at which persons are willing to buy or sell shares or options; and  the exchange market provides a medium for the determination of arm’s length prices likely to prove fair and reasonable, having regard to—  the number of participants in the market or having access to the market; and  the frequency of trading in the market; and  the nature of trading in the market, including how prices are determined and transactions are effected; and  the potential or demonstrated capacity of a person or persons significantly to influence the market; and  any significant barriers to entry to the market; and  any discrimination on the basis of quantity bought and sold unless based on the risks involved, the transaction costs, or economies of scale Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) 32. The VWAP for a share is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every 5 UNCLASSIFIED transaction relating to that share (price multiplied by number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded for the day. Example: VWAP for ABC Limited over a 5 day trading period. Company ABC’s shares are traded on the NZX. ABC Ltd issues shares to its employees on Friday 13 January. Based on information obtained from the NZX, the following ABC shares were traded over the previous five trading days (including the acquisition date) - Monday 9 January to Friday 13 January: Date Number of Shares Volume Weighted Daily Price 9 January 5,000 $2.00 10 January Nil n/a 11 January 4,000 $1.98 12 January 10,000 $2.05 13 January Nil n/a The VWAP is calculated as follows: (5,000 x $2.00) + (4.000 x $1.98) + (10,000 x $2.05) 19,000 = $2.02 The value of the shares issued to ABC’s employees on 13 January is $2.02. Foreign Listed Shares 33. If the shares are not listed in New Zealand but are listed on one or more overseas recognised exchanges, the foreign value determined in accordance with the above options will need to be converted to its New Zealand Dollar equivalent by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. 34. If the shares are listed on more than one recognised exchange (including for an employee not resident in New Zealand or dually resident here, a recognised exchange in the employee’s normal country of residence) the listed price should be based firstly on the recognised exchanges in the employee’s country of residence, or, if that is not applicable, on the average of all the listed prices as converted to New Zealand dollars. Newly Listed Company 35. Shares issued to employees as part of an initial public offering (“IPO”) by a newly listed company should be valued using the published offer price for the IPO. 36. The published offer price is the price included in the retail offer documentation. If the shares are only offered to non-retail investors (e.g. institutional buyers, fund managers) the volume weighted average purchase price of the investors should be utilised pursuant to the relevant offer documentation. 37. If there has been no arm’s length trading of the newly listed shares, the published offer price can be used for shares issued to employees after the date of the IPO for a period not exceeding six months (unless there are material changes to the assumptions used to calculate the offer price). 6 UNCLASSIFIED Information Requirements 38. The company should retain information that can support the share value and method, being able to supply the relevant documentation to the Commissioner on request. The following information should be retained:  If Option A is used, VWAP calculation and supporting listed price data; or  If Option B is used, closing market listed price data; or  If Option C is used, documents evidencing the sale and currency conversion and, where an independent third party undertakes the sale and any subsequent conversion of the proceeds to New Zealand Dollars, that third party’s advice of the New Zealand Dollar equivalent of the transaction will suffice; or  If newly listed shares, published offer price; or  If foreign listed shares, relevant offer or listed price data and the spot FX rate used. Unlisted Shares 39. Where the company issuing shares to an employee has unlisted shares (not including a start-up company which is defined for the purposes of this guidance below) the Commissioner will accept the share value reached (applicable to the class of shares, and any rights attaching to them, to which an SPA applies) using one of the following methods:  Option A: An arm’s length value determined by an independent, suitably qualified valuer which conforms with generally accepted practice 4 ; or  Option B: A valuation (based on the company’s most recent arm’s length commercial transaction in the last six months prior to the acquisition date) involving the issue or sale of the same class of shares to a non-associated third party (for example, a previous capital raising or sale of a parcel of shares) where, if new shares are being issued to employees the valuation is adjusted for dilution of existing shares; or  Option C: A valuation method prepared by an appropriate person in the company using an appropriate method (this option and the requirements to use this option is explained further below). Dilution Effect When Issuing New Shares 40. All methods should take into account the diluting effect of issuing new shares to employees, particularly if using Option B. Example: Company A has previously issued 1m shares to non-associated third parties for $1m. Subsequently, Company A issues 100,000 new shares to employees for no consideration. The value of the shares will be calculated as follows: Total consideration paid for shares issued $1m / total shares issued 1.1m = $0.91 per share. 4 For the purposes of paragraphs 39 and 50, “generally accepted practice” means a valuation prepared under AES-2 (Business Valuation Engagements) issued by CA ANZ or an equivalent valuation engagement standard. 7 UNCLASSIFIED Foreign Company 41. If the unlisted shares are held in a foreign company, the foreign value determined in accordance with the above options will need to be converted to its New Zealand Dollar equivalent by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. Previous Valuation 42. The Commissioner will accept a value based on the most recent valuation prepared by a company using option A, B or C if:  The valuation is for the same class of shares as the shares issued to the employee; and  The valuation was prepared within a period not exceeding six months prior to the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. 43. This Statement will not apply where a company uses a previous valuation and adjustments are made to the original share value resulting in a lower value (discounting). This Statement will also not apply where the previous valuation relates to shares of a different class to the shares issued under the SPA. Information Requirements 44. The company should retain information that can support the share value and method, being able to supply the relevant documentation to the Commissioner on request. The following information should be retained: 45. If Option A is used:  A copy of the independent valuation report received by the company. 46. If Option B is used:  Documentation supporting the value of the shares issued or sold to the non- associated third party (for example, copy of sale and purchase agreement or capital raising documentation); and  Confirmation the shares are of the same class; and  Approval of the valuation in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee at the taxing date. 47. If Option C is used, refer to detailed information requirements below. Option C: Internally Prepared Valuation Requirements 48. If a valuation is prepared internally by the company, the company should retain all the following information:  A copy of the internally prepared valuation; 8 UNCLASSIFIED  That the valuation was prepared by a person employed by the company who has the necessary financial skills, qualification and experience to prepare a valuation;  That the valuation is based on an appropriate method. The Commissioner considers the following methods are appropriate methods:  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF); or  Capitalisation of Earnings;  Contemporaneous documentation supporting all workings, input assumptions and comparable data used to prepare the valuation. This should include the following information (where applicable):  Financial information used to determine earnings (for capitalisation of earnings method) or future cash flows (for DCF method), including (but not limited to):  prior year financial statements;  current operating results;  cash flows and future oriented financial information such as budgets, forecasts and projections;  Documentation supporting any normalising adjustments;  Documentation supporting discount rates;  Documentation supporting capitalisation rates or earnings multiples (including any comparable data used to determine earnings multiples);  Reasoning and support for any discounts or premiums;  That the valuation has been approved in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee on the acquisition date or alternatively, that the valuation has been reviewed and agreed with by an independent, suitably qualified valuer appointed or instructed by the Board of Directors;  A copy of the independent valuation opinion (if applicable). Shares in an Unlisted Start-up Company 49. The following approach can be applied where the company issuing shares to an employee is a start-up company. This generally means a company which:  is in the first stage of its operations; and  initially financed and operated by founding shareholders or investors; and  has not paid any dividends; and 9 UNCLASSIFIED  its expenses tend to exceed their revenues and may be yet to produce a profit; and  tend to have very low net tangible assets; and  may have a high level of expended research and development costs relative to its tangible assets value; and  does not yet have a stable market for its product or service. 50. The Commissioner will accept the following methods for valuing start-up company shares:  Option A: An arm’s length value determined by an independent, suitably qualified valuer which conforms with generally accepted practice; or  Option B: A valuation (based on the company’s most recent arm’s length commercial transaction in the last 12 months prior to the acquisition date) involving a share issue or sale of the same class of shares to a non-associated third party (for example, a previous capital raising or sale of a parcel of shares) where, if new shares are being issued to employees the valuation is adjusted for dilution of existing shares; or  Option C: A valuation method prepared by an appropriate person in the company using an appropriate method (this option and the requirements to use this option is explained further below). Option C will not be available if the company has a previous valuation under Option A or a recent issue/sale of shares under Option B. Venture Capital Funding 51. Given the complexities associated with share valuations for venture capital funding rounds, this Statement will not apply to a company with a current or proposed (i.e. is intended to take place within six months of acquisition date of shares by employee) venture capital funding round 5 . The company should obtain a separate arm’s length valuation for any shares issued to employees under an SPA where venture capital funding is involved. Previous Valuation 52. The Commissioner will accept a value based on the most recent valuation prepared by a company using option A, B or C if:  The valuation is for the same class of shares as the shares issued to the employee; and  The valuation was prepared within a period not exceeding 12 months prior to the acquisition date of the shares by the employee. 53. This Statement will not apply where a company uses a previous valuation and adjustments are made to the original share value resulting in a lower value. This 5 Venture capital funding round means funding by a venture capital fund or firm (including Series A funding rounds). It does not include seed funding from private investors. 10 UNCLASSIFIED Statement will also not apply where the previous valuation relates to shares of a different class to the shares issued under the SPA. Information Requirements 54. The company should retain information that can support the share value and method, being able to supply the relevant documentation to the Commissioner on request. The following information should be retained: 55. If Option A is used:  A copy of the independent valuation report received by the company. 56. If Option B is used:  Documentation supporting the value of the shares issued or sold to the non- associated third party (for example, copy of sale and purchase agreement or capital raising documentation); and  Confirmation that the shares sold to the non-associated third party are of the same class as SPA shares and have the same rights attached to them; and  Approval of the valuation in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee at the taxing date. 57. If Option C is used, refer to detailed information requirements below. Option C: Internally Prepared Valuation Requirements 58. If a valuation is prepared internally by the company, the company should retain all the following information:  A copy of the internally prepared valuation;  That the valuation was prepared by a person employed by the company who has the necessary financial skills, qualification and experience to prepare a valuation;  That the valuation is based on an appropriate method. The Commissioner considers the following methods are appropriate methods:  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF);  Contemporaneous documentation supporting all workings, input assumptions and comparable data used to prepare the valuation. This should include the following information (where applicable):  Financial information used to determine future cash flows including (but not limited to):  prior year financial statements;  current operating results; 11 UNCLASSIFIED  cash flows and future oriented financial information such as budgets, forecasts and projections;  Documentation supporting any normalising adjustments;  Documentation supporting discount rates;  Documentation supporting capitalisation rates;  Reasoning and support for any discounts or premiums;  That the valuation has been approved in writing by one member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer of the company confirming that in their opinion the valuation reflects the market value of the shares issued to the employee on the acquisition date or alternatively, that the valuation has been reviewed and agreed with by an independent, suitably qualified valuer appointed or instructed by the Board of Directors;  A copy of the independent valuation opinion (if applicable). Application 59. This Statement provides general guidance to assist taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations. This approach can be used by taxpayers for, and will be applied by the Commissioner to, shares acquired by employees on or after 1 April 2017. 60. If you have any concerns about your compliance with the tax obligations discussed in this Statement, you should discuss the matter with an appropriately qualified tax professional.

Court of Appeal decides forgiveness of debt can be a charitable gift qualifying a taxpayer for donation tax credit
==================================================================================================================

This was an appeal of the High Court’s decision that Nancy Lois Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a “charitable or other public benefit gift” within s LD 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

[TIB Volume 32 No 3 April 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no3)

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Nancy Lois Roberts \[2019\] NZCA 654

Legal terms

Appeal, Charitable trust, Forgiveness of debt, Donation tax credits, Charitable or public benefit gift, Monetary gift, Statutory interpretation

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007, ss LD 1 and LD 3  
Interpretation Act 1999, s 5  
  

### Summary

This was an appeal of the High Court’s decision that Nancy Lois Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a “charitable or other public benefit gift” within s LD 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) qualifying her for a donation tax credit (_Nancy Lois Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2018\] NZHC 2153).

The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision and found that:

For the purposes of s LD 3(1)(a), the term “monetary” means “of or pertaining to money”;

*   In this context, “monetary” is not limited to include only cash, credit cards, cheques and bank transfers as the Commissioner submitted;
*   In this context, “monetary” also includes a right to receive cash, such as sums standing to the credit of a bank account, or invested in securities; and
*   Mrs Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a monetary gift that was paid.

### Impact

As a result of this judgment, taxpayers who have made gifts of forgiveness of debt can qualify for donation tax credits.

However, on 17 December 2019, the Minister of Revenue issued a media statement proposing an urgent remedial amendment to clarify that debt forgiveness does not qualify for donation tax credits. The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively to 1 April 2008, being the commencement date of the ITA. A savings provision would apply to taxpayers who have already taken a position in reliance on the current legislation and have filed a return or donation tax credit claim before the date of the announcement.

The amendment is contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The Bill has passed the Second Reading Stage on 4 March 2020.

Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the situation in light of the judgment and the proposed amendment.

### Facts

Mrs Roberts and her late husband jointly established the Oasis Charitable Trust (the Trust) in 2007 and registered it with the Charities Commission.

In October 2008, Mr and Mrs Roberts lent $1,708,080.90 to the Trust (the Loan).

In each income year ending 2011 to 2015, Mrs Roberts executed Deeds of Gift which released the Trust from liability to repay specified amounts of the Loan. She then claimed a donation tax credit for each of those five years on the basis that the forgiveness of debt was a charitable gift. The donation tax credits totalled $91,577.24, which corresponded with the $274,732 worth of debt that was forgiven.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) issued a notice on 4 May 2016 requiring repayment of the portion of donation tax credits paid to Mrs Roberts relating to the forgiveness of debt.

The High Court had dismissed P’s judicial review (\[2019\] NZHC 98).

### Issues

The Court of Appeal was required to determine whether Mrs Roberts’ forgiveness of debt owed to her by the Trust, qualified as a “charitable or other public benefit gift” under s LD 3(1) of the ITA.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal, holding that a forgiveness of debt was capable of being a “monetary gift” under s LD 3(1)(a) of the ITA and that Mrs Roberts was entitled to the donation tax credits she received.

The Court applied s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999, which provides that the text of the statutory provision and its purpose will determine the correct interpretation, noting that even if the meaning of the text appears plain in isolation of purpose, it must be cross-checked against the purpose to satisfy the dual requirements of the Interpretation Act.

**The words used in the legislation**

The Court noted the definition of “charitable or other public benefit gift” in s LD 3(1)(a) used the words “a gift of $5 or more that is paid” (for the 2011 to 2013 years), and “a monetary gift of $5 of more that is paid” (for the 2014 to 2015 years).

In interpreting the word “monetary”, the Court relied on dictionary definitions and concluded that for the purposes of s LD 3(1)(a), “monetary” is intended to mean “of or pertaining to money”. The Court accepted that the term “monetary” excludes a gift of land, chattel or services.

In interpreting the word “money”, the Court also relied on dictionary definitions and in particular, the Laws of New Zealand that defines “money” as follows (_Laws of New Zealand_ Money (online ed) at \[3\] (footnotes omitted). The letters were added by the Court of Appeal for ease of reference):

*   \[A\] The term “money” generally includes banknotes as well as coins. However, the amount of money that can be paid in the various small denomination bank notes and in coins is limited. \[B\] The term money is sometimes used to include not only actual cash but also a right to receive cash, such as sums standing to the credit of a bank account, or invested in securities. \[C\] The term may also be used in a popular sense to include all personal or even, exceptionally, all real and personal property. If the term “money” is used in relation to paying money into Court it is to be construed in its ordinary and natural meaning, as including money in foreign currency.

The Court was attracted to the wider definition set out in \[B\] in this context as the definition at \[A\] was too narrow and inapt for the general statutory context. The Court (in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Nancy Lois Roberts_ \[2019\] NZCA 654 (_the Commissioner v Roberts_) at \[38\]) held that:

*   Parliament clearly intended that payment could be achieved by debiting and crediting accounts, thus excluding a meaning of just bank notes or coins. It was common ground that the provision was not confined to money in this narrow sense.

Furthermore, the definition at \[C\] was too wide as it would include gifts of services, personal property, goods, chattels and land and it was clear that Parliament did not intend to include such gifts within s LD 3(1)(a).

Accordingly, the Court rejected the Commissioner’s assertion that the words “monetary” and “money” were limited only to cash payments and the like, and held that the text of s LD 3(1)(a) is not limited to include only cash, credit cards, cheques and bank transfers.

**The legislative history and extrinsic aids**

The Court considered the extensive legislative history of the charitable donations provisions and, in doing so, found it provided no support for the interpretation of “monetary” or “money” contended by the Commissioner.

The Court found that there has been, for a number of years, somewhat of a disconnect between the actual wording of the legislation and the commentary or discussion generated by officials (_the Commissioner v Roberts_ at \[58\]).

References in discussion papers and officials’ reports that differed from the statutory language (such as commentary references to “cash donations” differing from the statutory language “money”) were considered by the Court as “imprecise paraphrase\[ing\]” that did not provide any real assistance in interpreting statutory language, at \[58\] – \[62\]. It noted that comments by officials, unless they form part of the Parliamentary record, are not an especially reliable, or orthodox, form of legislative history.

**Policy arguments**

The Court found that none of the policy arguments the Commissioner advanced to support her interpretation of the statutory language (avoiding significant compliance and administrative costs and the difficulty of valuing non-cash donations which could result in tax avoidance) were compelling or persuasive.

The Court agreed with Mrs Roberts that the concerns advanced under the grounds that excluding forgiveness of debt avoids significant compliance and administrative costs were exaggerated. It considered that if Parliament was concerned about this, these concerns could be addressed by more detailed and specific drafting of the statutory provisions.

The Court was also unpersuaded by suggestions that greater administration costs will arise with the inclusion of forgiveness of debts. While significant investigation and checking may be required for tax rebate claims in relation to gifts of cash, depending on the circumstances of the giving, the Court found that concerns about tax avoidance were overstated by the Commissioner. It noted that there are now robust statutory mechanisms in place to deal with any instances of tax avoidance in this context, at \[64\] – \[66\].

API Kiritaki Customer API
=========================

The customer API provides general information about a customer. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)
 

How the customer API works
--------------------------

When integrated through our gateway services, the customer API provides general information about an identified customer. The customer API accepts a customer ID (IRD number or other customer identifier) and returns high-level information for that customer including:

*   names (preferred name and trading name)
*   physical address
*   postal address
*   primary contact details (contact and phone)
*   secondary contact details (contact and phone)
*   start and stop dates
*   entity classification (for example, individual salary and wages, or non-individual limited partnership).

The customer API can only be used by:

*   the customer the data is associated to
*   a user with delegated access
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer.

The customer API enables the above users to query Inland Revenue’s customer data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

Gateway service capability for the customer API
-----------------------------------------------

The customer API provides the following capabilities through defined API operations and API paths.

| API operation | API path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /customer | Returns the information of an identified customer. |

Customer API business use cases
-------------------------------

The following are examples of how to use the customer API to achieve specific business outcomes. All assume the user is authorised to access the customer's data. The sequence of operations, the order in which they should be called, is indicated in the column of each operation.

| Number | Use case | POST /customer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Retrieve the customer addresses held by Inland Revenue. | 1   |
| 2   | Retrieve the customer contact details held by Inland Revenue. | 1   |
| 3   | Check the last time customer address, name or contact details held by Inland Revenue were updated. | 1   |

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Portfolio Governance Committee 24 May 2018 Customer-centric design and planning \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] - 2 - Purpose and Outcome The Committee would like to understand the approach the Programme is taking to engage customers and understand how they can influence planning and design. The Programme has been asked to develop practical, worked-through examples that show the work they are doing in this space and bring this back to the Committee. This paper shows the frameworks being used to drive customer-centric design of our digital channels and the outside-in approach to managing customer awareness and readiness. Several examples are given of how customer-centric approaches are being used to drive design and planning. The intent isto inform the PGC of current practices and their application and provide a high level view of opportunities for improvements to design practices in R4. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Measurement of Customer Awareness and Readiness Marketing & Comms Activities Customer Treatment Plans Customer Value and Effort Rating Frameworks used for design and planning - 3 - Production Test Develop Customer Design Validation Sprints Customer Testing Define and Design Customer Requirements (co-define, co-refine) Customer Feedback Customer Impact Analysis Customer-centric design Customer awareness and readiness 1 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] - 4 - Examples of application in design and planning Design examples Tax agent operating model: in depth analysis of a representative cross-section of tax agents to understand their different operating models and their patterns of use of IR’s and other systems within their businesses. Tax technical user analysis: in depth analysis of a representative group of tax technical customers on their utilisation patterns for ird.govtas their general patterns for searching and using tax technical information in their roles. ird.govtbeta design: User interviews identified core tasks for childcare customers when using ird.govt. A co-design approach was used to develop optimised online content, navigation and interaction models for the core tasks. (video clip available) myIRprototyping for Working for Families: High-impact customer use cases were identified early in the design process and marked for prototyping and customer design validation. Prototype interfaces were developed using eServicesdesign patterns and validated with customers before being fed into the FAST development process (video clip available) Employer Information customer testing: Testing of changes made to user interface in myIRin order to assess ability to resolve critical tasks such as entering, uploading and updating employer information. (video clip available) Planning examples Customer impact assessment: Customer testing of myIRexposed weaknesses in design associated with management of employer information. Materiality assessments of customer impact across different customer sub-segments informed the re-design and the creation of new treatment plans for impacted customers. Outside-in measurement of customer awareness: measurements of customer awareness and sentiment regarding some R2 changes led to re-direction of account management and ComCom engagement activities. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Continuous improvement of eServicesdesign - 5 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] - 6 - Moving forward Modifying the R4 design process Sequencing of design activities: Currently the design of the customer interaction in IR digital channels occurs after core process design. With this sequencing interaction models and user experience in the channels are often constrained by limitations imposed by core process design which is already locked down and in some cases partially through the development cycle. Integrated channel and process design: Processes are designed with insufficient focus on how they will be supported by the customer facing channels. Ideally the processes should be designed concurrently with the channels’ customer interaction models in order to ensure that the processes are simple and efficient from a customer perspective. Using the familiessegment strategy to guide design: The families segment strategy provides rich context for design and highlights opportunities and pain points that could be addressed through the design process. Ensuring that customer outcomes described in the strategy are used to inform the design process will increase the customer value of the delivered solutions. Thinkingof test from the start: Focusing on testing during design helps strengthen solution design. It prompts the design team to think through a richer set of scenarios of use and make conscious decisions about what is acceptable and unacceptable for customers. This also informs the test approach and allows the testing team to optimise the production of test cases. Continuous improvement Customer-centric practices are already prevalent and embedded across many areas of the programme. Some areas such as the design of eServiceshave mature, repeatable processes which help mitigate risk and ensure positive customer outcomes. The practices will continue to evolve as they become more standardised and efficient based on lessons learned. Work will continue on extending the application of these practices in areas where they can add value.

Data - 4 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer impact assessment summary - 5 - This impact assessment focuses on S4.1.R2 and some S4.1.R2 Other scope items. This release impacts all customers across our customer segments to some degree but it varies depending on the product and type of change. As expected with the final stageof transformation, the impact for customers overall is reducing. Release 2 focuses on moving Child Support into START impacting our Families customers and upgrading myIR to version 12 that impacts all customer segments to varying degrees. Most customers don’t need to do anything specifically to prepare themselves for changes prior to go live with the exception of s ome of our business partners and employers. However, all our customers need to understand the changes so when they interact with Inland Revenue there are no surprises. For example, our child support customers will need to understand what services they can access digitally should they need them in the future. Customers with myIR accounts will need to be aware of myIR upgrade to version12, in particular our intermediaries will need tailored support and messaging to navigate some of the more significant changes. The Customer Impact •In general, a Mediumimpact is expected across many customer groups, with many Lowpockets and one pocket of Highfor intermediaries V12 upgrade (although we expect this to decrease when the design is finalised). •Most changes should be received positively (or at least neutral) and there are no very high impacts identified so far. However,most customers will need support to understand the changes before and after go live. The level of support and timing will be dependent on the nature of the change, business events requiring a call to action and customer changes that may trigger an interaction with Inland Revenue. For many customers the v12 myIR upgrade may trigger an “initial” reaction that things look a bit different and as they notice navigation changes but this should be negated quickly as they acclimatise, much like similar modern web application upgrades. Our customers who use myIR more frequently (generally business customers and intermediaries) may need additional support to understand there is no change to functionality as they have more engrained pathway habits that will need to change. •Other scope items includes further changes for intermediaries, software and payroll developers, some government agencies, some financial institutions, KiwiSaver providers, employers and some individual customers including amendments to interfaces, upgrades to payroll software, upgrades to SPK2IR, credit card payment changes and bankruptcy process improvements. Employers will need to know about when they can include a negative adjustment on Employment Information file, version 2 changes and timeframe. •Some of the changes only impact smaller subgroups of our customer segments and are dependent on specific circumstances (i.e. bankruptcy, arrears payments) . Many of the other scope changes are about improving Inland Revenues administration processes, therefore customers will not necessarily have visibility of the changes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer impact assessment summary - 6 - The more highly impacted customer segments are: Individuals – Families/High Wealth Individuals – child support customers are impacted and require awareness of the changes including better visibility of child support obligations and payments in myIR (including v12 changes) and improved self-management services (i.e. registrations, cancellations administrative reviews etc), the introduction of compulsory employer deductions for paying parents, changes to penalty application and statement of account re-design, ratification of the Hague Convention, streamlined processing of employer deductions and payments and other legislative changes. All customers regardless of their role will be impacted in some way by child support changes, but many existing customers will not need to do anything differently prior to or after go live. They will need reassurance and support to understand the changes so they are aware of and can navigate the changes as and when their circumstances require them. Intermediaries– require awareness of all changes to support their customers. The v12 myIR upgrade impacts intermediaries, in particular tax agents significantly and they will need to be aware of and understand what the changes are – fresh look and feel, changes to navigation (new simplified ‘hub and spoke’ model), how calls to action are presented, how summary views and balances are displayed all without loss of functionality. A new Intermediary centre will replace access to the functions/links currently within the Tax Preparer tab. Here they can access the new Action Centre; a centralised view of alerts for all clients they are subscribed to. These will be sorted by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered. The Tax Agent workspace will be retired and instead access to clients will be through a client s earch screen or through the use of the favourites functionality. This is a further change that intermediaries will need understand andadjust to. Business/Employers – employers are impacted by child support compulsory deductions, version 2 payday filing upgrade and negative PAYE adjustments. They need to understand when compulsory employer deductions start, how they will be notified and if they need to adjust their business processes. Many businesses/employers are frequent myIR users and they will be impacted bythe v12 upgrade although this is expected to reduce quickly as customers become used to the new features. Significant Enterprises with complex needs with multiple profiles and accounts will be impacted by the v12 upgrade. Customers will see improvements, have quick access to alerts/balances, have greater visibility of multiple customers and find it easier to access information. Customers wil l need support to understand the changes with minimum disruption to their business and interactions with Inland Revenue. Business Partners – some government agencies and overseas based agencies are impacted by child support changes and other scope items.A new service portal for \[Information redacted\] will enable them to apply for child support and view overpayments. The multi payment option will be available in their myIR account.\[Information redacted\] countries will be impacted by international child support changes but there will be no major changes to existing channels and processes to receive and send files. Some financial institutions are impacted by improvements to interfaces but the impact is estimated to be low. Payroll developers must ensure t heir employment information software is upgraded to version 2, so that employers can continue to file via GWS and file upload. Our business partners will need support to navigate these changes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] IN CONFIDENCE Customer Change \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Detailed customer heatmap The heat-map below provides a high level view of the customer impacts based on known START Delivery Stage 4 - Release 2 scope and design as at31 March 2021.

This impacts Individuals – Families/High Wealth Individuals customers who receive and pay child support by digitising the application process, providing greater visibility of their information, earlier payments (in most cases) and legislation changes. Some employersmay also be impacted by making it mandatory to deduct payments from employees who are new or returning liable parents. The level of change for receiving carers and liable parents isLOW – MEDIUM. Customers will be able to apply for child support in myIRwith some information pre-populated for them. Customers will have greater visibility of their account and payment information, along with the ability to self-service more by requesting actions like applying for an administrative review and objections (currently paper based). Legislation changessuch as penalty grace periods and a time bar to limit reassessments and administrative reviews should be viewed favourably. Aligning the definition of income with Working for Families may result in some adjustments to payments paid and received, however, customers won’t experience this until the assessments are calculated late February 2022. Improved payment processingwill also see most receiving carers get payments as soon as possible after the liable parents due date. Automating compulsory employer deductions reduces the time available for a liable parent to discuss privacy concerns with Inland Revenue prior to employer deduction notices being issued to the employer. The level of change for employers is estimated to be LOW – MEDIUM with compulsory employer deductions for all new or returning liable parents (currently only applies to parents in debt) which may increase the number of employees an employer currently deducts for. Automatic notifications to deduct will be included into one electronic notice instead of multiple paper only notices and havea shorter lead- in time for starting deductions. Some employers may perceive this as an additional compliance cost, as they will be required to adjust business processes. The level of change for some Business Partners such as government agencies is estimated to be LOW – MEDIUM. \[Information redacted\] will apply for child support, andview overpayments via a new self service portal, and will have access to a new multi payment option account in myIR; they will need support as they adjust to these. The child support file method of transfer between IRan d \[Information redacted\] changes from iron key to SFTP, and a new keypoint to capture the SWN number will be added on their Employment Information. Advocacy groups will need to be aware of the legislation changes and new services available in myIR. Customer Support Existing and new customers will need an awareness of the changes. Most existing child support customers won’t need to do anything differently at go live but will need to know about myIR changes (including v12), new self service options and payment changesfo r receiving carers. Returning liable parents and employers will need to know prior to go live about compulsory employer deductions. Our business partners will need support to change/amend business processes and adapt to using new digital services. New customers will need a myIR account, making it easier to apply and manage their entitlements/obligations. Our communications will need to include this message before, at and after go live. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support – legislation changes - 12- The Child Support Amendment Bill was passed and received royal assent on 24 March 2021. The Bill contains a range of measures to reduce the scheme’s complexity, improve fairness and increase compliance. The key changes that will be part of Release 2 are: Newly liable parents, or liable parents that are returning to the child support scheme will: Receive a 60 day grace period from penalties to assist in the transition into the scheme Have compulsory employer deductions made from their salary/wages, with some exceptions Be able to have their estimation backdated, if the estimation is received within 28 days of their assessment starting All liable parents will be able to apply for a temporary exemption if they are: suffering from a long term injury or illness in an overseas prison or hospital For the initial late payment penalty: The $5 minimum for the first stage will be repealed; it will always be the standard 2% The second stage will be moved out from 7 days to 28 days after the due date A time bar of 4 years will apply to reassessments and administrative reviews. There will be a change to the definition of income that will include interest/dividend income for salary/wage customers and excl ude losses carried forward. This aligns to the income definition for Working for Families. A new election period for estimations will benefit customers who are re-estimating their income throughout the year. The square up process will reflect income during the estimation periods. Children will not be considered financially independent for child support purposes unless they are at least 16 years of age. Child support for a qualifying child that is still in school will cease on the 31 st of December the year they turn 18. Inland Revenue will have the discretion to adjust a child expenditure calculation when the calculation leads to a perverse outcome. Customers will have 60 days to provide court orders of parentage for the back dating of assessments. Customers will also have 28 days from receiving an assessment to advise Inland Revenue of their existing living circumstances. Commissioner discretion will be introduced to offset customers arrears owing to each other instead of through the administrative review process. The mixed age expenditure table and urgent maintenance order provisions will be repealed from the Child Support Act. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer and product snapshot: child support - 13- 175K QUALIFYING CHILDREN 1.99B TOTAL CHILD SUPPORT DEBT BALANCE 367K PHONE CALLS RECEIVED WITHIN ONE YEAR 319K TOTAL CUSTOMERS – COMPRISED OF 156,000 LIABLE PARENTS AND 163,000 RECEIVING CARERS 517M TOTAL LIABLE PARENT ASSESSMENT DEBT BALANCE 1.4B TOTAL PENATLY BALANCE 9.5K CASES REFERRED TO AUSTRALIA FOR COLLECTION 34K APPLICATIONS RECEIVED WITHIN ONE YEAR 6K CASES BEING COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF AUSTRALIA \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer and product snapshot: child support - 14- Receiving Carer External Agencies Liable Parent Receiving carers are a parent or third party carer of a qualifying child/children that is normally entitled to receive child support from a liable parent.

KEY CHANGES The Child Support Amendment Act passed March 2021 has a focus on improving the administration of the scheme including simplified penalty rules, compulsory employer deductions and more certainty for parents via a 4 year time bar for reassessments and administrative reviews. It will be easier for customers to manage their child support as more self-service options available, including registrations, cancellations, administrative review applications and objections. Over time, this will reduce the amount of paper that IR receives from customers and encourage customers to use digital channels. Information sharing and communication with our external agencies will be improved through the use of portals and secure file transfer. The processing of payments and employer deductions will be streamlined and ensure receiving carers get their child support as soon as possible following a due date Most processes will be managed using a mix of cases and work items providing standardised patterns across a range of work types. START will automate processes reducing the amount of manual handling required. Up front validations and pre- population of information will improve data quality and make it easier for people to complete day to day tasks. START will introduce the use of transaction ledgers and a new CSC account to manage financial transactions as money moves from a liable parent through to one or more receiving carers. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes for receiving carers - 15- Digital Services Legislation Changes Timing of Payments Fluctuating High Stability L Will be more likely to get payments when they are newly entitled as a result of compulsory employer deductions Sees that the income used for their assessment better reflects their circumstances Will seamlessly receive their payments as soon as possible after the due dates Will no longer need to request an urgent refund to receive their entitlement earlier Meeting customer expectations for digital service offerings Mobile friendly digital services makes it easier for customers to access their child support information M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes for liable parents - 16- Legislation Changes Mostly Digital Deduction Methods Salary and WagesSelf employed L Mobile friendly digital options may make managing their child support and interacting with IR easier Meeting their expectations with similar level of functionality as their business accounts May appreciated the option of setting up a schedule of payments based on their chosen frequency No choice of payment channel; will be automatically set up for employer deductions May perceive they are disadvantaged if their losses carried forward will not reduce child support income Sees the income used for their assessment better reflects their circumstances M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes for NZ agencies - 17- Digital Services Information Sharing New Payment Options L Will be able to access information as and when required using the portal; reducing time spent contacting IR for adhoc information \[Information redacted\] will shift from IronKey to SFTP; will reduce manual effort for them Will continue using their current methods to make payments; no direct impact Will have a bulk payment channel (MPO account) in addition to standard payment options; will be able to choose the right payment option for them Existing channels used for information sharing; no channel changes. \[Information redacted\] will have a new field on their EI for the SWN; will need to adapt to include this Will have their own portal; they will need to adapt to using a new tool and know how to access support M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes overseas agencies - 18- Digital Services Information Sharing New Payment Options L The Hague agreement will allow us to share information with other Hague countries to support the collection of NZ and international child support Will have new myIR options along with existing preferred services; design meets needs of agency Will use new MPO account for their bulk payment: will be minimal impact as they already pay in bulk, this is simply a new channel Hague agencies will have digital payment options; each agency can determine what works best for them No change to what information is able to be shared; will be of no real impact At minimum, all will have myIR services available; onboarding processes to determine what options will suit each agency M \[Information redacted\] \[Information redacted\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – receiving carers - 19- Key ChangesKey Impacts Payments to receiving carers will be issued as soon as possible after the liable parents payment due date. The payment will be issued on the 23 rd at the earliest, instead of being held until the 7 th of the following month. There will be more incentive to shift to authenticated digital services due to more digital services being offered, the removal of some paper forms (including the main parent application form), and V12 design ensuring myIR is mobile friendly. Customers when using myIR will be prompted to provide all required information up front through the use of validations and pre- population of information already held where appropriate. Ratification of the \[Information redacted\] will allow receiving carers to apply against liable parents living in other member countries and request IR approach these countries to collect on their behalf. Newlegislation makes employer deductions compulsory for newly liable or returning liable parents which provides more consistency earlier. Newlegislation introduces a time bar that will restrict reassessments and administrative reviews to a four year period, exceptions will apply. Newlegislation aligns the definition of income with Working for Families Tax Credits. Income for child support will now include interest / dividends and exclude losses bought forward. Receiving carers will be paid their entitlement from the 23 rd of the month (as long as it has been paid by the liable parent) and will no longer have to request an urgent refund of the entitlement to receive it earlier than the 7 th of the following month. More digital services will give customers a new channel for common tasks and provide a clearer view of their account enabling them to take more of a self service approach. The upgrade to V12 has enhanced the usability of myIR for customers on mobile devices. Customers unable to shift to digital channels to lodge applications will continue to have our phone channel available. New validations will decrease the need for multiple points of contact with customers during registration, administrative reviews and other requests, to clarify or request additional information. The Hague Convention gives customers access to a new avenue to enable easier collection of child support and maintenance entitlements from parties in Hague countries. Compulsory deductions helps liable parents meet their obligations from the start of their liability; this will result in receiving carers being more likely to receive their entitlement earlier. The four year time bar will provide receiving carers with more certainty around their entitlement. They will need to understand what exceptions apply if their circumstances necessitate it. Receiving carers may see a change in their entitlement due to the change in income definition. This will not take effect until the 2023 child support year. Some customers may perceive this as unfair or fair depending on the impact to their entitlement. Impacted Customer Segments: Families, High Wealth Individuals, Nominated Persons, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – receiving carers - 20- Key ChangesKey Impacts Newlegislation aligns the minimum age a child can be deemed financially independent and the qualifying age criteria with Working for Families Tax Credits. Newlegislation repeals the mixed aged expenditure table to allow a fairer reflection of costs based on the actual ages of the children in each household. Newlegislation allows the Commissioner to initiate debt offsetting on behalf of the customer when there is debt owing between the parents. This removes the requirement for the customer to take part in an administrative review process to achieve the same outcome. Receiving carers will be monitored to identify and notify customers that may benefit from estimating their income to more accurately reflect their circumstances. Aligning the qualifying child criteria with Working for Families should make it less confusing for customers as there will be one clear set of criteria for both products. Receiving carers will consider this a fairer calculation of their child support as their entitlement will reflect the costs associated with each child based on their actual age. Receiving carers will no longer have to use the complex administrative review process to have their debt offset against the other parents, saving them considerable time and effort. They may view this positively as it removes a perceived unnecessary step and simplifies the overall process. Receiving carers may appreciate Inland Revenue notifying them of a potential avenue available to them when their circumstances appear to have changed. This may prompt receiving carers to estimate their income to more accurately reflect their circumstances.

These deductions will be automatically set up based on their employment situation, with some exceptions. Liable parents who are in debt and receiving salary / wages, will no longer be contacted and instead arrears plans will be automatically set up with their employer, exceptions will apply. Newlegislation introduces a 60 day grace period from penalties for newly liable or returning liable parents. Liable parents who do not have employer deductions, will have the option to request a START generated schedule of recurring payments to meet their monthly obligation based on their chosen payment frequency. Newlegislation introduces a time bar that will limit reassessments and administrative reviews to a four year period, exceptions will apply, e.g. in the case of a court order. Newlegislation aligns the definition of income with Working for Families Tax Credits. Income for child support will now include interest / dividends and exclude losses bought forward. Along with a more mobile friendly design due to version 12, there will also be more digital services offered for liable parents to use. In addition there will be a reduction in paper forms available. Liable parents will no longer have to request Inland Revenue set up deductions from their employer as it will happen automatically. This may mean some liable parents will not have the opportunity to advise of any privacy concerns prior to the deduction being set up. Some liable parents may appreciate that Inland Revenue is making it easy for them to meet their obligations, however some may view it as a sign of mistrust. Some liable parents may perceive it as unfair for Inland Revenue to go straight to their employer rather than discussing options with them first. Newly liable or returning liable parents may perceive the introduction of a grace period as a more compassionate approach to helping them to adapt to meeting their new obligations. Liable parents who choose the schedule option will have the certainty of a clear payment schedule to adhere to that suits their payment frequency. This will also remove frustration as they will no longer be incorrectly penalised when their payments didn’t easily align to the monthly due date. A time bar will provide liable parents with more certainty that their obligations will not change unless particular exception criteria apply. Liable parents may see a change in their entitlement due to the change in income definition. This will not take effect until the 2023 child support year. Some customers may perceive this as unfair or fair depending on the impact to their entitlement. Liable parents will appreciate that they can easily use myIR on any device and have access to new functionality enabling them to take more of a self service approach. Some may be frustrated by the removal of some paper forms.

The second stage of the initial penalty will also change from 7 days after the due date to 28 days. Newlegislation expands exemption criteria in relation to paying child support to include those in overseas hospitals and prisons. A new temporary ground has also been introduced for liable parents unable to work due to illness or injury. Liable parents based in Australia will only be asked for income details if \[Information redacted\] is unable to provide them. Liable parents who have a shortfall in their payment obligation will receive a text or web message to advise them of the shortfall and request them to make a manual payment. Liable parents will be proactively notified or contacted to advise they may have deductions that are not appropriate for their situation or that they may benefit from estimating their income. Liable parents living in New Zealand or \[Information redacted\] member countries may perceive the ability for Inland Revenue or the \[Information redacted\] country authority to take enforcement action negatively. Customers may not understand which country to contact in relation to the collection actions. Removing the $5 minimum for the first stage of the initial penalty will have a positive impact for our low income liable parents who will no longer be over penalised. Moving the second stage of the initial penalty will give all liable parents more opportunity to pay before being further penalised. Liable parents may perceive the changes to the exemption criteria positively as it could allow their situation to be taken into account. Less contact from Inland Revenue may mean liable parents in Australia perceive that \[Information redacted\] and Inland Revenue are working more collaboratively. Liable parents may appreciate being notified of an under deduction faster, giving them more of an opportunity to make up the shortfall before the due date. Liable parents may appreciate Inland Revenue notifying them of an option to have their deductions or assessment more accurately reflect their circumstances. Impacted Customer Segments: Families, High Wealth Individuals, Nominated Persons, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – employers - 23- Key ChangesKey Impacts New legislation requiring compulsory employer deductions may increase the number of employees that an employer has to deduct child support for. There may be some employers that previously have not had any employees requiring deductions and will now be required to. Employer deduction notices will be sent electronically if the employer has an active myIR account, paper will be an exception. Employer deduction notices can be redirected to tax agents rather than always going to the employer first. This will follow standard mail redirection patterns meaning they will not be redirected to payroll intermediaries, only to tax agents. Employer deduction notices will be consolidated into one notice that includes all actions that need to be taken e.g. start or stop deductions, instead of these being in separate notices. Employer deductions notices currently request that deductions start 21 days from the issue date, this will be decreased to 14 days. Employers will be monitored earlier to identify those that continually under or over deduct, or do not deduct for 3 paydays in a row, so that contact can be made with them to find out why they are incorrectly deducting. Employers will not be contacted for under-deductions that do not reach the 3 paydays criteria, however the liable parent will be contacted directly so they have the opportunity to address the under-deduction with the employer themselves. Employers may perceive an increase in compliance costs if their processes are affected by a change in volume of deductions or through being required to make deductions for the first time.Some employers may need education to understand why they are required to deduct. Employers will be able to view all correspondence relating to their payroll in myIR instead of receiving employer deduction notices separately via post, this may assist them with their processes as all of their information is in one place. Employers may appreciate employer deduction notices being redirected automatically to their tax agent as they will no longer have to forward this information. Employers may perceive Inland Revenue to be more efficient as they will receive fewer individual notices, with multiple requests being contained in the same letter. They may find it takes less time to action these requests from Inland Revenue. Some employers may need to adapt their internal processes to ensure they are able to commence deductions within 14 days of receiving a notice from Inland Revenue. Employers who do not meet their obligations in relation to deductions will receive more proactive contact from Inland Revenue. Employers need to be aware that liable parents may approach them after receiving a text message from Inland Revenue in relation to an under deduction.

Although there may be some initial frustration as their people adjust, over time they may appreciate the convenience a self-service channel gives them. \[Information redacted\] will need to understand how the Multi Payment Option works, including what they need to supply on a schedule and how to submit it in myIR. Adopting the SFTP method to transfer benefit information to IR will mean a person from \[Information redacted\] no longer has to physically deliver a USB. This simpler process may be less resource intensive. The new field for the SWN will allow Inland Revenue to include the SWN in employer deduction notices sent to \[Information redacted\]. This will allow \[Information redacted\] to easily match their customers to our notices, which may reduce their time spent on processing notices. \[Information redacted\] will use the interface to manage both child support and student loan PAX requests, removing the need for separate processes for the two products. Advocacy groups that assist customers in understanding their obligations and entitlements will need to be aware of changes that are being made in order to support their clients. Our partner agencies will continue to communicate with Inland Revenue via their existing channels, they will not need to make any changes to their processes.

This allows them to make a single bulk payment to Inland Revenue for all the amounts collected from liable parents. New Zealand ratifying the Hague Convention will enable other member countries to request Inland Revenue to collect on their behalf. They can also be requested to collect on behalf of Inland Revenue. Refund redirects will be used when a payment for a receiving carer is required to be issued to \[Information redacted\]. \[Information redacted\] will be sent annual bulk requests for income for liable parents located in Australia prior to these customers being contacted by Inland Revenue. The sending and receiving of files to and from \[Information redacted\] will continue to be done manually via the secure web portal hosted by \[Information redacted\]. Newlegislation expands exemption criteria to include those in overseas hospitals and prisons. This enables liable parents located in Australia who meet the criteria to be granted an exemption. \[Information redacted\] will need to understand how the Multi Payment Option works, including what they need to supply on a schedule and how to submit it in myIR. Hague countries may initially need education on payment options and how to register for a Multi Payment Option account. They will need to have a myIR account and understand how this is used to submit their payment schedule and the correct way to code payments. There may be some additional assistance needed initially as they become familiar with this process for making bulk payments. New Zealand and Hague countries will have access to a new avenue to enable easier collection of child support and maintenance entitlements from liable parents in their respective countries. Using refund redirects will eliminate the possibility of payments being made to the receiving carer when they should have been made to \[Information redacted\], this will save them the administrative work that results from this incorrect payment being made. There will be a small increase in the number of liable parents included in the request for income that \[Information redacted\] will receive from Inland Revenue. \[Information redacted\] will continue to receive and send files using their existing channels, they will not need to make any updates to their existing processes. \[Information redacted\] will need to be aware of the changes to exemption criteria in order to direct liable parents living in Australia to Inland Revenue.

This impacts all customers who use myIR to varying degrees and is dependent on frequency of use, current confidence levels when interacting with myIR, and if they have complex/specialised needs. At a high level the overall customer experience will improve but as with any application/software upgrade a period of adjustmentmay be required as customers familiarise themselves with the changes. Frequent and complex users will need more support, however this is expected to decrease over time due to the intuitiveness of V12. This upgrade presentsanopportunity tore-engagecustomers with myIR functionality,focusing ontheir needsand benefitsasopposedto product specifications. The level of change across all customer groups ranges from LOW – MEDIUM with the exception of intermediaries, where level of change is assessed asMEDIUM -HIGH. This is expected to decrease over time as customers become familiar with the changes. All myIR customerswill see changes that will improve their customer experience, including: Intermediaries are frequent users of myIR with diverse needs and may be impacted differently. We expect the change impact to decrease once design is finalised taking into account customer feedback.A new Intermediary centre will replace access to the functions/links currently within the Tax Preparer tab. Here they can access the new Action Centre; a centralised view of alertsfor all clients they are subscribed to. These will be sorted by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered. The Tax Agent workspace will be retired and instead access to clients will be through a client search screen or through the use of the favourites functi onality. The design team iscurrently considering possible improvements to this function based on customer feedback. The level of change for businesses and employers(frequent and complex myIR users) is expected to be LOW – MEDIUM. The impact is expected to reduce quickly as customers become used to the new features. Customers will see improvements, have quick access to alerts/balances. Customers with complex needs such as significant enterprises will have greater visibility of multipl e customers and find it easier to access information.

Type of myIR user KEY CHANGES - myIR Version 12 myIR is a lighter, modern look and feel, and simplifies the information that is presented, making it easier for customers to focus on relevant and important information. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it a seamless experience to use myIR across different devices. A new simplified ‘hub and spoke’ navigation model will allow customers to easily access most of the actions they need to perform, either from their home page or within the “I want to...” menus at the customer or account level. The current account (product) tiles will become account panels, and customers will be able to scroll down through these. These will allow IR to provide the customer with upfront information about the account such as any due now balances or relevant quick links to actions such as “make a payment” or “file a return”. A new Intermediary Centre will provide access to intermediary functions/links within myIR, replacing the current Tax Preparer tab. The Tax Agent Workspace will be retired, and access to clients will be through the client search screen, from the Action Centre, or through use of the new favourites functionality. The new Action Centre will give customers access to all their alerts, rather than some only being visible at the account or period levels. Alerts will be separated by customer, account, and due date; ensuring logons with access to multiple customers will be able to identify easily which alerts relate to which customer. Customers will be able to see when an alert is due, what action is required and easily navigate to this from the alert. They will also have the ability to dismiss alerts. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR - key changes for individuals - 30- Change in look & feel Adaptive by device Easy view of calls to action Annual IndividualSocial Policy May feel that myIR is behaving as expected when accessed on mobile devices Will appreciate the more user friendly view across all devices May appreciate a centralised view of alerts Clear descriptions and easy linking will help them complete required actions May perceive this to be an improvement on how information is presented Information may feel more accessible but may not notice the extent of the change L-M L-M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR - key changes for businesses - 31- Access / Sign On Adaptive by device Flattened navigation Complex BusinessFrequent Business May be of minimal impact unless working across desktop and laptop/tablet May find the consistent experience makes it easier to complete transactions in myIR at any time May welcome being able to access information/actions with less clicks Key information and regular actions displayed upfront; may require a break from pathway habits Will be easier to distinguish between personal and business accounts Will be easier to distinguish between various customers, profiles and accounts, and can select favourites Calls to action Centralised view and clearly separated by customer, account, and due date.

Information relating to alerts, and the “I want to...” links have been removed from the top of screens, reducing clutter and freeing up space for the new account panels. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen, without a loss of functionality, making it a seamless experience for customers to use myIR across different devices. Navigation within myIR for customers will be simplified and flattened with the new ‘hub and spoke’ model instead of the current ‘hierarchical’ one. The customer’s myIR summary page will be the central “hub” with links that enable them to explore different sections “spokes” for further detail as required. Customerswill no longer click into an account first to see their information, and instead will be able to access most actions/information with only one click from the summary screen. The new account panels that are replacing the account tiles, will now provide a more detailed snapshot view of the product with the number of alerts, any relevant total or due now balances, along with links and other information specific to that account such as detail of their next Working for Families payment, or the result of their end of year income tax assessment. A new ‘alerts’ tab provides customers with a centralised view of all actions that are required for their logon, with descriptions and quick links to perform these. On the summary screen they will also be able to quickly see how many alerts relate to each account. Some social policy customers may find the new look less cluttered and easier on the eye, while others may be annoyed that things have changed making it harder for them to find what they are looking for. Annual customers who have not logged in to myIR in a while may not realise the extent of the changes. Customers who use mobile technology predominantly will appreciate that they will have a more user friendly view. Customers who have not logged in to myIR for a period of time may be pleasantly surprised that myIR now behaves the way they would expect it to when accessed on a tablet or mobile. Regular users of myIR may find the new navigation initially frustrating as they re-learn where information now lives. Others may feel this removes some of the frustration they had trying to find information in the old version. It is expected that once they are familiar they will find it easier to navigate the system, with less clicks as more information will be accessible from the summary screen. Once customers are familiar with the new account panels they will appreciate the ability to see key information, balances, and links upfront. This may reduce the time it takes for them to find what they are looking for as well as make it easier for them to navigate to commonly used tasks for that account. Customers may find the new alerts tab provides a simpler and faster way of seeing any actions they need to take as well being able to quickly access that action. This may be of more benefit to those customers whose interaction with myIR is generally in response to an action required of them. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR impacts – frequent business - 34- Impacted Customer Segments: Micro, Not for Profit, Small-Medium Enterprises, Nominated persons Impact Rating: Low - Medium Key ChangesKey Impacts Version 12 provides a cleaner view of myIR, by simplifying what information is visible/accessible within screens. Information relating to alerts, and the “I want to...” links have been removed from the top of screens, reducing clutter and freeing up space for the new account panels. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen, including mobiles, without a loss of functionality. The flatter navigation is simpler and more information will be pulled up to the summary screen. Customers will no longer click into an account first to see their information, and instead most actions will require only one click from the summary screen to access. The new account panels, replacing the account tiles on the summary page, will now provide more of a snapshot view of the product. Instead of clicking into the account, the panel will show the number of alerts, any relevant key information including total/due now balances, and links to commonly accessed actions/information. Customers will continue to see the number of alerts per customer/account, but the new Alerts tab will provide a centralised view of all alerts for the customer. Each alert will now also show a description of the action required, a quick link to take this action, and the due date. Alerts will be sorted by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered and dismissed. Dismissed alerts will still be accessible within the Action Centre and can be undismissed if required. Micro business customers may find the new look less cluttered and easier on the eye, while others may be annoyed that things have changed making it harder for them to find what they are looking for. Customers will appreciate myIR being device responsive, and this may improve the experience they have of accessing myIR when and where suits them. Customers may find the change in navigation style initially frustrating as they will have formed pathway habits in myIR through frequent use, and will need to break these to learn new ones. It is expected that once they are familiar they will find it easier to navigate the system, with less clicks, as more information and links will be accessible from the customer level. Most customers will appreciate the ability to see account relevant information, balances, and links including the “I want to...” menu, within the new account panels as this will make it easier for them to navigate to commonly used tasks for that account. The increased visibility of account balances may cause some concern from customers if they are unsure what these relate to and/or are not expecting to see amounts due. The new Action Centre and alerts panels will particularly suit those customers who are generally reactive to requests for action from Inland Revenue, such as “file a return”. Customers will value the categorisation by due date as this will enable them to quickly assess what actions they should prioritise, and then dismiss those already dealt with or considered irrelevant. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR impacts – complex - 35- Impacted Customer Segments: Small – Medium Enterprises with complex business structures, Significant Enterprises Impact Rating: Low - Medium Key ChangesKey Impacts Version 12 provides a cleaner view of myIR, by simplifying what information is visible/accessible within screens as we as a new “hub and spoke” navigational pattern with more information pulled up to the summary screen.

A list of all customers they can access will be visible and they will be able to filter these using the name or IRD Number of the customer. They will also be able to select up to 50 customers or accounts as “favourites” that will show up under a new favourites tab on the landing page for easy access to those they work in regularly. Account panels, and sub-panels, will replace the v11 account tiles. Customers will no longer click into an account, and instead the panels will provide them with a snapshot view of information relevant to the account along with links to commonly accessed actions/information. The new Action Centre will provide a centralised view of all alerts associated to the customers and accounts that the logon has access to. These will be organised by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered. The alert panels in the action centre will have a description of the action required, along with a quick access link to complete this action. Customers may find the change in navigation style initially frustrating as they will have formed pathway habits in myIR through frequent use, and will need to break these to learn new ones. It is expected that once they are familiar they will find it easier to navigate the system, with less clicks, as more information and links will be accessible from the customer level. This may make it easier for customers to ensure they have accessed the customer account they intend to work in, but those customers who could previously “fast path” to a specific account for a customer may be frustrated at this extra step. Those customers who regularly access a subset of their customers/accounts may appreciate being able to select favourites as a way to reduce the time it takes to find and access these. Some customers will appreciate having key information and links being available on the summary screen. Others may be concerned at the amount or type of information that, though previously accessible, is now more visible to those in their organisation with myIR access. As the Action Centre can be accessed from the landing page as well as the customer summary screens, this will provide these customers with another avenue to quickly access a customer or account where action is required. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR impacts – intermediaries - 36- Impacted Customer Segments: Tax Agent, Bookkeeper, Payroll Intermediary, Tax Pool Intermediary Impact Rating: Medium - High Key ChangesKey Impacts A new Intermediary Centre will replace access to the functions/links that currently sit in the v11 tax preparer tab, excluding the “manage workspace” link as the Tax Agent Workspace is being retired. Access to the Intermediary Centre is via a link on the landing page, and will be available to all logons of a registered tax intermediary. When an Intermediary logs in to myIR they will be presented with a client search screen. This will allow them to find clients by IRD number or customer identifier. Once the intermediary searches, their access will be evaluated, and if they are linked to the customer they will be granted access and will be navigated to the customer's account. Intermediaries will be able to select up to 50 clients and accounts to be included in a “favourites” tab on their landing page, for quick access to those they work on regularly. Intermediaries will be able to access the new Action Centre from the Intermediary Centre and this will provide them with a centralised view of alerts for all clients of the agency that the web logon has subscribed to, up to a maximum limit. The alerts will be organised by customer, account, and due date, and will be able to be filtered. Alerts for non-subscribed clients will still be accessible from the client’s account. There are a number of changes to the look/feel of myIR including the navigation within myIR and the way information is presented. The account tiles in v11 are being replaced by account panels, and instead of clicking in to these, they will provide an upfront view of key information along with quick links to commonly accessed actions/information. Intermediaries will need to understand what the new Intermediary centre provides them in comparison to the functionality that was designed for them in v11. Support will be required to assist them in learning new pathways in myIR, and understanding any benefits of the new system, as well as how IR is responding to any perceived degradation in functionality. Intermediaries may be frustrated that they require their client’s IRD number or customer identifier to be able to use the ‘search’ screen, as they may store this in a separate system. Work is underway to consider possible improvements to this function. Although favourites will not be an exact replacement for the workspace functionality in v11, it will provide Intermediaries with an alternative to the client search function for easily viewing their priority clients. Some intermediaries may need to look at changes to their current business processes to adapt to the change. Intermediaries will appreciate that the new Action Centre will ensure they areable to identify easily which alerts relate to which customer and when these are due. Further education around myIR functionality will support those Intermediaries who may feel that the maximum limit on client subscriptions will remove their ability to quickly identify actions required across their client list. Some Intermediaries may welcome the changes and find they present a simplified view of a customer’s account, and improves their ability to navigate around myIR with fewer clicks. Others may find it initially difficult to adjust, where they have become familiar with the current layout and need to learn new pathways. There may also be some concern from Intermediaries at the level of information now more visible to their clients as they may receive increased contact from these clients seeking reassurance. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer Impacts Other Scope Individuals Business Intermediaries Business Partners - 37- \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other – customer change impacts - 38- There are further scope items that will be implemented either leading up to or close to Release 2 go-live. The changes are varied and impact a range of customer groups such as individuals, business, intermediaries and business partners but overall the changes have a Lowimpact and one pocket of Mediumfor KiwiSaver providers and members impacted by the default provider review. Some of the changes only impact smaller subgroups of our customer segments, depending on specific circumstances. Many these are improving Inland Revenues administration processes, therefore customers will not necessarily have visibility of the changes. Tax on Income: Negative PAYE adjustments -employers, software developers and intermediaries managing payroll for clients will need to understand when they can make a negative adjustment for prior periods in an Employment Information file – it only applies to gross and PAYE fields (not to social policy adjustments). Bankruptcy IRD number allocation –Individual customers (including sole traders) going through the bankruptcy process won’t be allocated a new IRD number, reducing confusion and removing the need for them to change their number with other organisations. Other business customers will not need to update their files for their employees or clients who are bankrupted. Credit card convenience fee -student loan borrowers and child support customers based overseas who use a credit card for payment transactions will now be charged the convenience fee charge (1.42%), along with all other customers and will need to be aware this and what other payment options are available. SPK2IR payment options -enhancements to improve the SPK2IR self service payment options for customers in arrears by allowing credit card payments, removing the need to engage with Inland Revenue staff. Miscellaneous payment types –management of a number of miscellaneous payment types (i.e. conscience money, excess cash etc) will be moved into START, including reparations that are awarded to Inland Revenue and collected by \[Information redacted\]. There are no direct impact to customers. Barcode solution (unauthenticated) –will be updated to match barcodes issued natively in START, ensuring \[Information redacted\] only have to read one standard type and may improve payment processing for them. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other – customer change impacts - 39- Digital Services: Version 2 Employment Information –payroll software developers, intermediaries and employers who have not moved to version 2 of Employment Information will need to do so, be aware of the implications if they continue to use version 1 and understand how to manage amendments by using the same EI version as originally filed. \[Information redacted\] interface –Inland Revenue will start sending passport information to \[Information redacted\] (e.g. for maintaining person of interest list). There should be minimal impact to \[Information redacted\] as there is not a functional change to the interface. \[Information redacted\] interface (unauthenticated credit card payment) -customers who use the unauthenticated credit card payment option may notice a minor change in look and feel due to a new provider – \[Information redacted\]. However, the impact to \[Information redacted\] should be minimal as there is no change to functionality and this is a common banking function they provide. \[Information redacted\] interface –\[Information redacted\] will send Inland Revenue bank files intraday in addition to the existing end of day file. This should have minimal impact for \[Information redacted\] but they may need to support any queries triggered by the file content. KiwiSaver: KS Default Provider –the KiwiSaver default provider list will be updated as per legislative requirements. Default KiwiSaver providers and members will need to be aware of the update. The outcomes of the review are expected to be known by end of May and the bulk of any change activity will likely occur in December 2021. The impact has been assessed as Mediumfor providers and members but this will be clearer when review outcomes are known. Data: myIR correspondence –there are some changes to how customers view correspondence in myIR and some will have to use a search function to view migrated EDSR content as it will not appear in their inbox. For most customers this shouldn’t be a significant impact as they would expect to only see recently issued correspondence in their inbox. This will have a greater impact on child support customers as all correspondence up to cutover will be migrated content. Customer Support Customers will need to be aware of the changes prior to and after go live via our usual engagement channels and methods particularly intermediaries and employers about version 2 payday filing and negative adjustments. Some customers will need to make changes to their systems and business processes and they will continue to be supported by the BT Account Management and External Relationships teams. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope Employers will be able to use negative values in the prior period adjustment field when submitting their Employment Information (EI) files as long as validations are met. Customers who go through bankruptcy will retain the same IRD number and no longer be required to get a new number. This means they will no longer have to update this information with employers, banks and other agencies. There will be some changes to the look/feel of unauthenticated credit card payments with \[Information redacted\] being the new provider for this service. There will also be no exceptions for the convenience fee charged on credit card payments, regardless of channel. Customer Segment IndividualsBusinessIntermediaries Business Partners Key Changes for Customers The required review of default KiwiSaver Providers will occur. System updates will ensure customers are allocated based on the new default list and this information will be published on ird.govt.nz for customers to access.          - 40-  \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope -key changes for individuals - 41- Bankruptcy – Single IRD Number Migrated correspondence in myIR Credit card convenience fee for all L May find it harder for a short period only to locate child support messages; will need to use search function even for recent content May appreciate not having to update their number with banks / employers etc Overseas based student loan borrowers may be frustrated however may find other options just as convenient Overseas based liable parents may need to be aware of other payment options Unlikely to be of noticeable impact for most; all recent content will be in the inbox HWI with child support will need to use the search function for that content May find it easier to view post and pre bankruptcy account information for tax and social policy, especially in myIR Individuals / HWIFamilies L \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope -key changes for businesses - 42- Bankruptcy – Single IRD Number Transition to version 2 EI file Negative Adjustments for PAYE L Will only impact those whose software is yet to transition.

There is no change to the requirements for managing their tax and social policy accounts separately where pre and post adjudication applies, this will just be managed under the same IRD number. The unauthenticated credit card payment option will be updated as part of a change in provider. \[Information redacted\] will provide the platform for this service based on Inland Revenue specifications. Inland Revenue will start passing on the convenience fee charge (1.42%) for credit and debit card transactions to all customers. Previously overseas based borrowers paying student loans and overseas child support customers were not charged this fee. There will be updates to SPK2IR to improve self service payment options for customers to include the ability to make arrears (ARR) payments by credit card. Customers will see some differences in myIR in relation to how they view correspondence, some of this is due to the V12 design, however there will also be change based on how EDSR content is migrated to START. The key difference is that migrated correspondence (even if it is recently issued) will not appear in the customer’s inbox and native START content will; instead they will need to use a search function to view the migrated EDSR content. The KiwiSaver default provider list will be updated as per legislative requirements to regularly do so. Customers will no longer have to update records with a new IRD number when made bankrupt. This will reduce confusion around which number applies to which period of their tax accounts and remove the need for them to contact employers, banks and other agencies to update their details with a new number. Customers may notice a new look / feel to the unauthenticated credit card payment option, however as the functionality will be the same, this should be of minimal impact. Customers who are aware of and currently benefiting from Inland Revenue covering the credit and debit card convenience fee will need to know that it will no longer continue. They may need to understand what other payment options are available to them so they can determine if they still wish to use this payment channel. Customers may notice some small enhancements to SPK2IR that allows them to use a self-service option rather than needing to be connected to a person in relation to arrears payments. Customers may wonder why some information is accessed from their inbox in myIR and other content can only be accessed using the search function. For most customers this won’t be of significant impact as they would expect only recently issued correspondence to be in their inbox. However this will impact those customers with child support obligations / entitlements the most as all correspondence up until cutover for this release will be migrated content and affected by this. KiwiSaver members may need to make a choice in relation to their KiwiSaver provider if they were allocated to a provider who is removed from the default list. They will need guidance from their current provider and education from Inland Revenue to support this. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope impacts - business Impacted Customer Segments: Micro, Small-Medium Enterprises, Significant Enterprises, Not for Profits Impact Rating: Negligible - Low - 45- Key ChangesKey Impacts Customers (including Sole Traders) who go through bankruptcy processes will no longer be allocated a new IRD number. There is no change to the requirements for managing their tax and social policy accounts separately where pre and post adjudication applies, this will just be managed under the same IRD number. Those employers who have not already done so will be transitioning to version 2 of the Employment Information (EI) file.This relates to those using file upload in myIR or those using a software package that has yet to update to version 2. This change will affect the fields on the file with the addition of new fields in V2 changing how they complete information relating to prior period adjustments, employee share scheme (ESS) information and when accounting for student loan SLCIR and SLBOR deductions. Employers can, in some cases, enter a negative value in an Employment Information (EI) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period.They can already make adjustments for prior periods currently as long as the value is positive.This change enables a negative value in the relevant gross and PAYE adjustment columns as long as it will not reduce the overall gross or PAYE for the line item below 0. Additional validations will prevent negative adjustments entirely if there are impacts on social policy as part of the adjustment. There will be updates to SPK2IR to improve payment options for customers to include the ability to make arrears payments by credit card. Customers will no longer have to update records with a new IRD number when made bankrupt.This will reduce confusion around which number applies to which period of their tax accounts and remove the need for them to contact employers, banks and other agencies to update their details. Customers who are employers or who use an IRD number from their customers/clients as part of their business activity will no longer need to update files with a second number if their employee or customer/client has been made bankrupt.This may reduce some administrative cost for them. Employers may find the way version 2 captures information easier to work with as it allows all information relating to an employee to be captured on one line item rather than multiple. They will need to understand how to manage amendments and that they must amend information using the same EI version as originally filed.This may cause some confusion initially but this will reduce over time as version 2 becomes the dominant file type used. Employers will need to be aware that the prior period adjustment fields on the EI can now accept negative values if validations are met.They will need to understand when this is an option, and when a prior period will need to be amended instead. Customers may notice some small enhancements to SPK2IR that allows them to use a self-service option rather than needing to be connected to a person in relation to arrears payments. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope impacts - intermediaries Impacted Customer Segments: Tax Agents, Bookkeepers, Payroll Intermediaries Impact Rating: Negligible - Low - 46- Key ChangesKey Impacts Customers who go through bankruptcy processes will no longer be allocated a new IRD number. There is no change to the requirements for managing their tax and social policy accounts separately where pre and post adjudication applies, this will instead simply be managed under the same IRD number. Intermediaries who manage payroll for their clients may be transitioning to Version 2 of the Employment Information (EI) file if they have not already done so.This relates to those using file upload in myIR or those using a software package that has yet to update to version 2. This change will affect the fields on the file with the addition of new fields in V2 changing how they complete information relating to prior period adjustments, employee share scheme (ESS) information and when accounting for student loan SLCIR and SLBOR deductions. Intermediaries completing payroll for their clients can, in some cases, enter a negative value in an Employment Information (EI) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period.They can already make adjustments for prior periods in a current EI, this change enables a negative value in the relevant gross and PAYE adjustment columns as long as it will not reduce the overall gross or PAYE for the line item below 0. Additional validations will prevent negative adjustments entirely if there are impacts on social policy as part of the adjustment. There will be a consistent current tax year plus four years prior approach taken to what historical correspondence will be migrated to START from EDSR. This means START will no longer call EDSR to access older correspondence (up to 8 years) and only records from current year plus four can be viewed in myIR. Based on how the data is migrated, it can only be viewed via a search function. Intermediaries will need to be aware that customers will no longer have to update records with a new IRD number when made bankrupt.They will need to know how accounts will behave in myIR and will no longer need to have more than one IRD number held in client lists for the same customer for this reason. Intermediaries may find the way version 2 captures information easier to work with as it allows all information relating to an employee to be captured on one line item rather than multiple. They will need to understand how to manage amendments and that they must amend information using the same EI version as originally filed.This may cause some confusion initially but this will reduce over time as version 2 becomes the dominant file type used. Intermediaries will need to be aware that the prior period adjustment fields on the EI can now accept negative values if validations are met.They will need to understand when this is an option, and when a prior period will need to be amended instead. Intermediaries who regularly review correspondence in myIR will need to be aware of what historical information will be available to view and how to locate it. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope impacts – business partners Impacted Customer Segments: Software Developers, Service Providers/Financial Institutions, KiwiSaver Providers, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Negligible – Low - Medium - 47- Key ChangesKey Impacts Software Developers will need to complete the transition to Version 2 of the Employment Information (EI) file if they have not already done so. This change affects the fields on the file with the addition of new fields in V2 changing how they complete information relating to prior period adjustments, employee share scheme (ESS) information and when accounting for student loan SLCIR and SLBOR deductions.This includes support for amendments as their clients may need to amend files that are both version 1 and version 2. The unauthenticated barcode generator will be updated to match the barcodes issued natively in START ensuring \[Information redacted\] will only be presented with one standard type of barcode by customers. \[Information redacted\] will be responsible for the unauthenticated credit card payment platform our customers access from the Inland Revenue website. Inland Revenue will commence sending passport information (when provided by the customer) as part of the data we send to \[Information redacted\] through the \[Information redacted\] interface (e.g. for maintaining the person of interest list). \[Information redacted\] will begin sending Inland Revenue bank files intraday in addition to the existing end of day file. Management of a number of miscellaneous payment types will be moved into START, including reparations that are awarded to Inland Revenue and collected by the \[Information redacted\]. The KiwiSaver default provider list will be updated as per legislative requirements to regularly do so. Most Software Developers will deliver this change prior to release 2, however for those who do not, they will need to manage their capacity to complete all development that Inland Revenue is requiring of them; this may be challenging as version 2 is not the sole focus of change (e.g. other annual changes, e-file decommission are also on their runway). They will also need to support their own customer base with this change including any communications around timing and implications if they need to push out delivery dates. \[Information redacted\] will no longer need to use two different systems to read Inland Revenue issued barcodes. Having one standard barcode type will remove this requirement and may improve ease of payment processing for them. \[Information redacted\] will support the unauthenticated payment platform; however, as this is a common banking function for them it should be of minimal impact. There should be minimal impact to \[Information redacted\] as there will be no functional change to the \[Information redacted\] interface and they already send Inland Revenue matched passport information. \[Information redacted\] may need to support any queries triggered by intraday file content, however the introduction of intraday files is not new to \[Information redacted\] and should be of minimal impact to them, the impact is more for Inland Revenue. Although there will be changes to how Inland Revenue manages reparations money internally in START, there is no direct impact to the \[Information redacted\] in terms of how they pass on payments. KiwiSaver Providers will need to be aware of the update, however this is an expected change that has happened before. The degree of impact may vary if any providers are removed or added. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] We will continue to utilise all of our channels and methods to tailor our reach and engagement with customers Website, myIR and online services Content on IR website, news items, campaign pages, promotional and instructional videos, banner messaging and new functionality, services and B2B channels.

Customer opportunity (2023)
===========================

We define customer opportunity as customer ease and satisfaction when interacting with us to meet their obligations or access their entitlements.

### Customer satisfaction and perceptions of effort

We use 2 questions in our Customer Experience and Perceptions Survey to measure our customers’ perceptions of effort and satisfaction. Results reflect scores of 5 or more, where 1 means 'strongly disagree' and 7 means 'strongly agree'.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Statements and scores from the Customer Experience and Perceptions Survey.
| Customers’ perceptions of effort and satisfaction | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customers who found it easy to deal with Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue | 63% | 67% | 65% | 65% |
| Customers satisfied with their last interaction with Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue overall | 67% | 73% | 70% | 69% |

This year’s survey results showed no change in how easy customers found us to deal with, and a small decrease in their satisfaction when interacting with us. These results reflect the challenges of supporting customers affected by the weather events and economic conditions, in line with increased contacts at times during the year from key annual events. We acknowledge we could not always provide the level of service we wanted to.

Note: In previous annual reports, results reported included neutral responses, ratings 4 of 7 on a 7-point scale. Results in this report for 2020 to 2022 have been adjusted to exclude neutral responses to provide consistent criteria to 2023 results.

### Returns filed digitally

Most customers use digital channels, particularly when filing their tax returns. This year, 99.9% of returns were filed digitally (tax, GST and employment information returns).

*   Website sessions have increased from 29 million in 2017 to 53 million in 2023.
*   Use of gateway services by businesses to file returns from their own systems increased from 2.6 million returns filed in 2017 to 7.6 million in 2023.

### Donation tax credit claim submissions sent digitally

Customers can submit their donation receipts in myIR at any time during the year or they can send us paper records. At the end of the tax year, we automatically pay out refunds. This year, 80.9% of donation tax credit claims were submitted digitally, which is 1.2 percentage points higher than 2021–22.

### Instalment arrangements set up through self-service

We provide options for customers who get into debt, including paying off what they owe in instalments while they get back on track. Customers can also set up arrangements ahead of the due date. Customers can set up an instalment arrangement themselves in myIR.

In 2022–23, 35.6% of instalment arrangements totalling over $1 billion were set up through myIR by customers themselves, a small decrease from 38.3% in 2021–22. We know customers who set up their own arrangements are more likely to stick to them. More detail on this is here.

Case study 1 – Overseas-based student loan borrowers payment campaign

Student loans are interest-free for borrowers based in New Zealand. However, borrowers who are based overseas pay interest on their student loans. If they miss a payment, late payment interest is added to their loan. Overseas student loan debt is growing and we want to encourage more overseas-based borrowers to make their repayments on time to avoid the extra interest. We did this using our digital tools.

In May 2023, we contacted overseas-based borrowers who had missed their 31 March payment to remind them to get back on track. We advised them to register for myIR so they could check their balance easily and that they can pay using the method that works best for them, including direct debit. We contacted people by email, text and letter and reached out on social media and online advertising. In total, we contacted nearly 75,000 overseas-based borrowers.

The difference with this campaign was that we tailored our message based on compliance level. We sent a standard reminder to borrowers who had missed their March payment, but used a stronger tone for those who had also missed previous payments.

Our objectives were to achieve an email open rate of 50% and a myIR login rate of 10%. For these borrowers, 84% opened our email and over 25% logged in to myIR. Over 3,000 instalment arrangements were set up, an increase of 87% from May 2022.

The overseas-based borrowers we contacted using a stronger tone made an average repayment that was 101% higher ($2,329) than the standard reminder we sent to other borrowers ($1,156).

Our campaign produced great results. Overall, nearly twice as many overseas-based borrowers logged in to myIR, and more borrowers made a repayment. In addition, their average student loan repayment amount was 57% higher at $1,384 (compared to $879 for the control group). In total, overseas-based borrowers repaid $2.27 million as a result of the campaign, which is 29% higher than in May 2022.

Case study 2 – Upgrading our external authentication system

Our priority is ensuring that customer information is secure, so people need to confirm their identity. We’ve now improved our authentication with a new solution, START IAMS, providing many benefits for us and for our customers. These include leading cyber security protection and improved performance.

Part of this upgrade is a 2-step verification, which gives customers an added layer of security for their online myIR accounts. Customers do not have to choose to go through 2-step verification, but the process will keep their information extra safe. This feature has been well received by gateway providers.

Some digital service providers needed to make updates to their software to interact with our new upgraded requirements. Customers who do not have compatible systems have until October 2023 to make the necessary changes.
\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Version: Final v1.0 Date:13/09/2019 Customer Readiness Approach Prepared by BT Organisation & Customer Change Management and Training \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer Readiness Approach - 2 - This document outlines the Release 4 approach on how to measure our customer readiness. •The customer readiness assessment is a component of the overall Readiness Framework for START release 4 which also assesses programme readiness, business and people readiness. •Customer readiness determines “where we expect customers to be” by customer segment. It also includes criteria which is critical for go-live and other criteria which will provide indicators to inform decisions for customer change treatments and/or business resourcing and response. It informs both business readiness and programme readiness, which, along with customer readiness, is assessed at pre-determined checkpoints. •The approach summarises how we will engage with our customers (up to 4 times) to understand how ready they feel for release 4 and how we can help support and better prepare them for the impending changes. While START release 3 impacted most people in New Zealand in some capacity and many were very highly impacted, Release 4 has a more direct impact on specific customers, including 713,606 customers with student loans, 2,938,003 KiwiSaver members and 204,840 Employers who are highly or moderately impacted. Other areas of moderate to low change in Release 4 include tax on income, Working for Families Tax Credits and Research & Development Tax Incentive. A monthly report on customer readiness will be prepared for PGC. In addition, the results of surveying our customers will assist the wider business with implementation planning through briefings with relevant leads and management advisors. Due to the broad range in scope for Release 4, we will use a combination of customer surveys and leveraging off other activities happening across IR with our customers. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Readiness & Support Purpose of Customer Readiness Checkpoints - 3 - Awareness & Understanding Understanding & Readiness OCT DEC APRIL MAY AUG JUN FEB MAR Individuals Business/ Employers Business Partners Intermedia ries Aware of the change Ready for the change Understand the change Progress / transition check Pulse Checks Aware of the change Aware of the change Understand the change Understand the change Understand the change Ready for the change Ready for the change Ready for the change Customer Research (tbc) Go-Live Checks Customer Research (tbc) Customer Research(tbc) Customer Research (tbc) Customer Research (tbc) Customer Research (tbc) Customer Research (tbc) \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Checkpoints for Customer Readiness surveying - 4 - 4a: Fri 3 April Go-Live Committee Can we COMMENCE 4b: tbc 4c: Sun 12 April Go-Live Committee Can we PROCEED Checkpoint 2: Are we ON TRACK Thurs 12 December Customer research will check in with: •Businesses/Employers •Tax Agents Checkpoint 5: 21 May Customer research will check that customers are on track Checkpoints 3a: Are we READY 20 February Customer research will check in with: •Individuals •Businesses/Employers •Tax Agents Checkpoint 1 : AWARE Thurs 24 October Checkpoint 6: 25 June Can we EXIT HyperCare 1 2 APRIL ‘20 Checkpoint 3b : Are we READY Thurs 19 March Feb ‘20 Mar ‘20 Dec ‘19 MAY ‘20 Jun ‘20 Oct ‘19 Aug ‘19 Checkpoint 0: ALIGNED Thurs 22 August S2 S3 S4 S5 Change Restriction 26/08/18 06/01 Change Control (Brown-Out) Change Freeze 03/04 16/3 Change Control 4b 4c 3b 3a 6 Indicates Customer Readiness Checkpoints 5 6 5 6 4a \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Customer Readiness Approach reflects lessons from prior releases and is based on the approach used in Release 3: 1.Use metrics and data from marketing and communications activities, for example, reach of direct mail, social media and advertising. 2.Incorporate other research findings such as the results of ‘exit’ surveys' run after Community Compliance seminars and the “Customer reactions to R4 Changes” research. 3.Use metrics and data collected by the Areas of Focus teams. 4.Reports via Account Managers (BT, External Relations and Community Compliance) against specific criteria on the readiness status of the intermediaries, service partners and government agencies they engage with. 5.Report insights from Customer Design Validation into customers’ expectations of eServices, including ease of use. 6.Leverage three major waves of market research commissioned by Marketing and Communications to be conducted by third party research agency (tbc).

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue Customer, Stakeholder and Marketing Plan for Stage 4 START Delivery Release 2: October 2021 Senior Responsible Owner: Prepared by: Date: 20 May 2021 v0.06 FINAL Page 2 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] About this document Stage 4 is the final step in IR’s Business Transformation journey which is currently planned to end in early 2022. This plan sets out the customer communication and marketing approach for Business Transformation Stage 4 START Delivery, Release 2. Stage 4 START Delivery is made of up three delivery phases: • S4-1-R1 went live on 1 March 2021. • S4-1-R2 will go live in October 2021. • START Delivery ‘Other’ includes a range of products be ing implemented between December 2020 and December 2021. In particular, this plan will focus on S4-1-R2 (Release 2) and some elements of START Delivery Other. These changes and enhancements will impact all our external stakeholder segments. To reach them, the IR Marketing and BT Communications teams have developed this p lan in consultation with internal stakeholders. It covers: • Stakeholder engagement: h ow we will engage with targeted stakeholder groups to build awareness and understanding of the changes that will affect them and their customers / audiences. This will mostly involve business to business engagement, for example through meetings, phone calls, newsletter content, presentations and webinars. For some products we will connect with end users through intermediaries such as tax agents and industry bodies. • Marketing: t he tactics, channels, timing and messaging for marketing campaigns to businesses, intermediaries, individuals and families customers. These will employ a range of both wide-reaching and direct channels such as web content, advertising, social media, community group collateral, letters, emails and texts. The Marketing and BT Communications teams will work closely throughout the release to coordinate outputs and to ensure consistent and timely messaging. We will integrate activity across: • The Executive Leadership Team. • The Business Transformation Programme including the Organisation Change Team, The BT Account Management Team and the Programme Leadership Team. • Internal Communications, Content Management and Media. • The External Relationships and Community Compliance Teams. • The Business delivery leads and any working groups that are set up. This document provides: • the high-level context for our engagement, communications and marketing activities • an introduction to the stakeholder groups that will be impacted by Stage 4, Release 2 and ‘other’ changes • a flavour of the messaging for each group • a point-in-time overview of our planned engagement and marketing activities. Page 3 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] As with previous releases, more detailed tactical plans will be developed for individual products/activities as required. Not included in this document are: • Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBC), the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) and other COVID-19 responses. While these are not included in this document, future impacts from these activities will be considered alongside the deliverables within this plan as they impact the same audiences. • The Stage 4 Transition and Go-live Communications Plan. This will be developed separately in line with the go -live date. • START generated letters (operational communications) that will be updated to reflect the myIR changes from V12. This document covers the changes at a point in time. Specific messages, channels and timelines will evolve as Stage 4 changes are further developed and defined.

7 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1 Introduction – the landscape for Stage 4, Release 2 Programme view Business Transformation (BT) is a multi-year, multi-stage change programme which will help IR become a modern world-class revenue organisation. It's about making it simpler, open and more certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Our business case promised we’d deliver the transformation in four stages across a series of releases. We’ve successfully implemented the first four major releases. Transformation is now in its final phase, Stage 4, and we remain committed to completing transformation as quickly as possible. Previously our major releases have aligned with the beginning of the tax year in April. Given the impacts of COVID-19, we are implementing the Stage 4 changes progressively. The first release went live on 1 March 2021. We’ll continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our customers and will adapt this plan as necessary to reflect any relevant COVID initiatives and their impact on each customer group. The landscape for this release differs from our most recent releases as it involves not just products, but our first myIR system upgrade. In this sense it could be seen as comparable to Stage 1 of our Business Transformation, when we moved GST into a new and unfamiliar system. We know customers and our people found the transition difficult and while we don’t underestimate the impact of the myIR upgrade to Version 12, specifically on our external stakeholders, we are in a very different place to where we were in Stage 1. We now have our customers’ attention firmly focused on everything we do and they are familiar with START. We will begin warming our customers up to the changes early, using the comprehensive suite of channels we have developed over the years. We will also provide practical tools for key internal teams, such as Community Compliance, to aide their conversations with customers. Our approaches for doing this are captured in this document. What we’ve delivered so far in Stage 4, START Delivery The three delivery phases of Stage 4 START Delivery will see the final elements moved into our new system, some new legislation implemented, and the myIR experience for customers further improved. 1.2.1 Release 1 Release 1 went live on 1 March 2021, migrating into START: • Paid Parental Leave – including regulation changes to simplify the application process. • New Zealand Foreign Trusts – including changes to the registration process and allowing providers to link to client myIR accounts. • Unclaimed Monies - including legislation changes to simplify the process for holder organisations, and • Duties (casino, lottery and totalisator duties). Page 8 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] All taxes and most social policies are now in the new system, as is all customer information such as contact details. 1.2.2 START Delivery Other By the end of April, a number of other products had also gone live, including: • Decommissioning E- File and replacing it with new gateway services and APIs. • Working for Families updates. • Replacing the KiwiSaver Heritage B2B gateway with gateway services APIs. • Requiring Payday Version 2 of employment information (Version 1 (for filing only) to be retired in October). Annual changes in April 2021 included: • Repealing the child support incremental penalty and simplifying child support penalty write-off rules. • Enabling the In-Work Tax Credit component of Working for Families to continue to be paid in the first two weeks of the customer being out of work. • Applying the same penalty and interest rules to voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions as apply to compulsory contributions. • Enabling overpaid tax on Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) investment income to be ref unded as part of the customer’s individual income tax assessment. • Applying a collection of other changes to income tax returns including the IR3. In addition, t he Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Bill introduced further changes in April. There are four main measures: • A new top personal income tax rate of 39%. • Increased disclosure requirements for trusts. • Increasing the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold for the 2020-21 tax year, and • Clarifying the ability for Inland Revenue to require information for the purposes of providing quality policy advice. Some of these activities are still in flight including: • The KiwiSaver heritage B2B gateway will remain in place until December 2021 as KiwiSaver Providers transition to the new APIs. • While officially Payday Version 2 was required from 1 April, we are allowing extensions until October (date to be confirmed) at which time it will become mandatory. • The new top personal tax rate is associated with other changes, some of which are still to come into effect. For example, the RWT rate changes, will come into effect in October 2021. While not part of Release 2, we will ensure they align with, and where appropriate are included in, our messaging and channels. Page 9 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.2.3 Changes coming in Stage 4 Release 2 Release 2 is planned to go live in October 2021 (targeting Labour Weekend). It includes: • myIR and START upgrade from Version 11 to Version 12 • migrating child support into START • child support legislation changes (there will also be more coming in April 2022), and • some tax on income change. Stage 4 Release 2 changes are the focus of this plan. 1.2.4 Impacts on stakeholders Release 2 has some different characteristics from Release 1. For example: • The upgrade to Version 12 will impact all our customers, although some to a greater degree than others. We will need to strike the right balance between focusing on those highly impacted stakeholders while maintaining the right level of educative communications to broader, less impacted customers. • Chi ld support customers will be impacted by the child support legislative changes and the move to START. • The impact of Release 2 on businesses will be low to medium depending on the frequency and complexity of their myIR use, and whether/how they are impacted by the child support changes. To give an example of some of our audiences, Stage 4 will impact: • 5,500 tax agencies (and their employees who use myIR). These will again be a key stakeholder group that will be highly impacted, particularly by the Version 12 upgrade. • 40,700 complex organisations, such as significant enterprises, that use myIR. • 642,000 small businesses or sole traders who use myIR frequently. • 1,270,000 individuals with social policy accounts who tend to use myIR a few times a month. • 1,452,000 individuals who use myIR infrequently. • 156,000 liable parents who pay child support and 163,000 receiving parents and carers. Key challenges In delivering Release 2 customer engagement, we will face the following key challenges: 1. Raising awareness of the changes and educating affected customer groups about what the changes mean for them. In particular, the myIR Version 12 upgrade will affect all customer groups to varying degrees. We need to be aware of the impact and communicate it effectively to all users of myIR without creating concern or uncertainty. Child support customers will need to adapt to the new legislation and processes, as well as a new system (Version 12). They will require clear information about what they need to know and do, and when. There is a risk highlighted in the impact assessment that will be tested in the mock go-live, that manual workarounds for a small number of child support customers are not passed through into START. To mitigate this, we will be ready with Page 10 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] internal and external communications to support customers with why and how to resolve this. 2. Managing change fatigue. After four years of change we are updating the entire system. While it will improve myIR for our customers, it could prompt questions about the need for a wholesale change for a newly built system. We will be careful to ‘keep it real’ - being clear that this is an upgrade not a system change, and by scaling information according to need. This will be particularly important to consider for customer groups who have been through several rounds of changes already. Tax intermediaries will again be a key group where we will need to manage / mitigate change fatigue. At the same time, we will communicate that the end of business transformation does not signal the end of change. Customers will see continual improvement and future enhancements managed with the same rigour as the BT programme but scaled appropriately. Customers affected by the R elease 1 changes (Paid Parental Leave, Duties, New Zealand Foreign Trusts and Unclaimed Money), will be faced with another change eight months after the initial go-live. While a challenge, it is also an opportunity as we already have momentum and contact with these customers and can introduce Release 2 as an ongoing part of this engagement. 3. Retaining and building confidence in Inland Revenue through the final stage of our transformation. It is important that we maintain trust with our customer groups. Through our stakeholder engagement, marketing and communications we will help to create customer buy-in, positive behaviour change and minimise reputational risk. 4. Getting the timing right and aligning with other engagement activities with customers as part of their IR compliance obligations. We will need to strike a balance between warming customers up to the changes ahead and providing the details when they need to know them. This includes aligning messaging with annual events. One of these challenges is that the main GST filing date falls on 28 October which, if we go live over Labour Weekend, will be three days after the move to Version 12. 5. Catering for other dependencies. There may be impacting factors that are not part of Release 2. For example, moving all employers to payday filing Version 2 before the Release 2 go live. Version 2 is critical for child support. Page 11 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Legislation Legislation impacting Release 2 has been passed and will come into effect in April 2021 (some child support) and October 2021 ( the majority of child support and the Hague Convention). There is also legislation that will come into effect in April 2022 (child support changes that impact payment calculations). This means we can speak with certainty about some of the legislative changes we are implementing but not others. Changes in April 2022 will be communicated to the relevant audiences in March/April 2022 as part of marketing BAU. 1.4.1 The Child Support Amendment Act The Child Support Amendment Act includes changes taking effect in April 2021, October 2021 and April 2022. Broadly the changes that will impact our customers are: April 2021: • Removing the incremental penalties. • Simplifying the penalty write-off provisions. These changes are in effect. As part of this, the Families segment is planning to contact relevant child support customers (liable parents) to write off their historic incremental penalty debt. October/November 2021: • Compulsory employer child support deductions from salaries (for newly liable customers). • Further changes to the penalties: o Moving the second stage of the initial late payment penalty to 28 days after the due date. o Removing the $5 minimum from the initial late payment penalty. o Introducing a 60-day grace period for customers new to or re-joining child support, before they are charged penalties. • Extending existing temporary exemptions to liable parents based overseas who are in prison or hospital. • Introducing exemptions for customers suffering long term injury or illness. • Introducing a minimum age of 16 for a child to be considered financially independent. • Continuing child support until the end of the school year for a child remaining at school past the age of 18 • Introducing time constraints for the provision of court orders of parentage for back dating assessments. • Introducing timeframes for first assessments; giving customers 28 days from the date they are notified of their assessment to advise of their existing circumstances. • Allowing IR to offset the amounts owed without the customers having to apply for an admin review. • Introducing a four-year time bar on child support reassessments. Page 12 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] For Release 2 the marketing and communications teams will focus on these October changes. April 2022: • Repealing the use of the mixed-age expenditure table. • Including investment income (interest and dividends) in the salaries/wages assessment; and moving from taxable income to net income. • Estimation changes including: o Allowing for estimations made within 28 days of a customer’s assessment to be backdated to the start of their child support. o End of year reconciliation of estimations. • Giving IR the discretion to adjust the child expenditure calculation in complex care situations. Ensuring that we tell child support customers what they need to know only when they need to know it, communication of these changes will fall outside of the Release 2 timeframe. 1.4.2 Hague Convention The Hague Convention, on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance, is a multilateral treaty which provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance when the liable person resides in a different country to where the child support or maintenance assessment was raised. On 26 November 2019 New Zealand signed the Hague Convention which is likely to come into effect in October 2021. The approach to stakeholder engagement is detailed in The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance 2007, Stakeholder Engagement Plan. This has been developed by a team in the business that is managing the Hague Convention work. BT Communications can support this work as required. There is unlikely to be any marketing required other than supporting the media team with media releases and responses to potential questions. 1.4.3 Other Government may introduce further legislation that may need to be factored into the BT Programme. Page 13 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 External stakeholder and customer engagement This section further describes our impacted stakeholders and customers in Release 2 and our approach to engaging them. Stakeholder engagement approach – BT Communications team A key role of the BT Communications team will be to support the BT Account Managers, and the business, in providing timely, consistent, targeted communications to external stakeholders. To achieve this, we will do the following. • Communicate any planned external messages to our people first. • Communicate to key stakeholders second, so there are no surprises for impacted businesses and partners. This means: o Engaging first with professional bodies, the Tax Agent Cohort and providers, then tax agents, industry associations and consumer advocacy groups as appropriate. o Helping those organisations and groups to cascade consistent messages to their staff, members and customers. • Carefully manage messaging: o Phasing communications through awareness, understanding and readiness for go- live followed by a support phase (Early Life Support). o Scal ing engagement to reflect the extent of each area of change. o Bundling messages for customers interested in multiple changes. o Repurposing messages in different channels. • Continue to take a coordinated, joined up approach to managing external stakeholders, presenting with one voice. • Take an ‘open and transparent’ approach to engaging and communicating with our stakeholders, customers and our people. Marketing approach – IR Marketing team A key role of the IR Marketing team is to identify the key impacts for customers and provide timely, consistent, targeted communications preparing customers for the changes. For Stage 4 Release 2, we will use multiple channels, most notably several rounds of highly targeted direct marketing (letters, emails, text messages) supported by website content, advertising and community group collateral. The messaging and approach will be adapted based on the impact of the change, research monitoring, information from the DIP platform, direct feedback from customers, contact centre feedback and social media observations. The goal is to guide customers on the journey from awareness to understanding and readiness, as outlined in the customer impact assessment. The approach will vary based on the changes and detailed customer segmentation and will include a range of channels and tactics that will work together to amplify the relevant key messages, ensuring they are received by the intended audiences. This includes aligning with other BAU marketing and communications activity to make sure messaging is sequenced correctly, is consistent and relevant and that we don’t overload customers. COVID-19 messages may be included as and when necessary. Page 14 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Media Approach The IR marketing and BT Communications teams will work closely with the media team to identify significant milestones and other opportunities for both proactive and reactive media activity – including releases, interviews, media briefings or other newsworthy events as appropriate. IR’s news website (https://www.media.ird.govt.nz) is the channel for news releases. All releases are made through the site and reach all key stakeholders by way of email alerts and Tweets on the media Twitter feed, at the same time as they reach the news media outlets. This is an effective tool that has reach well beyond the mainstream media; for example, it supplements our proactive, targeted activities for trade, industry and social interest groups and reaches the social media news environment. We can include video material – spokesperson interviews for example, to supplement releases if there is enough time in advance. A key area for the Media Team will be child support as there may be a number of sensitivities in this area that will see system, process and legislation change and a greater focus on compliance. We may see interest from journalists. A more detailed tactical media plan will be made closer to the timing of the milestones identified and at other times depending on what is happening in the news media environment and what opportunities present themselves. Messaging will be guided by the communications plan and by what the Media team determines as most likely to engage the interest of the news media. Spokespeople will be recommended for each proactive/responsive opportunity – emphasis will be on moving responsibility for media representation from the BT programme to the business – particularly the Commissioner, BT Deputy Commissioners, the two CCS Deputy Commissioners and the customer segment leaders across individual and business. Success Outcomes Customer engagement and marketing activities will contribute to the following outcomes: • The majority of c hild support customers (both liable parents and receiving carers) are aware of the Stage 4 legislative changes and the myIR changes and self-service options. • The majority of individuals and families, impacted by the change or who use myIR more than twice a year, are aware of, and ready for, the myIR version 12 changes affecting them. (Those who use myIR less than twice a year will learn of the changes through BAU communications). • The majority of businesses and intermediaries are aware of and ready for the myIR version 12 changes affecting them. • The majority of key influencers (such as professional bodies and advocacy groups) are aware of the legislative changes (particularly child support) and myIR version 12 changes that affect their stakeholders/customers. • The majority of Government stakeholders are aware of and ready for the legislative changes (particularly child support) and myIR version 12 changes that affect their departments. Page 15 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4 customer engagement activity will be measured against the above outcomes and other key metrics, e.g. marketing metrics. See Appendix B: Results and measurement for customer engagement for more information about these metrics. Stage 4, Release 2 Impacts In general, a medium impact is expected across customer groups, depending on the change. There is one pocket of high for the V12 upgrade impact on tax intermediaries. Overall, the most highly impacted customer segments are Tax Agents/intermediaries, Families (most notably child support customers), Employers, and some government agencies. Most changes should be received positively but customers will need adjustment periods to familiarise themselves and become comfortable with the change. Figure 1: Customer Heatmap Stakeholder overview Stakeholders are categorised into four groups: • Government • Key Influencers Page 16 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Customers • Service Providers Almost all of our stakeholders fall into more than one of these categories and interact with us in different ways: Government \[Information redacted\] Key Influencers • Transformation Reference Group • Professional bodies/associations • Tax Agent Cohort • Media and industry commentators • Advocacy groups Customers Business • Employers (including government agencies) • Microbusiness • Not for Profit • Small to medium enterprises • Significant Enterprises Individuals • Families • Child support (we have separated child support from Families for purposes of this plan) • Individuals (including nominated persons) • Māori Intermediaries • Tax Agents • Bookkeepers • Payroll intermediaries and Bureaus Service Providers • Software developers • Payroll software developers • KiwiSaver scheme providers • Financial institutions Figure 2: Stakeholder overview Page 17 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Areas of Change For external stakeholders, Release 2 consists of: • Two products - child support and tax on income (particularly negative adjustments for PAYE), and • a myIR system upgrade (to Version 12). We acknowledge that upgrading myIR to Version 12 will be very different from the traditional products we have released throughout the Business Transformation programme and we will look for new approaches to introducing this change while drawing on tried and true channels. While varied, the Release 2 changes will have overlapping stakeholders. This will require a tailored but also highly coordinated approach to our engagement and communications. myIR upgrade to Version 12 3.1.1 Introduction In October 2021, START and myIR will be upgraded from the current Version 11 (V11) to Version 12 (V12). The V12 upgrade has two parts: • Internal – changes to START. • External – changes to myIR. There will be a medium to high impact for customers who use myIR. All customers who use myIR will see changes to the navigation, and the look and feel, including how calls to action are presented and how summary views and balances are displayed for all products. At a high level while the overall customer experience will improve, there will be a period of readjustment. The upgrade to version 12 presents an opportunity to re-engage customers with myIR functionality, focusing on their needs and benefits as opposed to product specifications. 3.1.2 Approach BT Communications and IR Marketing will work with Account Managers, Relationship Managers, Community Compliance and other internal teams to communicate and engage with external stakeholders to ensure they understand what they need to know and do. We will tailor our messaging and channels to reach specific customer segments. Since August 2020, the Digital Ecosystems team has been engaging with key stakeholder groups for the design, build and testing phases. They are also undertaking customer testing and surveys as part of the ‘understanding’ phase of our stakeholder engagement. Feedback and sentiment from these engagements will help to inform our communications. As noted, implementing this system upgrade will be very different from implementing products. For each release to date, we have used a mix of online instruction, webinars, seminars, face to face engagement, newsletters, direct mail and social media to support customers through the change. While this has provided a level of support which has allowed customers to familiarise themselves with the change relatively quickly, the upgrade to myIR has been recognised as a different and potentially greater challenge. Page 18 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] To reach our audiences effectively we will: • (proposed approach, to be confirmed) incorporate task-based, easily searchable, contextual help on our website in the form of click stream videos and screen sequence (screen shot) guidance. These will be developed based on need as identified in customer testing. This solution would focus primarily on tax intermediaries but could extend to other customer segments. For specific ‘hotspots’, links will be embedded from myIR directly to the relevant guidance. This would help tax intermediaries (in particular) with myIR at the point they are trying to use it. • segment the customer groups to better understand their needs, the best channels to use (including seasonal / operational channels) and when they need specific information. • use existing channels in a way that better supports the upgrade. For example, five- minute, activity-specific ‘warm up’ webinars and ‘how to’ video demonstrations supplemented with printable quick reference summaries. • be mindful that child support customers may need particular care as they may have quite complex circumstances and are facing other changes as part of Release 2. We will work closely with the child support product team to align our messaging and timing. • overlay the timing of our messaging with other events (e.g., annual events) that will impact the same customers. This will help to ensure people receive the messaging only as they need it. • upskill and engage our people with myIR (as well as START), and provide them with practical tools, so they are better placed to assist our customers. Child Support 3.2.1 Introduction As part of Release 2, child support changes will: • safely transition child support into START • modernise and improve information shares, service options and self-management tools • deliver straight through processing, with fewer manual interventions, and automate large transactional processes • better integrate International child support into core systems, and • deliver legislative changes to improve fairness, simplify aspects of the scheme, improve compliance and deliver on Government goals to improve the wellbeing of children. Changes to child support will impact those involved in the child support process including those who pay and receive child support payments, employers of people who pay child support and partner agencies. Other than awareness, there will be a lower impact on tax intermediaries. Changing visibility of child support obligations and payments in myIR and improved self- management services will benefit child support customers and their nominated persons. Customers and employers will be impacted by legislative changes including the introduction of compulsory employer deductions for most newly liable paying parents. Modernised information sharing with other government agencies will help to streamline child support processes. Page 19 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] There will be new functionality for contracted lawyers who conduct administrative reviews. 3.2.2 Approach Our approach will reflect that many child support customers have complicated and sensitive circumstances and need information and solutions to be as straight forward and simple as possible. They will require reassurance that their circumstances are understood, we have the correct information, and that all parties are taking the actions required to administer the child support assessment or agreement. Considerable time and attention may be required to ensure we are engaging with this audience appropriately, in collaboration with other government organisations and IR internal groups. In the understanding phase, this may include: • a layer of Maori/Pasifika targeting for our advertising, particularly around the child support changes, • community outreach/engagement activity (for example, this might include posters at local GPs), • engaging with selected advocate groups to ask how best we can connect, through them, to their communities (for example, via Iwi radio stations and maraes), and • continuing to build our database to include those who may not have been targeted in other releases (such as father support groups). In the support phase, we will need to respond quickly to issues or concerns raised. We can do this through: • updated web content providing subject-specific responses to issues, • social media posts / ads to promote the information on the website (these could be partially translated), • targeted text messages, and • targeted, printable updates for community advocacy groups, covering specific issues or concerns and translated as required. We will also work with the media team as there may be media interest in this product. Tax on income and ‘other’ changes Mostly, the tax on income and ‘other’ changes will require minimal to no communication to external stakeholders. Those that may require some messaging include: • Negative adjustment for PAYE - which will impact employers that will be able to, if certain validations are met, enter a negative value in an Employment Information (EI) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period. We will communicate this change as part of our wider communications to employers and tax intermediaries, being careful not to oversell the message given the limited number of customers that will meet the validations. • Credit and debit card convenience fees – will impact student loans and child support customers who make payments with overseas banks’ credit/debit cards. As part of the Release 2 changes, we will no longer cover the convenience fee on credit and debit card transactions but will pass these on to customers. We will weave this messaging into our promotion of the variety of payment options available to our customers, including existing obligation due date communications. Page 20 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Audit correspondence – will impact business owners whose historic audit correspondence will be visible in myIR. Fr om October 2021 some audit letters from 2017 onwards will be moved to myIR. These will be visible to anyone with administrator access. We will bundle this message with other employer / business communications. • Bankruptcy - customers who go through bankruptcy processes will no longer be allocated a new IRD number. This will only affect those customers that are facing bankruptcy, and their tax intermediaries where applicable. We will include high level messaging as part of our wider communications to those audiences. Page 21 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Customer/stakeholder approach and messaging The communications approach is based on the successful rollout of previous releases. The goal is to guide customers on the journey from awareness to understanding and readiness, as per the customer impact assessment. The timing of the phases will differ for each audience, based on the expected impacts and whether they need to take any actions to prepare for the changes. Since the beginning of Stage 4 Release 1 we have been warming up employers, tax intermediaries and advocacy groups to the changes coming in October this year. For customers and stakeholder groups that will be highly impacted, we’ll start to build further awareness that changes are coming and broadly what they are. In the lead up to go-live we will build our customers’ understanding of the changes pre and during go-live. Post go-live we will support customers and encourage them to find out more about the relevant changes including new or improved features in our website content and myIR. The understanding and support phases will help ensure customer readiness. Phase 1: Awareness Phase 2: Understanding Phase 3: Support Readiness Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Government stakeholders Go live – October 2021 Key influencers Intermediaries Businesses/employers Child support customers Individuals/families Customer readiness checkpoints 14 th CP1 23 rd CP2a 26 th CP2b 26 th CP3 18 th CP4a Figure 3: Overview of the three phases for each audience group In depth customer testing is being managed by the Digital Ecosystems team to better understand the response of customers who use myIR, to the V12 changes. The testing is expected to run through to July 2021 and will help identify the benefits for customers and areas that may require additional support. This will be used to develop tailored messaging for each audience. In this section we look at the communications approach for each customer group, the planned activities for the Marketing and BT Communications teams and some of the key messages. Page 22 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] These provide a starting point and will be adapted and expanded further as the scope and designs are progressed. Appendix C: Communications channels further describes the channels and how they are used. Appendix D: Key messages shows the wider context of how our stakeholders and customers will be engaged and informed for Release 2. Government stakeholders 4.1.1 Communications approach As with previous releases we will contribute to updates to Ministers and Cabinet ensuring they are updated on the progress of the BT Programme, and that Members of Parliament know how the changes may impact their constituents. These stakeholders will be briefed prior to external customer or advocacy groups. Key stakeholders for Stage 4 Release 2 are: \[Information redacted\]. Some government agencies will be directly impacted by the changes, particularly those involved with child support. Inland Revenue works with external agencies to administer child support. These are: These agencies will require varying levels of communication support depending on their role and the impact on their own customers. We are working closely with them to align the content and timing of our messaging where appropriate and to help ensure they are up to date with the changes that impact them and can make the necessary preparations. The agencies will require varying levels of communication support depending on their role and the impact on their own customers. For example, information sharing and communication with \[Information redacted\] and \[INFORMATION REDACTED\] will be improved including through a new digital portal. We will also include government agencies in our messages for employers. 4.1.2 Planned activities for government stakeholders Phase Activity Ongoing throughout Release 2 • Contribute to weekly and monthly Minister / Joint Minister reports. • Support BT account management activities. • Contribute to cross agency communications activities including for any co-design and planning with affected agencies. • Send monthly Transformation Newsletters providing high level updates about the changes and linking them through to the website landing page for more detail. Page 23 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Phases 1 and 2: Awareness and understanding • Updates and webinars: to inform agencies of any new or changing obligations they may have as employers (including the impact of closing payday filing version 1). • MP packs prior to cutover to ensure Members of parliament know about the changes that may impact their constituents. Phase 3: Support • Cross agency open home: We can consider whether there is value in a cross agency ‘open home’ to walk through key V12 changes. I t would be similar to that done for Release 4 which focused on the ‘doers’. In this case it might include payroll and finance teams who may be highly impacted by V12 changes. We will carefully assess the correct channel and path for engaging with government stakeholders. For example, some messages will need to come from the Commissioner to Chief Executives; others will be manged through account management or product teams; or via the Government and Ministerial Team; other messages will come through BT communications channels to the agencies’ communications or change teams. 4.1.3 Key messages The key messages will be tailored based on the stakeholder audience, the impacts of the changes for them and the communications channel. Draft key messages: • This is the final stage of the BT programme but it won’t be the end of change. • The timing and implementation of the changes, including legislative changes. • In October we will be upgrading our myIR platform. The new layout will make it easier for our customers to see and action important information and there will be more functionality for certain tasks. • Agencies directly impacted by child support changes, will need to understand the impact of this on their processes, staff and customers. • Some government agencies will benefit from new digital options being available to them. These agencies will need to adapt their business processes to incorporate these and may need a fair amount of support fr om IR. • Changes for employers, such as child support deductions. • Who to contact for more information. Key influencers and professional bodies 4.2.1 Communications approach In the stakeholder engagement space, advocacy groups like industry associations and professional bodies \[Information redacted\], business groups \[Information redacted\], community groups and industry influencers are important conduits for engaging with end- users. Page 24 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] They represent customers who will be impacted by Release 2 in different ways. Most will be impacted by the myIR upgrade to V12; some community groups will be particularly interested in the child support changes and may be very vocal in advocating for their members; and many will have members who are impacted by the changes for employers. Industry and professional bodies should receive critical messaging ahead of their members, so they are prepared for calls and questions. They can also advise Inland Revenue on how and when their members should be contacted. BT Communications has a stakeholder database with over 600 organisations. We send our monthly Transformation Newsletter to these organisations (as well as to 4,500 subscribers) as well as updates on specific topics, for example COVID relief initiatives. We can segment this database by business association, community organisation, government agency, industry association, Iwi, professional body, sports body and trade association. Many of these are, or represent, not for profits. These groups will want certainty around what to do and how to do it and we will be proactive in directing the right message to the right organisations. These groups receive the most relevant messages based on their members. We’ll work closely with the BT Account Managers, External Relationships and Community Compliance teams to ensure we’re reaching the right influencers. Page 25 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.2.2 Planned activities for key influencers Phase Activity Ongoing throughout Release 2 • Support BT account management and community compliance activities. • Send monthly Transformation Newsletters providing high level updates about the changes and linking them through to the website landing page for more detail. • Presentations for conferences. Phase 1: Awareness • Update the Business Transformation webpage to direct customers to the landing pages for Release 2. • High level webinars on the upcoming changes. • Provide high level content and articles for advocacy group outputs. From phase 2: Understanding • Short webinars on using V12. • Quick reference guides to accompany the webinars. • More detailed webinars on child support changes. • As we get closer to go-live this content would move to the website and quick reference guides would likely become ‘task pages’. • Provide more detailed content and articles for advocacy group outputs. • Targeted updates for specific milestones or topics. • Fact sheet on the key changes for child support. Phase 3: Support • Day 1 packs to explain the key things their members may need to know post go-live. • Consider canvassing key groups on any missing information that we can produce webinars or web content on. This can continue post go-live. 4.2.3 Key messages The key messages will be tailored for the stakeholder group and will be relevant for their end customers/members. Draft key messages: • We will provide regular updates on the timing and implementation of the changes, including legislative changes. • The key changes in child support and how they can help to inform their members. • In October we will be upgrading to a new version of myIR. The new layout will make it easier for you and your customers/members to see important information and perform Page 26 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] certain tasks. We will provide support to customers on how to navigate and use the new version of myIR. • For those representing employers, your customers/members may be able to enter a negative value in an EI (Employment Information) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period. • There will also be changes to what you/your members will see in your myIR accounts. Some information that is currently available but hard to find may be more visible and may need additional explanation. Intermediaries 4.3.1 Communications approach Tax intermediaries will continue to be one of our most important audiences. As frequent users of myIR they will be significantly impacted by the myIR changes and will require ongoing support. The approach and message will vary across the three key segments: • Tax Agents: There are approximately 5,500 tax agencies with 31,000 employees, of which we have contact details for about 18,000. These tax agents represent approximately 2.5M clients. • Bookkeepers: There are around 128 bookkeepers registered with us and approximately 5,500 companies that provide bookkeeping services, but do not meet the criteria of 10 clients to register with us. The \[Information redacted\], is an important stakeholder which has approximately 1,092 members. • PAYE intermediaries and payroll bureaus: There are 18 PAYE intermediaries representing approximately 20,000 employers and 14 payroll bureaus representing approximately 800 employers. It is difficult to get accurate volumes due to the payday reporting process which provides visibility of the software the filing has come from rather than the intermediary or bureau. • Other representatives: There are 11 registered Intermediaries who aren’t covered by the above segments but who interact with IR on behalf of at least 10 clients. Examples include Investment income intermediaries, liquidators and donations tax credit intermediaries. They will be impacted to some extent as they have been set up with the tax preparer tab in myIR. A key insight from previous releases is that some intermediaries are generalists, and even though they don’t need to know all the detail, they need to know something about everything. Other intermediaries are specialists and need to know all the detail about some things. We’ll use the information we have available to create sub-segments of customers. Customer research will also be run at key checkpoints to measure intermediaries’ awareness of the changes and identify the perceived benefits or potential issues. This will enable us to tailor and target the appropriate messaging ensuring that the right people get the right message at the right time. Page 27 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Segmentation will be based on the following: • Intermediary type (eg bookkeeper/tax agent). • myIR role (eg owner/admin). • myIR login frequency (eg 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11+ times per month). • Tax agents who have a customer master link with a customer who will see old audit correspondence in myIR. • Tax types (eg EMP and KiwiSaver). • Their size (no. of clients/employees). • Those who still use workspace frequently and need to be transitioned to ‘quick access’. • What they need to know, and when. • Whether they are they likely to need more support (profiling based on who called or emailed in previous releases). 4.3.2 Planned activities for intermediaries Phase Activity Ongoing throughout Release 2 • Support BT account management and community compliance activities. • Supporting engagement with professional bodies and the Tax Agent Cohort. • Monthly Agents Answers, Business Tax Update articles and Transformation News. High level updates about the changes. Link them through to the landing page for more detail. • Send information through the monthly tax update and through ad hoc updates as required. • Update Top solutions to promote key milestones. Phase 1: Awareness • High level presentation introducing the V12 changes, to assist BT Account Managers, ComCom and others in their stakeholder engagements. • New landing page added to IR website (late July - early August). This will provide information about the changes to myIR and any legislation t hat could impact them. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (mid-late June). Tailored for sub-segments based on the most highly impacted. These will drive customers to website for more detail of the changes. • Update the Business Transformation webpage to direct customers to the landing pages for Release 2. • High level webinars on the upcoming changes. Phase 2: Understanding • Updated landing page and topic webpages ( pre go -live). Provide information about the changes to myIR and any legislation that impacts them. Include ‘how to’ information through videos or task pages. Page 28 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Phase Activity • Direct marketing including emails and letters (mid- September). Tailored for sub-segments based on the most highly impacted. Drive customers to website for more detail of the changes. • Targeted digital advertising (September). High level updates about the changes. Link through to the landing page for more detail. • ‘H ow to’ content – videos and/or guides. Provide examples of what’s changing and how to do the tasks in V12. Videos could be animated, making them editable if the V12 screens change during Phase 2. • Short webinars on using V12 (or CBT /support packages on most frequently used tasks) for those topics not covered in the webinars. • Quick reference summaries to accompany the webinars. • As we get closer to go-live this content would move to the website and quick reference guides would likely become ‘task pages’. • Support packages (webinars and summaries) for Community Compliance. Phase 3: Support • Updated landing page and topic webpages (after go-live). Provide information about the changes to myIR and any legislation that impacts them. Include ‘how to’ information through videos or task pages. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (early mid- October). Tailored for sub-segments based on the most highly impacted. Drive customers to website for more detail of the changes. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (after go-live). Tailored for sub-segments based on the most highly impacted. Drive customers to website for more detail. Include Day 1 packs. • Targeted digital advertising ( October). High level updates/benefits about the changes. Link through to the landing page for more detail. • Contextual guidance on the web. If the approach is approved, we will provide and promote these guidance assets on the web (with hotspots linked to directly from myIR). • Canvas key groups on any missing information that we can produce webinars or web content on, continuing post go- live. Page 29 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Phase Activity • Social media to highlight key milestones and link to relevant how to videos e.g. ’How to file GST’ in myIR targeting those with a 28 October due date. 4.3.3 Key messages Message development is currently underway and will be informed by customer testing with tax agents and other intermediaries. Some of the myIR upgrades have been purpose built in consultation with tax agents and other intermediaries to allow them to better self-serve. Themes to be addressed include: • For tax agents the changes are largely seen as positive but not a significant improvement – don’t oversell it. • IR is seen as helpful, but some intermediaries think that it can be difficult to get the help/advice they need. • Alerts functionality will be improved. For example, the Intermediary Centre will provide alerts across an intermediary’s client list. • Tax intermediaries feel responsible for their clients and want our systems to automate some processes to help them get it right. • Workspace is being replaced with the Intermediary Centre which will provide an uplift of the current tax preparer functionality. • Tax agents with a customer master link will have new visibility of s ome historical audit correspondence. Draft key messages: • Include supportive and helpful messaging for customers more likely to need help with links to guides and more info. • In October you’ll notice some changes to myIR. The new layout will make it easier to see important information and to perform certain tasks. • A new Intermediary Centre will allow you to perform ‘intermediary functions’, from any level within myIR. This will replace the Tax Preparer tab and the Tax Agent Workspace currently in myIR. • For customers who still use Workspace, we will clarify when Workspace will no longer be available, and how they can perform those tasks going forward. • For tax agents who have the customer master link - from October 2021 you may notice some old audit letters are now visible in myIR. • If your client is an employer, if certain validations are met you will be able to enter a negative value in an EI (Employment Information) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period. • There will also be changes to what your customers see in their myIR accounts. For example, some information that is currently available but hard to find may be more visible. Page 30 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • If your clients pay or receive child support, they will be able to complete more actions in myIR. Businesses 4.4.1 Communications approach There are approximately 680,000 business customers including around 200,000 employers. The customers who are most affected are those who use myIR and will be impacted by the myIR upgrade to Version 12, and employers who will need to deduct child support payments for newly liable parents. There is an opportunity to ‘sell’ myIR to those business customers who have not yet registered for an account. The audiences will be segmented based on the size of their business, their myIR login frequency and whether or not they are an employer. As we can’t identify employers of newly liable (or returning) child support customers ahead of time, we will communicate broadly to all employers about the change to employee deductions for child support. This may be bundled with other messages for employers (like negative adjustments). We will create tailored messages for those who already make child support deductions and need to know what’s changing, and for those who will be new to it. Segmentation will be based on the following: • SME or sole trader, Self-employed, Significant enterprises, Medium to large enterprises that may have multiple profiles. • EMP filing channel used (eg myIR). • 1,790 customers who will have historical audit visible in their myIR account + an employee with admin access • Do they use software? • Do they currently make employer deductions for child support? • Their size (no. of employees). • What they need to know, and when. • Do they use a tax agent? • Are they in arears/debt, are they up to date with their EI? • Are they a financial institution with obligations around investment income? 4.4.2 Planned activities for businesses Phase Activity Ongoing throughout Release 2 • Support BT account management and community compliance activities. • Monthly Business Tax Update articles. High level updates about the changes. Link them through to the landing page for more detail. • Send monthly Transformation Newsletters providing high level updates about the changes and linking them through to the website landing page for more detail. Page 31 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Phase Activity Phase 1: Awareness • New landing page added to IR website (late July - early August). Provide information about the changes to myIR and any legislation that could impact businesses and employers. Phase 2: Understanding • Direct marketing including emails and letters (mid-September). Tailored for sub-segments. Drive customers to the website for more details about the changes. • Targeted digital advertising (September). High level updates about the changes. Link through to the landing page for more detail. • How to content – videos and/or guides. Provide examples of what’s changing and how to do the tasks in V12. Videos could be animated, making them editable if the V12 screens change during Phase 2. • Short webinars on using V12 for those topics not covered in the videos. • Quick reference summaries to accompany the webinars. • As we get closer to go live this content would move to the website and quick reference guides would likely become ‘task pages’. • Support packages (webinars and summaries) for Community Compliance. Phase 3: Support • Updated landing page and topic webpages (after go-live). Provide information about the changes to myIR and any legislation that impacts them. Include ‘how to’ information through videos or task pages. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (after go-live). Tailored for sub-segments. Drive customers to the website for more details. Include Day 1 packs. • Contextual guidance on the web. Depending on need, as identified during customer testing, if the contextual guidance approach is approved, we will provide and promote these guidance assets to our business customers. • Canvas key groups on any missing information that we can produce webinars or web content on, continuing post go-live. • Social media to highlight key milestones and link to relevant how to videos ie ’How to file GST’ in myIR targeting those with a 28 October due date. 4.4.3 Key messages Draft key messages: Page 32 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • In October, you’ll notice some changes to myIR. For example, the new layout will make it easier to see important information and navigate common tasks. • Changes to the child support legislation mean that when we go live with the change in October, child support payments will be deducted from a newly liable employee’s income if they earn salary and wages. • In some cases, you may be able to enter a negative value in an EI (Employment Information) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period. • For businesses owners who will have historic audit correspondence visible in myIR – From October 2021 some audit letters from 2017 onwards will be moved to myIR. These will be visible to anyone with administrator access. If you do now want the letters to be viewed, you can change their access to Restricted Administrator here. Child support customers 4.5.1 Background Many child support customers have complex needs that require additional support and reassurance from Inland Revenue. These customers likely have other tax types and social policy products (eg Income tax, WfF, PPL, SL) and as frequent users of myIR, will be highly impacted by the V12 changes in addition to the child support legislative changes. The following gives a high-level overview of these customers: • There are 319,000 total child support customers – 156,000 liable parents and 163,000 receiving carers. • Some customers are both liable parents and receiving carers. • There is a mix of formula and voluntary agreements in place. Liable parents pay IR manually or via employer deductions. • The primary communication channels for these customers when communicating about child support has been phone and paper. With the move of child support into START, we will promote the new self-service functionality within our messaging. Liable parents: • 69.8% of child support obligations are paid on time and therefore do not incur penalties. • NZ$387 million is received from liable parents in a year – this amounts to 81.5% of the overall assessment collected. • There is currently $2.36 billion total outstanding debt. $1.8 billion is penalty debt – this accounts for 76.3% of the total debt. • There is $750 million international debt - $672 million of this relates to penalties charged. • Legislation came into effect on 1 April 2021, repealing the child support incremental penalty and simplifying write-off provisions. Note: The Families segment is planning to contact relevant child support customers to write-off historic incremental penalty debt, Page 33 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] prior to the October changes. We are looped in with this team and will provide communications advice and support where appropriate. • Of total liable parents, 48,200 are on a benefit. Receiving carers: • Approximately 37,000 new child support applications were received for the year ending June 2019. • NZ$238 million is paid to receiving carers in a year. • 55,800 receiving carers are on Sole Parent rate of benefit. 4.5.2 Communications approach Working with the Families segment, we will continue to use BAU channels already familiar to child support customers. This includes standard marketing channels such as direct marketing, web content, and digital and social media advertising. We’ll use the information we have available to create sub-segments of child support customers. This will enable us to tailor and target the appropriate messaging ensuring that the right child support customers get the right message at the right time. It will also help us make sure that those who are likely to need the most support will get it. We will combine messaging around myIR version 12 changes and child support legislative changes so these customers don’t get multiple communications. Community, advocacy and parenting specific groups will be integral in cascading information about child support changes to their members and followers. The approach for communicating with these groups is covered in the above ‘Key Influencers’ section. Overall, our messaging for child support customers will need to explain: • what the changes mean for them, what they need to do and when (reassurance is particularly key for this group). • what the concurrent myIR V12 changes will mean for them with reassuring tips on how to navigate myIR. • the value they get from the changes – our tone will need to be informative not authoritative, and we will myth-bust where appropriate. • how we’re here to help them get things right from the start. And how simplifying the child support process does that. Initial data profiling indicates the below Child Support segmentation will be relevant: • Child support sub-segments: Liable parent, paying parent or both. • Child support payment arrangement: Formula, voluntary. • Child support payment type: direct from liable parent, employer deductions. • Child support debt: primary debt, penalty debt. • Child support with other tax types: WfF, PPL, student loan. • Child support location: New Zealand, overseas. • Child support benefit: no benefit, benefit. Page 34 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] General indicators we can use to tailor messaging: • myIR status (active and used recently, active but no recent log ins, no myIR). • Contact details available (email, postal, mobile). April 2022 leg changes: t he approach for communicating legislative changes which come into effect in April 2022 is out of scope for this plan. 4.5.3 Planned activity for child support customers Phase Activity Ongoing throughout Release 2 • Support BT account management and community compliance activities. • Send monthly Transformation Newsletters to advocacy groups providing high level updates to community and advocacy groups about the changes and linking them through to the website landing page for more detail. Phase 1: Awareness • New landing page added to IR website (late July - early August). Provide information about the child support legislation changes and new myIR functionality/look-and-feel - what will impact them, why how and when. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (mid-September). Tailored for sub-segments based on the most highly impacted. Drive customers to the landing page for more detail of the changes. m yIR status will drive login/register message and level of detail about upgrade changes. • Digital and social media advertising (launched early- September). Drive customers to the landing page for more detail about the changes. Relevant targeting and tailored messaging for sub-segments. Change messages split and served in biteable chunks ie child support account now available in myIR, we’re simplifying child support. • Work closely with the media team as there is likely to be some media interest in the changes, particularly the move to compulsory employer deductions. This could include proactive media and will require the development of reactive Q+As. Phase 2: Understanding • Updates to the landing page (late September/early October). Update landing page to include additional pre-cutover info. Reiterate the key changes (legislative and myIR) and include any help/how to info. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (mid-October). Continue to drive customers to the landing page for more detail about the changes. Signal cutover info and dates. Identify customers who didn’t open the first round of emails or whose email bounced. Resend emails or send letters to make sure they’re aware of the changes. Identify specific reasons Page 35 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Phase Activity customers contacted IR from first round of activity and updates messaging to prevent contacts. • Digital and social media advertising (continuing to run throughout October). Continue to drive customers to the landing page for more detail about the changes. Continue with relevant targeting and tailored messaging for sub-segments. Signal cutover information and dates. • Factsheets on the key changes. • Continue to work closely with the media team. Phase 3: Support • Updates to the landing page (late October/early November and live once system successfully upgraded). Update landing page to include ‘changes are here’ messaging after cutover weekend. Reiterate what the changes are and encourage myIR self-service. • Direct marketing including emails and letters (mid-November). Remind customers of the changes that will be occurring/have occurred. Continue to drive customers to the landing page for more detail about the changes. Identify customers who didn’t open the first two rounds of emails or whose email bounced. Resend emails or send letters to make sure they’re aware of the changes. • Digital and social media advertising (continuing to run throughout November). Continue to drive customers to the landing page for more detail about the changes. Continue with relevant targeting and tailored messaging for sub-segments. Update messaging to ‘changes are here’ after cutover weekend. • Continue to work closely with the media team. • Contextual guidance on the web. Depending on need, as identified during customer testing, if the contextual guidance approach is approved, we will provide and promote these guidance assets to our child support customers. 4.5.4 Key messages • We’re adding a new child support section to myIR which will be available from October 2021. You may also notice that myIR looks a little different. • You’ll be able to update your details and manage your child support account online, including your contact details, bank account details and any changes to your circumstances. • You will also be able to register for or cancel child support and process administrative review applications and objections in myIR. These changes minimise the number of paper forms you’ll need to complete for us in the future. Page 36 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • We’ll be able to pre-populate information we already have on hand for you such as contact and bank account details. • Currently child support payments (which are received on the 20 th of the month) must be paid to you by the 7 th of every month. Improvements to our systems will mean that child support payments will be passed on more quickly so you may receive your payments earlier. • Changes to child support legislation aim to improve fairness, simplify aspects of child support and deliver on Government goals to improve the wellbeing of children. Key changes coming into effect in October include: o changes to late payment penalty charges. This includes a grace period during which penalties won’t be charged to newly liable (or re-joining) parents and increasing the timeframe before charging the second stage of late payment penalties to 28 days after the due date. o changes to some key definitions (ie qualifying age criteria, at which children can be considered financially independent will change to 16 years of age, and the maximum age a child qualifies for child support will change to cease the day before their 19 th birthday). o the introduction of compulsory employer deductions for newly liable parents. o new time constraints for backdating child support assessments. o exemptions for:  hospital patients  those suffering with long term injury or illness  overseas prisoners. • Changes which came into effect on 1 April 2021 include the removal of incremental penalties and the simplification of penalty write-offs. • These changes all aim to help you get things right from the start. • Go to our website for more information. • We’ll be in touch soon with more details. Individuals and families 4.6.1 Background The Individuals and Families group includes customers of a number of products eg Income tax, Student Loans, KiwiSaver, Working for Families, Paid Parental Leave and Child Support. As Child Support customers will be impacted both by legislative changes and the move into myIR as well as the overall myIR V12 upgrade, we have separated out our approach for them as an audience. Our approach for the rest of the Individuals and Families groups focuses on the move to myIR V12. Our Individual and Families customers need an educative and supportive approach to encourage greater interaction with myIR. Families customers in particular drive a large portion of inbound contact on our phone lines due to the complexity of their situations and for some, Page 37 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] low trust in myIR. Providing reassurance at all contact points, whether it’s in myIR or in our supporting communications, will be important for this group. The following gives a high-level overview of these customers: Individual customers: • 1.45 million customers in this group. • Individuals with 1-2 accounts. • Individuals with accounts such as Income tax and KiwiSaver. • Low frequency use of myIR – one to ten times per year. • Generally low confidence in using myIR. • Compliance attitude is reactive. Families customers: • 1.26 million customers in this group. • Families customers can concurrently be Individuals customers. • Individuals with social policy accounts such as Working for Families, Child Support or Student Loan. • Use myIR a few times a month. • Generally low confidence in using myIR. • Compliance attitude is reactive. Tax agents: • Tax agents will be acting on behalf of some customers and will need to receive communications about the changes on behalf of their clients. This will be taken into account as part of our segmentation and targeting approach. Student loan credit and debit card transaction fee: The credit and debit card transaction fee of 1.42% which has previously been waived for overseas customers will begin to be passed on to student loan and child support customers using overseas bank cards once we’ve gone live in October. This is because there are now more (and better) payment channels available to our customers. The convenience fee will be included in our messages about the variety of payment options they can use. It will be included in our web content, child support direct marketing, the bi-annual student loan campaign which takes place in September, and our BT communications channels to community organisations such as webinars and newsletters. 4.6.2 Communications approach We’ll use the information we have available to create sub-segments of Individuals and Families customers. This will enable us to tailor and target the appropriate messaging ensuring that the right Individuals and Families customers get the right message at the right time. It will also enable us to make sure that the those who are likely to need the most support (ie complex Families customers) will get it. Our messaging for these customers will need to focus on: Page 38 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • creating awareness that things will look different in myIR and being clear about when the changes will occur • providing guidance on what they might need to do differently once version 12 changes are live • directing customers to web content where they can find more detailed/step-by-step information about the changes that affect them and how-to self-service • providing them with top tips on how to navigate and get the most out of myIR, and • be ing clear about when cutover will occur and what they need to do before then to be ready. Initial data profiling indicates the below segmentation will be relevant: • Individuals sub-segments: Income tax, Student Loan etc, or a mix. • Families sub segments: Working for Families, Child Support, Paid Parental Leave etc, or a mix. General indicators we can use to tailor messaging: • Linked to a tax agent or no tax agent. • Frequency myIR login: ie 1-2 times per year, 3-12 times per year, 13-36 logins per year, 37+ logins per year. • Confidence in using myIR: low, medium, high. • Compliance attitude: proactive, reactive. • Contact details available (email, postal, mobile). • Nominated persons (NOP) or alternative contact persons (ACP). 4.6.3 Planned activities for individuals and families Phase Activity Ongoing throughout Release 2 • Send monthly Transformation Newsletters to community organisations / advocacy groups for changes that impact individuals and families. • Support BT account management and community compliance activities for advocacy groups that reach individuals and families.

Depending on need, as identified during customer testing, if the contextual guidance Page 40 of 54 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Phase Activity approach is approved, we will provide and promote these guidance assets to our individuals and families customers. 4.6.4 Key messages • From October you’ll notice some changes to myIR. The new layout will make it easier for you to see important information and there will be more functionality for certain tasks. • You’ll be able to use myIR across different devices – whether you’re using a phone, tablet or desktop, myIR will be presented in a way that adapts to your screen size. We will emphasise this enhancement to those who currently log on to myIR using mobile devices. • The new functionality will allow you to access most of the actions you need to perform either from the homepage or once you’ve clicked into a product account panel ie Income tax. • The current account (product) tiles will become account panels and you’ll be able to scroll down through these with useful information about your accounts such as any ‘due now’ balances and relevant quick links to “make a payment” or “file a return”. This will make it easier for you to focus on the most relevant and important information and will more clearly highlight what actions we want you to take, when and how. • A new ‘Action’ centre on the myIR homepage will allow you to access all your alerts, separated out by account type and due date. You’ll have the ability to dismiss alerts if you’d like to. • These changes will make navigating myIR simpler and easier. The new functionality will provide you with more reassurance about what actions we want you to take and when, helping you get it right from the start. • Go to our website for more information. • We’ll be in touch soon with more details.

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] R3 Customer-centric development practices TEWC Briefing Pack June 2019 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Introduction Jun 2019 2 Purpose of this paper oIn the R3 release significant change was driven into both myIRand www.ird. Where applicable, customer- centric design practices were used in the development of both these channels in order to ensure that change was aligned with customer requirements and delivered on target customer outcomes. oThis paper gives an overviewof the customer engagement and customer-centric practices used with particular focus on the design and testing of myIRand www.ird. It is intended to inform the TEWC of the scope of this work, the approach used in R3 and the benefits of the work done in this respect. For myIRthere is also a description of how these practices will be modified and improved in R4. oPlease note that extensivecustomer engagement and customer-facing testing is also used in the development of IR’s gateway and integration services. These are not covered in this brief. Contents of the briefing oThere are two sections in this paper: 1.Customer-centric design and testing practices in myIR 2.Customer-centric design and testing practices in www.ird \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Summary of customer-centric practices Customer engagement in development and testing of myIRand www.ird The purposeof customer engagement in the design and testing of myIRand www.ird is to ensure that the solutions meets customers’ needs and support positive customer outcomes. For Release 3 a variety of practices were used across the development lifecycles of both these solutions. For myIRthe R3 approach is an evolution of previous testing practice based on lessons learned from R1 and R2. Customer Design Validation (CDV) has been used as a vehicle for gathering customer feedback on both design and as-built solutions in their formative stages. Customer Interaction Testing (CIT) is run in parallel with BST and allows real customers to engage with the as-built solution with their own personal converted data set. CIT gives customers online access to the new solution and their own data from locations of their choice. Jun 2019 3 For www.ird the customer-centric design approach uses low-fidelity guerilla testing to confirm key aspects of the design and interaction model. This is followed by more rigorous use of working prototypes, usability testing and interaction testing in order to validate the design. The final step in the approach is the use of Betalaunches to gather customer feedback at scale prior to go-live. myIR www.ird \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] myIRCustomer Design Validation Jun 2019 4 Layout, flow, messaging, terminology, iconography, consistency, calls to action, task completion, confirmation, clarifications and help texts Individuals (92) Non-individuals (72) Tax preparers (28) 600+ Recommendations Solution improvements Design Library enhancements + \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] myIRCustomer Interaction Testing (CIT) Jun 2019 5 What has been done For selected scope items we prepared a test environment using customers’ data and formulated a series of real world tests for them to complete without assistance. Candidate customers are selected using historical usage data and relevant customer attributes. Surveys are sent to candidate customers offering them the chance to participate. If they agree and enrol they can log-into myIRand access a pre-release version of myIRwith their own converted data set. The online surveys used to gather feedback are completed once customers have attempted to solve the tasks assigned to them. Overall, CIT showed the final build performing significantly better than when tested with customers during Customer Design Validation. CIT has provided a completely different perspective to facilitated customer testing, in general providing constructive feedback and/or helpful observations for future consideration. Testing at scale has also revealed significant enhancements that were previously undetected by small scale and/or structured testing.

External engagement with customers to understand their needs that we have to solve for is mirrored by internal engagement models ensuring we havethe required coverage of content areas. The design intent is that content is presented to provide a consistent and seamless customer experience, across any device, applying a common style and voice. A non-hierarchical relationship between content offers flexibility to how that content is presented – situation, task, role or topic. Navigational support is intended to direct customers to core areas that step them through their task or explainsthe topic. Customer engagement is critical throughout the development process in order to work out what content is needed and how it should best be formulated and structured to meet the design intent. In the discovery phase primary research is used to feed discovery session aimed at understanding customer’s needs and IR’s requirements to inform. Customers are used to validate the situations, tasks, topics and roles that the content is tailored to support. Selected aspects of the design are validated using guerrilla testing which provides rapid feedback on functional features using low-fidelity prototypes. Wireframes and working prototypes are used to catalyse the design and these too are tested with customers in order to get feedback on whether or not the solution is capable of satisfying their needs. Finally beta sites themselves give an opportunity of testing production ready design and content with customers.

Cut your excuses and sort your tax
==================================

**08 April 2024**

In a last chance warning to the construction sector, Inland Revenue is telling businesses and sole traders to do the right thing and get on top of their tax obligations.  
  
Inland Revenue’s Richard Philp says if people do the right thing, Inland Revenue will help them. If they don’t, Inland Revenue will find them and start follow-up action.  
  
“Most people and businesses in New Zealand pay tax in full and on time but there is a core group who don’t.   
  
“We’re not blind to the fact that businesses in the construction sector have struggled with increases in the cost and availability of materials, and labour shortages over the last few years. But we also know that while some are struggling just to keep up with the everyday grind, others are actively avoiding their tax obligations.”  
  
Tax debt is high in the construction sector and our data shows that under-declaring income, often via cash jobs, is commonplace.   
  
“Each year across all sectors, we get nearly 7,000 anonymous tip-offs about cash jobs and the like. Construction is the industry most often anonymously reported to Inland Revenue. That shows a level of concern by New Zealanders and their belief that paying the correct amount of tax is the right thing to do.  
  
Inland Revenue took a ‘softly, softly’ approach across the board during the pandemic years but that’s now changed. We ran a campaign last year to help construction business do the right thing and now we’re taking an even firmer approach.  
  
“The message is cut the excuses, ask us for help if you need it, and don’t stick your head in the sand or you could find yourself talking to someone from our audit team, or worse still, staring down a prison sentence as several people in other sectors have this year.   
  
“Now is the last chance for people working in construction to sort their tax affairs and avoid finding themselves before the courts.  
  
“In a couple of months, we will send emails and letters to 40,000 construction customers with outstanding debt, overdue tax returns, or both. We’ll then text about 2,500 of those customers asking if they would like support to get their outstanding tax sorted. Those who reply “yes” will be contacted via phone by a dedicated team of compliance officers.  
  
“Our compliance officers will also be doing site visits in high construction areas in key locations across New Zealand. Our audit team will also be looking to select a number of customers to follow up and investigate.  
  
“Do the right thing and get your outstanding debt and returns sorted now.”
