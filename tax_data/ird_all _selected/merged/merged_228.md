The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT (FICA) – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) LIABILITY PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 01/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CI 1(e), CI 1(g) and CI 1(h). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the deduction of FICA contributions and the paying of these along with the employer contribution, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, by any New Zealand resident employer who is required to do so due to employing a citizen or citizens of the United States of America. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Moneys paid to FICA are not subject to FBT under section CI 1(g), as the contributions are not made to a “superannuation scheme” as defined in section OB 1. •Moneys paid to FICA are not subject to FBT under section CI 1(h), as no benefit is received by the employee in the quarter or income year within the meaning of the FBT rules. •Moneys paid to FICA are not subject to FBT under section CI 1(e), as the FICA scheme has not been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section CB 5, and FICA is not a “sick, accident or death benefit fund” as defined in section CB 5(2). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of May 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 5 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/05 and where the superannuation scheme is a trust, any reference in this Act to a superannuation scheme includes a reference to the trustees of that scheme: Application of the legislation The substantive issue is whether the employer is required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any part of the contributions made to the FICA scheme. The employee contribution is required to be withheld from the employee’s gross income by the employer and is therefore not considered to be a fringe benefit provided by the employer, as it is expenditure on account of the employee. The employer contribution is required to be paid over and above the employee’s gross salary or wages. An issue arises as to whether FBT applies to the employer contribution, as this is a payment by an employer in relation to an employee. Section CI 1(g) Section CI 1(g) concerns whether contributions are made to a “superannuation scheme”, as defined in section OB 1, and therefore attract FBT. Under subsection (c) of that definition, “superannuation scheme” includes: any arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or any similar arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand. Therefore, to come within the “superannuation scheme” definition, an arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country or state outside New Zealand, such as FICA, must be similar to an arrangement constituted under New Zealand legislation that has the principal purpose of providing retirement benefits. Two basic or generic types of employee superannuation schemes exist: defined contribution schemes and defined benefit schemes. A defined contribution scheme is one where contributions are defined in advance, usually as a fixed percentage of an employee’s salary, and benefits are determined by the amount of accumulated contributions plus income earned on those contributions. In such schemes the principle of allocated funding is employed, where contributions are invested as a common fund, but separate accounts are opened in respect of each member. Given that there is no beneficial entitlement to any particular amount that has been contributed to the FICA scheme (as the FICA scheme pays a statutorily fixed benefit on the basis of eventual eligibility as opposed to contributions made), it is considered that the FICA is not a sufficiently similar arrangement to a defined contribution scheme. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/05 (“the Ruling”). Background If a United States Citizen is employed in New Zealand, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) of the United States of America, employers and employees may be required to contribute a stated percentage of taxable wages paid to the FICA scheme. The employee portion of the FICA contribution must be withheld and paid from each payment of taxable wages, and in addition the employer must pay the employer portion. The FICA establishes two funds. The first is old age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI). The second is hospital insurance (HI). The current rate of contribution to the FICA scheme is 7.65%, made up of 6.2% for OASDI and 1.45% for the HI portion. This OASDI/HI rate of 7.65% is imposed on both the employer and the employee, so the employer contribution together with the employee’s withheld amount result in a combined rate of 15.3%. Legislation The relevant meaning of “fringe benefit” is defined in section CI 1 as follows: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of – ... (e)In relation to an employer of an employee, any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund which has been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of CB 5: ... (g)Any contribution in relation to an employer of an employee, to any superannuation scheme: (h)Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, - The relevant meaning of “superannuation scheme” is defined in section OB 1 as follows: “Superannuation scheme” means- ... (c)Any arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or any similar arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand;– Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 6 A defined benefit scheme is one that provides benefits based on a predetermined formula, usually relating the benefit level to the number of years of service and, in some cases, the average or recent levels of pay. Such schemes employ unallocated funding, and the employer contribution rate varies in order to meet the cost of providing the defined benefit. While FICA may prima facie appear similar to such a scheme in that it also employs unallocated funding and members contribute a fixed percentage of salary, it is considered the FICA is not sufficiently similar to a generic defined benefit scheme, as the employer’s contribution and employee’s contribution are matched and the rate is contained in statute. This statutorily imposed rate is fixed by the Federal Government of the United States, is involuntary, and an employer who fails to contribute the full amount as set down in statute may be liable for civil or criminal penalties. It is therefore considered that FICA is not a sufficiently similar arrangement to either of these generic schemes (constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand principally for providing retirement benefits) to be regarded as a superannuation scheme as defined in section OB 1. It is further concluded that the FICA is more similar to the New Zealand Social Security Act 1964, which is explicitly excluded from the definition of “superannuation scheme” as (on the words of the section) are similar arrangements constituted under the legislation of another country. Both schemes are tax funded and are the main government-provided retirement benefit schemes in the respective countries. In addition, both schemes form the basis of the social security systems in the respective countries, providing additional benefits such as those for sickness and disability. This conclusion takes FICA outside the definition of “superannuation scheme”, so contributions to the FICA are not caught by section CI 1(h) as being liable to FBT. Furthermore, contributions to FICA are more like a tax than a contribution to any superannuation scheme, as supported by the words of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act referring to the contributions as an “excise tax” (section 3111(a) and 3111(b)) and the penalties payable for non-payment of contributions that are the same as those for non-payment of federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code. This view is also supported by an Australian decision, Case 20 CTBR (NS) Vol. 7, 91 that by a majority held employee contributions under the FICA to be in the nature of an income tax, implying that the compulsory employer contribution is likewise more in the nature of a tax. Section CI 1(h) Section CI 1(h) includes as a fringe benefit “any benefit of any other kind whatever”. In addition, a fringe benefit under section CI 1(h) must be a benefit that is: used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee... and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee. The Commissioner considers that the withholding of amounts from employees’ wages or salaries provides no benefit. As to the employer’s contribution, it is considered that in the absence of a beneficial entitlement to a matched contractual amount, no benefit is provided either. It cannot be said that the employee receives a benefit at the point in time the employer makes a contribution to FICA, because it is a compulsory tax, goes into the Federal Government tax pool, and no beneficial sum is “belonging” to the employee. In addition, any eventual benefits from the FICA scheme do not satisfy the combination of requirements in section CI 1(h) to attract FBT liability. It is a contingency whether the taxpayer ever receives any payment back from the Federal Government, as any benefit received depends on an individual meeting the eligibility requirements (entitlement to the old age benefit is based on reaching the age of 62 and being fully insured). If an individual does receive a payment under the FICA scheme (paid as a monthly benefit), the person does so because of his or her United States citizenship and meeting the eligibility criteria etc. The person receives the government mandated amount, as opposed to a sum based on actual contributions made to the scheme. So whilst eligibility in part is due to previous contributions made to FICA (and some of these are made by the employer), and this may be considered, “indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee”, if these words are of the widest import, overall, it is considered the nexus or connection between any eventual benefit and the employment of the employee is too remote (especially given that the only nexus is to eligibility at all, and not in any way connected to the quantum of any eventual benefit received). Principally, the reason the benefit is received by the employee is not by virtue of the employee’s employment, but because the employee is a United States citizen. Contributions to the scheme are not made voluntarily, but are compulsorily imposed by the Federal Government of the United States, and are not part of any employment contract or remuneration package. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 7 Any amounts received by a United States citizen from FICA will be received from the Federal Government and not in the course of, or by virtue of, the employment relationship. Such a conclusion is consistent with the outcome of Constable v FC of T (1952) 86 CLR 402, where the High Court of Australia concluded that Constable only became entitled to payments under his scheme as a result of contingencies that had become absolute in the year in question, but that such an event did not give rise to an “allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit \[...\]” to the employee “in respect of, or for or in relation” to his employment. Accordingly, no benefit is “received by the employee in the quarter or income year” when the employee is being paid, and no sufficient nexus exists between the employer’s requirement to pay funds to the Federal Government of the United States and the ultimate benefit the employee may eventually receive from the government at a later date, if eligible under statute. Section CI 1(e) Section CI 1(e) includes as a fringe benefit: In relation to an employer of an employee, any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund which has been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section CB 5: The Commissioner has not approved the FICA scheme for the purposes of section CB 5. The term “sick, accident, or death benefit fund” is not defined for the purpose of section CI 1(e), but is defined in section CB 5(2) for the purpose of that section. Section CI (1)(e) and section CB 5(2) are interlinked, as section CI (1)(e) requires that a “sick, accident or death benefit fund” be approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section CB 5. To be approved under section CB 5 such a fund must satisfy the section CB 5(2) definition. The FICA scheme is not a “sick, accident, or death benefit fund” as that term is defined in section CB 5(2), as the FICA scheme is not established for the “benefit of the employees of any employer” as required by that definition. FICA is the funding scheme for the provision of United States social security benefits and there is no sufficient nexus between the employer’s requirement to pay funds to FICA and any benefit the employee may eventually receive from the government at a later date, if eligible under statute. Accordingly, any payments made to the FICA scheme are not considered to be subject to fringe benefit tax under section CI (1)(e).

The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to income derived by such a Maori Trust Board during income years falling within the period 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2006 (inclusive). This Ruling is signed by me on the 9 th day of July 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 97/8 which was published in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). BR Pub 97/8 applied up until 31 March 2001. Therefore this new ruling still relates to the charitable status of trusts established by Maori Trust Boards pursuant to the execution of a declaration of trust, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. However, it should be noted that the reissue of BR Pub 97/8 is separate from the government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies (Tax and Charities) which was released for public consultation on 14 June 2001, for comments by the end of July 2001. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This arrangement is the derivation of income by a trust established by a Maori Trust Board pursuant to the execution of a declaration of trust, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, declaring that it stands possessed of any of its property upon trust for charitable purposes. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 9 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/07 Provided that if those purposes are not limited to New Zealand the Commissioner may apportion the income in such manner as the Commissioner deems just and reasonable between those purposes within New Zealand and the like purposes out of New Zealand, and accordingly only a part of the amount may be exempt income:... Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 states: (1)Any Board may from time to time, in its discretion, execute under its seal a declaration of trust declaring that it shall stand possessed of any of its property, whether real or personal, upon trust for charitable purposes. (2)Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. (3)No declaration of trust under this section shall have any force or effect unless it has been approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Sections 24 and 24A specify the purposes for which a Maori Trust Board may apply money. Application of the Legislation Charitable purposes For a trust to be considered charitable for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, it must generally meet the common law requirements of charity. That is, a trust must be established for a “charitable purpose”, and must meet what is known as the “public benefit test”. The term “charitable purpose” is defined in the Income Tax Act, as: ...includes every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community: The Court of Appeal noted in Molloy v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,070 that the definition of charitable purpose in the Income Tax Act does not have the effect of enlarging or altering the ordinary, general law, meaning of charity. This means that it is necessary to refer to general law to determine whether any specific taxpayer, or activity, is charitable. In Commrs of IT v Pemsel \[1891\] AC 531, p.583, Lord Macnaghten determined that all charitable purposes fall within four classes of charity (known as the “Pemsel Heads”), namely: •the advancement of religion; •the relief of poverty; •the advancement of education; and •any other matter beneficial to the community. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/07 (“the Ruling”). Background Sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provide the following exemptions from income tax for income derived by a charitable trust: •Under section CB 4 (1)(c), income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution established exclusively for charitable purposes (except income to which section CB 4 (1)(e) applies). •Under section CB 4 (1)(e), income derived from a business carried on by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution established exclusively for charitable purposes. Neither exemption is available if any person is able to influence the amount of any private pecuniary benefit from the trust. The exemption under CB 4 (1)(e) only applies to the extent that the charitable purposes are limited to New Zealand. Under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, a Maori Trust Board may declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes. The income of the trust can only be applied for those purposes set out in sections 24 and 24A of that Act and which are specified in the declaration of trust. Section 24B deems the income of such a trust to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. Income tax exemption – section CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) Section CB 4 (1) provides an exemption from income tax for: ... (c)Any amount derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or derived by any society or institution established exclusively for charitable purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual, except where the income so derived is income to which paragraph (e) applies: ... (e)Any amount derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit to trustees in trust for charitable purposes within New Zealand, or derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit of any society or institution established exclusively for such purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 10 In addition to falling within one of the “Pemsel Heads”, with the exception of a trust for the relief of poverty, to be charitable in law a trust must be established for the benefit of the community or a sufficiently important class of the community, rather than for the benefit of private individuals. This requirement, which is in addition to the objects of the charity falling within one of the four heads listed above, is known as the public benefit test. The public benefit test has been endorsed and further developed by a large body of case law, including Verge v Somerville \[1924\] All ER 121, Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Company Limited \[1951\] 1 All ER 31, Davies v Perpetual Trustee Co. (Ltd.) \[1959\] 2 All ER 128 and New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 148. Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 was inserted into that Act by section 3 of the Maori Trust Boards Amendment Act 1962. Section 24B permits the establishment of charitable trusts by Maori Trust Boards, and provides a concessionary tax treatment of the income of such trusts. There are two possible interpretations of the meaning of section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act: •The first interpretation is that a declaration can only be made under section 24B(1) if the purposes of the trust are exclusively charitable, i.e. “charitable” being interpreted as the common law meaning of the term. Although section 24B(2) only requires that the income of the trust must be applied for purposes referred to in section 24 and 24A, it follows from this approach that, as the trust must be also charitable, the income can only be applied for section 24 and 24A purposes that are themselves charitable. Such income would therefore be exempt under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. •The second interpretation is that the income of a section 24B trust can be applied for any of the purposes referred to in section 24 or 24A – whether those purposes are charitable under general law or not. However, this approach proceeds upon the basis that any income derived by the trust is deemed by section 24B(2), to the extent that it is applied for purposes specified in sections 24 and/or 24A, to be income derived in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, and therefore exempt from income tax. This is irrespective of whether the purpose is a purpose that would generally be considered charitable in law. The background papers relating to the introduction of section 24B, including Hansard, indicate that the new section was intended to remedy the concern, at the time, that trusts established by Maori Trust Boards were not considered charitable in terms of both the common law and the income tax legislation. This view of the law was confirmed by the Court in Arawa Maori Trust Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1961) 10 MCD 391. In that case Donne S M ruled that a trust established by the Arawa Maori Trust Board was not charitable because: •Many of the purposes specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 were not charitable purposes under the general law; and •The trust failed the public benefit test because it was for the benefit of a group of persons determined by their bloodline, or whakapapa. The Court determined that such a group of people did not satisfy the public benefit test. Analysis The Commissioner believes the better view of the law to be that contained in the second interpretation, as set out above, and that the first interpretation was not what was intended by Parliament. As has been noted, at the time that section 24B was enacted, it was strongly arguable, taking into account the Court decision in Arawa, that a trust that benefits a specific tribe or iwi, or the members of such a tribe or iwi, cannot be charitable at common law because it will not meet the requirements of the public benefit test. Therefore, it would be arguable that any trust established under section 24B could not be charitable, irrespective of the purposes for which it was established, because Maori Trust Boards are acknowledged by the Maori Trust Boards Act to be for the benefit of iwi and hapu determined on the basis of whakapapa. This would give rise to a situation where, despite the enactment of section 24B, trusts established by Maori Trust Boards would possibly continue to be denied charitable status, and the amendment would have no effective operation. Clearly, this cannot have been the intention of Parliament. Taking this into account, and after considering the available background documents, the Minister’s statement (as recorded in Hansard) and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s practice immediately following the enactment of section 24B, the Commissioner believes that the second interpretation is the correct view of the law. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 11 Under this interpretation, section 24B(1) allows a Maori Trust Board to declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes, and authorises the Trust Board to settle some of the Trust’s assets to a charitable trust. Section 24B(2) contains two limbs. The first limb states: Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; ... The Commissioner considers that this limb limits the purposes for which the income of a charitable trust can be applied to those purposes that are referred to in sections 24 and 24A. The purposes for which the income is to be applied must be specified in the declaration of trust. As previously noted, many of the purposes referred to in sections 24 and 24A may not be charitable purposes under common law. In addition, any trust established by a Trust Board is only allowed to apply its income for the benefit of the Trust Board’s beneficiaries, which are restricted, by the Maori Trust Boards Act, to the members of specified iwi. Such a requirement could mean that a trust would fail the public benefit test applied under the common law. However, the second limb of section 24B(2) deems the income of the trust to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”. The second limb states: and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. Therefore, the effect of this section is to deem the income of the trust, even though it is established for purposes that may not be charitable in general law, to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. This means that the requirements of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, to the extent that those sections only apply to “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”, have been satisfied. It is, therefore, not necessary for such a trust to satisfy the common law requirements of “charitable purpose” and the “public benefit test”. However, it should be noted that section 24B(2) of the Maori Trust Boards Act only modifies the requirements of the Income Tax Act. It does not apply for any other purposes. Therefore, whatever may be the position of such a trust under common law and irrespective of whether the public benefit test would be failed in other contexts, the Commissioner is satisfied that in this provision Parliament intended for a trust established under section 24B to be treated as being a charitable trust for income tax purposes. The income of such a trust is therefore treated as having been derived for charitable purposes and as such is exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) or (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Nevertheless, before that exemption can be applied, the requirements of section 24B(3) must be satisfied. That section requires a declaration of trust under section 24B(1) to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before it will take effect. The Commissioner must still be satisfied that the constituting documents of the trust meet the legal requirements of a charitable trust, other than the public benefit test discussed above. Approval of charitable trust As has been outlined earlier in this commentary, section 24B(2) of the Maori Trusts Board Act 1955 modifies the general law requirements of a trust established under subsection (1) to the extent that the trust is not required to satisfy the meaning of “charitable purpose” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the public benefit test. However, before such a trust will be approved by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) as wholly exempt from tax, the trust must still meet the other criteria of a charitable trust. For example, the Commissioner must also be satisfied that the declaration of trust provides that: •the charitable activities are restricted to New Zealand; •the rules of the trust cannot be changed in order to allow the income of the trust to be applied to purposes that are not specified in sections 24 or 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act, or to otherwise affect the charitable nature of the trust; •no person is able to derive a personal pecuniary profit from the trust; •trustees are unable to materially influence their remuneration; •professional services provided by trustees to the trust are provided at commercial rates and that conflicts of interest are avoided; and •upon winding up, any remaining trust assets must be applied for charitable purposes. This is not an exhaustive list of all matters that the Commissioner will consider when deciding whether or not a trust is charitable, and therefore entitled to the tax exemptions under sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 12 When a section 24B trust has previously obtained the approval of the Commissioner, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act, that approval will continue to apply. Approval given by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) cannot be revoked. However, continued tax exemption in respect of the income of the trust is dependent on the trust continuing to apply its income for the purposes specified in the declaration. Comments on technical submissions received prior to the previous public ruling being issued When a draft public binding ruling on this subject was first made available for public comment, a number of submissions were received that disagreed with the views expressed in that draft ruling. In particular, those submissions noted that the Commissioner did not appear to have taken into account the use of a deeming provision in section 24B. That view, that the deeming provision effectively creates a charitable trust where one would not exist under general charitable law, was incorporated into the previous ruling and has been included in this ruling. A number of commentators also disagreed with the Court decision in Arawa and the general position of trusts for the benefit of iwi under the public benefit test. That issue was referred to in the commentary to the previous ruling, and is referred to in this commentary in so far as it is relevant to the issue being considered. While the Commissioner did consider the position of such trusts generally in an interpretation paper (IP3168) which went out for public consultation in January 2000 that matter has been put on hold pending the outcome of the recently released government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies. A submission was also received that argued that the Commissioner was not legally able to issue a binding ruling on the effect of a declaration made under a provision of an Act other than one of the Inland Revenue Acts. The Commissioner was, and is, of the view that he is able to issue this Ruling because it relates to the consequences of such a declaration under the income tax law and, in particular, to the application of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. In the context of the previous ruling, Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu asked for the ruling to be expanded to deal specifically with its specific circumstances. The Ngai Tahu Trust Board executed a declaration of trust pursuant to section 24B in 1975. That Trust Board was dissolved by the Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Act 1996, which also established the Runanga. All of the assets and liabilities of the former trust board were vested in the new Runanga. Section 30(1)(c) of the Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Act provides: 30. Taxes and duties—(1) For the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts (as defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994) and any other enactment that imposes or provides for the collection of any tax, levy, or other charge,— (c)Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Ngaitahu Maori Trust Board by this Act, any income derived by Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu from any property to which a declaration of trust made by the Ngaitahu Maori Trust Board under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 and dated the 24 th day of March 1975 relates shall, if applied for the purposes specified in the declaration, be deemed, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, to be income derived by Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu in trust for charitable purposes. The Commissioner remains of the view that, notwithstanding the fact that the Trust Board has been dissolved and no longer exists, section 30(1)(c) provides that any income derived from property that was subject to the original declaration, to the extent that it is applied for the purposes specified in the declaration, shall be treated for tax purposes as being derived in trust for charitable purposes. This means that the income of the trust created under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act will continue to be exempt for tax purposes. Similar provisions may apply to other section 24B trusts established by Trust Boards that have since been dissolved. Application of this Ruling Section 91DA(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires the Commissioner to state the period for which a public binding ruling applies. The Commissioner has determined that this public ruling will apply to income derived by approved trusts during income years falling within the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006, inclusive. Examples Example 1 A Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. The declaration provides that the trust will hold certain assets upon trust for charitable purposes. The declaration specifies that the income of the trust will be applied by making grants to reimburse any dental costs incurred by any of the beneficiaries, being members of the iwi. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 13 The declaration is submitted to the Commissioner who is satisfied that the purpose for which the trust’s income will be applied is a purpose specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act (section 24(2)(a)(iii) “The promotion of health ... by providing, subsidising, or making grants for medical, nursing, or dental services” ) and that there are adequate provisions in the Trust Deed to prevent the Trust’s income and assets from being used for other purposes. The Commissioner will therefore approve the declaration and the income of the trust will be exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 2 A Maori Trust makes a declaration under section 24B for the same purpose as described in Example 1. The Commissioner is satisfied that the purpose for which the Trust’s income is to be applied is a purpose that is specified in either section 24 or section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act. However, it is found that the declaration does not prohibit the trustees from materially influencing the amount of remuneration that they receive. The declaration also does not provide for the disbursement of assets, upon winding up, to other charitable entities or purposes. The Commissioner will therefore decline approval until such time as the declaration is amended in such a manner to satisfy the Commissioner’s requirements.

Units in the Trust will only be redeemed in whole and cannot be redeemed in part. Units redeemed must be cancelled. Units in the Trust will be issued on the basis that the ordering rule (subparagraph CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(B)) applies. 4The AMP Tracker Fund will make taxable distributions to the Trust from any dividends received by the AMP Tracker Fund either on receipt or quarterly depending on the size of the Trust’s investment. The Trust must either re- invest any distribution in AMP Tracker Fund units or make a distribution. The Trust will ordinarily distribute such part, as is determined by the manager, of its net income 6-monthly to unit holders and that net income will be calculated taking into account all costs, charges and expenses due. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the conditions that: (a)There is no arrangement between the Trustee and any unit holder for the redemption of units in substitution for dividends. (b)The Trust is an “unlisted trust” and a “widely held trust” in terms of the definition of those terms in section CF 3 (14). (c)The Trust will not redeem units as part of a pro rata cancellation of units. (d)The Trust will not be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The income distributed to unit holders annually will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2 (1)(i). •The entire amount paid to unit holders on the redemption of the units will be excluded from the definition of dividend by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. This Ruling expressly does not consider any potential for application of section BG 1 or section GB 1 (3). This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Currently there are six of these countries being all of those currently specified in Part A of Schedule 3 (excluding Norway). Shares will be held only where the companies are subject to tax in terms of the proviso to section CG 13(1) or are resident and subject to tax in the country in terms of section CG 15(2)(b). The trust deed does not permit Tortis-INTL to hold shares in foreign entities specified in Part B of Schedule 4. The MSCI adjusted in this way is known as the Tower Global Index. 4If any of the countries included in the Tower Global Index leave the grey list then securities held in companies resident in that country will be immediately divested. If any company in which Tortis-INTL holds shares ceases to be resident in a grey list country, then shares held in that company will be immediately divested. 5With the exception of transactions relating to the cash pool, index sampling or financial derivatives (these matters are explained below), Tortis-INTL will only enter into transactions that give effect to the investment policy to replicate the Tower Global Index. The tracking of the Tower Global Index will not involve consideration of profitability, yield, or any other return based features. The only other situations when shares will be bought and sold by Tortis-INTL is where it is necessary to fund the redemption or repurchase of units in Tortis-INTL (or restore liquidity to the cash pool to enable Tortis-INTL to fund the redemption of units) or for sampling. 6The tracking of the Tower Global Index will be undertaken by State Street Global Advisors, Australia Limited (“State Street”). 7Changes to the constituent stocks within the MSCI are made during the last week of the month unless corporate actions such as takeovers/mergers effected prior to this period require stocks to be added or removed earlier. Following adjustments to the MSCI the Tower Global Index will be adjusted in the appropriate proportion as soon as practicable. This will only require Tortis-INTL to buy and sell stocks to replicate these adjustments. No sales or purchases will be made as a result of changes in the market capitalisation of a particular stock in the MSCI arising as a consequence of actual or anticipated price fluctuations. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis-International Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b) and CF 3(1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-INTL pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 16 December 1996 and amended on 18 February 1997 and 31 July 2000 (the “trust deed”). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1Tortis-INTL is a New Zealand tax resident. The trustee of Tortis-INTL is the Public Trustee. The manager of Tortis-INTL is Tower Managed Funds Investments Limited. Tortis-INTL has been established as a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 2Tortis-INTL is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in Tortis-INTL is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in Tortis-INTL (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the fund or any particular investment of the fund. 3Tortis-INTL will act as an investment fund to hold a portfolio of shares. The composition of that portfolio will be determined as follows. Tortis-INTL will track international share markets using only the countries included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index (“MSCI”) which are also specified in Part A of Schedule 3 (known as grey list countries), and at the time of their inclusion in the grey list, the market capitalisation of MSCI companies in that Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 19 8The approach of Tortis-INTL is to replicate the Tower Global Index. Initially, due to the small size of the portfolio when it was launched, State Street used index sampling to match the Tower Global Index. The sampling process entailed investing across the countries and industries contained in the Tower Global Index on the basis of market capitalisation, based on information from a computer model. The computer model was non-discretionary and selected stocks based purely on market capitalisation and industry membership. No stock forecasting techniques were incorporated in the model. Sampling did not take into account the individual, actual historical or forecast performance of any particular company within the Tower Global Index. As Tortis-INTL grew and more units were purchased new stocks were added until the Tower Global Index was replicated. This approach was self rebalancing and did not require stocks to be bought or sold as a result of individual price changes. 9Due to the large number of companies in the Tower Global Index Tortis-INTL invests incoming funds, that are not of sufficient size to constitute effective replication of the index, in financial derivatives relating to the Tower Global Index. This is the only basis on which investments in financial derivatives occurs. As soon as sufficient funds are accumulated relevant financial derivatives are closed out and an acquisition of further shares, which replicate the Tower Global Index, is made. It is anticipated, depending on the size of the fund, that between 2% and 5% of the total fund will be invested in financial derivatives. 10Tortis-INTL permits investors to exit by redeeming units or by repurchase of units by the manager. These are the only methods of exit offered by Tortis-INTL as it is not intended to list Tortis-INTL on a stock exchange. Moneys to fund redemption come from a debt pool of approximately 5% of the fund and not, except in extraordinary circumstances, from partial realisation of the share portfolio. In the unlikely event that Tortis-INTL needs to realise part of the share portfolio to fund redemptions, that realisation would occur in accordance with the weighting of the Tower Global Index. Any sale by Tortis-INTL would be calculated at such a level as to restore liquidity to the debt pool. Tortis-INTL will only invest the debt pool in bank deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the Tower First Rate Account. 11Investors wishing to subscribe for units above a certain prescribed level may do so by transferring to Tortis-INTL an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-INTL in exchange. Equally, investors holding units in excess of a prescribed level will be able to redeem the units (both in the ordinary course of events and upon liquidation) in consideration for a transfer by Tortis-INTL to them of an appropriately weighted basket of securities, rather than by cash payment. 12Unit prices may be published in newspapers and Tortis-INTL will have an Internet site which will be used principally to publish prices at which the manager will repurchase or redeem units, and as a means for transferring units only by purchase from the manager, and redemption or repurchase by the manager. The MSCI World Index 13.The Tower Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. 14.The fundamental objective of the MSCI World Index is as follows (taken from the MSCI Methodology and Index Policy document, published by MSCI in March 1998, at page 3): MSCI Indices are constructed to provide benchmarks that accurately represent the opportunities available to the institutional investor. While an all-share-index (all listed companies at their full market cap weight) represents the theoretical opportunity set available to the global investor, this is not a fair performance benchmark in practice, since it cannot be fully replicated due to illiquidity of either shares or volume. Thus, MSCI creates indices which capture the spirit of an all-share index, but are actually subsets of shares which are truly replicable. 15.The rules for determining which companies will be included in the MSCI World Index are set out below (taken from the MSCI Methodology and Index Policy document): MSCI produces a world index which currently (31 May 2000) comprises 22 countries and over 1,300 stocks. Each country included in the MSCI World Index is represented by a separate index which forms part of the larger Index. The index for each country is referred to as a MSCI Country Index. In constructing the MSCI Country Indices MSCI uses a five-step process. MSCI Country Index Selection Criteria: 1. Define the total market. 2 . Sort the market by industry groups and target 60% for inclusion. 3 . Select stocks with good liquidity and free float. 4. Avoid cross-ownership. 5. Apply the full market capitalization weight to each stock. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 20 1.Define the total market: The initial research for the MSCI Indices covers the full breadth of each equity market in the universe. Country specialists track the evolution of both listed and unlisted shares of domestically listed companies in 51 markets that, combined, account for over 90% of the world’s total market capitalization. Based in Geneva, these teams of country specialists collect data on shares, pricing, ownership, float and liquidity for effectively all companies worldwide. Sources for this information include local stock exchanges and brokerage firms, newspapers ad company contacts. All of the companies within this research coverage are eligible for inclusion in the MSCI Indices except non- domiciled companies, investment trusts and mutual funds. 2.Sort the total market by industry groups and target 60% for inclusion: Once information on the total country market capitalization is analyzed, 60% of the capitalization of each industry group, and thus 60% of the entire market, is targeted for inclusion in each MSCI country index. This process ensures that the index reflects the industry characteristics of the overall market, and permits the construction of accurate regional and composite industry indices. With the uniform target of capturing 60% of the each country’s total market capitalization, each country carries its proportional weight in the regional and composite indices. A 60% target has been found sufficient to maintain a high level of tracking while still providing for an investable universe across all countries (the “highest common denominator” which can be captured, while still having an investable index in each country). 3.Select stocks with good liquidity and free float: A goal of the MSCI index construction process is to select the most liquid stocks within each industry group, all other things being equal, since liquidity is necessary but not the sole determinant for inclusion in the index. Liquidity is monitored by monthly average trading value over time in order to determine normal levels of volume, excluding temporary peaks and troughs. A stock’s liquidity is significant not only in absolute terms, but also relative to its market capitalization and to average liquidity for the country and the industry as a whole. Liquidity is not used as an absolute measure to select constituents because: An absolute minimum level of liquidity would be arbitrary and would have different meanings in different markets. Liquidity is partly a function of the cyclicality of markets and industries. Limiting index constituents to only the most liquid stocks would introduce a bias against those stocks and sectors that are temporarily out of favor with investors. An inflexible rule might also dictate a pattern of constituent additions and deletions that would introduce unnecessary turnover in the index. The free float (percentage of shares freely tradable) of every security in the market is monitored and an estimate is calculated, and low float may exclude a stock from consideration in the index. In the developed markets and some emerging markets, “low” float is considered under approximately 25%, as estimated by the country specialists at CIPSA in Geneva. However, in many emerging market countries, the average float is below 25%, so float is measured relative to the stock’s own industry and country. But float can be a difficult number to determine. In some markets, reliable data sources are generally not available; in other markets, information on smaller and less prominent issues can be subject to error and time lags. Additionally, government ownership and corporate share crossholdings can change over time and are not always made public. The precise definition of “float” also tends to differ depending on the data source. Thus, evaluations of float run the risk of penalizing those markets that have higher standards for company disclosure, regardless of the actual degree of availability of shares. As with liquidity, sufficient float is an important consideration, not an inflexible rule. 4.Avoid cross-ownership: Cross-ownership occurs when one company has a significant ownership stake in another company, and both are included in the index. Substantial cross-ownership can skew industry weights, distort country-level valuations (such as Price/ Earnings and Price/Book Value) and overstate a country’s true market size. An integral part of the index construction process is to identify corporate share crossholdings in order to avoid or minimize cross-ownership in the MSCI Indices. Country analysts in Geneva separate cross-ownership stakes into two categories. The first consists of stakes which are considered immaterial. In these cases, such cross-ownership does not represent something significant in terms of having distortionary effects on the index even if both companies are included. The second category is stakes which could materially distort an industry- or country-level index by significantly overstating the index’s market capitalization if both companies are included. Other ownership stakes (such as government, family, other institutional holdings) are also included in the estimated free float. 5.Apply the full market capitalization weight to each stock: All standard MSCI indices are weighted by each company’s full market capitalization (both listed and unlisted shares). This approach has the advantage of objectivity—the number of shares outstanding is consistently defined for companies around the world and is a readily obtainable figure. This approach also minimizes turnover. MSCI does not adjust share weights for either free float or cross- holdings. The most serious consequence of float limitations is illiquidity, which can be monitored objectively. Full market capitalization weighting is favored to float-weighting schemes for both theoretical and practical reasons: •It is impossible to judge whether a position which is currently in firm hands might be available in the future. •The quality and timeliness of information on float varies from market to market. Adjustments penalize those markets with the highest standards of company information disclosure. •Float adjustments incur index turnover as the float of a company changes. However, the precision of a float-adjusted index may not yield a more “investable” index. For instance, when the float of a stock increases from 55% to 60%, it may not be necessarily 5% more investable on a practical basis. In fact, it was probably fully replicable at a full market cap weight and the increase in turnover did not result in a “better” index, only an increase in transaction costs. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 21 •Float adjustments on a country level may not result in materially different country weights from market capitalization weights. \[Weighting stocks at their full market capitalisation, as described below in the fifth selection criterion, is slowly being phased out by MSCI: first by its extension of the partial inclusion policy to all new additions to its indices (as of 31 July 2000) and second, by the change in its index construction methodology to a free float-adjustment methodology. However, currently stocks which were already part of the index as at 31 July 2000 are included at their full market capitalisation.\] Partial Inclusion Policy Since the normal MSCI index policy is to include index constituents at 100% of market capitalization, large issues with low float—a characteristic of many privatizations—pose a dilemma for index construction. Including such companies at full market cap weight can overwhelm an index and overstate the true size of market opportunities; yet excluding them also results in an incomplete picture of the market. A company is included or excluded on a case-by-case basis, where the contributing factors include the expected change in float (especially for first-time government privatizations), stability of the liquidity and importance of the company in its local economy. A growing number of very sizable companies have been or will be brought to market with modest tranches initially made available to the public. By virtue of their size and visibility, these companies are obvious candidates for inclusion in a portfolio. To reflect this new market trend, MSCI index construction rules do allow for the possibility of including a company at a portion of its total market capitalization. This occurs only in exceptional cases when very large companies come to market with very modest initial float. In July 31 2000 the policy on partial inclusions was amended. MSCI has extended the application of its policy on partial inclusion of companies to all new additions to the MSCI indices. This amendment will simplify the partial inclusion policy, providing consistent treatment for all new index additions. Previously, the policy was targeted only at new constituents with very large market capitalizations. This amendment does not affect existing constituents in the MSCI indices. Following this amendment, all companies with a float below 40%, that are to be added to the MSCI Standard or Extended indices, regardless of size, will be included at a fraction of their total market capitalization using a Market Cap Factor (MCF). The MCF will be determined using MSCI’s current schedule as shown below: % Float equal1 01 52 02 53 03 54 0 or exceeding\* % Market Cap2 03 04 05 06 0 8 0 100 Factor (MCF) \* Over-allotment option is not included in the case of IPOs, privatizations and similar public offerings. Structural Changes In changing the constituents of the MSCI Indices, accurate representation is balanced with minimizing turnover. An index must represent the current state of an evolving marketplace while at the same time minimizing turnover, which is costly as well as inconvenient for investment managers. Restructuring an index involves a balancing of constituent additions and deletions. The primary concern when considering additions and deletions is the continuity of the indices. Of secondary concern are the turnover costs associated with these changes. There are two broad categories of changes to the MSCI Indices: structural changes and market-driven changes. Structural changes reflect the evolution of a market due, for example, to a change in industry composition or regulations. Industry restructurings generally take place every 18 to 24 months for any given country. However, the structural change to the country index may occur on only four dates throughout the year: as of the close of the last business day of February, May, August and November. MSCI index additions and deletions are announced two weeks in advance. There are absolute firewalls on any price-sensitive decision until there is a public announcement. These changes are communicated to subscribers both electronically and by fax. They are simultaneously posted on public Reuters pages (starting on MSCIA) and public Bloomberg pages (MSCN). The Reuters and Bloomberg MSCI pages are updated by Capital International Perspective, S.A. in Geneva. The pages include the security names, the action to be taken and, when necessary, the context of the change. A more detailed announcement service is available for a fee (and provides the weightings, shares outstanding, security identifiers and industry classification). During the examination of each country index, the market cap and business function coverage of each industry group is measured against the underlying market. The investability (free float, cross-ownership, long- and short-term trading volume and turnover) of each constituent is also monitored. In the event that an industry is over- or under-covered, or that there are stocks in the index which are no longer investable (here both long-term and short-term liquidity is examined), or a large privatization has altered the capitalization of the market, a structural change may be necessary. The MSCI indices reflect the opportunity set to the global investor on an ongoing basis—and should thus mirror the fundamental changes in the market’s structure, and correspond to the situation of the average institutional investor. These structural changes are designed and timed to minimize turnover to the indices. If possible, several unrelated changes to a country index are grouped together, minimizing disruption. Structural Change Additions: As markets grow because of privatizations, investor interest, or the relaxation of regulations, index additions (with or without corresponding deletions) may be needed to bring industry representations up to the 60% target. Companies are considered not only with respect to their broad industry, but also with respect to their sub- sector, in order to represent if possible a broader range of economic activity. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 22 Structural Change Deletions: The indices must represent the full-investment cycle, including bear as well as bull markets. Out-of-favor stocks may exhibit declining price, market capitalization, and/or liquidity, and yet continue to be good representatives of their industry. Deleting constituents because their liquidity has declined introduces a bias against out-of-favor companies or industries, especially those in the trough of a business cycle. For this reason, low liquidity is never an automatic trigger for deleting a company from the index. Companies may be deleted because they have diversified away from their industry classification, because the industry has evolved in a different direction from the company’s thrust, or because a better industry representative exists (either a new issue or an existing company). In addition, in order not to exceed the 60% target coverage of industries and countries, adding new index companies may entail corresponding deletions. Market-driven Changes Market-driven changes consist of new issues, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and other similar corporate events. These changes are announced and implemented as they occur. Additions - New Issues: New issues may not be automatically eligible for immediate inclusion in the MSCI Indices. Many factors must be considered, such as market capitalization, float and liquidity. Some new issues undergo a seasoning period of six to twelve months between index restructurings until a trading pattern and volume are established. After that time, they are eligible for inclusion, subject to the standard selection criteria discussed. However, sometimes a new issue, usually a privatization, comes to market and substantially changes the country’s industry profile. In this case, where even temporarily excluding it would distort the characteristics of the market, it may be immediately included in the MSCI Indices. An example is YPF, Argentina’s privatized oil company, which at USD 3.04 billion is Latin America’s largest privatization to date. In these cases, however, an announcement is made in the first few days of official trading for the security, since the country specialists do not want to influence the primary placement of the issue. In other cases, a large new issue may not be included even in the normal process of restructuring, despite substantial size and liquidity. The primary reasons for non-inclusion of a large new issue are as follows: •A large stock, if it has low float and is also illiquid, can overwhelm an index and over-represent the true opportunities in the market. •The index may be at the limit of industry representation—including the new issue would seriously over-weight an industry in the index. •In some cases, it is necessary to defer inclusion of a new issue until the next opportunity for index restructuring. Deletions - Suspended Companies: In the case of suspension for bankruptcy or near bankruptcy, the suspended company is deleted at the smallest price (unit or fraction of the currency) at which a security could have traded in a given market. More complex are the cases where the suspension is due to a major restructuring, which results in the company being ineligible (at least for an important period of time) for normal listing and trading on the stock exchange. The MSCI policy is to remove these companies from the index only after there is little likelihood the company will return to normal trading. In this situation, the key issue is determining the price at which the company can be removed from the index. Unofficial market prices may be used as a base to determine that exit price. In exceptional circumstances, average indicative prices from reliable sources may be used. Mergers & Acquisitions: Any case of mergers and acquisitions, or capital restructuring, which can affect a company within the MSCI universe is monitored. Depending on whether the active companies are, or are not, constituents of the MSCI Indices, a number of factors must be considered. If either the acquiring or the acquired firm is a constituent of the index, the first consideration is the impact of the acquisition on the index. The second consideration involves structural changes to the index. When a non-constituent company acquires a constituent company, either the acquiring company can replace the constituent company in the index, or another company altogether may be chosen as a better representative of the industry. If two medium-sized, non-constituent companies merge, the merged company may also be considered for inclusion in the indices. However, this change would occur only through a structural review. Spin-Offs: A spin-off is the distribution to existing shareholders of a part of the company’s business through the issuance of shares in the newly-established company. The decision to include the newly- established company in the index is based on several factors including estimated market value, market capitalization, and float. The market value of the spin- off is estimated through a consensus of industry analysts, grey market prices, and statistics on revenues and earnings. Performance of stocks The methodology for determining which stocks are to be included in the relevant country indices does not involve any exercise of predicting whether a company is likely to be particularly profitable or unprofitable or whether the company’s securities are likely to increase in value or decrease in value. Performance is not an issue. MSCI is solely focused on ensuring that a consistent methodology is used in preparing the indices, which maximises the utility of the indices as a recognised world-wide benchmark of stock market movement and avoids unnecessary turnover of index stocks. Upcoming MSCI Changes 16.In addition to the process stated above, there are also upcoming changes which alter the way in which the MSCI World Index will select its constituent company securities. The MSCI will adjust all its equity indices for free float and increase the target market representation of its Standard Index series from 60% to 85%. The combined changes will be implemented in two separate phases. The first phase will be implemented as of the close of 30 November 2001 and the second phase will be implemented as of Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 23 the close of 31 May 2002. MSCI plans to publish index constituents and their Inclusion Factors on or before 30 June 2001, and will begin calculating a provisional index series based on the enhanced methodology shortly thereafter. 17.The change in index construction methodology to a “free float-adjustment” methodology is described in the MSCI Announcement, dated 10 December 2000 (“the Announcement”), as follows: MSCI calculates the free float of an equity security as its total number of shares outstanding less shareholdings classified as strategic and shares otherwise restricted from trading by international investors. Examples of shares excluded from free float are stakes held by governments, corporations, controlling shareholders and their families, the company’s management, and shares subject to foreign ownership restrictions. Under this enhanced index construction methodology, MSCI will free float-adjust constituent weights using an adjustment factor, which will be referred to as the Inclusion Factor. This Inclusion Factor is equal to a constituent’s estimated free float rounded-up to the closest 5%. For example, a constituent with an estimated free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its total market capitalization, while a constituent with an estimated free float of 78.6%, will be included in the index with an Inclusion Factor of 0.80. Where the foreign ownership limit is more restrictive than the free float, and if there are no foreign strategic investors, a constituent’s Inclusion Factor will be equal to its exact foreign ownership limit, rounded to the nearest percentage point. Securities with a free float below 15% will not typically be eligible for inclusion in the MSCI equity indices. However, in exceptional cases where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry, the security may be included in the MSCI indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float rounded to the closest percentage point. For example, a very large company with an estimated free float of 11.4%, if included in the index, would be included with an Inclusion Factor of 0.11. In order to account for other types of restrictions on foreign equity investment, such as the investor qualification and quota approval system prevailing today in Taiwan, the enhanced MSCI methodology provides for an additional investability factor, referred to as the Limited Investability Factor. The application of this Limited Investability Factor would permit a more accurate comparison of markets with more complex and subtle restrictions to the investment process with markets where investment limitations can be appropriately reflected in security specific Inclusion Factors. MSCI will review constituents’ Inclusion Factors at the time of regular country index rebalancings. In addition, MSCI will allow for changes in a security’s Inclusion Factor in response to significant market- driven corporate events, as the events become effective. 18.To determine whether a shareholding is strategic or non-strategic, the following guidelines are used: Shareholding classification guidelines MSCI primarily classifies shareholdings as strategic or non-strategic based on a categorization of investor types. •Strategic shareholders: The following investor types are generally considered as strategic and their shareholdings in a company are not included in that company’s equity capital to determine its free float: •Governments: Shares owned by governments and affiliated entities. Please refer to the specific guidelines described below for government agencies and government-related investment funds. •Corporations: Shares owned by corporations, including treasury shares owned by the company itself, except when the treasury shares are excluded from the number of shares outstanding. Please refer to specific guidelines for banks. •Management and Board Members: Shares owned by members of the company’s management or Board of Directors, including shares owned by individuals or families that are related to or closely affiliated with members of the company’s management, Board of Directors, or founding members deemed to be insiders. •Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs): Shares owned in ESOPs during the lockup period. Non-Strategic shareholders: The following investor types are generally considered as non-strategic and their shareholdings in a company are included in that company’s equity capital to determine its free float: •Individuals: Shares owned by individuals, excluding shares owned by individuals or families that are related to or closely affiliated with members of the company’s management, Board of Directors or founding members deemed to be insiders, and, excluding those shareholdings held by individuals whose significant size suggests that they are strategic in nature. •Investment funds, mutual funds or unit trusts: Shares owned in investment funds, mutual funds and unit trusts, including shares owned in passively managed funds. •Pension funds: Shares owned in employee pension funds, excluding shares of the employing company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. •Insurance companies: In principle, the investment objective of portfolio holdings of insurance companies is non-strategic. When there are reasons to believe that an insurance company’s shareholding is strategic, it will not be included in free float. •Social security funds: Shares owned in social security funds, unless the fund’s management is deemed to exert influence over the management of the company. •Venture capital funds: Shares owned in venture capital funds, unless a specific investment is deemed to be strategic in nature. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 24 19.If the above guidelines are not sufficient, the additional guidelines described below are used: In the event that the above categories should not appropriately capture the nature of a specific shareholding, its classification as strategic or non- strategic will be determined based on a more extensive analysis. In particular, the following guidelines will be followed: •Banks. Shareholdings by banks are considered as strategic, excluding, when identifiable, specific shareholdings that are deemed to be non-strategic. •Nominees or trustees: Shareholdings registered in the name of a nominee or trustee are classified as strategic or non-strategic based on an analysis of who is the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares, according to the above definitions. •Government agencies and government- related investment funds: Shareholdings of government agencies and government-related investment funds are classified based on an analysis of the objective of the investment. •Shares placed in IPOs with special incentives: Shares that are placed in an IPO and that include meaningful incentives to hold the shares for a specific period of time, are classified as strategic until those incentives expire. •ADRs and GDRs: Shares that are deposited to back the issuance of ADRs and GDRs are classified as non-strategic, unless it is established that a specific stake held in ADRs or GDRs is strategic in nature. 20.Other shares (other than those which are classified as “strategic”) may also be excluded from the free float. These shares, described above as “shares otherwise restricted” from the free float, are described as follows: •Limits on share ownership for foreigners: Limits on the proportion of a security’s share capital that is authorized for purchase by non- domestic investors. Where they exist, these foreign share-ownership limits are generally set by law, government regulations, or company by-laws. •Other foreign investment restrictions: Investment restrictions, other than those described above, which materially limit the ability of international investors to freely invest in a particular equity market. There is typically no simple way to account for these limitations in a benchmark, as these restrictions tend to be more subtle and complex, and may affect different market participants in different ways. 21.The MSCI calculates the free float-adjustment construction methodology in the following manner: Calculation of a security’s free float-adjusted market capitalization As a general rule, MSCI calculates the free float of a security as its total number of shares outstanding less shareholdings classified as strategic and shares otherwise restricted from trading by international investors. However, the determination of the corresponding free float-adjusted market capitalization is dependent on the nature of the limitations on free float. In all cases, the calculation is based solely on publicly available shareholding information obtained from multiple information sources. For each security, all available shareholdings are considered where public data is available, regardless of size. •Calculation in the case of a security which is not subject to a foreign ownership limit or other foreign investment restrictions •Strategic shareholding (%) = Number of shares classified as strategic Total number of shares outstanding •Free float (%) = 100% - Strategic shareholding (%) •For constituents with free float greater than or equal to 15%, the security’s Inclusion Factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded-up to the closest 5%. •Securities with free float less than 15% are typically not eligible for inclusion in the indices. However, in exceptional cases, where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry, the security may be included in the indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float rounded to the closest 1%. •Free float-adjusted market capitalization = Inclusion Factor \* total market capitalization •Calculation in the case of a security which is subject to a foreign ownership limit •Foreign strategic shareholding (%) = Number of shares held by foreign strategic investors Total number of shares outstanding •Free float available to foreign investors (%) is equal to the lesser of: •the free float, calculated as: 100% - strategic shareholding (including both foreign and domestic strategic shareholders) (%) •the foreign ownership limit less the foreign strategic shareholding (%) •For constituents whose free float available to foreign investors is greater than or equal to 15%, the security’s Inclusion Factor is equal to the lesser of: •the estimated free float available to foreign investors rounded-up to the closest 5%; •the foreign ownership limit rounded to the closest 1%. •Securities with a free float available to foreign investors of less than 15% are typically not eligible for inclusion in the indices. However, in exceptional cases, where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry the security may be included in the indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float available to foreign investors rounded to the closest 1%. •Free float-adjusted market capitalization = Inclusion Factor \* total market capitalization •In the case of a security which is subject to other foreign investment restrictions Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 25 In the case where other foreign investment restrictions exist, which materially limit the ability of international investors to freely invest in equity markets, an additional Limited Investability Factor may be applied. There is typically no simple way to account for these types of investability limitations in a benchmark as they tend to be subtle and complex, and may affect different market participants in different ways. Therefore, where warranted, the Limited Investability Factor will be determined based on an extensive case-by-case analysis. 22.The change in target representation, as described in the Announcement, will occur as follows: In conjunction with the free float-adjustment of its indices, MSCI will increase the target market representation in the MSCI Standard Index series from 60% of total market capitalization to 85% of free float-adjusted market capitalization within each industry group within each country. Given trends such as increased market concentration, the increase in coverage will provide greater diversification and representation of investment opportunities in the indices. Broader coverage is also expected to decrease ongoing turnover in the MSCI indices. MSCI research shows that the increase to a target market representation of 85% can be achieved with the addition of a reasonable number of relatively liquid and sizeable constituents in most countries. In the countries where this is not possible, the country index will remain below the target market representation of 85%. 23.The “phase in” periods, also detailed in the Announcement, for the changes are as follows: Publication of Constituent Data and Implementation In order to assist market participants in understanding and preparing for these changes, MSCI plans to publish, on or before June 30, 2001, the list of index constituents and their Inclusion Factors under the enhanced methodology for each of the MSCI Standard country indices. In addition, shortly thereafter, MSCI will begin publishing a provisional index series to measure the performance of the MSCI countries and main regions based on the enhanced methodology. The provisional series, together with the constituents and their Inclusion Factors, also may be used by clients who wish to measure their performance against such an index, ahead of MSCI’s official implementation schedule. In order to best transition the indices to the enhanced methodology, the combined changes will be implemented in two separate phases: as of the close of November 30, 2001, and as of the close of May 31, 2002. The changes in each phase will simultaneously affect all MSCI Standard country indices and will include changes resulting from both the free float- adjustment and the increase in coverage. In the first phase, approximately half of the total change resulting from the free float-adjustment will be implemented for all existing index constituents and, simultaneously, all the new constituents resulting from the increase in coverage to 85% will be added at approximately half of their free float-adjusted market capitalization. More specifically, in the first phase, the market capitalization of all existing index constituents will be adjusted by an interim Inclusion Factor equal to the simple average of the current proportion of market capitalization included in the index prior to the change and their final Inclusion Factor. This average will be rounded up to the closest 5% (or closest 1% if below 15%). For example, in the first phase, two constituents with free floats of 23.2% and 78.6%, respectively, currently included in the index at their full market capitalization weights, will have their market capitalization adjusted by interim Inclusion Factors of 0.65 and 0.90, respectively. These interim Inclusion Factors are calculated as (25%+100%)/2 = 62.5%, rounded-up to 65%, and (80%+100%)/2 = 90%, respectively. Simultaneously, all the new constituents resulting from the increase in coverage to 85% will be added to the indices in the first phase with interim Inclusion Factors equal to half of their final Inclusion Factors rounded-up to the closest 5% (or 1% if below 15%). For example, in the first phase, two new constituents with free floats of 23.2% and 78.6%, respectively, will be included in the indices with their market capitalization adjusted by Inclusion Factors of 0.13 (25%/2 = 12.5%, rounded-up to 13%) and 0.40 (80%/2 = 40%), respectively. In the second and final phase, the remaining adjustment to market capitalization of all constituent securities will be implemented. Index Rebalancings and Market Events during the Transition Period During the transition period, from December 11, 2000 through May 31, 2002, MSCI will maintain its schedule of regular quarterly index rebalancings for its Standard Index series. To minimize changes not related to the transition, MSCI will seek to coordinate all changes in the Standard indices with the target index under the enhanced methodology (i.e., the provisional series when available.) In addition, MSCI will only consider very significant changes in the equity markets when performing its quarterly index reviews. All new additions of companies resulting from IPO’s and regular quarterly rebalancings will be included with their final Inclusion Factors. Also, during the transition period, important new market capitalization additions resulting from mergers, acquisitions and similar corporate events, in principle will be made in proportion to the free float of the additional market capitalization entering the index. For example, when a company - with a current inclusion factor of 40% - issues new shares for the acquisition of assets entirely in firm hands for the equivalent of 25% of its current share capital, the resulting inclusion factor will be derived from the following calculation: \[(100 x 40%) + (25 x 0%)\] / 125 = 32%, which will be rounded up to 35%. 24.Further details of the Arrangement are as described in and applicable to Binding Ruling Prd 96/34. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 26 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a)any cancellation of units by Tortis-INTL will be in whole but not in part; and (b)Tortis-INTL will either have not less than 100 unit holders, or any lesser number of unit holders will be due to unusual or temporary circumstances (including the recent establishment of the trust); and (c)the units will be issued on terms such that their redemption is subject to section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B); and (d)in relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a person that is related to Tortis-INTL within the meaning of section CF 3(12); and (e)at the date of redemption there is no arrangement for the units redeemed to be replaced by the subsequent issue of new units where the arrangement is intended to effect a substitution for the payment of dividends; and (f)index sampling will only take place in the initial stages of Tortis-INTL but not after the time that the fund reaches a size of NZ$60 million; and (g)financial derivatives will be used only to equitise relatively small balances anticipated to be less than 5% of the total fund. These derivatives will not be shares and will not be options to buy shares. They will be financial arrangements. Any gain on them will be assessable for income tax purposes and likewise any loss will be deductible; and (h)Tortis-INTL and any company in the Tower group of companies will not be a “wholly owned group” as that term is defined in section IG 1(3); and (i)In relation to the application of section CG 1(a), none of the features listed in Part B of Schedule 3 will be applied by any relevant company (shares of which are acquired) and (j)Section CG 6 will apply to Tortis-INTL. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows. •If a unit holder redeems units in Tortis-INTL (whether for cash or an appropriately weighted parcel of shares in the Index companies), section CF 3 (1)(b) will apply and the distribution made by Tortis-INTL will not be a dividend to the extent that the amount distributed does not exceed the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled”, as that term applies to Tortis-INTL. The Commissioner is satisfied that in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii) the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. The procedure of publicising buy-back and redemption prices on the Internet does not constitute a “recognised exchange” in terms of the definition of that phrase in section OB 1. •If Tortis-INTL is liquidated section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount” as those terms apply to Tortis-INTL. The excess return amount will include gains on shares sold by Tortis-INTL. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2001 until 30 June 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11th day of May 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 27 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/11 4In the event that the Fund will have to realise part of the share portfolio to fund redemptions, that realisation will occur in accordance with the weighting of the Index. 5Approximately 5% of the Fund is invested in a cash pool. This part of the investment will provide a readily realisable pool of funds from which to pay liabilities and fund redemptions. The Fund only invests the cash pool in bank deposits with a bank registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989, any debt obligations or in the Tower First Rate Account. 6Apart from shares acquired to establish and grow the Fund and the investment of the cash pool, any powers of investment or divestment by the trustee under the Deed of Trust are exercised for the purposes of (i) reflecting movements in the Index in terms of composition and weighting; or (ii) funding the redemption of units in the Fund (or to restore liquidity to the cash pool to enable the Fund to fund the redemption of units). 7Cash dividends received by the Fund (less any tax payable on them not covered by imputation credits) are passed on to the investors twice annually or retained by the Fund in order to restore liquidity to the cash pool. 8Investors are able to subscribe for units in the Fund by making a cash payment. It will be possible for investors to transfer to the Fund a parcel of shares in the Index companies (as specified by the Manager) proportionate to the numbers and classes of shares of the Index companies included in the Index. 9Investors are able to redeem their units at any time by giving notice, in the form of a repurchase request, to the manager. Their units will be redeemed in cash at a price equal to the net assets of the Fund at the time divided by the number of units on issue. 10It is possible for the manager to purchase the units from the unit holders as an alternative to redemption. Where units are repurchased the manager will pay the unit holder a price equal to the net assets of the Fund at the time divided by the number of units on issue. 11Instead of redeeming or repurchasing the units for cash the unit holder may request the trustee to transfer to the unit holder a parcel of shares in the Index companies proportionate to the numbers and classes of shares of the Index companies included in the Index. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis-NZ Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3 (1)(b) and CF 3 (1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the Fund under the terms of the Deed of Trust, dated 1 November 1996 to act as an investment fund to hold a portfolio of shares that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE30 Selection Capital Index (“the Index”). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1The trustee of the Fund is the Public Trustee. The manager of the Fund is Tower Managed Funds Limited. The Fund has been established as a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit, which will confer a proportional interest in the Fund) confers an equal interest in the Fund but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Fund or any investment in the Fund. 2Approximately 95% of the amount invested in the Fund is used to invest in a portfolio of shares. The investment policy of the Fund is to invest in Index Companies in a manner that replicates the Index (apart from the transactions relating to the cash pool) and only enter into transactions that give effect to that policy. 3Apart from shares acquired to establish and grow the Fund according to its terms, shares are bought and sold by the Fund in only two limited situations, namely where it is necessary to (i) reflect movements in the Index in terms of composition and weighting; and (ii) fund the redemption of units in the Fund (or restore liquidity to the cash pool to enable the Fund to fund the redemption of units). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 28 Where the unit holder receives a transfer of shares the market value of the shares per unit will be equal to net assets of the Fund at the time divided by the number of units on issue. 12The issuing of units and their redemption will be effected directly by the Fund. Unit prices may be published in newspapers and the Fund will have an Internet site through which visitors to the site will be able to request the purchase, redemption or buy-back of units. No units are or will be otherwise quoted on the official list of any “recognised exchange” as defined in section OB 1. 13Any cancellation of units will only be effected in order to allow unit holders to exit the Fund or decrease their holding in the Fund. Units will also be cancelled in the event that the Fund is liquidated. 14Apart from on liquidation of the Fund, any cancellation of units will be in response to the activities of a particular unit holder, and not all the unit holders of the Fund. 15Further details of the Arrangement are as described in and applicable to Binding Ruling Prd 96/34. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a)Any cancellation of units by the Fund will be in whole but not in part. (b)The Fund will have either not less than 100 unit holders, or any lesser number of unit holders will be due to unusual or temporary circumstances (including the recent establishment of the trust). (c)In relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a non-resident company that is related to the Fund within the meaning of section CF 3 (12). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •If a unit holder redeems units in the Fund (whether for cash or an appropriately weighted parcel of shares in the Index companies), section CF 3 (1)(b) will apply and the distribution made by the Fund will not be a dividend to the extent that the amount distributed does not exceed the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled”, as that term applies to the Fund. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. •If the Fund is liquidated, section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount”, as those terms apply to the Fund. The excess return amount will include gains on shares sold by the Fund. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2001 until 30 June 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of May 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 29 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/14 3.IA’s asset base has been originally derived from the Auckland Regional Council (the “ARC”). In 1992 the assets and liabilities of the ARC were transferred to the Auckland Regional Services Trust (“ARST”) under Part XLIVB of the Local Government Act 1974 (“LGA”). However, ARST did not inherit all the functions of the ARC and its primary role was to manage its assets, reduce the liabilities and dispose of specified assets as required under the provisions of the LGA. 4.In 1998 the government decided that the assets held by ARST should be applied for developing the Infrastructure of the Auckland region and it was decided to create IA to facilitate this decision. Pursuant to section 707ZZZL of the LGA, on 1 October 1998 the assets and liabilities of ARST were transferred to IA, with the following exceptions: •$10 million was paid to the ARC for the purposes of regional parks; •$10 million was paid to the territorial authorities of the Auckland region to be applied to significant projects in the Auckland region in the area of arts and culture; •the assets and liabilities of ARST in relation to the Pikes Point walkway were transferred to the Auckland City Council; •the shares in Watercare Services Limited were divided between the territorial authorities of the Auckland region. The Making of Grants 5.Section 707ZZL(1) of the LGA provides that any local authority which, or other person who, intends to undertake within the Auckland Region a project in respect of which IA may make a grant in the exercise of its functions under section 707ZZK(1) may apply to IA for such a grant. 6.IA, in deciding whether or not to contribute funds to projects or parts of projects or components of projects in the exercise of its principal function under section 707ZZK, must be guided by the criteria specified in clause 5.2 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed, which provides: 5.2Criteria: The criteria, in relation to each such project, are as follows: (a)The extent to which the project generates benefits to the community generally in addition to those that accrue to any identifiable persons or groups of persons; and This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Infrastructure Auckland. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •Section 2 •Section 3A •Section 5(1) •Section 5(6D) •Section 8(1) •Section 10(2) •Section 20(3) The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the making of grants by Infrastructure Auckland (“IA”) on the basis of applications from potential recipients to carry out specific transport or stormwater infrastructure projects within the Auckland region. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1.IA is a body corporate which was established pursuant to the Local Government Amendment Act 1998, and the Infrastructure Auckland Deed. 2.Section 707ZZK(1) of the Local Government Act 1974 provides that the principal function of Infrastructure Auckland is to contribute funds, by way of grants, in respect of projects, or parts of projects, undertaken in the Auckland Region for the purpose of providing: (a) Land transport; or (b) Any passenger service; or (c) Any passenger transport operation; or (d) Stormwater infrastructure; where the projects or parts of projects generate benefits to the community generally in addition to any benefits that accrue to any identifiable persons or groups of persons. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 30 (b)The extent to which the benefits generated to the community generally by the project exceed the costs (including the external costs) of the project by a margin greater than the assessed risk that the project will not deliver its intended net benefits; and (c)Whether the project satisfies the requirements of clause 4.1; and (d)The extent to which the project contributes and gives effect to any Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy or the Auckland regional growth strategy or any regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement adopted under the Resource Management Act 1991 or any regional stormwater strategy as adopted by the Regional Growth Forum; and (e)The principle that the costs of the project, including the external costs, should be (i) Allocated in a manner that is consistent with economic efficiency; and (ii) Where practicable, recovered from those persons or groups of persons who— -benefit from the project; or -contributed to such costs; and in a manner that matches the extent to which those persons or groups of persons benefit from the project or contributed to such costs; and (f)The extent to which the project will be in the best interests of the inhabitants of the Auckland Region; and (g)The extent to which the project provides the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people in the Auckland Region; and (h)The extent to which the project provides for a geographical spread of public benefits across the Auckland Region; and (i)The degree to which the project may improve economic performance in the Auckland Region; and (j)The degree to which the project may contribute to regional environmental outcomes; and (k)The degree of urgency for the project. 7.Clause 4.1 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed sets out further matters which IA must have regard to in making grants. It states: Infrastructure Auckland must ensure that grants it makes under section 707ZZK(1)— (a)Are made primarily for the purpose of funding the capital components of projects; and (b)Are not inconsistent with any Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy or the Auckland regional growth strategy or any regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement under the Resource Management Act 1991; and (c)Are made having regard to Transfund New Zealand’s funding policies; and (d)Are not for services for which funding has already been identified. (As required by section 707ZZZA(1)(c)) 8.The vast majority of the grants made by IA have been made (and will continue to be made) to local authorities and commercial transport operators who carry on taxable activities and must account for GST in respect of supplies they make. Terms and Conditions attaching to Grants 9.The grants IA makes are usually subject to terms and conditions. 10.IA has a broad discretion, pursuant to section 707ZZL of the LGA, to make grants subject to such terms and conditions as IA sees fit. 11.However, in practice, there are three broad categories under which IA will impose conditions in relation to a grant. These are: (a) Conditions which do no more than ensure the efficient and proper application of the grant funds, consistent with section 707ZZK(1) and 707ZZL(2) of the LGA, as well as other relevant statutory requirements, being one or more of the following conditions: (i) The grant recipient carrying out the project as stated in the grant application; (ii)The grant recipient obtaining any additional funding required to carry out the grant project (to the extent that the grant made by IA does not provide sufficient funding); (iii)The grant recipient obtaining all relevant statutory and regulatory consents in respect of the project, such as resource consents, building consents, local body and regulatory authority approvals; (iv)The grant recipient obtaining all relevant board and shareholder approvals; (v) The grant recipient entering into the principal contracts required to complete the relevant project; (vi)The grant recipient establishing an appropriate entity to hold assets and/ or carry out the project; (vii)The grant recipient completing any due diligence or further enquiry (if appropriate) for the purpose of ensuring the feasibility of the project; (viii)The grant recipient obtaining any property rights that are necessary for the project; and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 31 (ix)The grant recipient providing regular reports to IA at specified intervals including information on the progress of the project and costs, adverse events that have arisen, and the outcome of the project following its completion. (b) Conditions that ensure that the benefit of the grant is obtained by the Auckland people and region; provided that in any such case any benefit connected with any specified person or group of persons is incidental to and/or a necessary and unavoidable result of generating benefits to the community generally in the Auckland Region, being one or more of the following conditions: (i) The grant recipient allowing competitors to use assets that are funded by grants; (ii)The grant recipient allowing general public access to certain assets; (iii)The grant recipient informing the public of the existence of the services assets or improvements (as the case may be) arising from the grant project; and (iv)The grant recipient acknowledging the contribution of IA to the funding of the grant project. (c) Conditions that are contingent on the occurrence of some future event that would alter the assumptions inherent in making the grant, being one or more of the following conditions: (i) The grant recipient agreeing not to sell or dispose of its interest in assets acquired or approved as part of a project in respect of which a grant has been made unless authorised by IA; (ii) A condition providing that, if assets are disposed of, those assets must continue to be used in a manner that will deliver benefits to the Auckland Region generally, whether by reason of being transferred to a local authority, a subsidiary of a local authority, a competitor or otherwise; (iii)Rights to grants provided by IA may not be assigned; (iv)The grant applicant maintaining the project for the life of the asset in accordance with sound business practice; (v) A right for IA to cancel a grant and require repayment of amounts paid in respect of the grant if; • the grant recipient cannot complete the project by the specified date; or • the specified purpose for which the grant was made cannot be achieved; or • the grant was made in reliance on information that was incorrect or misleading; or • there are variations to the project to which the grant funds were applied that are not authorised by IA; (vi)The grant recipient ensuring that any assets created as a result of the grant project remain available to be used for the benefit of the Auckland Region where the grant recipient disposes of its ownership of the assets or ceases to use them for the purposes for which the grant was made; and (vii)The grant recipient obtaining IA’s consent prior to moving certain assets to another physical location or changing the ownership of such assets. Membership of IA 12.IA is required to be operated by up to seven “members” who are appointed in accordance with the Infrastructure Auckland Deed. The members are responsible for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer. 13.The members are appointed by a body known as the Electoral College. The Electoral College is established pursuant to the LGA and its function is set out in section 707ZZT, which provides: (1)The functions of the Electoral College are— (a) To appoint, in accordance with this Act and the Infrastructure Auckland deed, members of Infrastructure Auckland: (b) To appoint, in accordance with this Act and the Infrastructure Auckland deed, the chairperson of Infrastructure Auckland: (c) To discharge, in accordance with this Act and the Infrastructure Auckland deed, its duties in relation to Infrastructure Auckland’s statement of corporate intent: (d) To monitor the performance of Infrastructure Auckland: (e) To consult with the Minister from time to time about amendments to the Infrastructure Auckland deed: (f) To carry out such other functions as are conferred on it by this Act or any other Act. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 32 14.The Electoral College has eight members with each of the Manukau City Council, the Auckland City Council, the Waitakere City Council, the North Shore City Council, the Papakura District Council, the Rodney District Council, the Franklin District Council and the Auckland Regional Council being entitled to appoint one member. Central Government Involvement with IA 15.The Minister of Local Government (“the Minister”) has a minor degree of involvement with IA. 16.The Minister has been required to prepare and sign the Infrastructure Auckland Deed. In addition the Infrastructure Auckland Deed may be amended from time to time by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister after consultation with the Electoral College. 17.Pursuant to clause 46.1 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed, the Minister, in consultation with the Electoral College, must, in the period of 12 months ending with the close of 30 September 2008, conduct a review of the activities and future of IA for the purpose of determining whether there is a continuing need for IA to make grants under section 707ZZK(1). 18.In all other material respects, IA is totally divorced from central government involvement. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)No direct benefit to IA will arise in respect of grants made by IA except for a market rate return to compensate IA for temporary loss of use of funds where circumstances arise which necessitate repayment of a grant previously made. b)Any benefit resulting from any project in respect of which a grant is made which arises to specified or identified persons or groups of persons is incidental to IA’s overall purpose of providing a benefit to the Auckland Region generally. c)No direct benefit will arise to any member or employee of IA from any project in respect of which a grant is made except in that member or employee’s capacity as a member of the community generally living in the Auckland Region. d)This ruling only applies in respect of grants made subject to no conditions, or subject to one or more of the conditions listed in paragraphs 11(a), 11(b), or 11(c) of the Arrangement, and will not apply in respect of any grant which contains conditions which are not listed in paragraphs 11(a), 11(b), or 11(c). e)The criteria specified in clause 5.2 of the Infrastructure Auckland Deed are the sole criteria that IA will use in determining whether to offer a grant. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •The grant payments that the grant recipients receive from IA will not be deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods or services pursuant to section 5(6D). •The grant recipients will not be required to account for GST pursuant to section 8(1) in respect of the grant payments they receive from IA. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 October 1998 to 4 May 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4 th day of May 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 33 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/15 4.The leases are operating leases rather than finance leases for income tax purposes. 5.Employers find the Multi-lease product appealing because of its flexibility. There are no penalties payable as a result of a customer choosing not to take up a further lease of the vehicle concerned. At the expiry of each 12-month period, lease obligations have been met under the Multi-lease product. 6.By comparison, Esanda imposes a significant potential penalty for early termination under its three year lease (under clause 28 of the Master Lease Agreement, Esanda can determine the amount of the penalty). 7.The flexibility provided by the Multi-lease is particularly valuable when employers are unsure of the number of employees for whom they will require vehicles or are unsure of the type of vehicle the employees may wish to have available. As a result, the employers prefer short lease terms so that they are not required to continue either renting vehicles that they do not require or pay significant penalties for early termination. 8.The leasing of the motor vehicles by Esanda to customers/lessees (being, for the purposes of this ruling, the employers) comprises the following steps: (a) Initial lease enquiry This is the initial contact from the potential customer inquiring about leasing vehicles from Esanda. (b)Marketing response This involves the initial meeting and consideration of promotional material. (c)Lease proposal Esanda provides the customer with a “Lease Proposal”. This is not a contractual document. It is a strategic/informative document that sets out the general basis for the services that Esanda can provide to customers, as lessees. (d)Credit Application The lessee’s credit application is completed and assessed. (e)Motor Vehicle Leasing Terms and Conditions When a lessee commences dealings with Esanda, Esanda then provides the lessee with the Motor Vehicle Leasing Terms and Conditions. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Truck Leasing Limited trading as Esanda Fleet Partners (“Esanda”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CI 3(1), GC 15, GC 17, and Schedule 2, Part A clause 1(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of motor vehicles by Esanda under Multi-lease agreements to employers who provide the motor vehicles to employees for their private use. The Multi-lease agreements involve a motor vehicle lease with a term of one year, with the possibility of entering into two further terms of one year each. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.Esanda conducts a fleet leasing business. One of the options offered to customers is a motor vehicle lease with a term of one year, with the possibility of entering into two further terms of one year each (“Multi-lease”). 2.The arrangement for which this ruling is sought is the lease (using the Multi-lease product) of a motor vehicle from Esanda to an employer and the provision of that motor vehicle by the employer to an employee for their private use and enjoyment. The lease from Esanda to the employer is made under the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease Agreement and Agreement to Lease (copies of which were provided with the application dated 14 December 2000). The Master Lease Agreement states that the agreement is between the lessee and Mutual Leasing Limited. 3.Mutual Leasing Limited amalgamated with Truck Leasing Limited on 2 October 2000 and therefore now operates under the name of Truck Leasing Limited. As part of Esanda’s contractual obligations under the arrangement, it is required to advise employers of the market valuation of the vehicles. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 34 This is the Master Lease Agreement (“MLA”) which sets out the general terms and conditions for motor vehicles to be subsequently leased from Esanda. There is no specific reference to actual vehicles in the MLA. (f)Vehicle Order The lessee then completes a “Vehicle Order” which details their precise requirements, for example the vehicle, term, kilometres, and relevant monthly lease rental etc. The Vehicle Order also incorporates the conditions in the MLA. The Vehicle Order is completed prior to the commencement of each new lease and reflects the details for that lease only. (g)Acceptance Esanda then confirms acceptance with the lessee. (h) Agreement to Lease Esanda and the lessee then enter into an “Agreement to Lease”. The terms and conditions set out in the MLA are incorporated into this lease agreement. In a contractual sense, the lease of each vehicle is clearly created by the offer and acceptance of each specific Agreement to Lease. The actual motor vehicle is then delivered to the lessee. Under each and every Agreement to Lease entered into between Esanda and a particular lessee, the following will apply: •The term of the lease is 12 months. •There will be no provision for automatic renewal of the term of the lease. •There will be no option conferred on the lessee to renew, extend or vary the term of the lease. •There will be no provision for an incentive to the lessee if it takes up a further lease of the vehicle. •There will be no penalty on the lessee if it does not take up a further lease of the vehicle. (i)Procedure at end of lease As standard practice, Esanda advises the lessee of the status of the lease at least three months prior to the expiration of the 12-month lease term. Esanda is then able to determine whether the lessee wishes to lease the vehicle for a further lease term of 12 months. If not, the vehicle is returned to Esanda upon expiry of the lease. If the lessee wishes to retain the vehicle, a new lease is entered into for a further 12-month period. This new 12-month lease is assigned a separate and distinct number or record in Esanda’s computer system, which is used to manage vehicles leased using its Multi- lease product. In all cases, the old record for the previous 12-month lease is noted as having terminated. In addition, a new Agreement to Lease is executed for the further 12-month lease. Again, the general conditions set out in the MLA are incorporated into that new Agreement to Lease. The rental rates for the second and third periods are lower than the first. The rates reduce as the depreciated value of the vehicle reduces. If the customer does not renew, it does not get the benefit of reduced rates. However, there is no obligation on Esanda to provide vehicles for subsequent 12-month leases and no obligation on customers to enter into a subsequent 12-month lease. (j)Valuation of Vehicles As noted above, Esanda is required to advise lessees of the market value of the vehicle at the commencement of each 12-month lease period. The market value assessment takes into account the type of car and its condition and mileage. Esanda advises employers/lessees of the market valuation of the vehicles, and also provides market value forecasts for subsequent periods for indicative purposes only. Market values are routinely reviewed prior to the commencement of subsequent leases to ensure that the forecasts are accurate. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The motor vehicles leased by the employers under this Arrangement are leased for the private use or enjoyment of the employees or made available for the private use or enjoyment of the employees. b)Any rental rate for a subsequent lease period is the same rental rate that would be offered to any other customer for that particular vehicle and lease period (taking into account the customer credit rating, customer fleet size, kilometre allowances, and general service components of the lease including vehicle maintenance) irrespective of whether a previous lease for that vehicle was entered into by that customer. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 35 c)There is no other documentation, agreements, or contracts that concern or affect the terms of the leases entered into under this Arrangement apart from the MLA, the Vehicle Order, and the Agreement to Lease. d)There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally unenforceable or not) that any party will, or will if requested, renew, extend or vary the term of the lease. e)There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally unenforceable or not) at the time of entering into any lease under this Arrangement, that the parties will enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle. f)There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally unenforceable or not) at the time of entering into any lease under this Arrangement, that there will be penalties for choosing not to enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle. g)All calculations, factors, and/or projections which are taken into account in formulating the rental rates applying to each lease are not in any way based on a lease of the relevant motor vehicle for more than 12 months. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The market value of a motor vehicle under this Arrangement, for the purposes of calculating the fringe benefit value of that vehicle under section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2, Part A clause 1(c), is determined on the date on which each new 12-month lease commences. •Sections GC 15 and GC 17 do not apply to the Arrangement. •Section BG 1 does not apply to negate or vary the conclusions above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the date this Ruling is signed until 3 rd May 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4 th day of May 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 36 NEW LEGISLATION 2000–2001 DEEMED RATE OF RETURN FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND RULES The deemed rate of return used for the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been set at 10.29% for the 2000–2001 income year, down from 10.74% for the previous year. The rate will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The FIF rules tax the income earned by foreign entities on behalf of New Zealand residents, and apply to investments that are not subject to the controlled foreign company rules. The deemed rate of return method is one of four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. The rate for future income years will continue to be set annually. The regulations setting the rate—the Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return, 2000–01 Income Year) Regulations 2001—were made by Order in Council on 25 June 2001. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 37 FINANCIAL PLANNING FEES – GST TREATMENT Introduction All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This statement considers the GST treatment under sections 3 and 14, of a range of services provided by financial advisers for financial planning fees charged to investors. In this regard, the actual nature of the services provided is important and will determine the liability to GST of the financial planning fees paid for those services. The services will be exempt from GST under section 14 (exempt supplies) if: •the activities undertaken involve the supply of “financial services” in terms of section 3; or •the services are not in themselves “financial services”, but are supplied together with a supply of “financial services”, and those other services are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services, and are not otherwise specifically excluded from being exempt supplies. Activities that involve the provision of advice are generally excluded from the meaning of “financial services”. Background An investor who seeks advice from a financial adviser will be charged for the services provided. Whether these fees are exempt supplies or subject to GST will depend on the nature of the services provided. When an initial financial plan has been devised, agreed to by the investor and implemented by the adviser, that is not necessarily the end of the matter. Usually systems are in place that require the adviser’s continued involvement. Most financial advisers offer a continuing monitoring service that is generally part This statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the GST treatment of services provided in relation to financial planning fees charged by financial advisers to plan, implement, and monitor an investment portfolio for their investor clients. This interpretation statement replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 95/11 that appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996). The Public Ruling ceased to apply from 31 March 1999. There are seven categories of financial planning fees, which are based on the process of obtaining an initial financial plan, the subsequent monitoring of that plan, and any following adjustments or alterations to the plan. The question of the GST treatment hinges on the actual nature of the services provided rather than the label applied to those services. The following table summarises the GST treatment of services provided in relation to the various categories of financial planning fees that are charged by financial advisers. The table is a general guide only and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed explanations of each particular category contained in this interpretation statement. Fee CategoryServices Subject to GST Initial planning feesYes Implementation feesNo Administration feesNo Monitoring feesYes Evaluation feesYes Re-planning feesYes Switching feesNo INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the Tax Information Bulletin contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 38 of an overall advisory package. The investments are sometimes (but not always) placed in the care of a custodian (commonly for security reasons) who may have also been involved in the acquisition of the investments. The income derived from the investments may pass to the adviser or custodian where it is placed in a trust account before being able to be drawn upon by the investor. The maintenance of these trust accounts by the adviser usually incurs costs that are charged to the investor. As part of the service, the adviser may monitor the portfolio to ensure that the aims of the investor are continually met. For this service the investor will often pay further fees. From time to time as part of this monitoring service the adviser can recommend changes to the investment mix. If the investor accepts these recommendations to change investments, further fees are incurred which may include switching fees. It is the Commissioner’s view that public ruling BR Pub 95/11 has been useful in respect of the GST treatment of the financial planning fees. However, despite the issue of the ruling there has been occasional uncertainty on how the ruling should be applied. Although some of these were discussed within the commentary definitions of the three categories identified, participants in the financial planning industry may have had difficulty in applying the ruling. It seemed logical to extend and further define the present three categories to make it easier for advisers and others in the financial planning industry to decide whether or not the planning fees were subject to GST. Similar issues arose and the same approach was taken in relation to the previous income tax public rulings (Public Rulings BR Pub 95/10 and 10A) that dealt with the income tax deductibility of financial planning fees charged to investors. Financial advisers charge for a number of services provided to their clients, sometimes using different names for these component services. The GST tax treatment of the fees depends not on the name given to the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. The adoption of the expanded categorisation of fees in this statement is intended to make it easier for financial advisers and others to determine how fees charged and the services provided will be treated for GST purposes. The categories correspond to the process usually followed when an investor seeks the assistance of a financial adviser. Fee categories The fees charged by financial advisers vary from one adviser to another, but generally they can be separated into a number of categories. Financial planners give the fees charged various names, but the crucial point that determines the GST treatment is for what service(s) the fee is actually paid. The nature of the service provided will determine whether the fees paid are for a supply of a “financial service” and thus an exempt supply, or otherwise qualify as a supply of services exempt from GST. The fees can be summarised as: ( a )Initial planning fees: Fees charged in relation to services provided by the adviser for the initial interview where the investor and the adviser discuss the investor’s investment goals, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. The adviser then prepares a draft portfolio plan for the investor. Further interviews, discussions, and adjustments to the draft plan may follow until it is acceptable to the investor. ( b )Implementation fees: All fees for services associated with implementing the draft plan devised in (a). They will include any one-off up-front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the investments. They include payments to custodians on implementation of the plan or charges by fund managers for entry into the investments. (c)Administration fees: This fee category is generally described by advisers as “annual on-going” fees. They are charged by the adviser to cover the costs of maintaining records of the investor’s transactions with the adviser. This category also includes charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with an administrator, bank charges, and other administration fees. Also included are any fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging for this to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s own bank account. ( d )Monitoring fees: Annual charges for monitoring and reporting to the investor on the performance of the portfolio (including the performance of the fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals, and relaying this information to the investor. The adviser will prepare these reports from time to time. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 39 (e)Evaluation fees: Any fees for services relating to an evaluation of an existing portfolio. Typically, these arise where an investor has an existing portfolio of investments and either seeks a financial adviser’s advice for the first time, or seeks confirmation that the portfolio’s performance is matching the goals originally set by either the investor, or with the assistance of a financial adviser at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of performance of the portfolio than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the client. It may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes to investments within the portfolio to maintain the investor’s aims. (f)Re-planning fees: Fees for services relating to the re-planning of a portfolio sometimes arising from category (e) services due to changes to the investor’s objectives. This could entail minor changes, or the complete restructuring of investments and a change in investment strategy. Re-planning fees do not necessarily refer to advice supplied by the same adviser. They could be for advice by an adviser to a new client who had previously managed his or her own portfolio or had previously engaged a different adviser. Included in this category are any other fees as described in Initial planning fees at (a), when there has been a complete restructuring of investments. ( g )Switching fees: Fees related to the costs involved in selling existing investments and/or purchasing new investments arising from a recommendation by the adviser as a result of category (e) or category (f) services. The fees will be charged by the adviser for changing investments within the portfolio. Also included are any fees relating to the withdrawal in whole or in part from an existing portfolio. If financial planners charge a global fee (that includes fees for more than one of the above categories), it will be necessary for that fee to be apportioned between the categories, based on the particular services provided for the fee, to ensure the fees are correctly treated for GST purposes. A similar apportionment exercise needs to be undertaken in the case of “performance fees”, where an investor may have the option of being able to elect to pay a performance fee instead of fees for some or all of the categories noted above. Performance fees are a form of global fee paid to advisers, based on how well the portfolio of investments selected by the adviser and agreed to by the investor is performing against some pre-determined measure. The calculation of the seven categories of fees noted above might be based on a standard fee structure, hours of work put in by the adviser, the amount of the investments made by the investor, or a combination of those. Performance fees on the other hand, are calculated under some pre-determined formula based on how well the investor’s portfolio, as recommended by the adviser, performs over a period of time. These fees could include a standard amount, plus a percentage based on the extent to which the level of growth or return from the portfolio exceeds previously agreed targets, or the fee could be based solely on a percentage of the returns/agreed targets. Irrespective of the name given to the fee, or the basis of calculation, the GST treatment of the fees will be determined having regard to the services performed in establishing, administering, and altering the investor’s portfolio, based on the seven categories of services mentioned above. It may be that in certain cases the performance fee is paid in respect of all seven categories of services, while in other instances the fee may be only for services coming within some of the categories, e.g. the administration and monitoring fee categories. In view of this, in determining the GST treatment it is not the description (label) the adviser attaches to the fee charged that is relevant, rather it is what service (s) the fee is actually paid for. Performance fees are in reality no different to any other global or multi-service fee charged by an adviser. How the amount is apportioned among the categories of services is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. Issues The question considered in this statement is: in what circumstances will the Commissioner treat the services provided in respect of financial planning fees as an exempt supply of services under section 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? This will be determined by: •The nature of the service provided for the fees charged, and whether these fees are in respect of a “financial service” in terms of section 3. •In the event that the fees are not in respect of a financial service, whether the services are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services. This is subject to the services supplied for those other fees not otherwise being specifically excluded from being exempt supplies. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 40 Legislation The legislation relevant to this statement is contained in sections 3 and 14. Section 14 provides a GST exemption for certain supplies, including the supply of financial services, and section 3 defines the term “financial services” for the purposes of the Act. Paragraph (a) of section 14(1) is relevant for the purposes of this statement and provides: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: (a)The supply of any financial services (together with the supply of any other goods and services, supplied by the supplier of those financial services, which are reason- ably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services), not being¾ (i) A supply of financial services which, but for this paragraph, would be charged with tax at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11A of this Act; or (ii) A supply of goods and services which (although being part of a supply of goods and services which, but for this subparagraph, would be an exempt supply under this paragraph) is not in itself, as between the supplier of that first-mentioned supply and the recipient, a supply of financial services in respect of which this paragraph applies: The parts of the section 3 definition of “financial services” that are relevant for the purposes of this statement are as follows: (1)For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a)The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): .... (c)The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorse- ment, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d)The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: .... (ka) The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participa- tory security, credit contract, contract of life insur- ance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l)Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. Analysis General requirements of the legislation affecting financial services In order to determine whether particular services supplied are exempt, it is necessary that the supplies fall into the criteria stipulated in section 14. Section 14(1)(a) requires that there must be either a supply of a financial service or the supply of a good or a service that is “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of a financial service provided by the same supplier. This raises two interpretation matters: •What are financial services; and •What does “reasonably incidental and necessary” mean? What are financial services? Section 3 defines “financial services”. In terms of the issues raised by this statement concerning the treatment of financial planning fees, the relevant subparagraphs of section 3(1) are: (1)For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a)The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): .... (c)The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorse- ment, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d)The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: .... (ka)The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participa- tory security, credit contract, contract of life insur- ance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l)Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. \[Emphasis added\] The parts of section 3(1) under consideration raise two further interpretative matters: the meanings to be ascribed to the words “arranging” and “advising” as used in paragraph (l). A number of the supplies of services under consideration involve financial advisers providing various levels of advice or arranging for another organisation to implement an investor’s financial plan (place investments, etc.) and/or to collect income from the investments and arrange payment or crediting to the investor. A preliminary issue is the position under section 3(1)(l) of persons or organisations who may act as intermediaries between the investor and the person actually undertaking the activities specified in paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka) of section 3(1). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 41 Intermediaries and section 3(1)(l) The agreeing to do or arranging any of the activities listed in section 3(1) in terms of paragraph (l), encompasses the activities of brokers or intermediaries who arrange for the provision of financial services, such as mortgage, superannuation and life insurance brokers. This finding was concluded in Product Ruling BR Prd 96/30 issued by Inland Revenue in respect of section 3(1)(l) (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 8, November 1996). The adviser often does not actually undertake the activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka), but is authorised to arrange the activities to be undertaken for and on behalf of another (the investor). In this situation the adviser is acting as an intermediary. In other words, the financial adviser itself does not implement the plan but acts on behalf of its clients and gets someone else to implement the plan. This factor does not take the intermediary’s actions outside the ambit of section 3(1)(l). Similarly, where a custodian is involved, it is the custodian who usually implements the financial plan on instruction from the financial adviser. Even though there is another intermediary besides the financial adviser, the fees incurred for the activities undertaken by the custodian are still within the ambit of section 3(1)(l). Meaning of “arranging” used in section 3(1)(l) The term “arranging” is not defined in the Act. However, in ordinary use “arranging” is capable of being given a wide or a narrow interpretation. A wide interpretation would include every step that could result in a financial service being provided to the client, independently of whether a service is actually provided or of any intention of a service being provided. This would include promotions and marketing which do not necessarily lead to any service being provided or research into any areas to which investment may be expanded in the future. By comparison, a narrow meaning requires a nexus or a close linkage to the provision of the actual financial service to the client. These activities would include brokerage activities or filling out forms for a client. The activities are for a specific purpose, and it is highly probable that the supply of a financial service will occur following those activities. For example, the general monitoring of the debt securities market would not be arranging the issue of a debt security, despite the monitoring being required for the making of a prudent investment. Although the courts have not specifically discussed the term “advising” in the context of section 3(1)(l), there are cases that indicate that a narrow interpretation such as outlined above should be applied. Davison CJ in Databank Systems Limited v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) indicated that an appropriate meaning would be “cause to occur”. This suggests that there is also an element of certainty that the financial service will be provided to the client. Equally, Lord Templeman in CIR v Databank Systems Limited (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 (PC) indicated that the exemption did not extend to activities which merely resulted in the supply of financial services thus rejecting the wide interpretation of “arranging”. These two judgments indicate the need for a close connection between the activity undertaken and the financial service supplied to the ultimate recipient (the investor) in order for that activity to be the arranging of the financial service. Databank (PC) also illustrates the principle that it is the actual arranging activity being undertaken that is paramount and not the overall nature of the activity comprising the services being supplied to the ultimate recipient. Both the Databank (PC) and Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 1,032 (CA) decisions demonstrate the importance of dissecting the transaction involved to determine precisely what activity is being undertaken in order to establish whether a financial service is being provided. In summary, while the New Zealand courts have not directly considered what constitutes arranging in terms of section 3(1)(l), they have provided some determinative guidelines in establishing the application of arranging. That is, “arranging” is to be interpreted in a narrow sense, and that when considering what is inclusive of arranging, it is important to dissect the transaction involved to determine precisely what activity is being undertaken, and not be swayed by the overall nature of the activity that the recipient or supplier may be involved with. This is in order to establish whether it is a financial service that is being provided (Databank (PC), Turakina Maori Girls College and Case Q10 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,061). Putting this into the context of section 3(1)(l), “arranging” must have a direct connection to the specific supply of the financial service. It is not enough that the arranging may have caused the supply of that financial service, what is necessary is that the activity of arranging intentionally causes the provision of a financial service as defined in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 42 This interpretation is consistent with how the courts in the United Kingdom have defined the term “making of arrangements” (Hargreaves Landsdown Asset Management v C & E Commrs \[1995\] BVC 896, Dogbreeders Associates v C of CE (1989) VATTR 317 and Donald Ford v The Commissioners (1987) VATTR 130) and how Revenue Canada has defined the term “arranging” in its policy statement (Ruling No. 11783-2). In order to establish whether there is an activity of arranging pursuant to section 3(1)(l), it is therefore necessary to establish the following criteria: •The service to which the arranging relates is a financial service as defined by section 3(1)(a) to (ka) (Databank (PC)); and •The activity is a precursor to the provision of a financial service which the intended recipient of that financial service has already decided to use or to obtain. “Arranging activities” that arise before a decision is made to proceed by the intended recipient, are considered too far removed and the provision of the financial service too uncertain. Therefore, provision of the financial service being arranged must not be subject to another person’s overriding decision on whether to proceed. The “arranging” activity is tainted by the financial service’s character as it is closely connected and has the purpose of organising the provision of that financial service or causing it to occur (Dogbreeders Associates, Databank (HC)); and •The activity undertaken is to intentionally cause the provision of the financial service. This does not mean that no arranging has taken place if the financial service is cancelled or does not proceed. As long as the requisite activity is undertaken with the specific intention of causing the provision of a financial service to a recipient, then it will meet the test of “arranging” (Databank (HC), Dogbreeders Associates and Donald Ford). Meaning of “advising thereon” used in section 3(1)(l) Section 3(1)(l) expressly excludes the activity of “advising thereon” from the concept of arranging a financial service, and therefore the “financial services” definition. If a service is advisory, then it is not an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). The courts in New Zealand (and overseas) have not considered the words “advising thereon”. However, the word “advice” has been considered. In JR Moodie Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1950\] 2 DLR 145 Rand J (at p.148) stated: The word “advice” in ordinary parlance means primarily the expression of counsel or opinion, favourable or unfavourable, as to action, but it may chiefly in commercial usage signify information or intelligence. The Concise Oxford Dictionary suggests two types of advising (being consistent with the Moodie decision). Advising that involves a degree of counsel or recommendation, and advising that merely involves notification; the dissemination of information. In one sense, the exclusion for “advising thereon” from the paragraph (l) activity of “agreeing to do, or arranging” other financial services activities, could be said not to apply to the mere provision of information to a client in order for that client to decide where the funds should be invested. However, it is possible to argue that the reference to “advising thereon” is in fact capable of wider meaning and also excludes (from financial services) the provision of information. To assist in settling this point it is necessary to consider the meaning of the word “thereon”. Comparing the meaning of “thereon” with the word “thereof” may also assist in determining the meaning to be applied to the phrase “advising thereon”. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (8 th ed.), for example, includes the following definitions: thereof adv. formal of that or it. thereon adv. archaic on that or it (of motion or position). on ... 14. concerning or about ... In the context in which the phrase “advising thereon” is used in section 3(1)(l), it is considered that it bears the more limited of the two possible meanings. That is, the exclusion for “advising thereon” requires more than mere notification of or the dissemination of information regarding the activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Rather it excludes activities involving a degree of interpretation of information, counsel or opinion relating to those activities. However, in the case of the information and reporting services provided by financial advisers or planners, many such services may well incorporate a range of the varying levels of advice. Given that, careful consideration will be necessary by advisers and planners to determine whether their particular services are, or are not, subject to the exclusion for “advising” on the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Even if an activity is not “advising”, it does not mean that it will automatically be a financial service or a supply of services exempt from GST. The requirement that the activity be itself a financial service or the arranging of a financial service, or “reasonably incidental and necessary” to a supply of an associated financial service (discussed below) must still be met. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 43 Meaning of “reasonably incidental and necessary” in section 14(1)(a) As referred to earlier in this statement, the supply of services that are “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of any financial service and supplied by the same supplier, are also exempt supplies under section 14(1)(a). The Act does not define the term “reasonably incidental and necessary” and there are no cases on the meaning of this particular phrase. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the ordinary usage of the component parts of this phrase. The Act does however import an element of reasonableness to both “incidental” and “necessary”, by the inclusion of the word “reasonably” in the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” itself. Most of the cases are fact-specific in their interpretations and indicate that what is “necessary” or “incidental” is largely a question to be decided on the particular facts of each case. The following summarises those interpretations. It can be reasoned that the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” is designed to measure two separate although related things: •Firstly, the level of association or connection between the type of financial services supplied and the type of other goods and services supplied which are under consideration, viz “incidental” (or “reasonably incidental”); and •Secondly, how essential or “necessary” the other goods or services are for that supply of financial services to occur. Were that not the case there would have been no need to include both elements in the phrase, as simply including the narrower of the two conjunctive tests would have been all that was needed. Parliament could not have enacted a provision that leads to absurdity or an incongruous result, requiring a lesser degree of connection (“reasonably incidental”) but at the same time be essential (“necessary”) for the supply of the financial service to occur. It is therefore considered that “reasonably” applies to both “incidental” and “necessary”. “Reasonably incidental” A number of cases have suggested that incidental means ancillary or consequential or provided in subordinate conjunction with something else. From these cases, the word “incidental” suggests that the service must be an associated service that is secondary to and that depends on a financial service as the main or primary service. It must be a consequence of a financial service or provided in conjunction with one of the financial services in section 3(1). The meaning of the words “reasonably incidental” is something more than that which has a mere casual, accidental, or fortuitous connection with the other item. It also means something more than an item that may only possibly or sometimes be associated with the other item. From the cases, the words suggest a service that it is reasonable to expect will be supplied or offered with the financial service. In the context of section 14(1)(a) a service that is “reasonably incidental” to the supply of a financial service is an associated service: •That is ancillary to (C and E Commissioners v CH Beazer (Holdings) plc (1989) 4 BVC 121 and C and E Commissioners v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd (CA) \[1997\] BVC 251), or occurs or is provided in subordinate conjunction with (Department of Health and Social Security v Envoy Farmers \[1976\] 1 WLR 1,018, Canadian National Railway v Harris \[1946\] 2 DLR 545, CH Beazer (Holdings), and Wellington Private Hospital), the financial service (i.e. is a service that is secondary to and dependent on the financial service as the primary service, and provided in combination or conjunction with that financial service); (see also Mindell v Canadian Northern Shield Insurance (1990) 43 CCLI 191, Re Fahy’s Will Trusts \[1962\] 1 All ER 73, AG v Pontypridd Urban District Council \[1906\] 2 Ch 257); and •That it is reasonable to expect the supplier to provide in the course of undertaking the supply of the financial service (CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 (PC)). Something is not “reasonably incidental” if it is merely desirable or profitable (Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council \[1991\] 1 All ER 545), or convenient or advantageously provided with the financial service rather than by necessary implication being incidental or accessory to it (AG v Manchester Corporation \[1906\] 1 Ch 643). \[Reasonably\] “necessary” The word “necessary” narrows the meaning of the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary”. The word “necessary” can be interpreted as having a wide or a narrow meaning. The Concise Oxford Dictionary definition imparts an ingredient of being essential to the activity being performed. However, there is an issue in terms of how essential the performance is in relation to the fulfilment of a specific activity. The case law is fact specific on this point and it is the actual context in which the term “necessary” appears that indicates in broad terms the degree of essentiality that the term “necessary” is designed to effect. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 44 For example, in Re an Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 \[1988\] 1 All ER 203 at 208, Lord Griffiths stated that “necessary” has a meaning that lies somewhere between “indispensable” on the one hand, and “useful” or “expedient” on the other, and suggested “really needed” as the meaning. In Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the word “necessarily” in the context of deductions required to be “necessarily incurred” under the income tax general deductions provision. McCarthy P in the leading judgment, disagreed with the High Court of Australia’s interpretation of “necessarily” in Ronpibon Tin NL & Tongkah Compound NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 and held that there was no justification for watering-down the usual meaning of the word. The Court of Appeal commented further on the meaning of “necessarily” in its subsequent decision, Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No.2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,238, stating that the word did not merely mean “clearly appropriate or adapted for” as was suggested in Ronpibon Tin. The Court of Appeal has therefore rejected a wider meaning for the word. The degree of necessity required for a non-financial service to be “reasonably incidental and necessary” to a financial service, on the basis of the context that “necessary” arises in section 14(1)(a), and also based on the comments of McCarthy P in Europa Oil (No.2), can be taken to mean that the provision of the service must be seen from the surrounding circumstances to be needed or required for the provision of a financial service stipulated in section 3(1). The meaning to be applied to the word “necessary” (qualified by “reasonably”) and the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” must also be considered in the context in which the words appear in the Act. That is, as an extension to an exemption, when the prima facie position under the Act is that all supplies are taxable unless made expressly exempt. This also indicates that the words should not be interpreted too widely. Summary – “reasonably incidental and necessary” In summary, for an additional non-financial service to be “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the provision of a financial service, it must be an associated service that: •Is of a type that it is reasonable to expect the supplier to provide in the course of undertaking the supply of the financial service, and that is secondary to and dependent on the financial service as the primary service, and supplied together with or as a consequence of that financial service; and •Can be seen from the surrounding circumstances to be needed or required for the supply of the financial service to the recipient. Apportionment of global fees Before discussing how the above legislative principles relating to the GST treatment of financial services apply, it is necessary to determine how global fees are to be apportioned. Where a global or combined fee is charged for several supplies of services, some of which are exempt supplies and some of which are standard-rated services, section 10(18) requires an apportionment of the fee between the taxable and exempt supplies: CIR v Smiths City Group Limited (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140. Under section 10(18), if a taxable supply is not the only supply to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. This interpretation statement has categorised the component parts of financial planning fees based on the process of obtaining an initial financial plan, subsequent monitoring of the plan, and any following adjustments or alterations to that plan. It is considered that if fees are charged by financial advisers on the basis of the description of these categories, then determining what amount is subject to GST will be on a more objective basis than the previous public ruling. In the event that a financial planner charges a global fee (e.g. performance fees) for some or all of the different supplies of services provided, an apportionment of that global fee, based on the categories discussed in this statement, will be required. The amount allocated to each category will be a question of fact in each case. As noted earlier, the label given to such a supply is not necessarily determinative of the nature of the supply. It is a question of fact what services are provided for the fee, and it is the actual services provided that will determine the GST treatment. Appropriate apportionment methods The object of any apportionment is to identify the part of the consideration that is “properly attributable” to the taxable supply in question. The answer can only depend on the circumstances of the particular case and must be fair and reasonable and not be arbitrary or based on mere speculation: Ronpibon Tin NL v FC of T; Tongkah NL v FC of T (1949) 78 CLR 47; 8 ATD 431; Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. The onus will be on the adviser to show that a defined part of the consideration is properly attributable to something other than a taxable supply, although absolute precision or scientific calculation of an amount is not required as long as there is some intelligible basis supporting the conclusion: Buckley & Young. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 45 Depending on the facts of the case, an appropriate method of apportioning the global fee may be to apply a “time apportionment method” using the adviser’s time spent carrying out the activity of each category of service provided. In apportioning such a global fee any clearly identifiable direct expenses (those that clearly relate to a specific category) not specified separately from the global fee, would usually first be deducted and put to that category. The remaining global fee would then be apportioned on the basis of the time spent carrying out the activity of each category of service provided (the time apportionment method). GST treatment of the particular services in the new categories Having discussed the legislative principles relating to the GST treatment of financial services generally, those principles will now be applied in relation to the seven separate financial planning fees categories. Initial planning fees These fees relate to services provided by the adviser from the initial interview stage up to the finalisation of the portfolio plan for the investor. Events leading up to this point may include the preparation of a draft plan, subsequent discussions with the investor, and adjustments to the draft until it is acceptable to the investor. Initial planning services do not come within any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1) and in particular paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka), which are the only ones in this group relevant to this statement. The only possibility is paragraph (l). In relation to paragraph (l), it is unlikely that initial planning services in this category would fall within the narrow interpretation of “arranging” as set out earlier in this statement. In many cases where an investor seeks initial planning services, it is not until the adviser completes the portfolio plan and it is approved and adopted by the investor that a final decision to invest is likely to be made. Activities undertaken before a decision to invest or a positive intention of entering into the transaction would appear too far removed and the provision of the financial service is too uncertain (not that it is essential for actual provision of a financial service to be the outcome). Initial planning services in the circumstances outlined would not be an arranging service that is tainted by the character of any other financial service the advisers may provide, as it is not closely connected to nor has the purpose of organising the provision of that financial service. To that extent, therefore, such initial planning activities would not come within the initial section 3(1)(l) requirement that they involve “agreeing to do or arranging” any of the paragraph (a) to (ka) activities. If that happens such activities have failed the first test, and the fact that they may also be excluded from being financial services by virtue of the subsequent “advising” criterion in paragraph (l) is of little relevance. Situations may exist where planning services meet the first requirement of agreeing to do or arranging. However, even if meeting the “arranging” requirement in paragraph (l), initial planning services will fall squarely within the ordinary meaning of “advising” and thus the general exclusion for advising activities in paragraph (l). In this connection, the preparation of the portfolio plan will certainly involve to a significant degree the provision of advice and suggestions or recommendations by the adviser. Initial planning services provided by advisers are not reasonably incidental and necessary to any supply of financial services on the basis outlined earlier in this statement. Services that are reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of any financial service (i.e. a supply coming within section 3(1)(a) to (l)) are also exempt supplies under section 14(1)(a). As outlined in the next section, where an adviser arranges implementation of an investment plan, once adopted by the investor those implementation services are generally financial services. However, the initial planning services are not an additional subordinate service arising out of, or provided in conjunction with and ancillary to, any implementation of that advice (i.e. a supply of financial services). The existence of the initial planning services is not dependent on the supply of those implementation services. Initial planning services are therefore not reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply by the adviser of any financial services. Initial planning services’ fees are subject to GST. They do not constitute financial services under any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of section 3(1), nor do these activities as undertaken by advisers generally constitute the “agreeing to do or arranging” of any of the paragraph (a) to (ka) activities in terms of paragraph (l). The initial planning services do involve advisers in “advising” the investor on an investment programme, and therefore come within the specific exclusion from the definition of a financial service in section 3(1)(l). Implementation fees This category relates to all fees for services associated with implementing the initial investment plan devised in the preceding section. They will include any one- off, up-front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the investments. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 46 The fees include payments to custodians on implementation of the plan or charges by fund managers for entry into the investments. These services are provided in relation to the placement of investments. The role played by the adviser in relation to the services may vary. In some cases the adviser may directly undertake the purchase or acquisition of investments whether they be debt securities, equity securities, or participatory securities. However, usually the adviser will engage another organisation (e.g. a broker) to implement the investment plan on the adviser’s instructions and place investments on behalf of the investor. This other organisation is often referred to as the “custodian”. As previously noted, the use of one or more intermediaries does not prevent the services provided by them from being financial services in terms of section 3(1)(l). To the extent that the adviser may directly undertake the purchase or acquisition of investments in the form of a debt security, equity security or participatory security, those implementation services constitute financial services in terms of section 3(1)(c), (d), and/or possibly paragraph (l). As such they are, therefore, exempt supplies. The activity of transferring ownership of such securities is itself a financial service under paragraphs (c) or (d). On the other hand, the implementation of the investor’s investment plan by the adviser organising the placement of the investments constitutes the arranging of that transfer of ownership activities in terms of paragraph (l). Such organising the placement of investments comes within the meaning of “arranging” as outlined earlier in this statement. In situations where a custodian implements the plan and acquires the particular investments on the instruction of the financial adviser, the fees charged by the adviser to the investor are also for an exempt supply of arranging financial services in terms of section 3(1)(l). The arranging service is tainted by the financial service’s character, as it is closely connected to and has the purpose of organising the provision of that financial service or causing it to occur. If the adviser uses a custodian (or other person or organisation) to place investments and passes on any of that person’s charges for this service to the investor as a disbursement, no GST consequences will arise for the adviser if the adviser is acting as the investor’s agent. Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made to an agent on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Under this section, a supply of services that the adviser receives as agent for a client investor is deemed to be supplied to the investor client, not to the adviser. If the adviser pays for the supply and the client investor reimburses the adviser for that payment, the reimbursement is not consideration for a supply of services by the adviser. The adviser does not have to account for GST output or input tax on the supply. The discussion on the GST consequences of disbursements was outlined in the item “Disbursements by professional firms on behalf of clients – GST” on page 5 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 1 (July 1994). Where the adviser incurs custodian’s charges in the capacity of principal, and on-charges the investor as part of an “implementation fee”, no GST output tax is payable by the adviser so long as the services supplied by the adviser in respect of that implementation fee are themselves still financial services. In this respect it is not the name given to the fee that determines the GST treatment but the actual nature of the services provided. NB. Whether the adviser is acting in the capacity of principal (or agent of the investor) will be established based on the facts. That is, the nature of the contract or arrangements between the parties. Implementation services will be financial services under section 3(1)(c), (d), and/or (l), and as such they are exempt supplies under section 14(1)(a). Administration fees These fees are generally described by advisers as “annual on-going” fees. They are charged by the adviser in respect of services provided in, and to cover costs of, maintaining records of the investor’s transactions with the adviser. They are also in respect of services and charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with an administrator, bank charges, and other administration fees. Any fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging these to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s bank account are also included. The different activities or services described as falling within the administration fees category are addressed individually. Income collection and distribution Fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging these to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s bank account, may generally be accepted as falling within the wording of section 3(1)(ka). That is, “the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 47 This is on the basis that the amounts concerned relate to investments in a debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract. Alternatively, if part of the activities performed by the adviser in collecting investment income and arranging payment or crediting to the investor’s account (as described in this fees category) do not fall entirely within section 3(1)(ka), then they usually constitute financial services within paragraph (l). That is, the activities would fall within “arranging” one of the activities specified in the earlier paragraphs of section 3(1). This is on the basis that the particular service involved actively carrying out a service prior to the actual payment of an amount in respect of the investment. There is a direct nexus between the adviser doing this and the actual payment of an amount in respect of the investments, which is a financial service within paragraph (ka) of section 3(1). If a person other than the adviser (e.g. custodian or investment administrator) performs the income collection and distribution activities under consideration in this part of the statement, those activities would generally be financial services in terms of either section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l). Cash handling services and charges Services and charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with an administrator, bank charges, etc., are also considered initially under section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l). This is on the basis that the “investor’s cash” referred to relates to money either arising from investment income, investment sales or withdrawals, or provided by the investor to make initial, additional or new investments. Furthermore, the same person or organisation undertakes both the cash handling services and the associated income collection and distribution services or investment placement services (or the arranging of such services), whether it is the adviser or administrator, etc. Subject to the money concerned relating to investments of the type specified in paragraph (ka), the activities referred to can be considered to come within the wording in the paragraph: ... payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of ... To the extent that it could be argued that part of the cash handling activities referred to may not directly involve “payment or collection of ... or other amount whatever”, it is considered they could come within section 3(1)(l) as being involved with the arranging of such activities. A direct nexus exists between the adviser or administrator doing this and the actual payment of an amount in respect of the investments. On the other hand, it could be argued that the cash handling activities are not always a precursor to the payment or collection of the investor’s interest, principal, dividend or other amount or “cause that collection or payment to occur” and are therefore not “arranging”. However, even if the cash handling activities referred to do not constitute arranging, they would still qualify as an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). That is on the grounds that they are “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the Income collection and distribution services element of the administration fees already stated to be a financial service. Without the cash handling services and investor accounts, the adviser or administrator would be unable to undertake the financial service of collecting and processing distributions for investors; those distributions being placed in each investor’s “cash holding account”. Maintaining such investors’ accounts is essential to the adviser or administrator being able to supply the service of income collection and distribution for investors. Consequently, cash handling activities are regarded as being reasonably incidental and necessary to the Income collection and distribution services element of the administration services that are a financial service supplied by the same person. On that basis, to the extent there is doubt as to these services qualifying as financial services under section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l), they would still qualify as an exempt supply in terms of section 14(1)(a). That is, they are reasonably incidental and necessary to the Income collection and distribution services element of the administration fees already stated to be a financial service. Maintaining records of the investor’s transactions with the adviser To the extent that these activities relate to records of cash transactions between the adviser and investor, the reasoning and conclusions outlined in the previous section will apply equally here. This is on the basis that both the records maintenance activity and the associated income collection and distribution services and/or investment placement services (or the arranging of such activities), to which the cash transactions relate, are undertaken by the same person or company, whether it is adviser or administrator, etc. Where this occurs, this part of the administration fee activities will constitute an exempt supply. That will be either by virtue of being a financial service under section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l) or a supply of a service that under section 14(1)(a) is reasonably incidental and necessary to those other supplies making up the administration fee services as described (which in themselves are financial supplies supplied by the same person or company). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 48 The position may be somewhat different where the maintaining of transaction records’ activity referred to is undertaken by someone other than the person or company maintaining and operating the investor’s investment cash account (or carrying out income collection and distribution or investment placement services). In that situation, the maintaining of transaction records could not be a supply of services that are reasonably incidental and necessary to another supply of services that are financial services as required by section 14(1)(a). If the transaction records relate to the placing of investments and/or implementation of an investment plan (the undertaking or arranging of which it is considered is a financial service under section 3(1)(c), (d) and/or (l)), then (subject to the above comments) the keeping of such records is reasonably incidental and necessary to those other services. The keeping of such records would be essential as opposed to merely being a desirable adjunct to such activities. Summary Based on the activities making up the administration fee category being as described, the services provided in relation to administration fees constitute exempt supplies either: •by virtue of being financial services coming within one of the paragraphs in section 3(1); or •by being reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of those financial services in terms of section 14(1)(a). Monitoring fees Monitoring fees are the annual charges for services provided in monitoring and reporting to the investor on the performance of the portfolio (including the performance of the fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals. The adviser will from time to time prepare reports on the portfolio’s performance and relay this information to the investor. Earlier in this statement, it was concluded that the context in which the word “advising” is used in the phrase “advising thereon” in section 3(1)(l) indicates the more limited of two possible meanings. That is, the exclusion for advising thereon requires more than mere notification of or the dissemination of information regarding the financial service activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Rather it excludes activities involving a degree of interpretation of information, counsel or opinion relating to those activities. Based on the description of monitoring services outlined, such services will not usually be subject to the “advising thereon” exclusion from financial services within the terms of section 3(1)(l). However, as indicated earlier, some information and reporting services provided by financial advisers or planners may well incorporate levels of advice that fall inside the meaning attributed to the exclusion for advising on the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Careful consideration will, therefore, be necessary to determine whether particular services are, or are not, subject to the exclusion. As discussed, even if an activity is not “advising” it does not mean that it will automatically be a supply of services that is exempt from GST. The requirement that the activity itself be a financial service or the arranging of a financial service, or reasonably incidental and necessary to a supply of an associated financial service still has to be met. Based on the earlier criteria in this statement for satisfying the “agreeing to do, or arranging” requirements in section 3(1)(l), the monitoring services do not meet those tests. Neither are monitoring services reasonably incidental and necessary to another supply of services which is itself a financial service. On this basis, monitoring fees will be regarded as not constituting a financial service in terms of section 3(1) or an exempt supply in terms of section 14(1)(a) and are therefore subject to GST. Evaluation fees This category includes fees relating to services involving subsequent evaluations of the portfolio’s performance, where the investor generally seeks confirmation that an already established portfolio is matching the goals set by either the investor or at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of performance of the portfolio than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the client. It may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes to investments within the portfolio to maintain the aims established in the initial planning stage. Evaluation fees arise where the investor already has an existing portfolio and seeks advice to make changes to the income producing structure but not to the aims or goals of that structure. The services covered by these fees can be compared with and are similar in nature to some of those provided under the Initial planning fee category discussed earlier, in particular the provision of advice relating to future investment options and preparation of an investment plan. As such the GST treatment of evaluation fees is reasonably clear and is in line with that applying to Initial planning fee services. That is, the services do not come within any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1) and in particular paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka), which are the only ones in this group relevant to this statement. The only possibility is paragraph (l). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 49 However, to the extent that these evaluation fee services do happen to involve agreeing to do, or arranging any of the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka), the services would fall squarely within the “advising” exclusion in section 3(1)(l). Evaluation fees are therefore subject to GST. Re-planning fees The category includes fees relating to services involving a re-planning of a portfolio sometimes arising from Evaluation fees services due to changes to the investor’s objectives. This could be a minor change or a complete restructuring of investments and a change in investment strategy. Re-planning fees do not necessarily refer to advice supplied by the same adviser. The fees could be for advice by an adviser to a new client who had previously managed his or her own portfolio or had previously engaged a different adviser. The category could include any other fees for services as described in Initial planning fees above, when a complete restructuring of investments has occurred. As the name suggests, a re-planning could involve the restructuring of the current portfolio to meet the investor’s existing or changed investment goals and usually includes recommendations or suggestions for future investment. The services covered by these fees are very similar to those in the Evaluation fees category above, except that re-planning fees arise when there is a change in the investor’s investment objectives. The distinction is that Evaluation fees relate to looking at performance against original objectives whereas re-planning fees involve looking at new objectives and what changes are needed to achieve that. The services covered by re-planning fees do not include those relating to actual implementation of changes, which will come within the Switching fees category below. The GST treatment for services in the re-planning fee category is therefore the same as for Evaluation fees and the analysis is in line with that applying to Initial planning fee services. That is, the services do not come within any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1) and in particular paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka), which are the only ones in this group relevant to this statement. The only possibility is paragraph (l). However, to the extent that these services do happen to involve agreeing to do, or arranging any of the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka), the services would fall squarely within the “advising” exclusion in section 3(1)(l). Re-planning fees are therefore subject to GST. Switching fees These fees relate to the costs involved in selling existing investments and/or purchasing new investments arising from a recommendation by the adviser as a result of services suppled in relation to the two preceding fee categories (Evaluation fees and Re-planning fees). The fees will be charged by the adviser for services provided in changing investments within the portfolio, and will include any fees for services relating to the withdrawal in whole or in part from the then existing portfolio. The services provided for these fees have close similarities to those in the Implementation fees category, and in fact will include many that are the same. In particular up-front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the new investments will arise in both the implementation fees and switching fees categories. The same can be said for payments to custodians (on implementation of any amended plan), or charges by fund managers for entry into new investments. Section 3(1) will apply to services in the switching fees category, in the same way as it applied to those services in the implementation fees category. The analysis relating to the application of the law to these services is the same. The activity of transferring ownership of debt, equity, or participatory securities is a financial service under section 3(1)(c) or (d). To the extent that the adviser directly undertakes the sale or purchase of such securities as part of a switching of investments exercise, those switching services constitute financial services in terms of section 3(1)(c), (d) and/or paragraph (l). As such they are, therefore, exempt supplies. If a custodian implements an amended plan and switches or changes the particular investments on the instruction of the financial adviser, the fees charged by the adviser to the investor are also for an exempt supply of arranging financial services in terms of section 3(1)(l). This is in line with the conclusions drawn earlier as to the meaning of “arranging”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 50 Examples These examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 Financial Adviser prepares an initial portfolio plan, and charges Investor $2,000 for it. Investor decides to accept the plan, and asks Financial Adviser to arrange with Custodian for its implementation. Financial Adviser asks, on Investor’s behalf and as Investor’s agent, for Custodian to implement the plan. Custodian’s fee is charged to Investor by an invoice sent to Financial Adviser. Financial Adviser passes the invoice on to Investor. Custodian’s fee is $1,500, additional to the $2,000 charged by Financial Adviser. The $2,000 Financial Adviser charges Investor is for a taxable supply of initial planning services. The advice falls either outside the agreeing to do or arranging requirement, or within the “advising” exclusion, in paragraph (l) of the section 3(1) definition of “financial services”. Financial Adviser must account for GST output tax on the supply. Passing on Custodian’s invoice to Investor has no GST implications for Financial Adviser, because Financial Adviser is simply the agent of Investor. Custodian’s services are exempt supplies of implementation services and no GST output tax needs to be returned by Custodian. Example 2 Six months after implementing the plan, Financial Adviser passes on to Investor dividend income collected on Investor’s behalf. Financial Adviser also conducts an evaluation of the investment portfolio’s performance. Financial Adviser charges a small commission of $50 for collecting the dividend income and $250 for the evaluation service. The $50 charge for collecting dividends is consideration for an exempt supply under section 3(1)(ka). Financial Adviser does not need to return GST on the amount. The $250 for the portfolio review is an evaluation service and as such is within the “advising” exclusion in section 3(1)(l) and therefore subject to GST. Financial Adviser must return GST output tax on this amount. Example 3 Financial Adviser has prepared a portfolio plan (involving debt, equity, and participatory securities within the meaning of section 3) that Investor asks Financial Adviser as agent to arrange with Custodian to implement. Financial Adviser maintains a record of transactions between Investor, Financial Adviser and Custodian relating to investment purchases and placement, sales/withdrawals and collection, and distribution of investment income to Investor. Financial Adviser undertakes collection and distribution of investment income and operates a cash account for Investor through which movement of funds is recorded. Financial Adviser charges an annual on-going fee of $500 for the record administration and maintaining the account for Investor, plus an income collection and distribution commission of 5% of the investment income collected. The 5% commission for collecting investment income is an exempt supply, being in respect of a financial service under section 3(1)(ka). The annual on-going fee of $500 for services in administering Investor’s records and cash account is not in respect of a financial service under any of the paragraphs of section 3(1). However, those services would be regarded as being reasonably incidental and necessary to the financial service of payment or collection of interest, dividends, principal (section 3(1)) and/or to an extent, the arranging of the investment placement portfolio implementation financial service (section 3(1)(l)), and thus would be an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). Financial Adviser does not need to return GST on either of these fee amounts. Comments on technical submissions received Some comments received in the course of producing this item suggested that the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” appearing in section 14(1)(a) should be interpreted as meaning highly expedient and that other narrower meanings for the phrase given in the draft item, such as an integral part of, were inconsistent with that wider meaning. These comments led us to review the cases used to determine the meaning of the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary”. That review concluded that the previous range of meanings given for the phrase was too wide. The cases, in particular Databank, Re an Inquiry, and Europa Oil (No.2), together with the context in which the provision incorporating the phrase appears in the Act, show that the meaning of the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” is not as wide as the words highly expedient suggest. The cases and legislative context also indicate that the meaning of the phrase is not as narrow as the words an integral part of suggests. The Commissioner’s view of the meaning of the phrase is as set out earlier in the interpretation statement, and is considered to describe more clearly now what the cases have interpreted as the goods and services that come within the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary”.

DETERMINATION: AMOUNT OF A SPECIFIED WITHHOLDING PAYMENT (BEING HONORARIA PAID TO SCHOOL TRUSTEES) THAT SHALL BE REGARDED AS EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN PRODUCTION OF PAYMENT Introduction This Determination sets out the amount regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of specified withholding payments when those payments are honoraria paid to school trustees. Section NC 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires anyone who makes a source deduction payment to deduct tax when making it. Under section OB 2 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 a withholding payment is included in the definition of “source deduction payments”. Consequently, any person who makes a withholding payment must deduct tax from it at the time it is made, unless an exemption applies. Honoraria paid to school trustees come within the definition of “withholding payment” in the Income Tax (Withholding Payment) Regulations 1979. The regulations require withholding tax of 33% to be deducted from honoraria. Regulation 7 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any specified withholding payment that is considered to be expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. If the Commissioner has made such a determination, the person paying the specified withholding payment is only required to deduct tax from the amount that exceeds this threshold. Application This Determination applies to payments made to school trustees (honoraria) for each board meeting attended, up to a maximum of 11 meetings a year. It applies: –to honoraria paid on or after 1 April 2001, and –until the Commissioner varies or revokes this determination. Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax (Withholding Payment) Regulations 1979 and sections NC 2 and OB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Determination When any trustee receives honoraria for attendance at a board meeting, the sum of $55 per member, or $75 for the chair, shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the payment. The maximum annual amount of the specified withholding payment shall not exceed $605 per member, or $825 for the chair. However, if the trustee receives any reimbursement (in addition to honoraria) for expenditure incurred to attend that meeting, the amount exempted under this determination ($55 or $75 for the chair) shall be reduced by the amount of that additional reimbursement. This Determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Determination is signed on the 13 July 2001. Raju Budhia (Acting) National Manager Technical Standards Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 52 Examples Example 1 The chair receives honoraria of $75 a meeting. No payment is made in respect of any expenditure incurred, for example, travel. The payer does not have to deduct withholding tax because the total payment does not exceed $75. Example 2 The chair receives a total payment of $95, made up of an honorarium of $70 and reimbursement of travel expenses of $25. The payer must deduct withholding tax from $20 (honorarium of $70 reduced by the difference between the exemption allowed under the determination ($75) and the additional reimbursement ($25)).

These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER WAIVER OF TIME BAR FOR ASSESSMENT EFFECTIVE Case:CIR v Vela Fishing Limited Decision date:3 July 2001 Acts:Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1976 Summary The CIR was successful in his appeal from the High Court decision of Penlington J reported at \[2001\] 1 NZLR 437; (2000) 19 NZTC 15,885. Facts The taxpayer was subject to an audit. In February 1998 the 31 March time bar was approaching for the 1991 year. The taxpayer signed a waiver under section 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”), extending time to 30 September 1998. Inland Revenue reassessed on 30 September. The taxpayer then contended that the waiver was ineffective, because it applied only to time bars established under the TAA and not to time bars which existed under earlier legislation (the Income Tax Act 1976). Therefore, the taxpayer said that the assessment was out of time. Decision The Court held that section 227(4) TAA required the reference to the 1994 time bar provision (section 108 TAA) in section 108B (the provision authorising waivers) also to be read as a reference to the 1976 time bar provision (section 25 Income Tax Act 1976). Therefore, the waiver extended the period for the CIR to assess in this case. The Court said: “The question, then, is whether there is correspondence in that broad sense in relation to the times, circumstances or purposes as regards the continuing operation of s25. We have no hesitation in holding it to be a corresponding provision to the new s108. It has the same character and function. It pre-supposes the amendment of assessments within the time limit. During the four years the amendment function will be exercised as the statute provides. That is intended in each case and s25 and the new s108 are intended to produce that result. The altering of assessments during the 4 year period is something which is “to be done under or for the purposes of, that corresponding provision”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 54 APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW; APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED Decision His Honour, Chambers J, dealt with the standing of Floorlines first. He held that, as the company had been struck off, it would need to apply for reinstatement but, in any event, that was not to delay Mr Duncan’s proceeding against the Commissioner. Only if it were reinstated could a separate application for review be entertained. In the meantime its present application was to be struck out. On the Rule 478 matter, his Honour held that there was no evidence to exculpate the applicants. There had in fact been inordinate delay and it was inexcusable. His Honour noted, however, that as the review could proceed on affidavit evidence only, there was no prejudice to the Commissioner and the matter should proceed. Under Rule 477, the Commissioner submitted that the review application was without merit, and the claim so untenable it could not succeed. His Honour noted: “I do not know whether Mr Duncan will be able to substanti- ate the allegations he has made. If they are true, however, then at least some of them may be the stuff of judicial review. It may be that Mr Duncan could have taken these points when he followed the statutory objection route ... It is common ground, however, that he did not then take these points.” However, the fact that Mr Duncan (and Floorlines) had withdrawn their objections rather than having a court decide the issues, meant that the Commissioner could not rely on issue/cause of action estoppel or the extended doctrine of res judicata. His Honour held that the Commissioner had not established that judicial review was hopeless on the established facts. His Honour struck out the Floorlines claim and made orders that: •Mr Duncan was to file a separate statement of claim on his own behalf, containing no new allegations. •The new statement was to be simplified and the prayers for “ancillary orders” were to be deleted. •The Commissioner may oppose any “fresh prejudice” the amended statement of claim may raise. •Mr Duncan must seek the Commissioner’s approval to file two affidavits in support. If that is not given (the Commissioner has only viewed drafts at this time), leave of the Court must be obtained. Case:Floorlines (NZ) Ltd and W A Duncan v CIR Decision date:19 June 2001 Act:Judicature Amendment Act 1972 Keywords:Judicial review, delay, striking-out, leave to proceed Summary Chambers J struck out Floorlines (NZ) Ltd’s judicial review application but granted Mr Duncan leave to proceed. Facts The Commissioner assessed Mr Duncan, and one of his companies, Floorlines (NZ) Limited (“Floorlines”), for tax on undisclosed income in the years 1967–1978. The investigation was prolonged and revealed many anomalies in the way company profits were accounted for. As it became apparent that substantial amounts had been diverted to various staff “welfare” funds, and then to Mr Duncan, the Commissioner issued section 400 notices to recover tax from him and his companies. The assessments were amended a number of times as the ongoing investigation revealed further facts. Mr Duncan objected to the assessments and penalties and the matter went before Thorpe J in the late 1970s. After cross-examination of Mr Duncan, Thorpe J indicated that he had not made out his case and that he should reconsider his position. Mr Duncan then withdrew his objection and the matter went no further. In 1990 Mr Duncan instructed new counsel who initiated the present judicial review proceedings on the basis that the assessments were “irrational” and “arbitrary”. Various judicial conferences followed at which the judges directed Mr Duncan to apply to have Floorlines reinstated to the register of companies. Floorlines had been struck off in 1990 upon the Commissioner’s application and has not since been reinstated. Counsel for the applicants moved in mid-2000 for leave of the court to continue the proceeding under Rule 426A of the High Court Rules. The Commissioner counter-applied to have the matters struck out under High Court Rules 477 (no reasonable cause of action) and 478 (inordinate delay/prejudice). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 55 As to costs, his Honour said: “While the Commissioner was unsuccessful in having Mr Duncan’s proceeding dismissed, I do not think it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to have to pay costs to Mr Duncan. Mr Duncan has been guilty of inordinate and inexcusable delay. He is permitted to continue his proceeding but that is an indulgence.” Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001) 56 REGULAR FEATURES August 2001 6Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 31GST return and payment due September 2001 5Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 28GST return and payment due DUE DATES REMINDER These dates are taken from Inland Revenue’s Smart business tax due date calendar 2001–2002 Name Address Public rulingComment deadline PU2956: Payments made by parents or guardians of students to state schools –31 August 2001 GST treatment.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 3 THIS MONTH’S OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO COMMENT Inland Revenue produces a number of statements and rulings aimed at explaining how taxation law affects taxpayers and their agents. Because we are keen to produce items that accurately and fairly reflect taxation legislation, and are useful in practical situations, your input into the process—as perhaps a user of that legislation—is highly valued. The following draft item is available for review/comment this month, having a deadline of 1 October 2001.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/16 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by First Mortgage Managers Limited (FMM). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the definition of “beneficiary income” contained in section OB 1, and sections NF 1 to NF 3. This ruling expressly does not consider or rule on the potential (if any) for application of section BG 1 to the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of a Group Investment Fund (referred to as “GIF”) under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The GIF is to be known as the First Mortgage Trust Group Investment Fund (referred to as “FMGIF” or “the Fund”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The initial funds to be invested in the Fund will be derived from a unit trust, First Mortgage Trust, that is currently being managed by the applicants. 2.The Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited (trading as Tower Trust) will establish FMGIF. First Mortgage Trust will then be wound up following the redemption of the units outstanding at market value. Investors will then invest the funds obtained from the redemption in FMGIF. 3.The Fund will be governed by a trust deed dated 20 February 2001. This trust deed has been drafted in a manner that purports to limit the investment activities of the Fund to the types of investments listed in paragraphs (a) to (j) of section 4 of the Trustee Act 1956 (read and construed as if the Trustee Amendment Act 1988 had not been enacted). 4.In confining its investment activity to those investments listed in paragraphs (a) to (j) of section 4 of the Trustee Act 1956, the proposed GIF will be a “designated GIF” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. 5.The Fund will be governed by a trust deed. Clause 268 of the deed defines the authorised investments of the Fund as: “authorised investments” to the extent to which the trustee is lawfully permitted from time to time to hold such investments for the purposes of the fund, means: 1 . cash, deposits with, loans to, or other debt securities of any bank whether secured or unsecured 2 . loans made upon security of any mortgages or mortgage backed securities 3 . the acquisition of any mortgage backed securities by way of transfer or assignment of the mortgage or chargeholder’s interest in the mortgage or security 4. property which comes into the possession ownership or control of the trustee by virtue of the exercise of the powers authorities and discretions vested in the trustee by any mortgage backed security held by the trustee 5 . public sector securities 6. derivatives 7 . any trust (including a unit trust under the Unit Trusts Act 1960) which invests primarily or wholly in one or more of the investments referred to in the preceding bullet points Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 5 provided that until such time as the manager and the trustee agree to the contrary the fund shall: •primarily be invested in loans upon the security of mortgages and mortgage backed securities; and •only be invested in investments in which a group investment fund is permitted to invest in order to fall within the definition of a designated group investment fund as defined in section OBI of the Income Tax Act 1994, with the intent that unless agreed by the parties to the contrary the fund shall always be a designated group investment fund for taxation purposes. 6.The trustee of this GIF will be The Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited (trading as Tower Trust). Section 29 of the Trustee Companies Act 1967 allows a “Trustee company”, as defined in section 2 of that Act, to establish a GIF. The trustee is a Trustee company as defined in section 2. 7.The manager (and also the applicant) of First Mortgage Trust Group Investment Fund is FMM. FMM is a company operating out of Tauranga. This company currently manages a unit trust called the First Mortgage Trust. First Mortgage Trust is an amalgam of investors in the nominee companies of the three founding law firms, Sharp Tudhope, Holland Beckett Maltby, and Cooney Lees & Morgan. Since then it has acquired the activities of a further five law firms’ nominee companies in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato. Investments are also directly lodged with First Mortgage Trust by independent investors. 8.The rationale behind the establishment of this “designated GIF” as an investment vehicle is to enable each New Zealand resident unitholder to be effectively taxed at source at their marginal rate on any resident withholding income they derive from the Fund as beneficiaries of the trust. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)That the discretion contained in clause 268 will not be exercised to allow investments to be made by FMGIF, which are not investments that a “designated GIF” can invest in as referred to in the definition of “designated group investment fund” contained in section OB 1. b)That the power to amend as contained in clause 253 will not be exercised in any way so as to affect the “designated GIF” status of the Fund. c)The beneficiaries will be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •To the extent that any gross income derived during an income year by the trustee vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary, or is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during or within six months after the end of the income year, it will be “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and gross income of the beneficiary under section HH 3(1). •Pursuant to the provisions of sections NF 1, NF 2, and NF 3, if the trustees hold a certificate of exemption and no resident withholding tax has been deducted from resident withholding income, that they receive and distribute as beneficiary income, the trustees will be under an obligation to deduct resident withholding tax at the appropriate rate from the resident withholding income paid to the beneficiary unless the beneficiary provides a certificate of exemption. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31 st day of May 2001.

DAIRY FARM MILKING SHED BUILDING, PLANT & MACHINERY DRAFT GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION Please quote reference: DDG00014 In Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000) we published an interpretation statement setting out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of certain dairy farm expenditure relating to the operation of the dairy shed complex and the various items of plant and equipment found in the dairy shed. That statement did not address depreciation issues and said that depreciation rates for the assets identified in the statement would be set in due course. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination for the identified assets that will insert new asset classes into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category and also where applicable into the “Dairy Plant” industry category. The existing asset class for “Milking machinery” in the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category will be deleted. The draft determination therefore proposes to: •Delete the existing asset class “Milking machinery” and general depreciation rate of 22% diminishing value (“DV”) and 15.5% straight-line (“SL”) from the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category; •Insert a new asset class “Milking plant” with a general depreciation rate of 15% DV and 10% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. The milking plant consists of all items of the milking line plant and machinery commencing with the cups attached to the cow and ending with the pipe from which the milk flows into the milk storage vat, and includes those items making up the milk extraction and cleansing units. A more detailed description of the items included in this asset class is contained in the interpretation statement in TIB Vol 12, No 2; •Insert a new asset class “Wash down unit ” with a general depreciation rate of 18% DV and 12.5% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. The wash down unit is used for washing down the dairy shed surfaces and yards and external surfaces of other plant such as the milking plant. The wash down unit comes in two broad types, either a fixed unit, to which the above rates will apply, or a portable wash down unit, the depreciation rates for which are set out below; •Insert a new asset class “Wash down unit (portable)” with a general depreciation rate of 50% DV and 40% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. This asset class refers to the portable water blasters that are used by some farmers for wash down purposes; •Insert a new asset class “Water heaters” with a general depreciation rate of 15% DV and 10% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. This asset class refers to the water heaters or hot water cylinders for heating water for cleaning the milking plant, milk vat, etc; •Insert new asset classes “Milk storage vat/silo” and “Milk storage vat/silo (on farm)” with a general depreciation rate of 12% DV and 8% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” and “Dairy plant” industry categories respectively. The milk storage vat/ silo is sometimes called a milk storage tank or bulk milk tank and includes colostrum vats. It is the farm milk storage vat/silo together with its integral components such as refrigerant pads (or coils in older units), valves, temperature gauges, stirrers, load cells and any other integral components, but not including the refrigerant compressor which is a separate asset class, the depreciation rates for which are set out below; Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 7 •Insert new asset classes “Compressor (refrigerant)” and “Compressor (refrigerant) (on farm)” with a general depreciation rate of 15% DV and 10% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” and “Dairy plant” industry categories respectively. The refrigerant compressor although linked to the refrigerant pad on the milk vat/silo is a separate asset class; •Insert a new asset class “Rotary dairy shed milking platforms (turntables)” with a general depreciation rate of 7.5% DV and 5.5% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. The rotary dairy shed milking platforms or turntables are currently of two main types, floating platforms and conventional rotary platforms. This asset class consists of the rotary platform together with its attached steel pipe work to enclose and separate the cows, the drive mechanism and associated electric motor. A more detailed description of the items included in this asset class is contained in the interpretation statement in TIB Vol 12, No 2; •Insert a new asset class “Dairy shed and yard (including pipe work bails, railings and gates)” with a general depreciation rate of 6% DV and 4% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. This asset class consists of the dairy or milking shed itself together with yard and includes pipe work surrounds, bails, railings, barriers and gates (including the backing gate and its motorised drive unit). A more detailed description of the items included in this asset class is contained in the interpretation statement; •Insert a new asset class “Teat sprayers (automatic)” with a general depreciation rate of 26% DV and 18% SL into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category. Automatic teat sprayers consist of a pump and piping, and a spray unit with an automatic activation sensor. The interpretation statement on the deductibility of dairy shed complex expenditure in TIB Vol 12, No 2 also discussed the treatment of the dairy farm electricity reticulation system. As outlined in the statement, the cost of overhead lines is able to be “amortised” (under section DO 4) at 10% DV in line with clause 14 of Part A of the Seventh Schedule. The draft depreciation determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as set out in the determination and residual values of 13.5% of cost as required by section EG 4(3).

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 9 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. FUNERAL EXPENSES PAID BY FUNERAL DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – section 60(2) – supply to an agent The service provided by funeral directors to their clients is the making of arrangements for funerals. That service would necessarily include arrangements for the burial or cremation. Funeral directors may also enter into contracts with third parties for goods or services (including arrangements for newspaper advertisements, flowers, the printing of the order of service, purchase of burial plots, the minister or organist’s services) but normally these arrangements would be made only at the request of the clients. Funeral directors generally make payments to the third parties (who may in some cases be non-registered persons) and recover the costs from their clients. We have been asked whether funeral directors act as agents of their clients in respect of the supply of goods or services such as: •advertising of funeral notices •flowers for the funeral service •printing of the order of service •purchase of burial plots, and •minister or organist’s services and what is the correct GST treatment of such transactions. Are funeral directors agents? The same criteria apply in all situations where it is necessary to decide whether a person has acted as an agent on behalf of another person for GST purposes. Unless there are specific arrangements to the contrary, such goods or services would be acquired from third parties by funeral directors as agents for their clients as: •the goods or services would not be supplied unless requested by the clients, and •the clients would be aware that the goods or services will be supplied by third parties, and •the funeral directors would be authorised (expressly or implicitly) to acquire the goods or services on behalf of the clients. What is the correct GST treatment? Section 60(2) deems a supply of goods or services to an agent on behalf of a principal to be made to the principal. The effect of section 60(2) is that the agent “drops out” of the transaction. For GST purposes the supply of goods or services by a third party to a funeral director as agent for a client would be treated as a supply to the client and not to the funeral director. The correct GST treatment of the transactions would be: •The funeral director would not add GST to the disbursement paid on behalf of a client as the disbursement would not be paid for a supply made by the funeral director: Section 8(1). However, if a funeral director required payment of an amount exceeding the disbursement paid on behalf of the client, the amount charged in excess of the costs paid (however described in the invoice) would normally be considered to be part of the fee for services supplied by the funeral director. This presumption would be subject to the terms of the agreement between the funeral director and the client so that if the agreed fee is a specific amount, GST would be chargeable by the funeral director on that amount. A written quotation accepted by the client would be evidence of the agreed fee for the funeral director’s services. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 10 •The funeral director would not be entitled to an input tax credit on the supply of goods or services acquired on behalf of a client as the supply would not be made to the funeral director and would not relate to goods or services “acquired” by the funeral director: Sections 3A and 20(3). Even if funeral directors acquired services as principals, input tax credits are not allowable on services supplied by non-registered persons. An input tax credit may be allowable on the sale of “secondhand goods” by non-registered persons to funeral directors as principals. “Secondhand goods” are goods which have been previously owned and used for their intrinsic purpose by a previous owner: Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142; L R McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. For example, flowers would not be “secondhand goods” for GST purposes since their previous use for their intrinsic purpose would normally result in their no longer being regarded as new. Therefore, an input tax credit would not be allowable to funeral directors on flowers acquired from a non-registered person, whether acquired by funeral directors as a principal or agent. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 11 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER PAYMENT IN SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM WAS CAPITAL OR REVENUE Case:TRA022/00 Decision Number: 006/01 Decision date:11 July 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1994, Goods & Services Tax Act 1985 Summary The Taxation Review Authority found for the Commissioner. Facts The Disputant operated a kiwifruit packhouse and storage facility. In 1987 the Disputant purchased an AWA links grading machine (“the fruit processing machine”) from F Limited for $380,500 plus GST. The Disputant alleged that the fruit processing machine did not perform to the standards set out in its purchase contract and accordingly, in March 1993, filed a Statement of Claim against F Ltd as supplier and A Ltd as manufacturer. The Statement of Claim pleaded breach of contract against F Ltd and A Ltd, misrepresentation against F Ltd and negligence against A Ltd. The Disputant (as Plaintiff) claimed that its resulting loss or damage was $1,050,561.25. Before the matter reached court the parties entered into a mediation. This led to an out of court settlement with a denial of liability, whereby the Disputant received $170,000 from A Ltd and $100,000 from F Ltd. The Disputant treated this receipt as a non-taxable capital receipt in its accounts to 31 December 1995. However the Commissioner assessed the settlement payment as income. Decision Judge Barber found that the character of the settlement payment in this case must be ascertained by an examination of the legal documents and circumstances surrounding the payment, in other words, from an examination of the Statement of Claim and the Mediation Agreement with its attached Settlement Agreement. His Honour examined the purpose of the mediation as stated in the recitals to the Mediation Agreement and found that the recitals accurately reflected what happened, namely, that the resolution sought was of the matters covered in the Statement of Claim. His Honour held that the Settlement Agreement expressly provided that the settlement payment was to settle disputes in connection with the Statement of Claim. His Honour also held that the Disputant could not now seek to go behind its own documents. For Judge Barber the determining factor was the purpose of the payment. His Honour found that where the Settlement Agreement represented the entire agreement between the parties, their individual and uncommunicated reasons for entering the agreement were irrelevant. His Honour held that the purpose of the payment was to settle the claim. Judge Barber then examined whether the settlement payment was income or capital and held that that question depended upon whether it was paid to compensate for a loss of capital or revenue. His Honour found that the payment was made to compensate the Disputant for the items in the Statement of Claim and so the payment attracted the same character as those items. His Honour found that the items in this case were clearly revenue in character. In reaching this decision Judge Barber compared the facts in this case to the similar case of Omihi Lime Company v CIR \[1964\] NZLR 731 (SC). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 12 Judge Barber found that there was no evidence of a permanent loss of capital which could be said to be replaced by the settlement payment, and even if there had been, the evidence disclosed that this was not what the settlement payment was for. The Disputant sought damages for loss of profit and repair costs for the non-performance of the fruit processing machine and that was a claim for lost revenue. The Disputant argued inter alia that: •The comparatively low level of the payment (as compared to the original claim) was proof that the payment was not for the claims within the Statement of Claim. •The settlement did not compensate for the claims in the Statement of Claim because the settlement agreement was made with a denial of liability on the part of each Defendant. •The settlement payment was made to purchase the Disputant’s right to sue. His Honour held that to view the settlement payment as a purchase of the right to sue ignored the terms of the Settlement Agreement and focused only upon the legal rights necessarily extinguished in the process of a settlement. Judge Barber held that the relatively low level of payment was not proof that the payment was not for the claims in the Statement of Claim, only that other factors were taken into account by the Disputant in accepting the payment—such as costs and risks of litigation. His Honour held that to attribute significance to the fact that the settlement was made with a denial of liability was to ignore the commercial reality of the situation and that it was unlikely that a Defendant in any proceedings would accept liability. If a Defendant did not deny liability then there would be no incentive for a claimant to compromise its claim and settle for less than claimed. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 13 WHETHER INTEREST ON MORTGAGE PAYMENTS DEDUCTIBLE The Authority’s conclusion with reference to interest on the increased amount of mortgage was that the $185,000 was used to purchase the residence as a family home, and, therefore, was expenditure of a private nature and not deductible. It made no difference that the loan was secured over both properties. Decision Counsel for the appellants accepted that interest on the additional $185,000 was not fully deductible, but submitted three grounds in support of a “fairer” basis of apportionment. These were that the facts of the present case were distinguishable from any other decision of the TRA, that the Authority was too rigid in its application of Pacific Rendezvous and that it erroneously applied Public Trustee, and that the amendment to section 106(1)(h)(i) effected by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1987 was not “properly considered or considered at all” by the Authority. Distinguishability On the first line of argument, counsel for the appellant placed some reliance on Case S17. However, Panckhurst J noted that this case was perhaps “better viewed as one decided on its particular facts and where the issue of apportionment was complicated on that account.” Application of Established Principles With regard to Public Trustee His Honour noted that not only is the case now of long-standing, but also that in his view it is well-settled that “the involuntary nature of the expenditure ... is pivotal to the outcome.” Justice Panckhurst continued, saying: “I do not consider that the Authority erred by not placing the present case within the Public Trustee principle. To the contrary I agree that the expenditure on the Invercargill house purchase was discretionary, rather than involuntary. In both the Public Trustee and Williams the requirement to pay, and the quantum of the payment at issue was truly external to and beyond the control of the taxpayer ...” The further line of argument concerning Pacific Rendezvous was also swiftly dismissed by His Honour, stating: “If anything it seems to me that Pacific Rendezvous is against the appellants in the present case. Its emphasis is upon the use to which the funds have been put and, in particular, whether that use is in producing assessable income. Case:Borlase v CIR Decision date:17 July 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Summary The appellants were unsuccessful in their appeal from the Taxation Review Authority. Facts This case concerns the deductibility of interest payments on a mortgage. The appellants, husband and wife, acquired a home in Dunedin in the 1970s. On account of the husband’s work, they lived away from Dunedin for long periods. After the husband experienced a downturn in available work in Dunedin, the appellants shifted to Invercargill in 1991. Their Dunedin house was let and rental accommodation was obtained in Invercargill. There were problems with such accommodation and on two occasions the family had to shift home. After about two years, in February 1993, the appellants purchased a residential property in Invercargill for $185,000. They had no surplus funds to apply to the cost, so a total of $208,000 was borrowed on mortgage from a bank. The Dunedin property was already subject to a mortgage, under which $23,326 was outstanding. Accordingly, the new mortgage for $208,000 represented a sum sufficient to pay the purchase price of the new property, and cover the existing mortgage. The new mortgage was secured against both properties, as required by the bank. In the tax year to 31 March 1994 the appellants each claimed an interest deduction of half the total interest expenditure. In the following tax year similar deductions were claimed. The Commissioner disallowed them in each year. Taxation Review Authority Judge Barber in the TRA set out the factual background, referred to the statutory scheme, and then reviewed the relevant principles (Pacific Rendezvous; Brierly; Eggers; Public Trustee; Buckley and Young). Against the background of this review His Honour first considered the deductibility of interest incurred in relation to the core mortgage figure of $23,326. His Honour concluded that this portion of the interest was deductible. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 14 ... In the present case the use to which the $185,000 was put was the acquisition of a domestic dwelling. Every dollar was so employed during the relevant tax years. I am not persuaded that Pacific Rendezvous was misunderstood by the Authority or applied with undue rigidity.” Changed wording of section 106(1)(h)(i) Until 1987 the prohibition on the deductibility of interest applied except so far as the Commissioner was satisfied that: “(i)It is payable on capital employed in the production of the assessable income;” Since the amendment the relevant wording is: “(i)It is payable in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (ia)It is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year;” The thrust of the appellant’s argument was that the inclusion of the word “necessarily” in sub-paragraph (ia) indicated a more expansive approach to deductibility. With reference to the facts, where the taxpayers were intent upon retaining their rental activity in Dunedin, at least part of the additional borrowing was necessarily incurred in order to preserve or retain the income-producing activity. Hence the interest on that part was “necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for \[an\] income year”. His Honour commented that this submission was simply a variant of the previous ones, and found himself unable to accept that the appellants were obliged to incur, or necessarily incurred, the expenditure of $185,000 in order to produce assessable income or to carry on a business to that end. In conclusion, His Honour stated that the case was a “conventional one where taxpayers expended borrowed funds for a private or domestic purpose, albeit security was taken over properties one of which was used to gain assessable income.” Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 8 (August 2001) 15 TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT – COMMISSIONER’S ASSESSMENT VALID He noted that a report made after the approval to use section 99 had been given by a properly delegated officer and after the assessment was made, could not make that assessment invalid. He was not prepared to disturb the TRA’s finding that there had been some improper conduct by the Commissioner’s staff in their dealings with Mr Russell but concluded that this could not invalidate an assessment properly made some 18 months before Mr Russell’s involvement. Further he considered that the hearing before the TRA was de novo (allowing the matter to be reconsidered afresh) and cured any procedural defects that might arise as a result of the CIR’s staff conduct. He relied upon Dandelion Investments (1996) 16 NZTC 12,689; Russell v TRA (2000) 19 NZTC 15,924 and Miller v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC. Given the five weeks’ hearing before the TRA, Tompkins J considered there was no possible basis to conclude the taxpayer had not had an adequate hearing. On the cross appeal, Tompkins J considered the TRA was right to conclude there was a tax avoidance arrangement. He could see no reason for the transaction’s “elaborate framework” and that the whole purpose of the arrangement was to reduce tax. His Honour considered CIR v BNZI (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103 did not help the taxpayer as there was ample evidence that there was a meeting of minds and consensus as required by BNZI. Case:CIR v Dandelion Investments Ltd Decision date:3 August 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Summary The High Court found in favour of the Commissioner and the taxpayers’ cross appeal was dismissed. Facts This was an appeal from Case U11 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,068. In 1986 the objector (Dandelion) entered into an arrangement the effect of which was to avoid tax. Deductible interest was paid on a loan to purchase a subsidiary but, via a series of steps involving the Cook Islands, most of that interest paid was returned to Dandelion as a dividend from the subsidiary purchased. The only expense to Dandelion was the fees paid to the companies involved. The Commissioner formed the view this was avoidance and reassessed. Dandelion objected and then retained Mr J G Russell as its agent. The objection was disallowed. Dandelion, through Mr Russell sought a case at the Taxation Review Authority alleging misconduct by the Commissioner’s staff (in their dealings with Mr Russell), invalidity of the assessment (due to time bar and the Commissioner’s Policy Statement on section 99: “the CPS”) as well as the incorrectness of the assessment. At the TRA the allegations of misconduct and invalidity were considered made out and the assessment was invalid. It was also considered the assessment, if it had been valid, was correct. The CIR appealed the issues of misconduct and invalidity. Dandelion appealed the finding there was tax avoidance. Decision Tompkins J considered the assessment was valid. He accepted that the giving of notice of assessment was not part of the assessment process and failure to give notice could not invalidate an assessment. After reviewing the facts he concluded that the assessment could not be considered “tentative or provisional” in the Canterbury Frozen Meats sense.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/20 Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund invests in the securities of those companies that make up the Tower Global Index (the “Global Index” or the “Index”). The Global Index is a customised version of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (the “MSCI World Index”). The Fund has been designed to provide investors with comprehensive coverage of global equities. 2.Tortis-INTL is a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 3.Tortis-INTL is a New Zealand tax resident. The trustee of Tortis-INTL is the Public Trustee (the “Trustee”). The manager of Tortis-INTL is Tower Managed Funds Investments Limited (previously known under the name “Tower Trust Services Limited”) (the “Manager”). The investment manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (the “Investment Manager” or “State Street”). 4.The investment policy of the Fund is set out in clause 82.1 of the Trust Deed. It states: 82.The investment policy of the Trust shall be: 82.1 to only invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool and Unmarketable Accumulations) in Index Shares in a manner that replicates the Adjusted MSCI and to only enter into transactions that are necessary to give effect to that policy; This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis-International Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b) and CF 3(1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-International Fund (“Tortis-INTL” or the “Fund” or the “Trust”) pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 16 December 1996 and amended on 18 February 1997, 31 July 2000 and as amended by an Amending Trust Deed which will be the same as, or not materially different from the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue on 29 June 2001 (the “Trust Deed”), and the Prospectus for the Fund (the “Prospectus”). This issue of the TIB contains binding product rulings for the Tortis-International Fund (BR Prd 01/20) and the Tortis-NZ Fund (BR Prd 01/21). Shortly after those rulings were made, it was found that the Arrangement was incorrectly stated with regard to the process followed by unitholders wishing to dispose of their units. Consequently, the Commissioner agreed that those rulings should be withdrawn, on 13 September 2001, and new product rulings made. Those new product rulings for the Tortis-International Fund (BR Prd 01/26) and the Tortis- NZ Fund (BR Prd 01/27) are also published in this issue of the TIB. As the new product rulings are in respect of a different arrangement from the rulings that have been withdrawn, they are able to apply for the same period as the product rulings that have now been withdrawn. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 5 82.2 to invest the Cash Pool in deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the Tower First Rate Account upon terms that will allow the Manager to pay the anticipated Liabilities of the Fund and to manage the redemption of Units and the liquidity of the Trust; 82.3 to invest Unmarketable Accumulations in Derivatives until the total value of investment in Derivatives reaches a Marketable Amount whereupon the Derivatives will be realised and the proceeds invested in accordance with clause 82.1 or 82.2; and 82.4 to not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the Investments being held in non New Zealand currencies. 5.The investment objectives of the Fund are as follows: •To track the adjusted MSCI Index, called the TOWER Global Index, to provide broad international coverage of approximately 1,000 companies; •The Global Index includes only “grey listed” countries to New Zealand, so that double taxation issues do not occur. These include companies resident in the United Sates, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, and Aus- tralia. These companies provide coverage of 80% of all international companies contained within the total MSCI Index; •The Investment Manager cannot diversify investments of the Fund, or take prudent steps in respect of the mix of the Fund’s investments. 6.The Trust Deed states that: It is not the Fund or the Trustee’s intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling constituent company securities. 7.Tortis-INTL is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in Tortis-INTL is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in Tortis-INTL (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the fund or any particular investment of the fund. 8.The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects of the previous rulings (BR Prv 96/135, BR Prv 96/136, and BR Prv 01/15), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund (except for the changes noted above), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. The MSCI World Index 9.The Tower Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. 10.The tracking of the Global Index is undertaken by the Investment Manager. 11.The fundamental objective of the MSCI World Index is as follows (taken from the MSCI Methodology and Index Policy document, published by MSCI in March 1998, at page 3): MSCI Indices are constructed to provide benchmarks that accurately represent the opportunities available to the institutional investor. While an all-share-index (all listed companies at their full market cap weight) represents the theoretical opportunity set available to the global investor, this is not a fair performance benchmark in practice, since it cannot be fully replicated due to illiquidity of either shares or volume. Thus, MSCI creates indices which capture the spirit of an all-share index, but are actually subsets of shares which are truly replicable. 12.The rules for determining which companies will be included in the MSCI World Index are set out below (taken from the MSCI Methodology and Index Policy document): MSCI produces a world index which currently (31 May 2000) comprises 22 countries and over 1,300 stocks. Each country included in the MSCI World Index is represented by a separate index which forms part of the larger Index. The index for each country is referred to as a MSCI Country Index. In constructing the MSCI Country Indices MSCI uses a five-step process. MSCI Country Index Selection Criteria: 1.Define the total market. 2 .Sort the market by industry groups and target 60% for inclusion. 3 .Select stocks with good liquidity and free float. 4.Avoid cross-ownership. 5.Apply the full market capitalization weight to each stock. 1.Define the total market: The initial research for the MSCI Indices covers the full breadth of each equity market in the universe. Country specialists track the evolution of both listed and unlisted shares of domestically listed companies in 51 markets that, combined, account for over 90% of the world’s total market capitalization. Based in Geneva, these teams of country specialists collect data on shares, pricing, ownership, float and liquidity for effectively all companies worldwide. Sources for this information include local stock exchanges and brokerage firms, newspapers ad company contacts. All of the companies within this research coverage are eligible for inclusion in the MSCI Indices except non- domiciled companies, investment trusts and mutual funds. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 6 2.Sort the total market by industry groups and target 60% for inclusion: Once information on the total country market capitalization is analyzed, 60% of the capitalization of each industry group, and thus 60% of the entire market, is targeted for inclusion in each MSCI country index. This process ensures that the index reflects the industry characteristics of the overall market, and permits the construction of accurate regional and composite industry indices. With the uniform target of capturing 60% of each country’s total market capitalization, each country carries its proportional weight in the regional and composite indices. A 60% target has been found sufficient to maintain a high level of tracking while still providing for an investable universe across all countries (the “highest common denominator” which can be captured, while still having an investable index in each country). 3.Select stocks with good liquidity and free float: A goal of the MSCI index construction process is to select the most liquid stocks within each industry group, all other things being equal, since liquidity is necessary but not the sole determinant for inclusion in the index. Liquidity is monitored by monthly average trading value over time in order to determine normal levels of volume, excluding temporary peaks and troughs. A stock’s liquidity is significant not only in absolute terms, but also relative to its market capitalization and to average liquidity for the country and the industry as a whole. Liquidity is not used as an absolute measure to select constituents because: An absolute minimum level of liquidity would be arbitrary and would have different meanings in different markets. Liquidity is partly a function of the cyclicality of markets and industries. Limiting index constituents to only the most liquid stocks would introduce a bias against those stocks and sectors that are temporarily out of favor with investors. An inflexible rule might also dictate a pattern of constituent additions and deletions that would introduce unnecessary turnover in the index. The free float (percentage of shares freely tradable) of every security in the market is monitored and an estimate is calculated, and low float may exclude a stock from consideration in the index. In the developed markets and some emerging markets, “low” float is considered under approximately 25%, as estimated by the country specialists at CIPSA in Geneva. However, in many emerging market countries, the average float is below 25%, so float is measured relative to the stock’s own industry and country. But float can be a difficult number to determine. In some markets, reliable data sources are generally not available; in other markets, information on smaller and less prominent issues can be subject to error and time lags. Additionally, government ownership and corporate share crossholdings can change over time and are not always made public. The precise definition of “float” also tends to differ depending on the data source. Thus, evaluations of float run the risk of penalizing those markets that have higher standards for company disclosure, regardless of the actual degree of availability of shares. As with liquidity, sufficient float is an important consideration, not an inflexible rule. 4.Avoid cross-ownership: Cross-ownership occurs when one company has a significant ownership stake in another company, and both are included in the index. Substantial cross-ownership can skew industry weights, distort country-level valuations (such as Price/ Earnings and Price/Book Value) and overstate a country’s true market size. An integral part of the index construction process is to identify corporate share crossholdings in order to avoid or minimize cross-ownership in the MSCI Indices. Country analysts in Geneva separate cross-ownership stakes into two categories. The first consists of stakes which are considered immaterial. In these cases, such cross-ownership does not represent something significant in terms of having distortionary effects on the index even if both companies are included. The second category is stakes which could materially distort an industry- or country-level index by significantly overstating the index’s market capitalization if both companies are included. Other ownership stakes (such as government, family, other institutional holdings) are also included in the estimated free float. 5.Apply the full market capitalization weight to each stock: All standard MSCI indices are weighted by each company’s full market capitalization (both listed and unlisted shares). This approach has the advantage of objectivity—the number of shares outstanding is consistently defined for companies around the world and is a readily obtainable figure. This approach also minimizes turnover. MSCI does not adjust share weights for either free float or cross- holdings. The most serious consequence of float limitations is illiquidity, which can be monitored objectively. Full market capitalization weighting is favored to float-weighting schemes for both theoretical and practical reasons: •It is impossible to judge whether a position which is currently in firm hands might be available in the future. •The quality and timeliness of information on float varies from market to market. Adjustments penalize those markets with the highest standards of company information disclosure. •Float adjustments incur index turnover as the float of a company changes. However, the precision of a float-adjusted index may not yield a more “investable” index. For instance, when the float of a stock increases from 55% to 60%, it may not be necessarily 5% more investable on a practical basis. In fact, it was probably fully replicable at a full market cap weight and the increase in turnover did not result in a “better” index, only an increase in transaction costs. •Float adjustments on a country level may not result in materially different country weights from market capitalization weights. \[Weighting stocks at their full market capitalisation, as described above in the fifth selection criterion, is slowly being phased out by MSCI: first by its extension of the partial inclusion policy to all new additions to its indices (as of 31 July 2000) and second, by the change in its index construction methodology to a free float-adjustment methodology. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 7 However, currently stocks which were already part of the Index as at 31 July 2000 are included at their full market capitalisation.\] Partial Inclusion Policy Since the normal MSCI index policy is to include index constituents at 100% of market capitalization, large issues with low float—a characteristic of many privatizations—pose a dilemma for index construction. Including such companies at full market cap weight can overwhelm an index and overstate the true size of market opportunities; yet excluding them also results in an incomplete picture of the market. A company is included or excluded on a case-by-case basis, where the contributing factors include the expected change in float (especially for first-time government privatizations), stability of the liquidity and importance of the company in its local economy. A growing number of very sizable companies have been or will be brought to market with modest tranches initially made available to the public. By virtue of their size and visibility, these companies are obvious candidates for inclusion in a portfolio. To reflect this new market trend, MSCI index construction rules do allow for the possibility of including a company at a portion of its total market capitalization. This occurs only in exceptional cases when very large companies come to market with very modest initial float. In July 31 2000 the policy on partial inclusions was amended. MSCI has extended the application of its policy on partial inclusion of companies to all new additions to the MSCI indices. This amendment will simplify the partial inclusion policy, providing consistent treatment for all new index additions. Previously, the policy was targeted only at new constituents with very large market capitalizations. This amendment does not affect existing constituents in the MSCI indices. Following this amendment, all companies with a float below 40%, that are to be added to the MSCI Standard or Extended indices, regardless of size, will be included at a fraction of their total market capitalization using a Market Cap Factor (MCF). The MCF will be determined using MSCI’s current schedule as shown below: % Float equal1 01 52 02 53 03 5 4 0 or exceeding\* % Market Cap 2 03 04 05 06 08 0 100 Factor (MCF) \* Over-allotment option is not included in the case of IPOs, privatizations and similar public offerings. Structural Changes (“Structural Changes”) In changing the constituents of the MSCI Indices, accurate representation is balanced with minimizing turnover. An index must represent the current state of an evolving marketplace while at the same time minimizing turnover, which is costly as well as inconvenient for investment managers. Restructuring an index involves a balancing of constituent additions and deletions. The primary concern when considering additions and deletions is the continuity of the indices. Of secondary concern are the turnover costs associated with these changes. There are two broad categories of changes to the MSCI Indices: structural changes and market-driven changes. Structural changes reflect the evolution of a market due, for example, to a change in industry composition or regulations. Industry restructurings generally take place every 18 to 24 months for any given country. However, the structural change to the country index may occur on only four dates throughout the year: as of the close of the last business day of February, May, August and November. MSCI index additions and deletions are announced two weeks in advance. There are absolute firewalls on any price-sensitive decision until there is a public announcement. These changes are communicated to subscribers both electronically and by fax. They are simultaneously posted on public Reuters pages (starting on MSCIA) and public Bloomberg pages (MSCN). The Reuters and Bloomberg MSCI pages are updated by Capital International Perspective, S.A. in Geneva. The pages include the security names, the action to be taken and, when necessary, the context of the change. A more detailed announcement service is available for a fee (and provides the weightings, shares outstanding, security identifiers and industry classification). During the examination of each country index, the market cap and business function coverage of each industry group is measured against the underlying market. The investability (free float, cross-ownership, long- and short-term trading volume and turnover) of each constituent is also monitored. In the event that an industry is over- or under-covered, or that there are stocks in the index which are no longer investable (here both long-term and short-term liquidity is examined), or a large privatization has altered the capitalization of the market, a structural change may be necessary. The MSCI indices reflect the opportunity set to the global investor on an ongoing basis—and should thus mirror the fundamental changes in the market’s structure, and correspond to the situation of the average institutional investor. These structural changes are designed and timed to minimize turnover to the indices. If possible, several unrelated changes to a country index are grouped together, minimizing disruption. Structural Change Additions: As markets grow because of privatizations, investor interest, or the relaxation of regulations, index additions (with or without corresponding deletions) may be needed to bring industry representations up to the 60% target. Companies are considered not only with respect to their broad industry, but also with respect to their sub- sector, in order to represent if possible a broader range of economic activity. Structural Change Deletions: The indices must represent the full-investment cycle, including bear as well as bull markets. Out-of-favor stocks may exhibit declining price, market capitalization, and/or liquidity, and yet continue to be good representatives of their industry. Deleting constituents because their liquidity has declined introduces a bias against out-of-favor companies or industries, especially those in the trough of a business cycle. For this reason, low liquidity is never an automatic trigger for deleting a company from the index. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 8 Companies may be deleted because they have diversified away from their industry classification, because the industry has evolved in a different direction from the company’s thrust, or because a better industry representative exists (either a new issue or an existing company). In addition, in order not to exceed the 60% target coverage of industries and countries, adding new index companies may entail corresponding deletions. Market-driven Changes (“Market Driven Changes”) Market-driven changes consist of new issues, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and other similar corporate events. These changes are announced and implemented as they occur. Additions - New Issues: New issues may not be automatically eligible for immediate inclusion in the MSCI Indices. Many factors must be considered, such as market capitalization, float and liquidity. Some new issues undergo a seasoning period of six to twelve months between index restructurings until a trading pattern and volume are established. After that time, they are eligible for inclusion, subject to the standard selection criteria discussed. However, sometimes a new issue, usually a privatization, comes to market and substantially changes the country’s industry profile. In this case, where even temporarily excluding it would distort the characteristics of the market, it may be immediately included in the MSCI Indices. An example is YPF, Argentina’s privatized oil company, which at USD 3.04 billion is Latin America’s largest privatization to date. In these cases, however, an announcement is made in the first few days of official trading for the security, since the country specialists do not want to influence the primary placement of the issue. In other cases, a large new issue may not be included even in the normal process of restructuring, despite substantial size and liquidity. The primary reasons for non-inclusion of a large new issue are as follows: •A large stock, if it has low float and is also illiquid, can overwhelm an index and over- represent the true opportunities in the market. •The index may be at the limit of industry representation—including the new issue would seriously over-weight an industry in the index. •In some cases, it is necessary to defer inclusion of a new issue until the next opportunity for index restructuring. Deletions - Suspended Companies: In the case of suspension for bankruptcy or near bankruptcy, the suspended company is deleted at the smallest price (unit or fraction of the currency) at which a security could have traded in a given market. More complex are the cases where the suspension is due to a major restructuring, which results in the company being ineligible (at least for an important period of time) for normal listing and trading on the stock exchange. The MSCI policy is to remove these companies from the index only after there is little likelihood the company will return to normal trading. In this situation, the key issue is determining the price at which the company can be removed from the index. Unofficial market prices may be used as a base to determine that exit price. In exceptional circumstances, average indicative prices from reliable sources may be used. Mergers & Acquisitions: Any case of mergers and acquisitions, or capital restructuring, which can affect a company within the MSCI universe is monitored. Depending on whether the active companies are, or are not, constituents of the MSCI Indices, a number of factors must be considered. If either the acquiring or the acquired firm is a constituent of the index, the first consideration is the impact of the acquisition on the index. The second consideration involves structural changes to the index. When a non-constituent company acquires a constituent company, either the acquiring company can replace the constituent company in the index, or another company altogether may be chosen as a better representative of the industry. If two medium-sized, non-constituent companies merge, the merged company may also be considered for inclusion in the indices. However, this change would occur only through a structural review. Spin-Offs: A spin-off is the distribution to existing shareholders of a part of the company’s business through the issuance of shares in the newly-established company. The decision to include the newly- established company in the index is based on several factors including estimated market value, market capitalization, and float. The market value of the spin- off is estimated through a consensus of industry analysts, grey market prices, and statistics on revenues and earnings. Performance of stocks The methodology for determining which stocks are to be included in the relevant country indices does not involve any exercise of predicting whether a company is likely to be particularly profitable or unprofitable or whether the company’s securities are likely to increase in value or decrease in value. Performance is not an issue. MSCI is solely focused on ensuring that a consistent methodology is used in preparing the indices, which maximises the utility of the indices as a recognised world-wide benchmark of stock market movement and avoids unnecessary turnover of index stocks. Changes to the MSCI World Index 13.In partial replacement of the process stated above, there are also forthcoming changes which alter the way in which the MSCI World Index will select its constituent company securities. The MSCI will adjust all its equity indices for free float and increase the target market representation of its Standard Index series from 60% to 85%. The combined changes will be implemented in two separate phases. The first phase will be implemented as of the close of 30 November 2001 and the second phase will be implemented as of the close of 31 May 2002. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 9 14.The change in index construction methodology to a “free float-adjustment” methodology is described in the MSCI Announcement, dated 10 December 2000 (“the Announcement”), as follows: MSCI calculates the free float of an equity security as its total number of shares outstanding less shareholdings classified as strategic and shares otherwise restricted from trading by international investors. Examples of shares excluded from free float are stakes held by governments, corporations, controlling shareholders and their families, the company’s management, and shares subject to foreign ownership restrictions. Under this enhanced index construction methodology, MSCI will free float-adjust constituent weights using an adjustment factor, which will be referred to as the Inclusion Factor. This Inclusion Factor is equal to a constituent’s estimated free float rounded-up to the closest 5%. For example, a constituent with an estimated free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its total market capitalization, while a constituent with an estimated free float of 78.6%, will be included in the index with an Inclusion Factor of 0.80. Where the foreign ownership limit is more restrictive than the free float, and if there are no foreign strategic investors, a constituent’s Inclusion Factor will be equal to its exact foreign ownership limit, rounded to the nearest percentage point. Securities with a free float below 15% will not typically be eligible for inclusion in the MSCI equity indices. However, in exceptional cases where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry, the security may be included in the MSCI indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float rounded to the closest percentage point. For example, a very large company with an estimated free float of 11.4%, if included in the index, would be included with an Inclusion Factor of 0.11. In order to account for other types of restrictions on foreign equity investment, such as the investor qualification and quota approval system prevailing today in Taiwan, the enhanced MSCI methodology provides for an additional investability factor, referred to as the Limited Investability Factor. The application of this Limited Investability Factor would permit a more accurate comparison of markets with more complex and subtle restrictions to the investment process with markets where investment limitations can be appropriately reflected in security specific Inclusion Factors. MSCI will review constituents’ Inclusion Factors at the time of regular country index rebalancings. In addition, MSCI will allow for changes in a security’s Inclusion Factor in response to significant market- driven corporate events, as the events become effective. 15.To determine whether a shareholding is strategic or non-strategic, the Announcement states the following guidelines: Shareholding classification guidelines MSCI primarily classifies shareholdings as strategic or non-strategic based on a categorization of investor types. •Strategic shareholders: The following investor types are generally considered as strategic and their shareholdings in a company are not included in that company’s equity capital to determine its free float: •Governments: Shares owned by governments and affiliated entities. Please refer to the specific guidelines described below for government agencies and government-related investment funds. •Corporations: Shares owned by corporations, including treasury shares owned by the company itself, except when the treasury shares are excluded from the number of shares outstanding. Please refer to specific guidelines for banks. •Management and Board Members: Shares owned by members of the company’s management or Board of Directors, including shares owned by individuals or families that are related to or closely affiliated with members of the company’s management, Board of Directors, or founding members deemed to be insiders. •Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs): Shares owned in ESOPs during the lockup period. Non-Strategic shareholders: The following investor types are generally considered as non-strategic and their shareholdings in a company are included in that company’s equity capital to determine its free float: •Individuals: Shares owned by individuals, excluding shares owned by individuals or families that are related to or closely affiliated with members of the company’s management, Board of Directors or founding members deemed to be insiders, and, excluding those shareholdings held by individuals whose significant size suggests that they are strategic in nature. •Investment funds, mutual funds or unit trusts: Shares owned in investment funds, mutual funds and unit trusts, including shares owned in passively managed funds. •Pension funds: Shares owned in employee pension funds, excluding shares of the employing company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. •Insurance companies: In principle, the investment objective of portfolio holdings of insurance companies is non-strategic. When there are reasons to believe that an insurance company’s shareholding is strategic, it will not be included in free float. •Social security funds: Shares owned in social security funds, unless the fund’s management is deemed to exert influence over the management of the company. •Venture capital funds: Shares owned in venture capital funds, unless a specific investment is deemed to be strategic in nature. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 10 16.If the above guidelines are not sufficient, the Announcement also states the following additional guidelines: In the event that the above categories should not appropriately capture the nature of a specific shareholding, its classification as strategic or non- strategic will be determined based on a more extensive analysis. In particular, the following guidelines will be followed: •Banks. Shareholdings by banks are considered as strategic, excluding, when identifiable, specific shareholdings that are deemed to be non- strategic. •Nominees or trustees: Shareholdings registered in the name of a nominee or trustee are classified as strategic or non-strategic based on an analysis of who is the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares, according to the above definitions. •Government agencies and government- related investment funds: Shareholdings of government agencies and government-related investment funds are classified based on an analysis of the objective of the investment. •Shares placed in IPOs with special incentives: Shares that are placed in an IPO and that include meaningful incentives to hold the shares for a specific period of time, are classified as strategic until those incentives expire. •ADRs and GDRs: Shares that are deposited to back the issuance of ADRs and GDRs are classified as non-strategic, unless it is established that a specific stake held in ADRs or GDRs is strategic in nature. 17.Other shares (other than those which are classified as “strategic”) may also be excluded from the free float. These shares, described above as “shares otherwise restricted” from the free float, are described as follows: •Limits on share ownership for foreigners: Limits on the proportion of a security’s share capital that is authorized for purchase by non- domestic investors. Where they exist, these foreign share-ownership limits are generally set by law, government regulations, or company by- laws. •Other foreign investment restrictions: Investment restrictions, other than those described above, which materially limit the ability of international investors to freely invest in a particular equity market. There is typically no simple way to account for these limitations in a benchmark, as these restrictions tend to be more subtle and complex, and may affect different market participants in different ways. 18.The MSCI calculates the free float-adjustment construction methodology in the following manner: Calculation of a security’s free float-adjusted market capitalization As a general rule, MSCI calculates the free float of a security as its total number of shares outstanding less shareholdings classified as strategic and shares otherwise restricted from trading by international investors. However, the determination of the corresponding free float-adjusted market capitalization is dependent on the nature of the limitations on free float. In all cases, the calculation is based solely on publicly available shareholding information obtained from multiple information sources. For each security, all available shareholdings are considered where public data is available, regardless of size. •Calculation in the case of a security which is not subject to a foreign ownership limit or other foreign investment restrictions •Strategic shareholding (%) = Number of shares classified as strategic Total number of shares outstanding •Free float (%) = 100% - Strategic shareholding (%) •For constituents with free float greater than or equal to 15%, the security’s Inclusion Factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded-up to the closest 5%. •Securities with free float less than 15% are typically not eligible for inclusion in the indices. However, in exceptional cases, where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry, the security may be included in the indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float rounded to the closest 1%. •Free float-adjusted market capitalization = Inclusion Factor \* total market capitalization •Calculation in the case of a security which is subject to a foreign ownership limit •Foreign strategic shareholding (%) = Number of shares held by foreign strategic investors Total number of shares outstanding •Free float available to foreign investors (%) is equal to the lesser of •the free float, calculated as: 100% - strategic shareholding (including both foreign and domestic strategic shareholders) (%) •the foreign ownership limit less the foreign strategic shareholding (%) •For constituents whose free float available to foreign investors is greater than or equal to 15%, the security’s Inclusion Factor is equal to the lesser of: •the estimated free float available to foreign investors rounded-up to the closest 5%; •the foreign ownership limit rounded to the closest 1%. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 11 •Securities with a free float available to foreign investors of less than 15% are typically not eligible for inclusion in the indices. However, in exceptional cases, where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry the security may be included in the indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float available to foreign investors rounded to the closest 1%. •Free float-adjusted market capitalization = Inclusion Factor \* total market capitalization •In the case of a security which is subject to other foreign investment restrictions In the case where other foreign investment restrictions exist, which materially limit the ability of international investors to freely invest in equity markets, an additional Limited Investability Factor may be applied. There is typically no simple way to account for these types of investability limitations in a benchmark as they tend to be subtle and complex, and may affect different market participants in different ways. Therefore, where warranted, the Limited Investability Factor will be determined based on an extensive case-by-case analysis. 19.The change in target representation, as described in the Announcement, will occur as follows: In conjunction with the free float-adjustment of its indices, MSCI will increase the target market representation in the MSCI Standard Index series from 60% of total market capitalization to 85% of free float-adjusted market capitalization within each industry group within each country. Given trends such as increased market concentration, the increase in coverage will provide greater diversification and representation of investment opportunities in the indices. Broader coverage is also expected to decrease ongoing turnover in the MSCI indices. MSCI research shows that the increase to a target market representation of 85% can be achieved with the addition of a reasonable number of relatively liquid and sizeable constituents in most countries. In the countries where this is not possible, the country index will remain below the target market representation of 85%. 20.The “phase in” periods, also detailed in the December 2000 Announcement, for the changes were detailed as follows: Publication of Constituent Data and Implementation In order to assist market participants in understanding and preparing for these changes, MSCI plans to publish, on or before June 30 2001, the list of index constituents and their Inclusion Factors under the enhanced methodology for each of the MSCI Standard country indices. In addition, shortly thereafter, MSCI will begin publishing a provisional index series to measure the performance of the MSCI countries and main regions based on the enhanced methodology. The provisional series, together with the constituents and their Inclusion Factors, also may be used by clients who wish to measure their performance against such an index, ahead of MSCI’s official implementation schedule. In order to best transition the indices to the enhanced methodology, the combined changes will be implemented in two separate phases: as of the close of 30 November 2001, and as of the close of 31 May 2002. The changes in each phase will simultaneously affect all MSCI Standard country indices and will include changes resulting from both the free float- adjustment and the increase in coverage. In the first phase, approximately half of the total change resulting from the free float-adjustment will be implemented for all existing index constituents and, simultaneously, all the new constituents resulting from the increase in coverage to 85% will be added at approximately half of their free float-adjusted market capitalization. More specifically, in the first phase, the market capitalization of all existing index constituents will be adjusted by an interim Inclusion Factor equal to the simple average of the current proportion of market capitalization included in the index prior to the change and their final Inclusion Factor. This average will be rounded up to the closest 5% (or closest 1% if below 15%). For example, in the first phase, two constituents with free floats of 23.2% and 78.6%, respectively, currently included in the index at their full market capitalization weights, will have their market capitalization adjusted by interim Inclusion Factors of 0.65 and 0.90, respectively. These interim Inclusion Factors are calculated as (25%+100%)/2 = 62.5%, rounded-up to 65%, and (80%+100%)/2 = 90%, respectively. Simultaneously, all the new constituents resulting from the increase in coverage to 85% will be added to the indices in the first phase with interim Inclusion Factors equal to half of their final Inclusion Factors rounded-up to the closest 5% (or 1% if below 15%). For example, in the first phase, two new constituents with free floats of 23.2% and 78.6%, respectively, will be included in the indices with their market capitalization adjusted by Inclusion Factors of 0.13 (25%/2 = 12.5%, rounded-up to 13%) and 0.40 (80%/2 = 40%), respectively. In the second and final phase, the remaining adjustment to market capitalization of all constituent securities will be implemented. Index Rebalancings and Market Events during the Transition Period During the transition period, from 11 December 2000 through 31 May 2002, MSCI will maintain its schedule of regular quarterly index rebalancings for its Standard Index series. To minimize changes not related to the transition, MSCI will seek to coordinate all changes in the Standard indices with the target index under the enhanced methodology (i.e., the provisional series when available.) In addition, MSCI will only consider very significant changes in the equity markets when performing its quarterly index reviews. All new additions of companies resulting from IPO’s and regular quarterly rebalancings will be included with their final Inclusion Factors. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 12 Also, during the transition period, important new market capitalization additions resulting from mergers, acquisitions and similar corporate events, in principle will be made in proportion to the free float of the additional market capitalization entering the index. For example, when a company - with a current inclusion factor of 40% - issues new shares for the acquisition of assets entirely in firm hands for the equivalent of 25% of its current share capital, the resulting inclusion factor will be derived from the following calculation: \[(100 x 40%) + (25 x 0%)\] / 125 = 32%, which will be rounded up to 35%. 21.As of 31 May 2001, MSCI have been calculating and publishing the MSCI Provisional Index Series, which is based upon the MSCI Enhanced Methodology for free float adjusting constituents’ index weights, and targeting for Index inclusion 85% of free float- adjusted market capitalisation in each industry group with each country. The Adjusted MSCI World Index: the Tower Global Index 22.The Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index replicates the MSCI World Index, with one qualification: it only contains grey list countries, which comprise at least 2% of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index does not alter the MSCI World Index in any other way. 23.If any of the countries included in the Global Index leave the grey list then securities held in companies resident in that country will be immediately divested. If any company in which Tortis INTL holds securities ceases to be resident in a grey list country, then securities held in that company will be immediately divested. Trust Deed and Prospectus Two classes of units 24.The Fund offers two classes of units: Class A and Class B. Class A units are standard retail units. Class B units are issued on exactly the same terms as Class A units, however holders of Class B units, due to the size of their investment, are able to negotiate reduced management and trustee fees. Date of Adjustments 25.The Fund is re-balanced in the following circumstances: •If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and •Due to the Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and •If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. 26.Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. Rights Issues 27.The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of rights issues. 28.In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 29.The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers or share buy-backs. 30.With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 31.The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of a Index Company. Cash investments held by the Fund 32.Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Manager and the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Manager and the Investment Manager is on “call”. Wherever possible, the Manager will enter into futures contracts to cover the cash held by the Fund. This is known as “equitised cash”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 13 33.The Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) will hold cash in the following circumstances: •Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Index, pending the reinvestment of that cash; •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a Manager on behalf of a unitholder; •To accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the Index, which is presently $NZ5 million (“the minimum investment level”). The minimum investment level will increase to $US3 million as at 31 May 2002 to take account of the changes to the MSCI described in paragraphs 13 to 21 above. 34.The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: •for up to 10 working days preceding a MSCI structural change; •for up to 3 working days after a MSCI structural change; or •for up to 10 working days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. 35.In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Manager may hold cash. The amount of cash held by the Manager will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the circumstances described below, and in any event will not exceed 2% of the total assets of the Fund. Those circumstances are: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and •To fund the expenses, fees and taxation for the Fund; 36.The 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager may be exceeded in the following circumstances: •For up to one business day if there is rapid inflow to the Fund, or the Fund has notice of a substantial pending withdrawal ; •For up to one calendar month if the Manager receives a formal notice of a forthcoming obligation of subsequent performance (ie, payment due on partly paid shares) affecting the constituent securities in the Index; or •For up to one calendar month if the Manager is aware of a forthcoming distribution to unitholders at the scheduled date of distribution. 37.However, in any event, if the 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager is exceeded, the Fund will take immediate action to remedy the situation within the shortest practicable time. 38.At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Manager and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) which is the greater of 5% of the total value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the total value of the Fund and the minimum investment level (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 39.The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 40.The following futures contracts are currently used: CountryContract AustraliaSPI200 CanadaS&P/TSE60 JapanNikkei 225 GermanyDAX United KingdomFTSE100 United StatesS&P500 41.In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the Global Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such alternative contract or contracts. Hedging 42.The Fund does not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non- New Zealand currencies. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 14 Foreign Currencies 43.The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or divest the foreign currencies necessary to purchase or dispose of Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within 2 business days. Borrowing 44.The Fund may only borrow in the following circumstances: •To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; •To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 45.The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Issue and redemption of Units 46.Investors wishing to subscribe for units may do so for cash or, alternatively, above a certain prescribed level, investors may subscribe for units by transferring to Tortis-INTL an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-INTL in exchange. 47.Tortis-INTL permits investors to exit by redeeming units or by repurchase of units by the Manager. These are the only methods of exit offered by Tortis-INTL as it is not listed on a stock exchange. Units in the Fund may be redeemed by a unitholder for cash or an equivalent basket of securities (clause 35 of the Trust Deed). 48.A unitholder may redeem units subject to the conditions in Article C of the Trust Deed. Article C gives the Manager a discretion to refuse to redeem units where the amount to be redeemed is less than the minimum number acceptable by the Manager at that time. Currently the Manager has set a minimum withdrawal at $500. 49.Unit prices may be published in newspapers. Tortis-INTL has an Internet site which will be used principally to publish prices at which the Manager will repurchase or redeem units, and as a means for transferring units only by purchase from the Manager, and redemption or repurchase by the Manager. Same day unit redemption policy 50.On being repurchased the Manager is required to pay the aggregate value of the units to the investor within 21 business days of the relevant time (as described in the Trust Deed). However when possible the Fund operates a same day unit redemption policy. The Fund will endeavour to redeem the units requested by any unitholder and redeem and pay for those units on the same day as the unitholder’s request is made. 51.If the Fund has insufficient cash in the cash pool, the Fund will always in the first instance attempt to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds in order to meet the redemption request. In situations where the Fund is not able to borrow such sufficient funds, the Fund may suspend the withdrawal of Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 15 units in the Fund. The only exception to the Fund always attempting to borrow in the first instance where a redemption request is made and there is insufficient cash in the cash pool, is where a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders. In such a case the Fund will always suspend the withdrawal of units. Suspension of issuing and redeeming units 52.The Fund has not previously suspended the issuing or redeeming of units. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; or (4) in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a)The predetermined rules used by the Investment Manager to ascertain the Global Index constituents (set out above), and the predetermined rules used by MSCI to calculate the MSCI World Index (set out above), will not be made with or influenced by any intention of seeking higher rates of return or capital growth. (b)No material changes will be made to the way in which the Global Index tracks the MSCI World Index. (c)Apart from as described above at paragraphs 13 to 21, no material changes will be made to the way in which MSCI constructs the MSCI World Index. (d)The proportion of the Applicant’s assets to be held as cash (including all “free” cash and “equitised” cash) will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes stated in paragraph 32 of this ruling, and will not in any event exceed the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. This condition will not be regarded as being breached if, pending investment of contributions or disbursement of withdrawal proceeds, the Fund is forced to hold cash in excess of the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. The Fund will immediately invest or disburse such cash, except where immediate investment to track the Index is not possible due to the unavailability of appropriate equities, in which case the excess cash may be held for only so long as is strictly necessary and in any event no longer than two business days. (e)When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level (presently $NZ5 million, but to be $US3 million as from 31 May 2002), it will be immediately applied to track the Index. (f)The Investment Manager will rebalance the Fund in the following circumstances: •If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and •Due to Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 16 •If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. (g)When rebalancing the Fund the Investment Manager will use its best endeavours to track the Index as exactly as possible. Any re- balancing of the Fund that does not achieve an exact match of the Index will only occur where it is not possible to obtain or sell the securities necessary to exactly replicate the Index. In any case the tracking deviation will not exceed 1% of the value of the Fund. (h)In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. (i)With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted (but in any event within 2 business days). The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. (j)The Fund Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. (k)When the Fund is given the option of re- investing its dividends into any Index Company, the Fund invariably accepts the cash dividend. (l)The Fund can only borrow in the following circumstances: • To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; •To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. (m)The Fund will not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non- New Zealand currencies. (n)The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 17 (o)This Ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i)there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii)if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). (p)This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. (q)Apart from the Trust Deed and the Prospectus of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this Ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: (a) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or (b) the entry into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal; and/or (c) the appointment by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or (d) any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Fund, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Fund, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. (r)The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of Index Company securities. (s)If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. (t)The Fund will not be involved in any securities lending. (u)The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the issuing or redeeming of units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) except in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; (4) where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders; or (5) in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. (v)The Manager will not redeem units as a means of correcting tracking errors. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 18 (w)The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.7 of the Trust Deed to promote or carry on any scheme or undertaking in any country upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee deems fit. (x)The Fund will not invest in derivatives, with the exception of futures contracts entered into for the purposes of tracking the Index and spot foreign exchange contracts (which have a settlement period of no longer than two business days) to acquire or dispose of the necessary foreign currency so as to purchase or dispose of Index securities. (y)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders when unitholders wish to redeem their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool, when the Fund cannot borrow the funds required, and when the Fund is unable to sell sufficient securities in order to redeem the units requested. The Manager will not use this power to enhance the profit of the Fund. (z)The Global Index will only include countries that are listed in Schedule 3, Part A. (aa)The foreign companies included in the Global Index are resident and liable for tax in a country listed in Schedule 3, Part A. (bb)For the purposes of section CG 15(2)(b)(iii), in case of an interest, in relation to a foreign entity, of a kind specified in section CG 15(1)(a), the foreign entity is not a foreign entity, or a member of a class of foreign entities, specified in Part B of Schedule 4. (cc)The Fund will not acquire or hold any income interest or any control interest in any company that is a “controlled foreign company” under section CG 4. (dd)There is no arrangement between the Trustee and any unitholders to effect the redemption of units in substitution for dividends. (ee)Any cancellation of units will not be part of a pro rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). (ff)The Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. (gg)The Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). (hh)All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to investors net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. (ii)In relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a person that is related to Tortis- INTL within the meaning of section CF 3(12). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows. •Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). •Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. The procedure of publicising buy-back and redemption prices on the Internet does not constitute a “recognised exchange” in terms of the definition of that phrase in section OB 1. •If the Fund is liquidated, section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount”, as those terms apply to the Fund. The excess return amount will include gains on any securities sold by the Fund. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2001 until 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of June 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 19 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/21 4.The investment policy of the Fund is set out in clause 82.1 of the Trust Deed. It states: 82.The investment policy of the Trust shall be: 82.1 to only invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool) in Index Companies in a manner that replicates the NZSE30 Index and to only enter into transactions that are necessary to give effect to that policy; and 82.2 to invest the Cash Pool in deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the Tower First Rate Account, upon terms that will allow the Manager to pay the anticipated Liabilities and to manage the redemption of Units and the liquidity of the Trust. 5.According to the Prospectus, the investment objectives of the Fund are as follows: •To track the performance of the NZSE30 Index, which represents approximately 97% of all shares listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange; •To invest only in shares and securities that replicate the NZSE30, apart from the liquidity pool of approximately 5% of the Fund’s assets; •The Investment Manager cannot diversify investments of the Fund, or take steps to diversify the mix of the Fund’s investments outside the above objectives. 6.The Trust Deed states that: It is not the Fund or the Trustee’s intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling constituent company securities. 7.Tortis-NZ is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) confers an equal interest in the Fund but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Fund or any investment in the Fund. 8.The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects and conditions of the previous rulings (BR Prv 96/135, BR Prv 96/136 and BR Prv 01/14), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund, (except for the changes noted above), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis New Zealand Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3 (1)(b) and CF 3 (1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-NZ Fund (“Tortis-NZ” or the “Fund” or the “Trust”) pursuant to the Deed of Trust dated 1 November 1996 and as amended by an Amending Trust Deed which will be the same as, or not materially different from the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue on 29 June 2001 (the “Trust Deed”) and the Prospectus for the Fund (the “Prospectus”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund invests in a portfolio of shares that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE30 Selection Capital Index (“the Index”). The Fund has been designed to provide investors with an index which reflects as nearly as practical the stocks available to investors in the New Zealand Stock Exchange (the “NZSE”). The Applicant advises that the Index was selected because it allows for accurate tracking. 2.Tortis-NZ is a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 3.The trustee of the Fund is the Public Trustee (“the Trustee”). The manager of the Fund is Tower Managed Funds Investments Limited (previously known under the name “Tower Trust Services Limited”) (“the Manager”). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 20 The Index Rules 9.The NZSE describes the NZSE30 Index in general terms as follows: NZSE30 Selection Gross And Capital Indices The NZSE30 Selection Index covers the 30 largest and most liquid issuers with equity securities quoted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The float capital of each company is established by removing all known blocks of shares held, or more-or-less controlled, by one person or a group of related persons and amounting to 30% or more of the share capital. This reflects as nearly as is practical, the stock normally available to investors. The NZSE30 Selection Index is weighted by float (available) capital and membership is reviewed quarterly. The Index has been recalculated back to 01 January 1991. The...NZSE30 \[is\] available in both gross and capital form, that is with and without the reinvestment of dividends. The day-to-day methods of index calculation and adjustment for issues and dividends are identical to the NZSE Gross and Capital Indices. 10.The Construction and Maintenance Rules for the NZSE30 Index explain how the Index operates. The Construction and Maintenance Rules contain 20 Rules, which outline how the Index is constructed and how it adjusts over time. These rules are as follows: The major rules governing the construction and maintenance of the base of companies making up the indices are as follows:- 1 .Companies considered for inclusion in the index must be registered in New Zealand or have a sufficient proportion of shareholding on a New Zealand register to qualify for inclusion based on that proportion of the company’s market capitalisation. 2 .All classes of quoted equity security of a company are eligible for inclusion in the index bases. For index calculation purposes an equity security is defined in the Listing Rules. It includes all securities representing a residual equity claim on the earnings of the company and all securities which derive a substantial portion of their value from their ordinary share characteristics or conversion privileges. This includes convertible notes, specified preference shares, partly-paid shares and warrants (company-issued options). 3 .Shares issued through pro rata bonus and rights issues will be recognised on the ex date, according to the issue ratio. Application of changes will be governed by Rule 4. 4.Any adjustments to the capitalisation of Index constituents which do not accumulate to a relative Index impact of more than 0.03% will be held and applied at each quarterly revision. Adjustments with a greater impact will be applied as soon as practicable. 5 .With respect to new issues that have a slightly different dividend entitlement to the ordinary shares, the treatment for index calculation purposes is to aggregate the reported outstanding number of both classes of share to the sum at the price of the ordinary share. 6 .Newly quoted securities will be included in the indices at the end of the month, not less than five business days following its initial listing if the company meets all inclusion criteria. Overseas FASTER constituent securities will be assigned a weighting that reflects the percentage holdings on the New Zealand Register in order to determine eligibility and weighting in the NZSE40 and NZSE30 Indices. The weighting assigned to overseas constituents will be the most recent three month moving average. If a weighting is not available at the time of quotation, then when the weighting is available post quotation, the market price will be used to determine eligibility. If a reasonable indication of the percentage holding on the New Zealand Register is available prior to listing, then this will be used in conjunction with its issue price. 7.The Exchange will review the composition of the indices each quarter according to the following rules 8 - 17. The revised bases of the indices, will be communicated to the market at least three weeks before they are to take effect. 8 .At each revision, companies will be ranked according to their daily average market capitalisation and float capitalisation for the preceding six months. The top 50 stocks will form the eligible pool for inclusion in either the NZSE40 or NZSE30 respectively. 9.Any index stock that has dropped out of the index pool will be removed from any index or indices in which it currently features. 10.Rule 10 refers only to NZSE40 Index. 11.Rule 11 refers only to NZSE40 Index. 12.Rule 12 refers only to NZSE40 Index. 13.The float capital of each company in the NZSE30 is calculated by excluding parcels of shares deemed to be not freely available in the market. As a general rule, the Exchange will exclude all holdings comprising a 30% or greater “relevant interest”, as disclosed in the Substantial Security Holders Notices issued pursuant to the Securities Amendment Act 1988. 14.Any NZSE30 stock that has dropped to a float capital rank of 36 or below will be removed from the NZSE30. 15.Any stock which is not in the NZSE30 and is ranked 25 or higher by float capital will automatically be introduced into the NZSE30 unless it would replace a more liquid stock (determined by trading value over the previous six months). New listings ranked 25 or higher by float capital in the index pool will be automatically included in the NZSE30 in accordance with rule 6. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 21 16.Any required additions to or deletions from the NZSE30 as a result of the operation of rules 14 and 15 will be made with reference to the liquidity of the stocks ranked 26 to 35. 17.Any additions or deletions required between quarterly revisions due to a merger, takeover or new listing will be carried out in accordance with rules 10, 11,16 & 19. 18.Movements in float capital will be monitored continuously, and the number of securities excluded will generally be updated as and when Substantial Security Holder Notices are received by the Exchange subject to the application of rule 4. In the case of pro-rata cash or bonus issues, it would be assumed, until advice was received otherwise, that the substantial security holders received or accepted their pro rata entitlement, and the number of excluded shares would be increased accordingly on the ex date. If the change in the amount of stock excluded represents 5% or more of the quoted capital of the company, the market would be advised of the impending change at least two weeks in advance. 19.In the event of a merger or takeover in respect of 100% of a constituent company’s issued securities, such constituent company’s securities will be removed from the Index five Business Days after the date the Offeror becomes entitled and announces that it will proceed with compulsory acquisition. Where a takeover offer proceeds at less than 100% acceptance, the constituent company’s securities will continue to be included in the Index unless there is a failure to satisfy the Index rules. In such cases the constituent company’s securities will be removed from the Index five Business Days after the Index Committee determines that such failure to satisfy the Index rules is not likely to be rectified in the near future. 20.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing rules, the New Zealand Stock Exchange reserves the right to, at any time, include any stock in the base of either index and attribute to it such weight as it may in its sole discretion determine. Trust Deed and Prospectus Date of Adjustments 11.The Fund re-balances in the following circumstances: (i)monthly, when the NZSE adjusts the weighting of Index Companies to allow for cancellation/allotment of shares on issue of the Index Companies; (ii)quarterly, when the NZSE reviews the Index Companies in the Index; and (iii)when the NZSE makes any other announcement that affects the NZSE30 Index. 12.Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within one business day. Rights Issues 13.The Index may be adjusted from time to time because of rights issues. 14.In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will only take up the rights if the rights are to be included in the Index. If the rights are not included in the Index, the Manager will sell the rights and reinvest in the Index at the earliest possible time. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 15.The Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers or share buy- backs. 16.With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index Company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to the NZSE Listing Rules or the Takeover Code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at the time the Index is adjusted and not participate in the event in any other way. 17.The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. Cash investments held by the Fund 18.Although it is not an objective of the Fund to invest in cash securities, the Fund may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and •To fund expenses, and any fee and taxation obligations of the Fund. 19.Cash is held in on-call deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989. Borrowing 20.The Fund may only borrow in the following circumstances: •To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 22 •Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; •To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary or •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 21.The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Issues and redemptions of Units 22.Investors wishing to subscribe for units may do so for cash or, alternatively, above a certain prescribed level, investors may subscribe for units by transferring to Tortis-NZ an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-NZ in exchange. 23.Tortis-NZ permits investors to exit by redeeming units or by repurchase of units by the Manager. These are the only methods of exit offered by Tortis-NZ as it is not listed on a stock exchange. Units in the Fund may be redeemed by a unitholder for cash or an equivalent basket of securities (clause 35 of the Trust Deed). 24.A unitholder may redeem units subject to the conditions in Article C of the Trust Deed. Article C gives the Manager a discretion to refuse to redeem units where the amount to be redeemed is less than the minimum number acceptable by the Manager at that time. Currently the Manager has set a minimum withdrawal at $500. Same day unit redemption policy 25.On being repurchased the Manager is required to pay the aggregate value of the units to the investor within 21 business days of the relevant time (as described in the Trust Deed). However when possible the Fund operates a same day unit redemption policy. The Fund will endeavor to redeem the units requested by any unitholder and redeem and pay for those units on the same day as the unitholder’s request is made. 26.If the Fund has insufficient cash in the cash pool, the Fund will always in the first instance attempt to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds in order to meet the redemption request. In situations where the Fund is not able to borrow such sufficient funds, the Fund may suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund. The only exception to the Fund always attempting to borrow in the first instance where a redemption request is made and there is insufficient cash in the cash pool, is where a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders. In such a case the Fund will always suspend the withdrawal of units. Suspension of issuing and redeeming units 27.The Fund has not previously suspended the issuing or redeeming of units. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; or (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Company securities from the NZSE; or (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 23 If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a)The predetermined rules used by the Manager and the NZSE to ascertain the Index constituents (set out above) will not be made with or influenced by any intention of seeking higher rates of return or capital growth. (b)No material changes will be made to the way in which the Fund will track the Index. (c)No material changes will be made to the way in which the NZSE constructs the Index. (d)The Fund will re-balance in the following circumstances: (i)monthly, when the NZSE adjusts the weighting of Index Companies to allow for cancellation/allotment of shares on issue of the Index Companies; (ii)quarterly, when the NZSE reviews the Index Companies in the Index; (iii)when the NZSE make any other announcement that affects the NZSE30 Index; and (iv) If any security or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than 0.2%. Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within one business day. (e)When rebalancing the Fund the Manager will use its best endeavours to track the Index as exactly as possible. Any re-balancing of the Fund that does not achieve an exact match of the Index will only occur where it is not possible to obtain or sell the securities necessary to exactly replicate the Index. In any case the tracking deviation will not exceed 0.2% of the value of the Fund. (f)In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company of the Index, the Fund Manager will only take up the rights if the rights are to be included in the Index. If the rights are not included in the Index, the Fund Manager will sell the rights and reinvest in the Index at the earliest possible time. (g)With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index Company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to the NZSE Listing Rules or the Takeover Code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at the time the Index is adjusted and not participate in the event in any other way. (h)The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. (i)When the Fund is given the option of re- investing its dividends into any Index Company, the Fund invariably accepts the cash dividend. (j)The cash pool is held in on-call deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and •To fund any expenses, and fee or taxation obligations of the Fund. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed 5% of the total assets of the Fund. (k)Condition (j) shall not be considered breached if the 5% limit is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: •For up to one business day if there is rapid inflow to the Fund, or the Fund has notice of a substantial pending withdrawal ; •For up to one calendar month if the Manager receives a formal notice of a forthcoming obligation of subsequent performance (ie, payment due on partly paid shares) affecting the constituent securities in the index; or •For up to one calendar month if the Manager is aware of a forthcoming distribution to unitholders at the scheduled date of distribution. In any event when the 5% limit in exceeded for any of the reasons above, the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 24 (l)The Fund can borrow only in the following circumstances: •To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event the borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where the Fund is required to fund purchases of shares due to changes in the Index Companies in the Index where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible; •When, due to a merger situation affecting the composition of the Index, payment due to the Fund is delayed (such delay is beyond the control of the Fund) creating a situation where the Fund will need to rebalance the Index; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible; or •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. (m)The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. (n)This Ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i)there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii)if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). (o)This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. (p)Apart from the Trust Deed and the Prospectus of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this Ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: (a) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or (b) the entry into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal; and/or (c) the appointment by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or (d) any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Fund, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Fund, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. (q)The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of Index Company shares. (r)If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. (s)The Fund will not be involved in any securities lending. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 25 (t)A suspension from issuing or redeeming units may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; or (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Company securities from the NZSE; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; or (4) where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders; or If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. (u)The Manager will not redeem units as a means of correcting tracking errors. (v)The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.7 of the Trust Deed to promote or carry on any scheme or undertaking in any country upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee deems fit. (w)The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.10 of the Trust Deed to agree to enter into and perform any contract option or other right relating to any investment including any derivative. (x)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders when unitholders wish to redeem their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool, when the Fund cannot borrow the funds required, and when the Fund is unable to sell sufficient securities in order to redeem the units requested. The Manager will not use this power to enhance the profit of the Fund. (y)There is no arrangement between the Trustee and any unitholders to effect the redemption of units in substitution for dividends. (z)Any cancellation of units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). (aa)The Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. (bb)The Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). (cc)All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to investors net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. (dd)In relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a person that is related to Tortis-NZ within the meaning of section CF 3(12). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows: •Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). •Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. •If the Fund is liquidated, section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount”, as those terms apply to the Fund. The excess return amount will include gains on any securities sold by the Fund. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2001 until 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of June 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 26 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/26 4.The investment policy of the Fund is set out in clause 82.1 of the Trust Deed. It states: 82.The investment policy of the Trust shall be: 82.1to only invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool and Unmarketable Accumulations) in Index Shares in a manner that replicates the Adjusted MSCI and to only enter into transactions that are necessary to give effect to that policy; 82.2to invest the Cash Pool in deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the Tower First Rate Account upon terms that will allow the Manager to pay the anticipated Liabilities of the Fund and to manage the redemption of Units and the liquidity of the Trust; 82.3to invest Unmarketable Accumulations in Derivatives until the total value of investment in Derivatives reaches a Marketable Amount whereupon the Derivatives will be realised and the proceeds invested in accordance with clause 82.1 or 82.2; and 82.4to not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the Investments being held in non New Zealand currencies. 5.The investment objectives of the Fund are as follows: •To track the adjusted MSCI Index, called the TOWER Global Index, to provide broad international coverage of approximately 1,000 companies; •The Global Index includes only “grey listed” countries to New Zealand, so that double taxation issues do not occur. These include companies resident in the United Sates, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, and Australia. These companies provide coverage of 80% of all international companies contained within the total MSCI Index; •The Investment Manager cannot diversify investments of the Fund, or take prudent steps in respect of the mix of the Fund’s investments. 6.The Trust Deed states that: It is not the Fund or the Trustee’s intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling constituent company securities. 7.Tortis-INTL is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in Tortis-INTL is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in Tortis-INTL (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the fund or any particular investment of the fund. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis-International Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b) and CF 3(1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-International Fund (“Tortis-INTL” or the “Fund” or the “Trust”) pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 16 December 1996 and amended on 18 February 1997, 31 July 2000 and as amended by an Amending Trust Deed which will be the same as, or not materially different from the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue on 29 June 2001 (the “Trust Deed”), and the Prospectus for the Fund (the “Prospectus”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund invests in the securities of those companies that make up the Tower Global Index (the “Global Index” or the “Index”). The Global Index is a customised version of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (the “MSCI World Index”). The Fund has been designed to provide investors with comprehensive coverage of global equities. 2.Tortis-INTL is a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 3.Tortis-INTL is a New Zealand tax resident. The trustee of Tortis-INTL is the Public Trustee (the “Trustee”). The manager of Tortis-INTL is Tower Managed Funds Investments Limited (previously known under the name “Tower Trust Services Limited”) (the “Manager”). The investment manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (the “Investment Manager” or “State Street”). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 27 8.The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects of the previous rulings (BR Prv 96/135, BR Prv 96/136, and BR Prv 01/15), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund (except for the changes noted above), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. The MSCI World Index 9.The Tower Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. 10.The tracking of the Global Index is undertaken by the Investment Manager. 11.The fundamental objective of the MSCI World Index is as follows (taken from the MSCI Methodology and Index Policy document, published by MSCI in March 1998, at page 3): MSCI Indices are constructed to provide benchmarks that accurately represent the opportunities available to the institutional investor. While an all-share-index (all listed companies at their full market cap weight) represents the theoretical opportunity set available to the global investor, this is not a fair performance benchmark in practice, since it cannot be fully replicated due to illiquidity of either shares or volume. Thus, MSCI creates indices which capture the spirit of an all-share index, but are actually subsets of shares which are truly replicable. 12.The rules for determining which companies will be included in the MSCI World Index are set out below (taken from the MSCI Methodology and Index Policy document): MSCI produces a world index which currently (31 May 2000) comprises 22 countries and over 1,300 stocks. Each country included in the MSCI World Index is represented by a separate index which forms part of the larger Index. The index for each country is referred to as a MSCI Country Index. In constructing the MSCI Country Indices MSCI uses a five-step process. MSCI Country Index Selection Criteria: 1.Define the total market. 2 .Sort the market by industry groups and target 60% for inclusion. 3 .Select stocks with good liquidity and free float. 4.Avoid cross-ownership. 5.Apply the full market capitalization weight to each stock. 1.Define the total market: The initial research for the MSCI Indices covers the full breadth of each equity market in the universe. Country specialists track the evolution of both listed and unlisted shares of domestically listed companies in 51 markets that, combined, account for over 90% of the world’s total market capitalization. Based in Geneva, these teams of country specialists collect data on shares, pricing, ownership, float and liquidity for effectively all companies worldwide. Sources for this information include local stock exchanges and brokerage firms, newspapers ad company contacts. All of the companies within this research coverage are eligible for inclusion in the MSCI Indices except non- domiciled companies, investment trusts and mutual funds. 2.Sort the total market by industry groups and target 60% for inclusion: Once information on the total country market capitalization is analyzed, 60% of the capitalization of each industry group, and thus 60% of the entire market, is targeted for inclusion in each MSCI country index. This process ensures that the index reflects the industry characteristics of the overall market, and permits the construction of accurate regional and composite industry indices. With the uniform target of capturing 60% of each country’s total market capitalization, each country carries its proportional weight in the regional and composite indices. A 60% target has been found sufficient to maintain a high level of tracking while still providing for an investable universe across all countries (the “highest common denominator” which can be captured, while still having an investable index in each country). 3.Select stocks with good liquidity and free float: A goal of the MSCI index construction process is to select the most liquid stocks within each industry group, all other things being equal, since liquidity is necessary but not the sole determinant for inclusion in the index. Liquidity is monitored by monthly average trading value over time in order to determine normal levels of volume, excluding temporary peaks and troughs. A stock’s liquidity is significant not only in absolute terms, but also relative to its market capitalization and to average liquidity for the country and the industry as a whole. Liquidity is not used as an absolute measure to select constituents because: An absolute minimum level of liquidity would be arbitrary and would have different meanings in different markets. Liquidity is partly a function of the cyclicality of markets and industries. Limiting index constituents to only the most liquid stocks would introduce a bias against those stocks and sectors that are temporarily out of favor with investors. An inflexible rule might also dictate a pattern of constituent additions and deletions that would introduce unnecessary turnover in the index. The free float (percentage of shares freely tradable) of every security in the market is monitored and an estimate is calculated, and low float may exclude a stock from consideration in the index. In the developed markets and some emerging markets, “low” float is considered under approximately 25%, as estimated by the country specialists at CIPSA in Geneva. However, in many emerging market countries, the average float is below 25%, so float is measured relative to the stock’s own industry and country. But float can be a difficult number to determine. In some markets, reliable data sources are generally not available; in other markets, information on smaller and less prominent issues can be subject to error and time lags. Additionally, government ownership and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 28 corporate share crossholdings can change over time and are not always made public. The precise definition of “float” also tends to differ depending on the data source. Thus, evaluations of float run the risk of penalizing those markets that have higher standards for company disclosure, regardless of the actual degree of availability of shares. As with liquidity, sufficient float is an important consideration, not an inflexible rule. 4.Avoid cross-ownership: Cross-ownership occurs when one company has a significant ownership stake in another company, and both are included in the index. Substantial cross-ownership can skew industry weights, distort country-level valuations (such as Price/ Earnings and Price/Book Value) and overstate a country’s true market size. An integral part of the index construction process is to identify corporate share crossholdings in order to avoid or minimize cross-ownership in the MSCI Indices. Country analysts in Geneva separate cross-ownership stakes into two categories. The first consists of stakes which are considered immaterial. In these cases, such cross-ownership does not represent something significant in terms of having distortionary effects on the index even if both companies are included. The second category is stakes which could materially distort an industry- or country-level index by significantly overstating the index’s market capitalization if both companies are included. Other ownership stakes (such as government, family, other institutional holdings) are also included in the estimated free float. 5.Apply the full market capitalization weight to each stock: All standard MSCI indices are weighted by each company’s full market capitalization (both listed and unlisted shares). This approach has the advantage of objectivity—the number of shares outstanding is consistently defined for companies around the world and is a readily obtainable figure. This approach also minimizes turnover. MSCI does not adjust share weights for either free float or cross- holdings. The most serious consequence of float limitations is illiquidity, which can be monitored objectively. Full market capitalization weighting is favored to float-weighting schemes for both theoretical and practical reasons: •It is impossible to judge whether a position which is currently in firm hands might be available in the future. •The quality and timeliness of information on float varies from market to market. Adjustments penalize those markets with the highest standards of company information disclosure. •Float adjustments incur index turnover as the float of a company changes. However, the precision of a float-adjusted index may not yield a more “investable” index. For instance, when the float of a stock increases from 55% to 60%, it may not be necessarily 5% more investable on a practical basis. In fact, it was probably fully replicable at a full market cap weight and the increase in turnover did not result in a “better” index, only an increase in transaction costs. •Float adjustments on a country level may not result in materially different country weights from market capitalization weights. \[Weighting stocks at their full market capitalisation, as described above in the fifth selection criterion, is slowly being phased out by MSCI: first by its extension of the partial inclusion policy to all new additions to its indices (as of 31 July 2000) and second, by the change in its index construction methodology to a free float-adjustment methodology. However, currently stocks which were already part of the Index as at 31 July 2000 are included at their full market capitalisation.\] Partial Inclusion Policy Since the normal MSCI index policy is to include index constituents at 100% of market capitalization, large issues with low float—a characteristic of many privatizations—pose a dilemma for index construction. Including such companies at full market cap weight can overwhelm an index and overstate the true size of market opportunities; yet excluding them also results in an incomplete picture of the market. A company is included or excluded on a case-by-case basis, where the contributing factors include the expected change in float (especially for first-time government privatizations), stability of the liquidity and importance of the company in its local economy. A growing number of very sizable companies have been or will be brought to market with modest tranches initially made available to the public. By virtue of their size and visibility, these companies are obvious candidates for inclusion in a portfolio. To reflect this new market trend, MSCI index construction rules do allow for the possibility of including a company at a portion of its total market capitalization. This occurs only in exceptional cases when very large companies come to market with very modest initial float. In July 31 2000 the policy on partial inclusions was amended. MSCI has extended the application of its policy on partial inclusion of companies to all new additions to the MSCI indices. This amendment will simplify the partial inclusion policy, providing consistent treatment for all new index additions. Previously, the policy was targeted only at new constituents with very large market capitalizations. This amendment does not affect existing constituents in the MSCI indices. Following this amendment, all companies with a float below 40%, that are to be added to the MSCI Standard or Extended indices, regardless of size, will be included at a fraction of their total market capitalization using a Market Cap Factor (MCF). The MCF will be determined using MSCI’s current schedule as shown below: % Float equal1 01 52 02 53 03 5 4 0 or exceeding\* % Market Cap 2 03 04 05 06 08 0 100 Factor (MCF) \* Over-allotment option is not included in the case of IPOs, privatizations and similar public offerings. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 29 Structural Changes (“Structural Changes”) In changing the constituents of the MSCI Indices, accurate representation is balanced with minimizing turnover. An index must represent the current state of an evolving marketplace while at the same time minimizing turnover, which is costly as well as inconvenient for investment managers. Restructuring an index involves a balancing of constituent additions and deletions. The primary concern when considering additions and deletions is the continuity of the indices. Of secondary concern are the turnover costs associated with these changes. There are two broad categories of changes to the MSCI Indices: structural changes and market-driven changes. Structural changes reflect the evolution of a market due, for example, to a change in industry composition or regulations. Industry restructurings generally take place every 18 to 24 months for any given country. However, the structural change to the country index may occur on only four dates throughout the year: as of the close of the last business day of February, May, August and November. MSCI index additions and deletions are announced two weeks in advance. There are absolute firewalls on any price-sensitive decision until there is a public announcement. These changes are communicated to subscribers both electronically and by fax. They are simultaneously posted on public Reuters pages (starting on MSCIA) and public Bloomberg pages (MSCN). The Reuters and Bloomberg MSCI pages are updated by Capital International Perspective, S.A. in Geneva. The pages include the security names, the action to be taken and, when necessary, the context of the change. A more detailed announcement service is available for a fee (and provides the weightings, shares outstanding, security identifiers and industry classification). During the examination of each country index, the market cap and business function coverage of each industry group is measured against the underlying market. The investability (free float, cross-ownership, long- and short-term trading volume and turnover) of each constituent is also monitored. In the event that an industry is over- or under-covered, or that there are stocks in the index which are no longer investable (here both long-term and short-term liquidity is examined), or a large privatization has altered the capitalization of the market, a structural change may be necessary. The MSCI indices reflect the opportunity set to the global investor on an ongoing basis—and should thus mirror the fundamental changes in the market’s structure, and correspond to the situation of the average institutional investor. These structural changes are designed and timed to minimize turnover to the indices. If possible, several unrelated changes to a country index are grouped together, minimizing disruption. Structural Change Additions: As markets grow because of privatizations, investor interest, or the relaxation of regulations, index additions (with or without corresponding deletions) may be needed to bring industry representations up to the 60% target. Companies are considered not only with respect to their broad industry, but also with respect to their sub- sector, in order to represent if possible a broader range of economic activity. Structural Change Deletions: The indices must represent the full-investment cycle, including bear as well as bull markets. Out-of-favor stocks may exhibit declining price, market capitalization, and/or liquidity, and yet continue to be good representatives of their industry. Deleting constituents because their liquidity has declined introduces a bias against out-of-favor companies or industries, especially those in the trough of a business cycle. For this reason, low liquidity is never an automatic trigger for deleting a company from the index. Companies may be deleted because they have diversified away from their industry classification, because the industry has evolved in a different direction from the company’s thrust, or because a better industry representative exists (either a new issue or an existing company). In addition, in order not to exceed the 60% target coverage of industries and countries, adding new index companies may entail corresponding deletions. Market-driven Changes (“Market Driven Changes”) Market-driven changes consist of new issues, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and other similar corporate events. These changes are announced and implemented as they occur. Additions - New Issues: New issues may not be automatically eligible for immediate inclusion in the MSCI Indices. Many factors must be considered, such as market capitalization, float and liquidity. Some new issues undergo a seasoning period of six to twelve months between index restructurings until a trading pattern and volume are established. After that time, they are eligible for inclusion, subject to the standard selection criteria discussed. However, sometimes a new issue, usually a privatization, comes to market and substantially changes the country’s industry profile. In this case, where even temporarily excluding it would distort the characteristics of the market, it may be immediately included in the MSCI Indices. An example is YPF, Argentina’s privatized oil company, which at USD 3.04 billion is Latin America’s largest privatization to date. In these cases, however, an announcement is made in the first few days of official trading for the security, since the country specialists do not want to influence the primary placement of the issue. In other cases, a large new issue may not be included even in the normal process of restructuring, despite substantial size and liquidity. The primary reasons for non-inclusion of a large new issue are as follows: •A large stock, if it has low float and is also illiquid, can overwhelm an index and over- represent the true opportunities in the market. •The index may be at the limit of industry representation—including the new issue would seriously over-weight an industry in the index. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 30 •In some cases, it is necessary to defer inclusion of a new issue until the next opportunity for index restructuring. Deletions - Suspended Companies: In the case of suspension for bankruptcy or near bankruptcy, the suspended company is deleted at the smallest price (unit or fraction of the currency) at which a security could have traded in a given market. More complex are the cases where the suspension is due to a major restructuring, which results in the company being ineligible (at least for an important period of time) for normal listing and trading on the stock exchange. The MSCI policy is to remove these companies from the index only after there is little likelihood the company will return to normal trading. In this situation, the key issue is determining the price at which the company can be removed from the index. Unofficial market prices may be used as a base to determine that exit price. In exceptional circumstances, average indicative prices from reliable sources may be used. Mergers & Acquisitions: Any case of mergers and acquisitions, or capital restructuring, which can affect a company within the MSCI universe is monitored. Depending on whether the active companies are, or are not, constituents of the MSCI Indices, a number of factors must be considered. If either the acquiring or the acquired firm is a constituent of the index, the first consideration is the impact of the acquisition on the index. The second consideration involves structural changes to the index. When a non-constituent company acquires a constituent company, either the acquiring company can replace the constituent company in the index, or another company altogether may be chosen as a better representative of the industry. If two medium-sized, non-constituent companies merge, the merged company may also be considered for inclusion in the indices. However, this change would occur only through a structural review. Spin-Offs: A spin-off is the distribution to existing shareholders of a part of the company’s business through the issuance of shares in the newly-established company. The decision to include the newly- established company in the index is based on several factors including estimated market value, market capitalization, and float. The market value of the spin- off is estimated through a consensus of industry analysts, grey market prices, and statistics on revenues and earnings. Performance of stocks The methodology for determining which stocks are to be included in the relevant country indices does not involve any exercise of predicting whether a company is likely to be particularly profitable or unprofitable or whether the company’s securities are likely to increase in value or decrease in value. Performance is not an issue. MSCI is solely focused on ensuring that a consistent methodology is used in preparing the indices, which maximises the utility of the indices as a recognised world-wide benchmark of stock market movement and avoids unnecessary turnover of index stocks. Changes to the MSCI World Index 13.In partial replacement of the process stated above, there are also forthcoming changes which alter the way in which the MSCI World Index will select its constituent company securities. The MSCI will adjust all its equity indices for free float and increase the target market representation of its Standard Index series from 60% to 85%. The combined changes will be implemented in two separate phases. The first phase will be implemented as of the close of 30 November 2001 and the second phase will be implemented as of the close of 31 May 2002. 14.The change in index construction methodology to a “free float-adjustment” methodology is described in the MSCI Announcement, dated 10 December 2000 (“the Announcement”), as follows: MSCI calculates the free float of an equity security as its total number of shares outstanding less shareholdings classified as strategic and shares otherwise restricted from trading by international investors. Examples of shares excluded from free float are stakes held by governments, corporations, controlling shareholders and their families, the company’s management, and shares subject to foreign ownership restrictions. Under this enhanced index construction methodology, MSCI will free float-adjust constituent weights using an adjustment factor, which will be referred to as the Inclusion Factor. This Inclusion Factor is equal to a constituent’s estimated free float rounded-up to the closest 5%. For example, a constituent with an estimated free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its total market capitalization, while a constituent with an estimated free float of 78.6%, will be included in the index with an Inclusion Factor of 0.80. Where the foreign ownership limit is more restrictive than the free float, and if there are no foreign strategic investors, a constituent’s Inclusion Factor will be equal to its exact foreign ownership limit, rounded to the nearest percentage point. Securities with a free float below 15% will not typically be eligible for inclusion in the MSCI equity indices. However, in exceptional cases where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry, the security may be included in the MSCI indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float rounded to the closest percentage point. For example, a very large company with an estimated free float of 11.4%, if included in the index, would be included with an Inclusion Factor of 0.11. In order to account for other types of restrictions on foreign equity investment, such as the investor qualification and quota approval system prevailing today in Taiwan, the enhanced MSCI methodology provides for an additional investability factor, referred to as the Limited Investability Factor. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 31 The application of this Limited Investability Factor would permit a more accurate comparison of markets with more complex and subtle restrictions to the investment process with markets where investment limitations can be appropriately reflected in security specific Inclusion Factors. MSCI will review constituents’ Inclusion Factors at the time of regular country index rebalancings. In addition, MSCI will allow for changes in a security’s Inclusion Factor in response to significant market- driven corporate events, as the events become effective. 15.To determine whether a shareholding is strategic or non-strategic, the Announcement states the following guidelines: Shareholding classification guidelines MSCI primarily classifies shareholdings as strategic or non-strategic based on a categorization of investor types. ·Strategic shareholders: The following investor types are generally considered as strategic and their shareholdings in a company are not included in that company’s equity capital to determine its free float: ·Governments: Shares owned by governments and affiliated entities. Please refer to the specific guidelines described below for government agencies and government-related investment funds. ·Corporations: Shares owned by corporations, including treasury shares owned by the company itself, except when the treasury shares are excluded from the number of shares outstanding. Please refer to specific guidelines for banks. ·Management and Board Members: Shares owned by members of the company’s management or Board of Directors, including shares owned by individuals or families that are related to or closely affiliated with members of the company’s management, Board of Directors, or founding members deemed to be insiders. ·Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs): Shares owned in ESOPs during the lockup period. Non-Strategic shareholders: The following investor types are generally considered as non-strategic and their shareholdings in a company are included in that company’s equity capital to determine its free float: ·Individuals: Shares owned by individuals, excluding shares owned by individuals or families that are related to or closely affiliated with members of the company’s management, Board of Directors or founding members deemed to be insiders, and, excluding those shareholdings held by individuals whose significant size suggests that they are strategic in nature. ·Investment funds, mutual funds or unit trusts: Shares owned in investment funds, mutual funds and unit trusts, including shares owned in passively managed funds. ·Pension funds: Shares owned in employee pension funds, excluding shares of the employing company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. ·Insurance companies: In principle, the investment objective of portfolio holdings of insurance companies is non-strategic. When there are reasons to believe that an insurance company’s shareholding is strategic, it will not be included in free float. ·Social security funds: Shares owned in social security funds, unless the fund’s management is deemed to exert influence over the management of the company. ·Venture capital funds: Shares owned in venture capital funds, unless a specific investment is deemed to be strategic in nature. 16.If the above guidelines are not sufficient, the Announcement also states the following additional guidelines: In the event that the above categories should not appropriately capture the nature of a specific shareholding, its classification as strategic or non- strategic will be determined based on a more extensive analysis. In particular, the following guidelines will be followed: ·Banks. Shareholdings by banks are considered as strategic, excluding, when identifiable, specific shareholdings that are deemed to be non- strategic. ·Nominees or trustees: Shareholdings registered in the name of a nominee or trustee are classified as strategic or non-strategic based on an analysis of who is the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares, according to the above definitions. ·Government agencies and government- related investment funds: Shareholdings of government agencies and government-related investment funds are classified based on an analysis of the objective of the investment. ·Shares placed in IPOs with special incentives: Shares that are placed in an IPO and that include meaningful incentives to hold the shares for a specific period of time, are classified as strategic until those incentives expire. ·ADRs and GDRs: Shares that are deposited to back the issuance of ADRs and GDRs are classified as non-strategic, unless it is established that a specific stake held in ADRs or GDRs is strategic in nature. 17.Other shares (other than those which are classified as “strategic”) may also be excluded from the free float. These shares, described above as “shares otherwise restricted” from the free float, are described as follows: ·Limits on share ownership for foreigners: Limits on the proportion of a security’s share capital that is authorized for purchase by non- domestic investors. Where they exist, these foreign share-ownership limits are generally set by law, government regulations, or company by- laws. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 32 •Other foreign investment restrictions: Investment restrictions, other than those described above, which materially limit the ability of international investors to freely invest in a particular equity market. There is typically no simple way to account for these limitations in a benchmark, as these restrictions tend to be more subtle and complex, and may affect different market participants in different ways. 18.The MSCI calculates the free float-adjustment construction methodology in the following manner: Calculation of a security’s free float-adjusted market capitalization As a general rule, MSCI calculates the free float of a security as its total number of shares outstanding less shareholdings classified as strategic and shares otherwise restricted from trading by international investors. However, the determination of the corresponding free float-adjusted market capitalization is dependent on the nature of the limitations on free float. In all cases, the calculation is based solely on publicly available shareholding information obtained from multiple information sources. For each security, all available shareholdings are considered where public data is available, regardless of size. •Calculation in the case of a security which is not subject to a foreign ownership limit or other foreign investment restrictions •Strategic shareholding (%) = Number of shares classified as strategic Total number of shares outstanding •Free float (%) = 100% - Strategic shareholding (%) •For constituents with free float greater than or equal to 15%, the security’s Inclusion Factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded-up to the closest 5%. •Securities with free float less than 15% are typically not eligible for inclusion in the indices. However, in exceptional cases, where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry, the security may be included in the indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float rounded to the closest 1%. •Free float-adjusted market capitalization = Inclusion Factor \* total market capitalization •Calculation in the case of a security which is subject to a foreign ownership limit •Foreign strategic shareholding (%) = Number of shares held by foreign strategic investors Total number of shares outstanding •Free float available to foreign investors (%) is equal to the lesser of •the free float, calculated as: 100% - strategic shareholding (including both foreign and domestic strategic shareholders) (%) •the foreign ownership limit less the foreign strategic shareholding (%) •For constituents whose free float available to foreign investors is greater than or equal to 15%, the security’s Inclusion Factor is equal to the lesser of: •the estimated free float available to foreign investors rounded-up to the closest 5%; •the foreign ownership limit rounded to the closest 1%. •Securities with a free float available to foreign investors of less than 15% are typically not eligible for inclusion in the indices. However, in exceptional cases, where including such a security would significantly improve the index’s ability to accurately represent the investment opportunities in that country or industry the security may be included in the indices with an Inclusion Factor equal to its estimated free float available to foreign investors rounded to the closest 1%. •Free float-adjusted market capitalization = Inclusion Factor \* total market capitalization •In the case of a security which is subject to other foreign investment restrictions In the case where other foreign investment restrictions exist, which materially limit the ability of international investors to freely invest in equity markets, an additional Limited Investability Factor may be applied. There is typically no simple way to account for these types of investability limitations in a benchmark as they tend to be subtle and complex, and may affect different market participants in different ways. Therefore, where warranted, the Limited Investability Factor will be determined based on an extensive case-by-case analysis. 19.The change in target representation, as described in the Announcement, will occur as follows: In conjunction with the free float-adjustment of its indices, MSCI will increase the target market representation in the MSCI Standard Index series from 60% of total market capitalization to 85% of free float-adjusted market capitalization within each industry group within each country. Given trends such as increased market concentration, the increase in coverage will provide greater diversification and representation of investment opportunities in the indices. Broader coverage is also expected to decrease ongoing turnover in the MSCI indices. MSCI research shows that the increase to a target market representation of 85% can be achieved with the addition of a reasonable number of relatively liquid and sizeable constituents in most countries. In the countries where this is not possible, the country index will remain below the target market representation of 85%. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 33 20.The “phase in” periods, also detailed in the December 2000 Announcement, for the changes were detailed as follows: Publication of Constituent Data and Implementation In order to assist market participants in understanding and preparing for these changes, MSCI plans to publish, on or before June 30 2001, the list of index constituents and their Inclusion Factors under the enhanced methodology for each of the MSCI Standard country indices. In addition, shortly thereafter, MSCI will begin publishing a provisional index series to measure the performance of the MSCI countries and main regions based on the enhanced methodology. The provisional series, together with the constituents and their Inclusion Factors, also may be used by clients who wish to measure their performance against such an index, ahead of MSCI’s official implementation schedule. In order to best transition the indices to the enhanced methodology, the combined changes will be implemented in two separate phases: as of the close of 30 November 2001, and as of the close of 31 May 2002. The changes in each phase will simultaneously affect all MSCI Standard country indices and will include changes resulting from both the free float- adjustment and the increase in coverage. In the first phase, approximately half of the total change resulting from the free float-adjustment will be implemented for all existing index constituents and, simultaneously, all the new constituents resulting from the increase in coverage to 85% will be added at approximately half of their free float-adjusted market capitalization. More specifically, in the first phase, the market capitalization of all existing index constituents will be adjusted by an interim Inclusion Factor equal to the simple average of the current proportion of market capitalization included in the index prior to the change and their final Inclusion Factor. This average will be rounded up to the closest 5% (or closest 1% if below 15%). For example, in the first phase, two constituents with free floats of 23.2% and 78.6%, respectively, currently included in the index at their full market capitalization weights, will have their market capitalization adjusted by interim Inclusion Factors of 0.65 and 0.90, respectively. These interim Inclusion Factors are calculated as (25%+100%)/2 = 62.5%, rounded-up to 65%, and (80%+100%)/2 = 90%, respectively. Simultaneously, all the new constituents resulting from the increase in coverage to 85% will be added to the indices in the first phase with interim Inclusion Factors equal to half of their final Inclusion Factors rounded-up to the closest 5% (or 1% if below 15%). For example, in the first phase, two new constituents with free floats of 23.2% and 78.6%, respectively, will be included in the indices with their market capitalization adjusted by Inclusion Factors of 0.13 (25%/2 = 12.5%, rounded-up to 13%) and 0.40 (80%/2 = 40%), respectively. In the second and final phase, the remaining adjustment to market capitalization of all constituent securities will be implemented. Index Rebalancings and Market Events during the Transition Period During the transition period, from 11 December 2000 through 31 May 2002, MSCI will maintain its schedule of regular quarterly index rebalancings for its Standard Index series. To minimize changes not related to the transition, MSCI will seek to coordinate all changes in the Standard indices with the target index under the enhanced methodology (i.e., the provisional series when available.) In addition, MSCI will only consider very significant changes in the equity markets when performing its quarterly index reviews. All new additions of companies resulting from IPO’s and regular quarterly rebalancings will be included with their final Inclusion Factors. Also, during the transition period, important new market capitalization additions resulting from mergers, acquisitions and similar corporate events, in principle will be made in proportion to the free float of the additional market capitalization entering the index. For example, when a company - with a current inclusion factor of 40% - issues new shares for the acquisition of assets entirely in firm hands for the equivalent of 25% of its current share capital, the resulting inclusion factor will be derived from the following calculation: \[(100 x 40%) + (25 x 0%)\] / 125 = 32%, which will be rounded up to 35%. 21.As of 31 May 2001, MSCI have been calculating and publishing the MSCI Provisional Index Series, which is based upon the MSCI Enhanced Methodology for free float adjusting constituents’ index weights, and targeting for Index inclusion 85% of free float- adjusted market capitalisation in each industry group with each country. The Adjusted MSCI World Index: the Tower Global Index 22.The Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index replicates the MSCI World Index, with one qualification: it only contains grey list countries, which comprise at least 2% of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index does not alter the MSCI World Index in any other way. 23.If any of the countries included in the Global Index leave the grey list then securities held in companies resident in that country will be immediately divested. If any company in which Tortis INTL holds securities ceases to be resident in a grey list country, then securities held in that company will be immediately divested. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 34 Trust Deed and Prospectus Two classes of units 24.The Fund offers two classes of units: Class A and Class B. Class A units are standard retail units. Class B units are issued on exactly the same terms as Class A units, however holders of Class B units, due to the size of their investment, are able to negotiate reduced management and trustee fees. Date of Adjustments 25.The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: •If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and •Due to the Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and •If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. 26.Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. Rights Issues 27.The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of rights issues. 28.In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 29.The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers or share buy-backs. 30.With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 31.The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of a Index Company. Cash investments held by the Fund 32.Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Manager and the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Manager and the Investment Manager is on “call”. Wherever possible, the Manager will enter into futures contracts to cover the cash held by the Fund. This is known as “equitised cash”. 33.The Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) will hold cash in the following circumstances: •Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Index, pending the reinvestment of that cash; •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a Manager on behalf of a unitholder; •To accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the Index, which is presently $NZ5 million (“the minimum investment level”). The minimum investment level will increase to $US3 million as at 31 May 2002 to take account of the changes to the MSCI described in paragraphs 13 to 21 above. 34.The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: •for up to 10 working days preceding a MSCI structural change; •for up to 3 working days after a MSCI structural change; or •for up to 10 working days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 35 35.In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Manager may hold cash. The amount of cash held by the Manager will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the circumstances described below, and in any event will not exceed 2% of the total assets of the Fund. Those circumstances are: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and •To fund the expenses, fees and taxation for the Fund; 36.The 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager may be exceeded in the following circumstances: •For up to one business day if there is rapid inflow to the Fund, or the Fund has notice of a substantial pending withdrawal ; •For up to one calendar month if the Manager receives a formal notice of a forthcoming obligation of subsequent performance (ie, payment due on partly paid shares) affecting the constituent securities in the Index; or •For up to one calendar month if the Manager is aware of a forthcoming distribution to unitholders at the scheduled date of distribution. 37.However, in any event, if the 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager is exceeded, the Fund will take immediate action to remedy the situation within the shortest practicable time. 38.At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Manager and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) which is the greater of 5% of the total value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the total value of the Fund and the minimum investment level (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 39.The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 40.The following futures contracts are currently used: CountryContract AustraliaSPI200 CanadaS&P/TSE60 JapanNikkei 225 GermanyDAX United KingdomFTSE100 United StatesS&P500 41.In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the Global Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such alternative contract or contracts. Hedging 42.The Fund does not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non- New Zealand currencies. Foreign Currencies 43.The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or divest the foreign currencies necessary to purchase or dispose of Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within 2 business days. Borrowing 44.The Fund may only borrow in the following circumstances: •To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; •To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 36 •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 45.The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Issue and redemption of Units 46.Investors wishing to subscribe for units may do so for cash or, alternatively, above a certain prescribed level, investors may subscribe for units by transferring to Tortis-INTL an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-INTL in exchange. 47.When a unitholder wishes to dispose of an investment in the Fund, the unitholder is able to elect that the units be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager. Notwithstanding any provision in the Prospectus or the Deed of Trust, it is the invariable practice of the Fund that where such an election is made by the unitholder, the units will be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager, in strict accordance with that election. In the absence of an election by the unitholder, the units will in all instances be repurchased by the Manager. Where units are repurchased by the Manager, the price paid to the unitholder by the Manager will be the same amount as would be received by the unitholder if the unitholder had elected the direct redemption method. In all instances where units are repurchased by the Manager, whether pursuant to an election by a unitholder or not, the Manager will redeem those units with the Trustee for the same price as paid to the unitholder. 48.A unitholder may redeem units subject to the conditions in Article C of the Trust Deed. Article C gives the Manager a discretion to refuse to redeem units where the amount to be redeemed is less than the minimum number acceptable by the Manager at that time. Currently the Manager has set a minimum withdrawal at $500. 49.Unit prices may be published in newspapers. Tortis-INTL has an Internet site which will be used principally to publish prices at which the Manager will repurchase or redeem units, and as a means for transferring units only by purchase from the Manager, and redemption or repurchase by the Manager. Same day unit redemption policy 50.On being repurchased the Manager is required to pay the aggregate value of the units to the investor within 21 business days of the relevant time (as described in the Trust Deed). However when possible the Fund operates a same day unit redemption policy. The Fund will endeavour to redeem the units requested by any unitholder and redeem and pay for those units on the same day as the unitholder’s request is made. 51.If the Fund has insufficient cash in the cash pool, the Fund will always in the first instance attempt to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds in order to meet the redemption request. In situations where the Fund is not able to borrow such sufficient funds, the Fund may suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund. The only exception to the Fund always attempting to borrow in the first instance where a redemption request is made and there is insufficient cash in the cash pool, is where a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders. In such a case the Fund will always suspend the withdrawal of units. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 37 Suspension of issuing and redeeming units 52.The Fund has not previously suspended the issuing or redeeming of units. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; or (4) in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a)The predetermined rules used by the Investment Manager to ascertain the Global Index constituents (set out above), and the predetermined rules used by MSCI to calculate the MSCI World Index (set out above), will not be made with or influenced by any intention of seeking higher rates of return or capital growth. (b)No material changes will be made to the way in which the Global Index tracks the MSCI World Index. (c)Apart from as described above at paragraphs 13 to 21, no material changes will be made to the way in which MSCI constructs the MSCI World Index. (d)The proportion of the Applicant’s assets to be held as cash (including all “free” cash and “equitised” cash) will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes stated in paragraph 32 of this ruling, and will not in any event exceed the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. This condition will not be regarded as being breached if, pending investment of contributions or disbursement of withdrawal proceeds, the Fund is forced to hold cash in excess of the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. The Fund will immediately invest or disburse such cash, except where immediate investment to track the Index is not possible due to the unavailability of appropriate equities, in which case the excess cash may be held for only so long as is strictly necessary and in any event no longer than two business days. (e)When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level (presently $NZ5 million, but to be $US3 million as from 31 May 2002), it will be immediately applied to track the Index. (f)The Investment Manager will rebalance the Fund in the following circumstances: •If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and •Due to Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and •If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. (g)When rebalancing the Fund the Investment Manager will use its best endeavours to track the Index as exactly as possible. Any rebalancing of the Fund that does not achieve an exact match of the Index will only occur where it is not possible to obtain or sell the securities necessary to exactly replicate the Index. In any case the tracking deviation will not exceed 1% of the value of the Fund. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 38 (h)In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. (i)With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted (but in any event within 2 business days). The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. (j)The Fund Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. (k)When the Fund is given the option of re- investing its dividends into any Index Company, the Fund invariably accepts the cash dividend. (l)The Fund can only borrow in the following circumstances: • To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; •To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. (m)The Fund will not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non- New Zealand currencies. (n)The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. (o)This Ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i)there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii)if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). (p)This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 39 (q)Apart from the Trust Deed and the Prospectus of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this Ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: (a) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or (b) the entry into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal; and/or (c) the appointment by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or (d) any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Fund, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Fund, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. (r)The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of Index Company securities. (s)If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. (t)The Fund will not be involved in any securities lending. (u)The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the issuing or redeeming of units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) except in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; (4) where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders; or (5) in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unitholders. (v)The Manager will not redeem units as a means of correcting tracking errors. (w)The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.7 of the Trust Deed to promote or carry on any scheme or undertaking in any country upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee deems fit. (x)The Fund will not invest in derivatives, with the exception of futures contracts entered into for the purposes of tracking the Index and spot foreign exchange contracts (which have a settlement period of no longer than two business days) to acquire or dispose of the necessary foreign currency so as to purchase or dispose of Index securities. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 40 (y)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders when unitholders wish to redeem their units. The Manager will always use this power when the unitholder specifically requests that the Manager purchase the units and in any instance where the unitholder does not specifically request that the Trustee redeem the units. The Manager will not purchase units from any unitholder, where to do so would be inconsistent with the unitholder’s election to redeem their units with the Trustee. The Manager will not use this power to enhance the profit of the Fund. (z)The Global Index will only include countries that are listed in Schedule 3, Part A. (aa)The foreign companies included in the Global Index are resident and liable for tax in a country listed in Schedule 3, Part A. (bb)For the purposes of section CG 15(2)(b)(iii), in case of an interest, in relation to a foreign entity, of a kind specified in section CG 15(1)(a), the foreign entity is not a foreign entity, or a member of a class of foreign entities, specified in Part B of Schedule 4. (cc)The Fund will not acquire or hold any income interest or any control interest in any company that is a “controlled foreign company” under section CG 4. (dd)There is no arrangement between the Trustee and any unitholders to effect the redemption of units in substitution for dividends. (ee)Any cancellation of units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). (ff)The Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. (gg)The Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). (hh)All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to investors net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. (ii)In relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a person that is related to Tortis- INTL within the meaning of section CF 3(12). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows. •Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). •Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. The procedure of publicising buy-back and redemption prices on the Internet does not constitute a “recognised exchange” in terms of the definition of that phrase in section OB 1. •If the Fund is liquidated, section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount”, as those terms apply to the Fund. The excess return amount will include gains on any securities sold by the Fund. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2001 until 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8 th day of August 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 41 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/27 82.1 to only invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool) in Index Companies in a manner that replicates the NZSE30 Index and to only enter into transactions that are necessary to give effect to that policy; and 82.2 to invest the Cash Pool in deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the Tower First Rate Account, upon terms that will allow the Manager to pay the anticipated Liabilities and to manage the redemption of Units and the liquidity of the Trust. 5.According to the Prospectus, the investment objectives of the Fund are as follows: •To track the performance of the NZSE30 Index, which represents approximately 97% of all shares listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange; •To invest only in shares and securities that replicate the NZSE30, apart from the liquidity pool of approximately 5% of the Fund’s assets; •The Investment Manager cannot diversify investments of the Fund, or take steps to diversify the mix of the Fund’s investments outside the above objectives. 6.The Trust Deed states that: It is not the Fund or the Trustee’s intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling constituent company securities. 7.Tortis-NZ is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) confers an equal interest in the Fund but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Fund or any investment in the Fund. 8.The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects and conditions of the previous rulings (BR Prv 96/135, BR Prv 96/136 and BR Prv 01/14), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund, (except for the changes noted above), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. The Index Rules 9.The NZSE describes the NZSE30 Index in general terms as follows: NZSE30 Selection Gross And Capital Indices The NZSE30 Selection Index covers the 30 largest and most liquid issuers with equity securities quoted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The float capital of each company is established by removing all known blocks of shares held, or more-or-less controlled, by This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis New Zealand Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3 (1)(b) and CF 3 (1)(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-NZ Fund (“Tortis-NZ” or the “Fund” or the “Trust”) pursuant to the Deed of Trust dated 1 November 1996 and as amended by an Amending Trust Deed which will be the same as, or not materially different from the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue on 29 June 2001 (the “Trust Deed”) and the Prospectus for the Fund (the “Prospectus”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund invests in a portfolio of shares that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE30 Selection Capital Index (“the Index”). The Fund has been designed to provide investors with an index which reflects as nearly as practical the stocks available to investors in the New Zealand Stock Exchange (the “NZSE”). The Applicant advises that the Index was selected because it allows for accurate tracking. 2.Tortis-NZ is a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 3.The trustee of the Fund is the Public Trustee (“the Trustee”). The manager of the Fund is Tower Managed Funds Investments Limited (previously known under the name “Tower Trust Services Limited”) (“the Manager”). 4.The investment policy of the Fund is set out in clause 82.1 of the Trust Deed. It states: 82.The investment policy of the Trust shall be: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 42 one person or a group of related persons and amounting to 30% or more of the share capital. This reflects as nearly as is practical, the stock normally available to investors. The NZSE30 Selection Index is weighted by float (available) capital and membership is reviewed quarterly. The Index has been recalculated back to 01 January 1991. The...NZSE30 \[is\] available in both gross and capital form, that is with and without the reinvestment of dividends. The day-to-day methods of index calculation and adjustment for issues and dividends are identical to the NZSE Gross and Capital Indices. 10.The Construction and Maintenance Rules for the NZSE30 Index explain how the Index operates. The Construction and Maintenance Rules contain 20 Rules, which outline how the Index is constructed and how it adjusts over time. These rules are as follows: The major rules governing the construction and maintenance of the base of companies making up the indices are as follows:- 1 .Companies considered for inclusion in the index must be registered in New Zealand or have a sufficient proportion of shareholding on a New Zealand register to qualify for inclusion based on that proportion of the company’s market capitalisation. 2 .All classes of quoted equity security of a company are eligible for inclusion in the index bases. For index calculation purposes an equity security is defined in the Listing Rules. It includes all securities representing a residual equity claim on the earnings of the company and all securities which derive a substantial portion of their value from their ordinary share characteristics or conversion privileges. This includes convertible notes, specified preference shares, partly-paid shares and warrants (company-issued options). 3 .Shares issued through pro rata bonus and rights issues will be recognised on the ex date, according to the issue ratio. Application of changes will be governed by Rule 4. 4.Any adjustments to the capitalisation of Index constituents which do not accumulate to a relative Index impact of more than 0.03% will be held and applied at each quarterly revision. Adjustments with a greater impact will be applied as soon as practicable. 5 .With respect to new issues that have a slightly different dividend entitlement to the ordinary shares, the treatment for index calculation purposes is to aggregate the reported outstanding number of both classes of share to the sum at the price of the ordinary share. 6 .Newly quoted securities will be included in the indices at the end of the month, not less than five business days following its initial listing if the company meets all inclusion criteria. Overseas FASTER constituent securities will be assigned a weighting that reflects the percentage holdings on the New Zealand Register in order to determine eligibility and weighting in the NZSE40 and NZSE30 Indices. The weighting assigned to overseas constituents will be the most recent three month moving average. If a weighting is not available at the time of quotation, then when the weighting is available post quotation, the market price will be used to determine eligibility. If a reasonable indication of the percentage holding on the New Zealand Register is available prior to listing, then this will be used in conjunction with its issue price. 7.The Exchange will review the composition of the indices each quarter according to the following rules 8 - 17. The revised bases of the indices, will be communicated to the market at least three weeks before they are to take effect. 8 .At each revision, companies will be ranked according to their daily average market capitalisation and float capitalisation for the preceding six months. The top 50 stocks will form the eligible pool for inclusion in either the NZSE40 or NZSE30 respectively. 9.Any index stock that has dropped out of the index pool will be removed from any index or indices in which it currently features. 10.Rule 10 refers only to NZSE40 Index. 11.Rule 11 refers only to NZSE40 Index. 12.Rule 12 refers only to NZSE40 Index. 13.The float capital of each company in the NZSE30 is calculated by excluding parcels of shares deemed to be not freely available in the market. As a general rule, the Exchange will exclude all holdings comprising a 30% or greater “relevant interest”, as disclosed in the Substantial Security Holders Notices issued pursuant to the Securities Amendment Act 1988. 14.Any NZSE30 stock that has dropped to a float capital rank of 36 or below will be removed from the NZSE30. 15.Any stock which is not in the NZSE30 and is ranked 25 or higher by float capital will automatically be introduced into the NZSE30 unless it would replace a more liquid stock (determined by trading value over the previous six months). New listings ranked 25 or higher by float capital in the index pool will be automatically included in the NZSE30 in accordance with rule 6. 16.Any required additions to or deletions from the NZSE30 as a result of the operation of rules 14 and 15 will be made with reference to the liquidity of the stocks ranked 26 to 35. 17.Any additions or deletions required between quarterly revisions due to a merger, takeover or new listing will be carried out in accordance with rules 10, 11,16 & 19. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 43 18.Movements in float capital will be monitored continuously, and the number of securities excluded will generally be updated as and when Substantial Security Holder Notices are received by the Exchange subject to the application of rule 4. In the case of pro-rata cash or bonus issues, it would be assumed, until advice was received otherwise, that the substantial security holders received or accepted their pro rata entitlement, and the number of excluded shares would be increased accordingly on the ex date. If the change in the amount of stock excluded represents 5% or more of the quoted capital of the company, the market would be advised of the impending change at least two weeks in advance. 19.In the event of a merger or takeover in respect of 100% of a constituent company’s issued securities, such constituent company’s securities will be removed from the Index five Business Days after the date the Offeror becomes entitled and announces that it will proceed with compulsory acquisition. Where a takeover offer proceeds at less than 100% acceptance, the constituent company’s securities will continue to be included in the Index unless there is a failure to satisfy the Index rules. In such cases the constituent company’s securities will be removed from the Index five Business Days after the Index Committee determines that such failure to satisfy the Index rules is not likely to be rectified in the near future. 20.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing rules, the New Zealand Stock Exchange reserves the right to, at any time, include any stock in the base of either index and attribute to it such weight as it may in its sole discretion determine. Trust Deed and Prospectus Date of Adjustments 11.The Fund re-balances in the following circumstances: (i)monthly, when the NZSE adjusts the weighting of Index Companies to allow for cancellation/ allotment of shares on issue of the Index Companies; (ii)quarterly, when the NZSE reviews the Index Companies in the Index; and (iii) when the NZSE makes any other announcement that affects the NZSE30 Index. 12.Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within one business day. Rights Issues 13.The Index may be adjusted from time to time because of rights issues. 14.In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will only take up the rights if the rights are to be included in the Index. If the rights are not included in the Index, the Manager will sell the rights and reinvest in the Index at the earliest possible time. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 15.The Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers or share buy- backs. 16.With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index Company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to the NZSE Listing Rules or the Takeover Code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at the time the Index is adjusted and not participate in the event in any other way. 17.The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. Cash investments held by the Fund 18.Although it is not an objective of the Fund to invest in cash securities, the Fund may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and •To fund expenses, and any fee and taxation obligations of the Fund. 19.Cash is held in on-call deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989. Borrowing 20.The Fund may only borrow in the following circumstances: •To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; •To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary or Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 44 •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 21.The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Issues and redemptions of Units 22.Investors wishing to subscribe for units may do so for cash or, alternatively, above a certain prescribed level, investors may subscribe for units by transferring to Tortis-NZ an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-NZ in exchange. 23.When a unitholder wishes to dispose of an investment in the Fund, the unitholder is able to elect that the units be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager. Notwithstanding any provision in the Prospectus or the Deed of Trust, it is the invariable practice of the Fund that where such an election is made by the unitholder, the units will be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager, in strict accordance with that election. In the absence of an election by the unitholder, the units will in all instances be repurchased by the Manager. Where units are repurchased by the Manager, the price paid to the unitholder by the Manager will be the same amount as would be received by the unitholder if the unitholder had elected the direct redemption method. In all instances where units are repurchased by the Manager, whether pursuant to an election by a unitholder or not, the Manager will redeem those units with the Trustee for the same price as paid to the unitholder. 24.A unitholder may redeem units subject to the conditions in Article C of the Trust Deed. Article C gives the Manager a discretion to refuse to redeem units where the amount to be redeemed is less than the minimum number acceptable by the Manager at that time. Currently the Manager has set a minimum withdrawal at $500. Same day unit redemption policy 25.On being repurchased the Manager is required to pay the aggregate value of the units to the investor within 21 business days of the relevant time (as described in the Trust Deed). However when possible the Fund operates a same day unit redemption policy. The Fund will endeavor to redeem the units requested by any unitholder and redeem and pay for those units on the same day as the unitholder’s request is made. 26.If the Fund has insufficient cash in the cash pool, the Fund will always in the first instance attempt to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds in order to meet the redemption request. In situations where the Fund is not able to borrow such sufficient funds, the Fund may suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund. The only exception to the Fund always attempting to borrow in the first instance where a redemption request is made and there is insufficient cash in the cash pool, is where a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders. In such a case the Fund will always suspend the withdrawal of units. Suspension of issuing and redeeming units 27.The Fund has not previously suspended the issuing or redeeming of units. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; or (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Company securities from the NZSE; or Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 45 (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests. If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a)The predetermined rules used by the Manager and the NZSE to ascertain the Index constituents (set out above) will not be made with or influenced by any intention of seeking higher rates of return or capital growth. (b)No material changes will be made to the way in which the Fund will track the Index. (c)No material changes will be made to the way in which the NZSE constructs the Index. (d)The Fund will re-balance in the following circumstances: (i)monthly, when the NZSE adjusts the weighting of Index Companies to allow for cancellation/allotment of shares on issue of the Index Companies; (ii)quarterly, when the NZSE reviews the Index Companies in the Index; (iii)when the NZSE make any other announcement that affects the NZSE30 Index; and (iv) If any security or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than 0.2%. Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within one business day. (e)When rebalancing the Fund the Manager will use its best endeavours to track the Index as exactly as possible. Any re-balancing of the Fund that does not achieve an exact match of the Index will only occur where it is not possible to obtain or sell the securities necessary to exactly replicate the Index. In any case the tracking deviation will not exceed 0.2% of the value of the Fund. (f)In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company of the Index, the Fund Manager will only take up the rights if the rights are to be included in the Index. If the rights are not included in the Index, the Fund Manager will sell the rights and reinvest in the Index at the earliest possible time. (g)With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index Company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to the NZSE Listing Rules or the Takeover Code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at the time the Index is adjusted and not participate in the event in any other way. (h)The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. (i)When the Fund is given the option of re- investing its dividends into any Index Company, the Fund invariably accepts the cash dividend. (j)The cash pool is held in on-call deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and •To fund any expenses, and fee or taxation obligations of the Fund. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed 5% of the total assets of the Fund. (k)Condition (j) shall not be considered breached if the 5% limit is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: •For up to one business day if there is rapid inflow to the Fund, or the Fund has notice of a substantial pending withdrawal ; •For up to one calendar month if the Manager receives a formal notice of a forthcoming obligation of subsequent performance (ie, payment due on partly paid shares) affecting the constituent securities in the index; or •For up to one calendar month if the Manager is aware of a forthcoming distribution to unitholders at the scheduled date of distribution. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 46 In any event when the 5% limit in exceeded for any of the reasons above, the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time. (l)The Fund can borrow only in the following circumstances: •To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event the borrowing will be repaid within three business days; •Where the Fund is required to fund purchases of shares due to changes in the Index Companies in the Index where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible; •When, due to a merger situation affecting the composition of the Index, payment due to the Fund is delayed (such delay is beyond the control of the Fund) creating a situation where the Fund will need to rebalance the Index; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible; or •For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. (m)The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; •If there is a change in the Index composition so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking; •Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; •Transferring securities to a unitholder if the unitholder redeems units for securities; •If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. (n)This Ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i)there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii)if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). (o)This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. (p)Apart from the Trust Deed and the Prospectus of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this Ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: (a) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or (b) the entry into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal; and/or (c) the appointment by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or (d) any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Fund, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Fund, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 47 (q)The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of Index Company shares. (r)If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. (s)The Fund will not be involved in any securities lending. (t)A suspension from issuing or redeeming units may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; or (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Company securities from the NZSE; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; or (4) where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unitholder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unitholders; or If a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. (u)The Manager will not redeem units as a means of correcting tracking errors. (v)The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.7 of the Trust Deed to promote or carry on any scheme or undertaking in any country upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee deems fit. (w)The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.10 of the Trust Deed to agree to enter into and perform any contract option or other right relating to any investment including any derivative. (x)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders when unitholders wish to redeem their units. The Manager will always use this power when the unitholder specifically requests that the Manager purchase the units and in any instance where the unitholder does not specifically request that the Trustee redeem the units. The Manager will not purchase units from any unitholder, where to do so would be inconsistent with the unitholder’s election to redeem their units with the Trustee. The Manager will not use this power to enhance the profit of the Fund. (y)There is no arrangement between the Trustee and any unitholders to effect the redemption of units in substitution for dividends. (z)Any cancellation of units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). (aa)The Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. (bb)The Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). (cc)All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to investors net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. (dd)In relation to amounts paid as consideration for a cancellation upon liquidation, the recipient will not be a person that is related to Tortis-NZ within the meaning of section CF 3(12). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows: •Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). •Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 48 •If the Fund is liquidated, section CF 3 (1)(c) will apply. The amount distributed to unit holders will not be a dividend to the extent that it does not exceed the aggregate of the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and the “excess return amount”, as those terms apply to the Fund. The excess return amount will include gains on any securities sold by the Fund. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2001 until 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8 th day of August 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 49 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/17 3.The Fund invests in securities of those companies that make up the NZSE30 Capital Share Price Index (“the Index”). The Index provides a measure of price trends of New Zealand’s top thirty listed companies and was chosen for its ability to best reflect the shares that are able to be purchased by members of the public on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”). 4.The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit confers an undivided part or share in the beneficial interest of the Fund. Income of the Fund is distributed to unitholders twice a year. 5.The Fund has both “category A units” and “category B units”. Category B units are those units which are acquired with funds from “designated sources” as defined in section HE 2(3). As the majority of the investments in the Fund are not from “designated sources”, most of the units in the Fund are category A units. All of the units in the Fund are subject to the same rules regarding income distribution and redemption of units. 6.The Trustee receives subscriptions from each investor, with a minimum value of $1000, with further investments being in multiples of $100. The Trustee also receives redemption requests, of a minimum number of 100 units per investor. On a valuation day subscriptions and redemptions of units are netted off. The Trustee will then purchase securities and issue new units, if the subscriptions exceed the redemptions, or sell securities and cancel units, if the redemptions exceed the subscriptions. The valuation day is defined in clause 1 of the Trust Deed as the close of business on Thursday of each week, or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day. 7.The Fund Manager may also purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem their units. The Fund Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool, and is unable to sell sufficient securities in order to redeem the units requested. To date, the Fund Manager has not utilised this power. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee for the NZGT 30 Fund (“the Fund”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •Section CF 2(3); •Section CF 2(3A); •Subpart LE; •Section CF 3(1)(b); •Section HH 3; •Section GB 1(3); and •Section BG 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the Fund, pursuant to the Deed of Trust dated 5 September 1996 and Deed of Amendment dated 15 September 2000, which acts as a specialist investment fund to hold a portfolio of shares and other securities that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE 30 Capital Share Price Index (“the Index”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Trustee and Manager of the Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited (“the Trustee” and “the Fund Manager”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The Fund has been established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967 and meets the definition of “group investment fund” contained in section OB 1. 2.The Investment Manager of the Fund is New Zealand Guardian Trust Funds Management Limited (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager was appointed to invest and manage various funds, including the NZGT 30 Fund, by an Investment Management Agreement dated 16 August 2000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 50 8.Clause 6.9 of the Trust Deed enables the Fund to suspend unit redemptions. The power to suspend unit redemptions is used in exceptional circumstances, being: •where a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure; or •if there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets namely, closure of the NZSE or a collapse of the market resulting in a lack of liquidity in the Fund’s securities. Where it is necessary to suspend redemption of units, the suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstances giving rise to the need to suspend are beyond the control of the Trustee and the Investment Manager, in which case the suspension shall only be for such a period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and or the Investment Manager to recover from the event. 9.This Ruling does not apply where the disposal of units by any particular unitholder is assessable under sections CD 3 or CD 4. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)All units redeemed by the Fund will be redeemed in whole and not in part. b)The units are not non-participating redeemable shares as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). c) Any redemption of units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). d)The units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e)The units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). f)All distributions received by the Fund will be paid out to unitholders net of any expenses incurred by the Fund. g)The Fund Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem their units. The Fund Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool, and is unable to sell sufficient securities in order to redeem the units requested. h)There is no agreement, arrangement, or understanding between the Fund, the Trustee, the Fund Manager, or the Investment Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. i)The Fund is a qualifying trust as that term is defined in section OB 1. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The distribution of category A income to category A unitholders will be treated as a “dividend” pursuant to section CF 2(3). •In respect of payments made to category A unitholders, section CF 2(3A) will treat the Fund as if it were a company for the purposes of subpart LE of the Act. •The amount paid to category A unitholders on the redemption of their units will be excluded from the definition of dividend by section CF 3(1)(b) to the extent that the amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. •Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the sale of category A units to the Fund Manager by category A unitholders. •In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category A unitholder, any gain on the sale of the category A units to the Fund Manager does not of itself give rise to the application of section BG 1. •Any distribution of category B income to category B unitholders is included within the definition of “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1, and is included in the assessable income of the unitholder under section HH 3(1).

The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28 th day of June 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 52 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/18 WiNZ Fund enable the ASB World Trust to obtain the same financial results through one investment as would be achieved by direct investment in the securities which make up the MSCI World Index (the “Index”) tracked by the AMP WiNZ Fund. 4.ASB selected the AMP WiNZ Fund for its underlying investment for the following reasons: •The corporate strength and stability of AMP Limited (“AMP”), and the strong likelihood that AMP would be able to support an index-tracking fund well into the foreseeable future; •AMP’s technical expertise, particularly the investment management skill and capability of AMP Investments Limited in being able to construct and efficiently manage an index-tracking fund; •The high standard of service provided by AMP eg, regular statements and reporting on the AMP WiNZ Fund; good working relationship; and •AMP’s competitive investment management fees resulting in a lower cost to ASB World Trust Fund investors in having their funds invested in the AMP WiNZ Fund through the ASB World Trust. 5.Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the ASB World Trust’s Establishment Deed state the “investment objectives” of the ASB World Trust and identify the “authorised investments” as follows: 3Investment Policy 3.1Objectives: The objectives of the Trust are to: (a) invest in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund subject to the need for the Trust to hold some cash for liquidity and administrative purposes; and (b) provide after tax foreign currency hedges in respect of 50% of the foreign currency securities indirectly invested in through the Trust’s investment in the AMP Investment’s World Index Fund. The funds of the Trust that are available for investment shall be invested in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund or in foreign currency contracts as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The Trust and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling AMP Investments’ World Fund units. 3.2Authorised Investments: For the purposes of this Trust “Authorised This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ASB World Shares Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 2(1)(i), CF 3(1)(b) and GB 1(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the ASB World Shares Trust (the “ASB World Trust” or the “Trust” or the “Fund”) pursuant to a master deed dated 17 October 1997 (the “Master Deed”), an establishment deed also dated 17 October 1997 (the “Establishment Deed”), a “Variation of Master Deed Dated 17 October 1997” (executed on 27 April 1999) and a Deed of Amendment to ASB World Shares Trust Establishment Deed (dated 18 June 2001). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The ASB World Trust is a unit trust pursuant to the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and is a “unit trust” for the purposes of the definition of that term in section OB 1. 2.The trustee of the ASB World Trust is the Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited (the “Trustee”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The manager of the Trust is ASB Investments Limited (formerly ASB Investment Services Limited) (the “Manager”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASB Bank Limited. The beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Trust, but units do not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Trust. Investment 3.The ASB World Trust acts as a special purpose vehicle, which holds units in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund (the “AMP WiNZ Fund”). Ownership of units in the AMP Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 53 Investments” means: (a) the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund; (b) cash balances with banks, brokers, agents, funds, including, without limitation, the ASB Money Market Trust, or custodians held for the liquidity and administrative purposes of the Trust referred to at Clause 3.1; and (c) foreign exchange contracts for the foreign currencies of the securities making up the AMP World Index entered into to provide the hedges referred to in clause 3.1 6.Pursuant to the Establishment Deed, the ASB World Trust is only authorised to invest contributions from Members in: (a) the AMP WiNZ Fund, (b) a fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge and (c) cash investments. The Fund may hold cash investments to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash investments are held as cash in the ASB Bank Call Account. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of AMP WiNZ Fund units to meet a request to redeem units in cash; •To make income distributions to unitholders; •To meet obligations under the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge; and •To met administration expenses of the Fund. 7.It is the intention of the ASB World Trust that investment in AMP WiNZ Fund units (including the appropriate level of hedge, or distribution of excess cash, whichever is intended) will be completed as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The funds received from unitholders are invested on a weekly basis. Funds passed to the Manager are invested in the underlying pool within 24 hours. 8.The currencies to be hedged are the US dollar, Japanese yen, Euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. The weighting of these currencies in the hedge will be determined exactly, based on the Trust’s underlying exposure, on each rollover date, based on the latest country weightings (included in the Index) which are made available by AMP Investments Limited. 9.The ASB World Trust is required to place an order for a 74.6% hedge (or an equivalent residual figure should the applicable income tax rate change from 33%) and accept the closest to this figure that is obtainable within the set limits. Further, realignment of the hedge level will occur monthly at the rollover of forward contracts to a new forward date. All hedge contracts will mature on or about the fifteenth business day of the month following entry. The level of the hedge is to be maintained at between 71.6% and 77.6% of the non-New Zealand dollar amount invested offshore. This variance is required to take account of redemptions and subscriptions arising during a month. It is also required to take account of the fact that foreign currency hedges can generally only be obtained in round amounts. Where the hedge moves outside the plus or minus 3% (pre-tax) band the hedge will be adjusted back to 74.6%, on the day that this occurs, based on the country weightings made available by AMP Investments Limited on the last roll-over date. 10.Under clause 11.3(h) of schedule 1 to the Master Deed the unitholders can sanction any variation of the “authorised investments” of the Trust by extraordinary resolution. However, the Fund intends to maintain its current investment strategy. AMP WiNZ Fund 11.The AMP WiNZ Fund is a “group investment fund” within the meaning of section OB 1. The AMP WiNZ Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to track the Index. The AMP WiNZ Fund has two current binding rulings (BR Prv 01/31, regarding BD 1(1), CD 3, CD 4, and CD 5 and BR Prv 01/32, regarding OZ1 and CG 1) which state that such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The AMP WiNZ Fund is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. 12.The AMP WiNZ Fund will make taxable distributions to the Trust from any income received by the AMP WiNZ Fund semi- annually within 20 days from the end of June and December. 13.The Trust will generally distribute such part, as is determined by the Manager, of its net income 6-monthly to unitholders and that net income will be calculated taking into account all costs, charges and expenses due. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 54 14.The Establishment Deed also provides for special distributions to occur at other times determined by the Manager. However, in the period between receipt of income from the AMP WiNZ Fund and any distribution, the ASB World Trust is required to invest amounts not held for administrative or liquidity purposes in units in the AMP WiNZ Fund and maintain the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge. Suspensions 15.The Fund has not previously suspended redemptions. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God or a system failure; (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Redemption of ASB World Fund units 16.The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. To date, the Manager has not utilised this power. Redemption of AMP WiNZ Fund units 17.When the ASB World Trust is required to redeem units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, the ASB World Trust can sell its units to a third party, or it can redeem its units to the AMP WiNZ Fund. Upon redemption, the ASB World Trust will receive a parcel of securities equal to the value of the units at that time. The AMP WiNZ Fund manager may sell those securities on behalf of (as agent for) the ASB World Trust, and then give the ASB World Trust cash for those units. The ASB World Trust also has the option (as opposed to redeeming its units to the AMP WiNZ Fund) to sell its units through the AMP WiNZ Fund manager. 18.Redemption requests for AMP WiNZ Fund units must be for a minimum of 1,000,000 WiNZ units. When the ASB World Trust makes a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund, the AMP WiNZ Fund manager makes a choice as to how to effect that redemption request. The AMP WiNZ Fund manager may effect redemption by either: (1) cancellation of the units or (2) purchasing those units on its own behalf. In either situation, when the AMP WiNZ Fund manager effects a redemption request, the unitholder (ie, the ASB World Trust) will receive the same redemption amount for its AMP WiNZ Fund units. 19.Requests to dispose of parcels of less than 1,000,000 AMP WiNZ Fund units will be facilitated by the AMP WiNZ Fund manager in parcels of 100,000 AMP WiNZ Fund units. The ASB World Trust will only dispose of its AMP WiNZ Fund units by making a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund manager. The ASB World Trust will not dispose of AMP WiNZ Fund units in any other manner. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. b)The Trust will be a widely-held trust, as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). c)Any cancellation of ASB World Trust units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). d)The ASB World Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e)The ASB World Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). f)The income of the Fund, net of any expenses incurred by the Fund, will be paid out to unitholders either as cash or additional units in the Fund. However, the Manager may use its discretion, and decide not to make such a Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 55 payment if the amount to be paid is so minimal that the administrative costs of making the payment would exceed the amount to be distributed. The payment of income to unitholders on this basis is consistent with the Fund’s normal dividend policy and Trust Deed. Not necessarily paying out the full value of the WiNZ Fund units received as income reflects the Trustee’s normal prudence in only distributing the “profits” of the Fund and does not occur for tax purposes; g)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. h)Where unitholders elect to receive distributions as additional Fund units instead of cash, these constitute a “taxable bonus issue” as that term is defined in section OB 1. i)The AMP WiNZ Fund was chosen to provide a cost effective means for simulating an investment that matches the composition and weighting of the Index. The AMP WiNZ Fund was not selected in order to maximise returns. j)The Fund has not taken into account historical returns in deciding to maintain its current investment strategy. k)The investment objectives and authorised investments of the Trust will not be amended. l)The cash pool is held in cash deposits which are held on call in the ASB Bank Call Account. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: •Pending investment in AMP WiNZ Fund units; •To meet a withdrawal from the Trust; •To make income distributions to unitholders; •Pursuant to the fixed 50% after tax foreign currency hedge; and •To meet administration expenses of the Fund. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 4% of the total assets of the Fund. m)Condition (l) shall not be breached if the limit referred to in condition (l) is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: •Where a large cash subscription has been paid into the cash pool; or •Receipt of dividends from the AMP WiNZ Fund; or •From proceeds or settlement of maturing currency hedge contracts; and the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time, and in any event, no longer than 5 business days. n)The Fund may borrow temporarily in order to meet the following obligations where it is unable to meet such demands out of its current cash reserves: (1) to redeem units; (2) to meet hedging contract obligations. Any such borrowing will only be to the extent that is strictly necessary and in the case of borrowing to redeem units will not exceed 2% of the value of the Fund and in the case of borrowing to meet hedging obligations will not exceed 10% of the value of the Fund. All such borrowing will be repaid within five business days. o)The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of AMP WiNZ Fund units in the following circumstances: •To meet administration expenses of the Fund that cannot be met out of the cash pool; or •Where the Manager must purchase or redeem AMP WiNZ Fund units in order to meet the needs of the Fund’s unitholders; or •In order to wind up the Trust; or •To meet hedging contract obligations that cannot be met out of the cash pool. p)When the Fund is given the option of re- investing its dividends for additional units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, the Fund will always accept the reinvestment option. In any such case, the value of the units received is equivalent to the value of the cash dividend, (net of tax, fees and expenses). q)This ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i)there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 56 (ii)if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). r)This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. s)Apart from the Trust Deed and/or Prospectus and/or any Rules of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time and/or (ii) the entry into of agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal, will not alone constitute an agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the preceding sentence applies. t)The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of AMP WiNZ Fund units. u)If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. v)A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure; or (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. w)The distribution period of the Fund will only be altered for administrative reasons and shall not be altered to enhance the performance of the Fund in any way. x)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. y)There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the AMP WiNZ Fund or its trustee or its manager and the ASB World Trust (or any person associated with the ASB World Trust) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of the ASB World Trust’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the AMP WiNZ Fund. z)The Trust will only dispose of its AMP WiNZ Fund units by making a redemption request to the AMP WiNZ Fund manager or by selling to a third party. The Fund will only sell to a third party in the exceptional circumstance where the request to the AMP WiNZ Fund Manager cannot be actioned within 7 business days. aa)Any powers exercised by the Trustee under the Master Deed and Establishment Deed are for the purposes of either buying units in the AMP WiNZ Fund, matched by a 50% after tax hedge, to reflect the level of funds invested in the Trust, or selling units in the AMP WINZ Fund to fund redemption of units in the Trust, or in order to meet its payment obligations under the hedging arrangement or to meet administration expenses of the Fund. bb)The existing binding rulings for the AMP WiNZ Fund (BR Prv 01/31 and BR Prv 01/32) or any such replacement ruling or rulings in respect of the same taxation laws remain current and in force. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 57 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). •Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. •Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2001 until 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2 nd day of July 2001.

Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ASB New Zealand Shares Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 2(1)(i), CF 3(1)(b) and GB 1(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the ASB NZ Shares Trust (the “ASB NZ Trust” or the “Trust” or the “Fund”) pursuant to the Master Deed (which is dated 17 October 1997) (the “Master Deed”), the Establishment Deed (which is also dated 17 October 1997) (the “Establishment Deed”), a “Variation of Master Unit Trust Deed Dated 17 October 1997” (dated 27 April 1999) and a Deed of Amendment to ASB NZ Shares Trust Establishment Deed (dated 18 June 2001). Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The ASB NZ Trust is a unit trust pursuant to the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and is a “unit trust” for the purposes of the definition of that term in section OB 1. 2.The trustee of the ASB NZ Trust is The Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited (the “Trustee”). It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The manager of the Trust is ASB Investments Limited (formerly ASB Investment Services Limited) (the “Manager”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASB Bank Limited. The beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Trust, but units do not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Trust.

The Fund may hold cash investments to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash investments are held as cash in the ASB Bank Call Account. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the sale of AMP Tracker Fund units to meet a request to redeem Trust units in cash; •To make income distributions to unitholders; and •To meet administration expenses of the Fund. 7.It is the intention of the ASB NZ Trust that investment in AMP Tracker Fund units, including the appropriate distribution of excess cash, will be completed as soon as practicable after receipt by the Trustee. The funds received from unitholders are invested on a weekly basis. Funds passed to the Manager are invested in the underlying pool within 24 hours. 8.Under clause 11.3(h) of schedule 1 to the Master Deed the unitholders can sanction any variation of the “authorised investments” of the Trust by extraordinary resolution. However, the Fund intends to maintain its current investment strategy. AMP Tracker Fund 9.The AMP Tracker Fund is a “group investment fund” within the meaning of section OB 1. The AMP Tracker Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to track the Index. The AMP Tracker Fund has two current binding rulings (BR Prv 96/157, regarding CD 3, CD 4, and CE 1(1) and BR Prv 97/114, regarding CD 5) which state that such buying and selling is not motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. 10.The AMP Tracker Fund makes taxable distributions to the ASB NZ Trust. The taxable distributions from the AMP Tracker Fund to the ASB NZ Trust are from any dividends received by the AMP Tracker Fund, according to the Prospectus, either on receipt or quarterly, depending on the size of the ASB NZ Trust’s investment. However, in practice, the dividends are received on a monthly basis. 11.The ASB NZ Trust will generally distribute to its unitholders part of the distributions it receives from the AMP Tracker Fund six- monthly. To determine the amount of the distribution, the Manager of the ASB NZ Trust will determine the Trust’s “net income” by taking into account, not only the distributions received by the AMP Tracker Fund, but also all costs, charges and expenses due by or to the ASB NZ Trust. 12.The Establishment Deed also provides for special distributions to occur at other times determined by the Manager. However, in the period between receipt of income from the AMP Tracker Fund and any distribution the ASB NZ Trust is required to invest amounts not held for administrative or liquidity purposes in units in the AMP Tracker Fund. 13.The AMP Tracker Fund units will be issued subject to the reverse ordering rule (subparagraph CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B)) and may only be redeemed in whole, and not in part. Units in the AMP Tracker Fund are not quoted on any exchange. Suspensions 14.The Fund has not previously suspended redemptions. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs, namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God or a system failure; or (2) if there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets, namely, the failure of pricemaking software. (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Redemption of ASB NZ Trust Units 15.The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. To date, the Manager has not utilised this power. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 60 Redemption of AMP Tracker Fund Units 16.When the ASB NZ Trust is required to redeem units in the AMP Tracker Fund, the parcel of securities held by the AMP Tracker Fund attributable to the ASB NZ Trust’s investment can be returned to the ASB NZ Trust. Alternatively, the redemption parcel of securities can be delivered to the AMP Tracker Fund manager as agent for the unitholder (ie, the ASB NZ Trust). In this alternative situation, the AMP Tracker Fund manager will sell the basket of securities comprising the redemption parcel as agent for the ASB NZ Trust, and the AMP Tracker Fund manager will pay the proceeds to the ASB NZ Trust (or in certain circumstances, the AMP Tracker Fund manager will hold the securities and transfer to the ASB NZ Trust the equivalent dollar value of the redeemed securities). 17.The ASB NZ Trust always requests the AMP Tracker Fund manager to redeem the basket of securities for cash, instead of receiving the basket of securities. Therefore, the ASB NZ Trust, upon redemption of units in the AMP Tracker Fund, will receive a transfer of securities followed by an immediate sale of those securities by the AMP Tracker Fund manager as agent for the ASB NZ Trust. 18.Although the AMP Tracker Fund’s prospectus refers to a threshold of 100,000 units being the minimum redemption amount (in order to redeem the units to the AMP Tracker Fund), ASB Bank have agreed with the AMP Tracker Fund manager that the treatment of redemptions for parcels of 100,000 units or greater will also apply to parcels of 50,000 or greater in respect of redemptions for the ASB NZ Trust. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager and any unitholder (or any person associated with any unitholder) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of a unitholder’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the Fund. b)The Trust will be a widely-held trust, as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). c)Any cancellation of ASB NZ Trust units will not be part of a pro-rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). d)The ASB NZ Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any recognised exchange as that term is defined in section OB 1. e)The ASB NZ Trust units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). f)The income of the Fund, net of any expenses incurred by the Fund, will be paid out to unitholders either as cash or additional units in the Fund. However, the Manager may use its discretion, and decide not to make such a payment if the amount to be paid is so minimal that the administrative costs of making the payment would exceed the amount to be distributed. The payment of income to unitholders on this basis is consistent with the Fund’s normal dividend policy and Trust Deed. Not necessarily paying out the full value of the Tracker Fund units received as income reflects the Trustee’s normal prudence in only distributing the “profits” of the Fund and does not occur for tax purposes; g)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. h)Where unitholders elect to receive distributions as additional Fund units instead of cash, these constitute a “taxable bonus issue” as that term is defined in section OB 1. i)The AMP Tracker Fund was chosen to provide a cost effective means for simulating an investment that matches the composition and weighting of the Index. The AMP Tracker Fund was not selected in order to maximise returns. j)The Fund has not taken into account historical returns in deciding to maintain its current investment strategy. k)The investment objectives and authorised investments of the Trust will not be amended. l)The cash pool is held in cash deposits which are held on call in the ASB Bank Call Account. The holding of such cash will arise only from the following circumstances: •To meet the administration expenses of the Fund; •Pending investment in AMP Tracker Fund units; Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 61 •To meet a withdrawal from the Trust; or •To make income distributions to unitholders. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 4% of the total assets of the Fund. m)Condition (l) shall not be breached if the limit referred to in condition (l) is exceeded when this occurs due to the following reasons: •Where a large cash subscription has been paid into the cash pool; or •Receipt of dividends from the AMP Tracker Fund, and the Fund takes immediate action to remedy this within the shortest practicable time, and in any event, no longer than five business days. n)In the event that the Fund has insufficient cash available to meet redemptions, the Fund may temporarily borrow in order to redeem units. Any borrowing that occurs will be: (i) only to the extent that is strictly necessary and will not in any event exceed 2% of the value of the Fund; and (ii) repaid as soon as possible and in any event within five business days. o)The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of AMP Tracker Fund units in the following circumstances: •To meet the administration expenses of the Fund; •The Manager must purchase or redeem AMP Tracker Fund units in order to meet the needs of the Fund’s unitholders; or •In order to wind up the Trust. p)When the Fund is given the option of re- investing its dividends for additional units in the AMP Tracker Fund, the Fund will always accept the reinvestment option. In any such case, the value of the units received is equivalent to the value of the cash dividend (net of tax, fees and expenses) and the distribution of cash or units constitutes a “dividend” as that term is defined in section CF 2. q)This ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: (i)there is a unitholder, or two or more unitholders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and (ii)if that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unitholder, or one or more of such unitholders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unitholders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). r)This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section CF 3(14)), and the Fund units are offered to the public. s)Apart from the Trust Deed and/or Prospectus and/or any Rules of the Fund that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unitholder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unitholder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the fact that a unitholder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time and/or (ii) the entry into of agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal, will not alone constitute an agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the preceding sentence applies. t)The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of AMP Tracker Fund units. u)If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. v)A suspension from issuing or redeeming units will only occur in exceptional circumstances, being: (1) If a material adverse change in the financial markets occurs namely, a breakdown in liquidity caused by an act of God, or a system failure; (2) If there is a fundamental breakdown in the functioning of financial markets namely, the failure of pricemaking software; or (3) If it is required so as to avoid a breach of any applicable law. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 62 Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of 3 business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. w)The distribution period of the Fund will only be altered for administrative reasons and shall not be altered to enhance the performance of the Fund in any way. x)The Manager has the power to purchase units from unitholders, when unitholders wish to redeem or sell their units. The Manager may use this power only when the Fund does not have enough funds in the cash pool to redeem the units requested and the Fund is unable to borrow to meet the unitholders’ requests. y)The AMP Tracker Fund is an “unlisted trust” in terms of the definition of that term in section CF 3(14). z)Cancellation of AMP Tracker Fund units will not be made as part of a pro rata cancellation of units. aa)AMP Tracker Fund units will not be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. bb)The AMP Tracker Fund units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the reverse ordering rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(B). cc)There is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the AMP Tracker Fund or its trustee or its manager and the ASB NZ Trust (or any person associated with the ASB NZ Trust) which directly or indirectly has a purpose or effect of the redemption or disposition of any of the ASB NZ Trust’s units occurring in substitution for or instead of one or more distributions from the AMP Tracker Fund. dd)The Trust will either: (1) redeem its AMP Tracker Fund units to the AMP Tracker Fund or (2) sell its units to the AMP Tracker Fund manager. The Trust will not dispose of its units in any other manner. ee)All distributions received by the AMP Tracker Fund will be paid out, (either as cash or AMP Tracker Fund units) to investors in the AMP Tracker Fund net of any expenses incurred by the AMP Tracker Fund. ff)Any powers exercised by the Trustee under the Master Deed and Establishment Deed are for the purposes of either buying units in the AMP Tracker Fund to reflect the level of funds invested in the Trust or, selling or redeeming units in the AMP Tracker Fund to fund redemptions of units in the Trust. gg)The existing binding rulings for the AMP Tracker Fund (BR Prv 96/157 and BR Prv 97/114) or any such replacement ruling or rulings in respect of the same taxation laws remain current and in force. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CF 2(1)(i). •Any amount received by unitholders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. •Section GB 1(3) does not apply to the arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2001 until 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2 nd day of July 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 63 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/22 5.Clause 4.5.7 of the Settlement Deed indicates that TOKM holds the assets for the benefit of Maori. It states: All parties acknowledge the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission receives and holds the settlement benefits on behalf of Maori and for their benefit. 6.Clause 4.5.1 of the Settlement Deed, in combination with clause 4.5.7 above also indicates that TOKM is holding the settlement benefits ultimately for the benefit of all Maori. Clause 4.5.1 states: Maori agrees that the settlement evidenced by this Settlement Deed of all the commercial fishing rights and interests of Maori is ultimately for the benefit of all Maori. 7.“Pre-settlement assets” are the assets vested in TOKM pursuant to the Maori Fisheries Act 1989 when originally enacted and up until the time of settlement on 6 January 1993 (“settlement date”) and the acquisition of Sealord Products Limited. “Post settlement assets” are assets vested post settlement date and pursuant to the Settlement Deed. Clauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.6 of the Settlement Deed indicate that the pre-settlement assets are considered part of the settlement under the Settlement Deed and thus both the pre and post settlement assets can be viewed as vested in TOKM for the settlement of historical grievances. 8.Clause 4.5.2 of the Settlement Deed states in relation to pre-settlement assets that: The Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission is to consider how best to give effect to the resolutions taken at the annual general meeting of the Maori Fisheries Commission in July 1992 and will be empowered to allocate assets held by the Maori Fisheries Commission at the day before the Settlement Date. 9.The authority to allocate pre-settlement assets is contained in section 6(e)(i) of the Maori Fisheries Act 1989. Section 6(e)(iv) of the Maori Fisheries Act requires a report to be prepared for the Minister of Fisheries setting out the allocation process. 10.In relation to post-settlement assets clauses 4.5.3 and 4.5.4.2 of the Settlement Deed require TOKM to develop procedures for identifying beneficiaries and distributing settlement benefits. In particular clause 4.5.4.2 provides: \[a\] procedure for identification of beneficiaries and their interests in accordance with the Treaty of Waitangi and a procedure for allocation of benefits of this Settlement Deed to them in accordance with the This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission/Te Ohu Kai Moana (“TOKM”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3 and CD 5. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the distribution by TOKM of its assets to Maori as full and final settlement to compensate for historical grievances of Maori in relation to commercial fishing pursuant to the Deed of Settlement between the Crown and Maori dated 23 September 1992. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.TOKM is a statutory body established by the Maori Fisheries Act 1989, as amended by the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992. TOKM’s functions are set out in section 5 and section 6 of The Maori Fisheries Act 1989. 2.The Crown vested significant assets in TOKM (in the form of cash and fishing quota) in settlement of all claims by Maori in respect of commercial fishing. This settlement was carried out pursuant to the Maori Fisheries Act 1989, the Deed of Settlement dated 23 September 1992 (“the Settlement Deed”) and the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992 (“the Settlement Act”). 3.Paragraph M of the preamble to the Settlement Deed indicates that the settlement was made to settle past wrongs or grievances. It states: The Crown and Maori wish to express their mutual and solemn acknowledgment that the settlement evidenced by this Settlement Deed marks the resolution of an historical grievance. 4.Section 9 of the Settlement Act declares that the effect of the settlement is to settle all claims by Maori in respect of commercial fishing. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 64 principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Such proposals for distribution of settlement benefits will address the questions set out in Annexure A and will include a procedure for Maori affected, to be heard on benefit issues. Annexure A outlines the issues which need to be considered in determining the method of allocation of benefits from post settlement assets. These issues include: •What will be distributed •Who will manage the distribution system •Who will receive the settlement benefits •How will different levels of interest be identified and accommodated •How will disputes be resolved. This is consistent with the provision of the Maori Fisheries Act dealing with the allocation of post-settlement asset benefits. In particular section 6(e)(ii)(A)-(B) provides for the development of a method of allocation of the benefits from the deed of settlement. 11.TOKM acquired quota and cash from the Crown. It leased the quota and used the proceeds to acquire further assets such as quota and shares. TOKM also used the cash received from the Crown to acquire assets such as quota and shares. Further acquisitions of quota and shares by TOKM may also occur which will be funded from TOKM earnings on its assets, or proceeds from asset realisations. However, any transactions which involve TOKM transferring (whether by way of sale or other dispositions) any asset to any company in return for shares in that company, will not constitute a distribution that is subject to this Ruling. Therefore, when TOKM distributes its assets, Maori will receive a mixture of some or all of: •Fishing quota, •Shares in companies, •Cash. 12.The amounts distributed to Maori will therefore comprise of assets received from the Crown by TOKM, assets subsequently acquired by TOKM (using either cash received from the Crown, earnings from assets, or proceeds from asset sales), and the accumulated income derived by TOKM from the assets. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumption: •The distributions under this Arrangement will be made by TOKM in the course of its termination pursuant to section HI 1(2). Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)TOKM is a “Maori authority” as defined in section OB 1. b)The settlement between the Crown and Maori pursuant to the Settlement Deed dated 23 September 1992 has no direct and identifiable connection with lost profits to Maori. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The distribution by TOKM to Maori made under this Arrangement will not constitute amounts derived from any business of Maori under section CD 3. •The distribution by TOKM to Maori made under this Arrangement will not constitute gross income under ordinary concepts to Maori under section CD 5. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the date this Ruling is signed until the 16 th day of July 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 16 th day of July 2001.

All New Zealand investors will invest directly into the Funds either personally or through a nominee. Wrap account and master trust services referred to in the prospectus represent separate entities in Australia and will not be used in New Zealand. Class B units differ from Class A units in regard to the Responsible Entity’s fees and charges, repurchase policy and distribution policy. In all other respects the classes of units are equivalent. 4.Applications for the allotment of units are to be made to the Manager: Clause 19.1 of the Constitution. The application form for the allotment of units provides that the signature of the investor confirms acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in the investment statement relating to the particular investment. 5.The Investment Statement says that the operation of the Fund is governed by its Constitution, the Corporations Law and the general law of Australia. The Constitution sets out the conditions under which the Fund operates, the rights and obligations of the unitholders and the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Manager. 6.The Manager may accept or refuse any application for units in total or in part and is not required to give any reason for the refusal of an application: Clauses 19.3 and 19.4.

Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Assure New Zealand Ltd in respect of Assure Select Global Value Equities Portfolio. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •Section CF 2(1)(f) •Section CF 3(1)(a) •Section CF 8 •Section CG 1(b) •Sections CG 5(1) and (2) •Sections CG 15(1) and (2) •Section HE 1 The following definitions in section OB 1: •“bonus issue” •“bonus issue in lieu” •“company” •“foreign company” •“foreign entity” •“international tax rules” •“non-taxable bonus issue” •“taxable bonus issue” Section OE 2 The definitions of “FIF rules” and “international tax rules” in section OZ 1(1) Schedule 3 The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of Assure Select Global Value Equities Portfolio (“the Fund”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund is registered as a managed investment scheme under Chapter 5C of the Corporations Law of Australia. The Fund will be managed and controlled in Australia by Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 66 The Manager intends to apply the discretion given under the Constitution to ensure that: •No New Zealand resident will have a control interest in the Fund greater than 40 percent; and •There will not be a group of less than 5 or fewer New Zealand residents with a controlling interest in the Fund. 7.The Manager has discretion to invest the assets of the Fund in any Authorised Investment. Authorised Investments include: •shares, stocks, debentures, bonds, notes, convertible notes, or any unit or option over these; •derivative contracts (including swaps, futures, forward rate agreements and options and any form of agreement creating a contingent liability); •Unit Trust investments (being any units, rights to participate or interest in an undertaking, enterprise or scheme, whether unquoted or quoted on any stock or other securities exchange, including any interest in a managed investment scheme and any prescribed interest, which the Manager and the Fund is not prohibited by the Corporations Law from investing in); •Any deposit with or any negotiable instrument accepted endorsed or issued by, an Australian ADI, as defined in section 9 of the Corporations Law; •Deposits or loans to any financial institution other than Unit Trust Investments; •bills of exchange, promissory notes, commercial bills or other negotiable instruments issued by any financial institution; •the taking, granting, buying or selling of options in relation to any of the above; •any other investment determined by the Manager to be an authorised investment. 8.The Manager may appoint an investment manager for the Fund to act in relation to the investments of the Fund or any part of the Fund: clause 42.1(1). An investment manager has the powers in relation to the investments of the Fund determined by the manager, which may include the power to delegate all or any of the powers granted to the investment manager of the Manager: clause 42.1(2). Lazard Asset Management Pacific, whose headquarters are in New York, USA, has been appointed as the first investment manager of the Fund. 9.The Manager has discretion as to the investment policy of the Fund but the investment policy must be specified in the first prospectus of the Fund: clauses 29.1 and 29.2. The prospectus (which relates to both the Fund and the Assure Select Global Core Equities Portfolio) explains the difference in the investment policy of the two funds as follows: Assure initially established two Portfolios, Assure Select Global Core Equities Portfolio and Assure Select Global Value Equities Portfolio, in October 2000, and subsequently established Assure Select Global Active Equities Portfolio.... Assure Select is the umbrella name under which the Portfolios are being offered. A single investment manager is responsible for managing the investments of a Portfolio. Assure has appointed Putnam as the investment manager for the Global Core Equities Portfolio and Lazard as the investment manager for the Global Value Equities Portfolio. Putnam’s investment philosophy is based on the belief that all companies, no matter what they do or make, have an underlying long term business worth and that share prices fluctuate significantly around this long term worth. Lazard’s investment philosophy is based on bottom-up value stock selection. Lazard focuses on companies that are financially productive yet inexpensively priced. Assure has appointed National as the investment manager for the Global Active Equities Portfolio, with an investment mandate that requires National to invest the Portfolio wholly in funds managed by Capital. Capital’s investment philosophy is based on a bottom-up research approach to stock selection emphasising a company’s stock price relative to the underlying value and expected earnings growth of that company.... The currency hedging policy of the Fund is as follows: International equity investments may be partially hedged back to the Australian dollar. The hedging level will generally be set at 35% of the four major currencies: USD, GBP, Euro and Yen. Other currencies will generally not be hedged. The level of hedging can fluctuate around the central point to allow for asset and currency movements. Additionally, hedging may be used selectively for defensive purposes. Cross hedging is also permitted. After agreement with Lazard, hedging policy may be changed from time to time by Assure. 10.The Manager holds the assets of the Fund on trust for the members: clause 5.2 Constitution. The Manager must clearly identify the assets of the Fund as the property of the Fund and hold the assets separately from any other property held by the Manager: clause 5.3. However, the Manager may engage a custodian to hold the assets in accordance with the Australian Corporations Law: clause 5.4. The Manager has appointed State Street Australia Ltd (“State”) as the custodian to hold the assets of the Funds and to perform some administrative functions for the Funds. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 67 State was incorporated in Australia and carries on business in, Sydney, Australia. State has no offices in New Zealand. 11.The Manager has entered into a Custodian Agreement with State. Clause 3.13 of the Custodian Agreement permits State to appoint subcustodians to carry out any of the provisions of the Custodian Agreement. State’s duties under the Custodian Agreement are as follows: •State must segregate in its books for the account of the Manager all securities and other non cash property of each Fund, other than securities which are held in a securities system. •State is to release and deliver securities of a Fund held by State or its subcustodians only upon receipt of proper instructions. •State will pay interest on credit balances in cash accounts. •Upon receipt of proper instructions State or its subcustodians may enter into all types of contracts for foreign exchange on behalf of the Manager. •State or its subcustodians may make margin payments on derivatives contracts on behalf of the Manager. •State or its subcustodians may deliver money of the Manager to a third party to be held on deposit for the Manager pursuant to proper instructions. •State or its subcustodians are to use their commercially reasonable efforts to collect on a timely basis all income and other payments with respect to each Fund to which the Manager is entitled. Income that is collected is to be credited to the relevant accounts held for the Manager. •Upon receipt of proper instructions State is to pay out (or direct its subcustodians to pay out) moneys of the Fund for the purchase of securities, the conversion, exchange or surrender of securities of the Fund, the payment of expenses incurred by the Manager, the purchase or sale of foreign exchange or foreign exchange agreements, in connection with trading in derivatives contracts or securities borrowings by the Manager. State may also pay out money of the Fund for any other purpose upon receipt of proper instructions. Refer clauses 3.1, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. State also has general obligations in respect of recordkeeping, procurement of registration of securities, execution of documents required to perform its obligations under the Custodian Agreement. State must also segregate its settlement staff from its accounting staff. Refer clause 3.4. 12.The expression “proper instructions” is defined in the Custodian Agreement as follows: Proper Instructions means instructions (which may be standing instructions) received by the Custodian from the \[Manager\] (or a person duly authorised by the \[Manager\]), the Investment Manager, or any person duly authorised by either of them, in any of the following forms: (a)in writing signed or initialled by the authorised person (subject to the telephone verification callback procedures adopted by the Custodian and advised to the \[Manager\] from time to time); or (b)in a tested communication; or (c)in a communication utilising access codes effected between electro mechanical or elec- tronic devices; or (d)by such other means as may be agreed in writing from time to time by the Custodian and the party giving such instructions including without limitation oral instructions. 13.State may without express authority from the Manager or the Investment Manager: •Make payments to itself or others for minor expenses of handling securities or other similar items relating to its duties under the Custodian Agreement. •Surrender securities in temporary form for securities in definitive form; •Endorse for collection cheques, drafts and other negotiable instruments; and •Attend to all non-discretionary details in connection with the sale, exchange, substitution, purchase, transfer and other dealings with the securities and other assets of the Funds. See Clause 3.19. 14.State’s duties under the Administrative Services Agreement are to provide accountancy services, registry services and taxation services. 15.The beneficial interest in the fund is divided into units: Clause 6.1. A member is a person who is registered as the holder of a unit: definition of “member”, Clause 1.1(39). Unitholders do not have a right to any particular assets or any part of the assets of the Funds. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 68 Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the Constitution provide: 7.1General Entitlement to Assets Each Unit confers on the holder of that Unit an undivided interest in the Assets in the proportion that the Unit bears to the total number of Units on Issue at that time. 7.2No Entitlement to any part of Assets A unit does not entitle the holder of that Unit to any particular Asset comprised in the Assets or to any particular part of the Assets. 16.Clause 11.1 provides that a unit confers on the member the following: •The right to attend and vote at meetings of members; •The right for the member as at midnight on the last day of a Distribution Period to receive a share of the Distributable Income (if any) for the Distribution Period on a pro rata basis with all other such units; •The right to participate in the division of any surplus assets or profits of the fund on the winding up of the fund on a pro rata basis with all other units; and •Rights on redemption of the units. Members may not interfere with the rights or powers of the Manager in its dealings with the assets of the Fund and the Fund, nor do members have the right to exercise any rights, power or privileges in respect of any part of the assets or investments of the Fund: Clause 12.1. 17.The Manager is required to collect and receive all money, rights and property paid, receivable or arising from the assets of the Fund and must pay the liabilities of the Fund, including tax liabilities: clause 31. The Manager must determine the net taxable income of the Fund for each distribution period: clause 32.2. The distributable income of the Fund for a period is to be determined by applying the following formula which is set out in Clause 32.3 of the Constitution: DI=NTI + I-NCI+C-D Where: DI=the amount of Distributable Income N T I=the amount of Net Taxable Income I=so much of the amount by which Income exceeds the Net Taxable Income that the Manager has determined is to be distributed to Members NCI=Non-Cash Income C=the amount of capital the Manager has determined is to be distributed D=Accumulation Account 18.“Distribution period” is defined in Clause 1.1(25) as follows: (a)for the first Distribution Period, the period from the Commencement Date to the next Distribu- tion Calculation Date; (b)thereafter, the period beginning on the day after the preceding Distribution Calculation Date to the next Distribution Calculation Date until the last Distribution Calculation Date immediately preceding the Termination Date; and (c)for the last Distribution Period, the period from the last Distribution Calculation Date immedi- ately preceding the Termination Date until the Termination Date; The distribution calculation dates are 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December in each year “or any other date the Manager determines from time to time”: Clause 1.1(22). 19.Clause 32.4 provides that each member’s income entitlement in the Fund is to be determined by applying the following formula: IE=DI x UH NU Where: IE=the Income Entitlement of the Member DI=the amount of Distributable Income UH=the Unit Holding of the Member at the close of business on the Distribution Calculation Date NU=the number of Units on Issue at the close of business on the Distribution Calculation Date The distributable income of the Fund is the net taxable income of the Fund (calculated under the rules in the Australian Act or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) with adjustments for distributions of income for any period, non-cash income, capital amounts distributed and accumulation amounts. 20.Clause 32.5 provides: 32.5Distribution Accounts (1)The Manager may: (a) keep separate accounts of different categories or sources of income or capital, or deductions or credits for taxation purposes; and (b) allocate income, capital, deductions or credits from a particular category or source to particular Members. (2)Nothing in this clause 32 or any provision of this Constitution requires the Manager to establish any separate bank for: (a) any distribution to any Member or the Members; or (b) in respect of the accounts referred to in clause 32.5(1). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 69 21.The Manager must calculate and distribute each Member’s Income Entitlement: clause 32.6. Clauses 32.6, 32.7 and 33.1 provide: 32.6Determination Member’s Income Entitlement Subject to clause 34.1 and to the terms of any issue, for each Distribution Period, the Manager must calculate and distribute each Member’s Income Entitlement. 32.7Member’s Entitlement Vested and Present For each Accounting Period: (1)the Manager holds the Distributable Income which has not been distributed by the end of the Accounting Period for the Members; and (2)each Member will be presently entitled to Distributable Income of the Fund in proportion to the amounts which are distributed pursuant to clauses 32.3 and 32.4 in proportion to their respective entitlements under this Constitution. 33.1Distribution Date Subject to the Security Interest Rules and subject to clause 34.1 and the terms of any issue, the Manager must distribute the Distributable Income to which the Member is presently entitled within 2 months after the end of the relevant Distribution Period. 22.Clause 33.6 provides: The Manager has power to retain and accumulate in respect of an Accounting Period any part of what would otherwise be income for that Accounting Period, and no Member has any interest in the amount accumulated. If the Manager decides to distribute the Accumulation Amount or any part of it in a later Accounting Period, that amount must be treated as a distribution of Distributable Income of that later Accounting Period. However, the Prospectus indicates that the Manager does not intend to exercise the power to retain and accumulate income for the duration of the Prospectus. 23.Clauses 34.1 and 34.4 provide: 34.1Power to Reinvest The Manager may, in relation to a particular class of Units, except in relation to holders of Units of a particular class to which clause 34.4 applies, decide whether, and on what terms, to permit the Members to reinvest some or all of any distribution to acquire additional Units. .... 34.4 Non-Discretionary Reinvestment Under the terms of issue of any Units of a particular class, the Manager may reinvest the whole or any part of an amount which a Member would otherwise receive as a distribution under clause 33.1 by way of issuing additional Units in the Fund. Clause 19 does not apply to the issue of Units under this clause 34.4. Subject to the terms of the issue, Units issued under this clause 34.4 will be priced in accordance with clause 20.1. (Clause 19 relates to the procedures for applications for units.) 24.The Investment Statement says: Investors in each Portfolio receive the benefit of all investment returns generated by the underlying assets of each Portfolio, less taxes, expenses and the fees set out above. Returns from Class B units take the form of distributions (both cash and increases in the number of units owned) and any increases in the value of units. You will receive the return from any increases in the value of units you hold when the relevant units are sold or redeemed and the proceeds paid to you. Distributions are made at the times discussed below. .... In general terms, distributions for Class B units comprise your share of a Portfolio’s net income and realised capital gains after Assure has deducted authorised fees and expenses related to that class. Assure will normally make distributions to you within two months of the end of each distribution period, so within two months after 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June in each year at present. Assure may vary the frequency and duration of distribution periods from time to time, but intends there will be at least one distribution of income each financial year. Some or all of the Class B unitholders’ income entitlements in a Portfolio will be automatically reinvested in additional Class B units in that Portfolio. The Manager has the right to determine the proportion of the income entitlements that will be reinvested. At present it is intended for Class B unitholders of each Portfolio, that 90% of income entitlements will be automatically reinvested. 25.The Prospectus says: Distributions Distributions are made in accordance with the constitution. In general terms, distributions comprise your share of a Portfolio’s net income and realised capital gains after the Responsible Entity has deducted authorised fees and expenses. The Responsible Entity has the right to retain and accumulate income however it does not intend to exercise that right for the duration of this Prospectus. Assure will normally make distributions to investors within 2 months of the end of each distribution period, so within two months after 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June in each year at present. The Responsible Entity may vary the duration of distribution periods from time to time, and therefore the frequency of distributions, in relation to Class A units or Class B units or both. However, the Responsible Entity intends there will be at least one distribution of income each financial year for each class of units in each Portfolio. Again, remember that if your investment is held through a master trust or wrap account service your account operator may pay you income at times which are different to this. At present it is intended that Portfolios will pay all distributions wholly in cash except in relation to Class B unitholders, 90% of whose income entitlements will be subject to mandatory reinvestment in additional Class B units. The Responsible Entity has the power to revoke mandatory reinvestment, and to increase or decrease the percentage of income entitlement that is subject to mandatory reinvestment, at its sole discretion. (p. 10) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 70 26.Clause 51.1 of the Constitution provides that the Fund must be wound up and terminated on the first to occur of the following dates: •If the members by extraordinary resolution so determine, the date the extraordinary resolution is passed; •If the manager considers it to be in the interest of the members, the date the manager so determines; •The vesting date (being the day that is 80 years less one day after the commencement date); •If the fund is wound up pursuant to an order of the court, the date of the order or such other date as the court determines. 27.Clause 52 sets out the procedure that is to be followed on termination. Clause 52.1 says: The Manager must, as soon as practicable after the Termination Date: (1)convert the Assets into money; (2)pay the liabilities of the Fund and provide for any contingent liabilities or liabilities not yet accrued; and (3)pay the balance of the Assets to the Members in accordance with the provisions of this Constitu- tion. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumptions: i)The Manager is the trustee of the Fund under the general law and for Australian tax purposes. ii)The Fund is not resident in New Zealand. iii)The Fund is not a controlled foreign company as defined in section CG 4. iv)New Zealand members of the Fund will not use the branch equivalent method of calculating income of the Fund. v)All New Zealand investors will invest directly into the Fund either personally or through a nominee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Manager does not make an election that the issue of additional units to New Zealand investors shall be treated as a taxable bonus issue. b)The Manager of the Fund was incorporated in Australia, carries on business there, or has its central management or control in Australia. Accordingly, the Fund is a resident trust estate for Australian tax purposes. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Where units are issued on the terms that the Manager is not obliged to distribute income entitlements relating to the units and has the power to reinvest the whole or part of the income entitlements in additional units, the issue of additional units to the persons holding such units will constitute a non-taxable bonus issue and, accordingly will be excluded from the definition of a dividend in terms of section CF 3(1)(a) of the Act. •The interest of New Zealand investors in the Fund will not constitute an interest in a foreign investment fund by virtue of the exemption in section CG 15(2)(b). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24 th day of July 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 71 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/24 1.The Fund is registered as a managed investment scheme under Chapter 5C of the Corporations Law of Australia. The Fund will be managed and controlled in Australia by Assure Services & Technology Ltd (“the Manager”), which was incorporated in Australia and which carries on business in Sydney, Australia. The Manager has no offices or employees outside Australia. The Manager is the responsible entity and trustee of the Fund. 2.The objective of the Fund is to outperform the benchmark of the MSCI World Index in AUD by investing in a diversified portfolio of international shares. The MSCI World Index is the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index which includes the stocks of 1,575 companies representing the stock markets of 22 countries. 3.A prospectus has been registered in Australia and with the Registrar of Companies in New Zealand. An investment statement has been issued for Class B units which are to be offered to New Zealand investors. All New Zealand investors will invest directly into the Funds either personally or through a nominee. Wrap account and master trust services referred to in the prospectus represent separate entities in Australia and will not be used in New Zealand. Class B units differ from Class A units in regard to the Responsible Entity’s fees and charges, repurchase policy and distribution policy. In all other respects the classes of units are equivalent. 4.Applications for the allotment of units are to be made to the Manager: Clause 19.1 of the Constitution. The application form for the allotment of units provides that the signature of the investor confirms acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in the investment statement relating to the particular investment. 5.The Investment Statement says that the operation of the Fund is governed by its Constitution, the Corporations Law and the general law of Australia. The Constitution sets out the conditions under which the Fund operates, the rights and obligations of the unitholders and the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Manager. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Assure New Zealand Ltd in respect of Assure Select Global Core Equities Portfolio.

This Ruling applies in respect of: •Section CF 2(1) •Section CF 3(1)(a) •Section CF 8 •Section CG 1(b) •Sections CG 5(1) and (2) •Sections CG 15(1) and (2) •Section HE 1 The following definitions in section OB 1: •“bonus issue” •“bonus issue in lieu” •“company” •“foreign company” •“foreign entity” •“international tax rules” •“non-taxable bonus issue” ·“taxable bonus issue” Section OE 2 The definitions of “FIF rules” and “international tax rules” in section OZ 1(1) Schedule 3 The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of Assure Select Global Core Equities Portfolio (“the Fund”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 72 6.The Manager may accept or refuse any application for units in total or in part and is not required to give any reason for the refusal of an application: Clauses 19.3 and 19.4. The Manager also has discretion to refuse to register a transfer without giving any reason for the refusal: Clause 17.4. The Manager intends to apply the discretion given under the Constitution to ensure that: •No New Zealand resident will have a control interest in the Fund greater than 40 percent; and •There will not be a group of less than 5 or fewer New Zealand residents with a controlling interest in the Fund. 7.The Manager has discretion to invest the assets of the Fund in any Authorised Investment. Authorised Investments include: •shares, stocks, debentures, bonds, notes, convertible notes, or any unit or option over these; •derivative contracts (including swaps, futures, forward rate agreements and options and any form of agreement creating a contingent liability); •Unit Trust investments (being any units, rights to participate or interest in an undertaking, enterprise or scheme, whether unquoted or quoted on any stock or other securities exchange, including any interest in a managed investment scheme and any prescribed interest, which the Manager and the Fund is not prohibited by the Corporations Law from investing in); •Any deposit with or any negotiable instrument accepted endorsed or issued by, an Australian ADI, as defined in section 9 of the Corporations Law. •Deposits or loans to any financial institution other than Unit Trust Investments; •bills of exchange, promissory notes, commercial bills or other negotiable instruments issued by any financial institution; •the taking, granting, buying or selling of options in relation to any of the above; •any other investment determined by the Manager to be an authorised investment. 8.The Manager may appoint an investment manager for the Fund to act in relation to the investments of the Fund or any part of the Fund: clause 42.1(1). An investment manager has the powers in relation to the investments of the Fund determined by the manager, which may include the power to delegate all or any of the powers granted to the investment manager of the Manager: clause 42.1(2). Putnam Advisory Company Inc, whose headquarters are in Boston, USA, has been appointed as the first investment manager of the Fund. 9.The Manager has discretion as to the investment policy of the Fund but the investment policy must be specified in the first prospectus of the Fund: clauses 29.1 and 29.2. The prospectus (which relates to all Funds established by the Manager) explains the differences in the investment policies of the Funds as follows: Assure initially established two Portfolios, Assure Select Global Core Equities Portfolio and Assure Select Global Value Equities Portfolio, in October 2000, and subsequently established Assure Select Global Active Equities Portfolio.... Assure Select is the umbrella name under which the Portfolios are being offered. A single investment manager is responsible for managing the investments of a Portfolio. Assure has appointed Putnam as the investment manager for the Global Core Equities Portfolio and Lazard as the investment manager for the Global Value Equities Portfolio. Putnam’s investment philosophy is based on the belief that all companies, no matter what they do or make, have an underlying long -term business worth and that share prices fluctuate significantly around this long term worth. Lazard’s investment philosophy is based on bottom-up value stock selection. Lazard focuses on companies that are financially productive yet inexpensively priced. Assure has appointed National as the investment manager for the Global Active Equities Portfolio, with an investment mandate that requires National to invest the Portfolio wholly in funds managed by Capital. Capital’s investment philosophy is based on a bottom-up research approach to stock selection emphasising a company’s stock price relative to the underlying value and expected earnings growth of that company.... The Policy of the Fund in respect of currency hedging is as follows: International equity investments may be partially hedged back to the Australian dollar. The hedging level will generally be set at 35% of the four major currencies: USD, GBP, Euro and Yen. Other currencies will generally not be hedged. The level of hedging can fluctuate around the central point to allow for asset and currency movements. Additionally, hedging may be used selectively for defensive purposes. Cross hedging is also permitted. After agreement with Putnam, hedging policy may be changed from time to time by Assure. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 73 10.The Manager holds the assets of the Fund on trust for the members: clause 5.2 Constitution. The Manager must clearly identify the assets of the Fund as the property of the Fund and hold the assets separately from any other property held by the Manager: clause 5.3. However, the Manager may engage a custodian to hold the assets in accordance with the Australian Corporations Law: clause 5.4. The Manager has appointed State Street Australia Ltd (“State”) as the custodian to hold the assets of the Funds and to perform some administrative functions for the Funds. State was incorporated in Australia and carries on business in Sydney, Australia. State has no offices in New Zealand. 11.The Manager has entered into a Custodian Agreement with State. Clause 3.13 of the Custodian Agreement permits State to appoint subcustodians to carry out any of the provisions of the Custodian Agreement. State’s duties under the Custodian Agreement are as follows: •State must segregate in its books for the account of the Manager all securities and other non cash property of each Fund, other than securities which are held in a securities system. •State is to release and deliver securities of a Fund held by State or its subcustodians only upon receipt of proper instructions. •State will pay interest on credit balances in cash accounts. •Upon receipt of proper instructions State or its subcustodians may enter into all types of contracts for foreign exchange on behalf of the Manager. •State or its subcustodians may make margin payments on derivatives contracts on behalf of the Manager. •State or its subcustodians may deliver money of the Manager to a third party to be held on deposit for the Manager pursuant to proper instructions. •State or its subcustodians are to use their commercially reasonable efforts to collect on a timely basis all income and other payments with respect to each Fund to which the Manager is entitled.

State may also pay out money of the Fund for any other purpose upon receipt of proper instructions. Refer clauses 3.1, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. State also has general obligations in respect of recordkeeping, procurement of registration of securities, execution of documents required to perform its obligations under the Custodian Agreement. State must also segregate its settlement staff from its accounting staff. Refer clause 3.4. 12.The expression “proper instructions” is defined in the Custodian Agreement as follows: Proper Instructions means instructions (which may be standing instructions) received by the Custodian from the \[Manager\] (or a person duly authorised by the \[Manager\]), the Investment Manager, or any person duly authorised by either of them, in any of the following forms: (a)in writing signed or initialled by the authorised person (subject to the telephone verification callback procedures adopted by the Custodian and advised to the \[Manager\] from time to time); or (b)in a tested communication; or (c)in a communication utilising access codes effected between electro mechanical or elec- tronic devices; or (d)by such other means as may be agreed in writing from time to time by the Custodian and the party giving such instructions including without limitation oral instructions. 13.State may without express authority from the Manager or the Investment Manager: •Make payments to itself or others for minor expenses of handling securities or other similar items relating to its duties under the Custodian Agreement. •Surrender securities in temporary form for securities in definitive form; •Endorse for collection cheques, drafts and other negotiable instruments; and •Attend to all non-discretionary details in connection with the sale, exchange, substitution, purchase, transfer and other dealings with the securities and other assets of the Funds. See Clause 3.19. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 74 14.State’s duties under the Administrative Services Agreement are to provide accountancy services, registry services and taxation services. 15.The beneficial interest in the fund is divided into units: Clause 6.1. A member is a person who is registered as the holder of a unit: definition of “member”, Clause 1.1(39). Unitholders do not have a right to any particular assets or any part of the assets of the Funds. Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the Constitution provide: 7.1General Entitlement to Assets Each Unit confers on the holder of that Unit an undivided interest in the Assets in the proportion that the Unit bears to the total number of Units on Issue at that time. 7.2No Entitlement to any part of Assets A Unit does not entitle the holder of that Unit to any particular Asset comprised in the Assets or to any particular part of the Assets. 16.Clause 11.1 provides that a unit confers on the member the following: •The right to attend and vote at meetings of members; •The right for the member as at midnight on the last day of a Distribution Period to receive a share of the Distributable Income (if any) for the Distribution Period on a pro rata basis with all other such units; •The right to participate in the division of any surplus assets or profits of the fund on the winding up of the fund on a pro rata basis with all other units; and •Rights on redemption of the units. Members may not interfere with the rights or powers of the Manager in its dealings with the assets of the Fund and the Fund, nor do members have the right to exercise any rights, power or privileges in respect of any part of the assets or investments of the Fund: Clause 12.1. 17.The Manager is required to collect and receive all money, rights and property paid, receivable or arising from the assets of the Fund and must pay the liabilities of the Fund, including tax liabilities: clause 31. The Manager must determine the net taxable income of the Fund for each distribution period: clause 32.2. The distributable income of the Fund for a period is to be determined by applying the following formula which is set out in Clause 32.3 of the Constitution: DI=NTI + I-NCI+C-D Where: DI=the amount of Distributable Income N T I=the amount of Net Taxable Income I=so much of the amount by which Income exceeds the Net Taxable Income that the Manager has determined is to be distributed to Members NCI=Non-Cash Income C=the amount of capital the Manager has determined is to be distributed D=Accumulation Account 18.“Distribution period” is defined in Clause 1.1(25) as follows: (a)for the first Distribution Period, the period from the Commencement Date to the next Distribu- tion Calculation Date; (b)thereafter, the period beginning on the day after the preceding Distribution Calculation Date to the next Distribution Calculation Date until the last Distribution Calculation Date immediately preceding the Termination Date; and (c)for the last Distribution Period, the period from the last Distribution Calculation Date immedi- ately preceding the Termination Date until the Termination Date; The distribution calculation dates are 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December in each year “or any other date the Manager determines from time to time”: Clause 1.1(22). 19.Clause 32.4 provides that each member’s income entitlement in the Fund is to be determined by applying the following formula: IE=DI x UH NU Where: IE=the Income Entitlement of the Member DI=the amount of Distributable Income UH=the Unit Holding of the Member at the close of business on the Distribution Calculation Date NU=the number of Units on Issue at the close of business on the Distribution Calculation Date The distributable income of the Fund is the net taxable income of the Fund (calculated under the rules in the Australian Act or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) with adjustments for distributions of income for any period, non-cash income, capital amounts distributed and accumulation amounts. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 75 20.Clause 32.5 provides: 5.5Distribution Accounts (1)The Manager may: (a) keep separate accounts of different categories or sources of income or capital, or deductions or credits for taxation purposes; and (b) allocate income, capital, deductions or credits from a particular category or source to particular Members. (2)Nothing in this clause 32 or any provision of this Constitution requires the Manager to establish any separate bank for: (a) any distribution to any Member or the Members; or (b) in respect of the accounts referred to in clause 32.5(1). 21.The Manager must calculate and distribute each Member’s Income Entitlement: clause 32.6. Clauses 32.6, 32.7 and 33.1 provide: 32.6Determination Member’s Income Entitlement Subject to clause 34.1 and to the terms of any issue, for each Distribution Period, the Manager must calculate and distribute each Member’s Income Entitlement. 32.7Member’s Entitlement Vested and Present For each Accounting Period: (1)the Manager holds the Distributable Income which has not been distributed by the end of the Accounting Period for the Members; and (2)each Member will be presently entitled to Distributable Income of the Fund in proportion to the amounts which are distributed pursuant to clauses 32.3 and 32.4 in proportion to their respective entitlements under this Constitution. 33.1Distribution Date Subject to the Security Interest Rules and subject to clause 34.1 and the terms of any issue, the Manager must distribute the Distributable Income to which the Member is presently entitled within 2 months after the end of the relevant Distribution Period. 22.Clause 33.6 provides: The Manager has power to retain and accumulate in respect of an Accounting Period any part of what would otherwise be income for that Accounting Period, and no Member has any interest in the amount accumulated. If the Manager decides to distribute the Accumulation Amount or any part of it in a later Accounting Period, that amount must be treated as a distribution of Distributable Income of that later Accounting Period. However, the Prospectus indicates that the Manager does not intend to exercise the power to retain and accumulate income for the duration of the Prospectus. 23.Clauses 34.1 and 34.4 provide: 34.1Power to Reinvest The Manager may, in relation to a particular class of Units, except in relation to holders of Units of a particular class to which clause 34.4 applies, decide whether, and on what terms, to permit the Members to reinvest some or all of any distribution to acquire additional Units. .... 34.4Non-Discretionary Reinvestment Under the terms of issue of any Units of a particular class, the Manager may reinvest the whole or any part of an amount which a Member would otherwise receive as a distribution under clause 33.1 by way of issuing additional Units in the Fund. Clause 19 does not apply to the issue of Units under this clause 34.4. Subject to the terms of the issue, Units issued under this clause 34.4 will be priced in accordance with clause 20.1. (Clause 19 relates to the procedures for applications for units.) 24.The Investment Statement says: Investors in each Portfolio receive the benefit of all investment returns generated by the underlying assets of each Portfolio, less taxes, expenses and the fees set out above. Returns from Class B units take the form of distributions (both cash and increases in the number of units owned) and any increases in the value of units. You will receive the return from any increases in the value of units you hold when the relevant units are sold or redeemed and the proceeds paid to you. Distributions are made at the times discussed below. .... In general terms, distributions for Class B units comprise your share of a Portfolio’s net income and realised capital gains after Assure has deducted authorised fees and expenses related to that class. Assure will normally make distributions to you within two months of the end of each distribution period, so within two months after 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June in each year at present. Assure may vary the frequency and duration of distribution periods from time to time, but intends there will be at least one distribution of income each financial year. Some or all of the Class B unitholders’ income entitlements in a Portfolio will be automatically reinvested in additional Class B units in that Portfolio. The Manager has the right to determine the proportion of the income entitlements that will be reinvested. At present it is intended for Class B unitholders of each Portfolio, that 90% of income entitlements will be automatically reinvested. 25.The Prospectus says: Distributions Distributions are made in accordance with the constitution. In general terms, distributions comprise your share of a Portfolio’s net income and realised capital gains after the Responsible Entity has deducted authorised fees and expenses. The Responsible Entity has the right to retain and accumulate income however Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 76 it does not intend to exercise that right for the duration of this Prospectus. Assure will normally make distributions to investors within 2 months of the end of each distribution period, so within two months after 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June in each year at present. The Responsible Entity may vary the duration of distribution periods from time to time, and therefore the frequency of distributions, in relation to Class A units or Class B units or both. However, the Responsible Entity intends there will be at least one distribution of income each financial year for each class of units in each Portfolio. Again, remember that if your investment is held through a master trust or wrap account service your account operator may pay you income at times which are different to this. At present it is intended that Portfolios will pay all distributions wholly in cash except in relation to Class B unitholders, 90% of whose income entitlements will be subject to mandatory reinvestment in additional Class B units. The Responsible Entity has the power to revoke mandatory reinvestment, and to increase or decrease the percentage of income entitlement that is subject to mandatory reinvestment, at its sole discretion (p.10) 26.Clause 51.1 of the Constitution provides that the Fund must be wound up and terminated on the first to occur of the following dates: •If the members by extraordinary resolution so determine, the date the extraordinary resolution is passed; •If the manager considers it to be in the interest of the members, the date the manager so determines; •The vesting date (being the day that is 80 years less one day after the commencement date); •If the Fund is wound up pursuant to an order of the court, the date of the order or such other date as the court determines. 27.Clause 52 sets out the procedure that is to be followed on termination. Clause 52.1 says: The Manager must, as soon as practicable after the Termination Date: (1)convert the Assets into money; (2)pay the liabilities of the Fund and provide for any contingent liabilities or liabilities not yet accrued; and (3)pay the balance of the Assets to the Members in accordance with the provisions of this Constitu- tion. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumptions: i)The Manager is the trustee of the Fund under the general law and for Australian tax purposes. ii)The Fund is not resident in New Zealand. iii)The Fund is not a controlled foreign company as defined in section CG 4. iv)New Zealand members of the Fund will not use the branch equivalent method of calculating income of the Fund. v)All New Zealand investors will invest directly into the Fund either personally or through a nominee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Manager does not make an election that the issue of additional units to New Zealand investors shall be treated as a taxable bonus issue. b)The Manager of the Fund was incorporated in Australia, carries on business there, or has its central management or control in Australia. Accordingly, the Fund is a resident trust estate for Australian tax purposes. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Where units are issued on the terms that the Manager is not obliged to distribute income entitlements relating to the units and has the power to reinvest the whole or part of the income entitlements in additional units, the issue of additional units to the persons holding such units will constitute a non-taxable bonus issue and, accordingly will be excluded from the definition of a dividend in terms of section CF 3(1)(a) of the Act. •The interest of New Zealand investors in the Fund will not constitute an interest in a foreign investment fund by virtue of the exemption in section CG 15(2)(b). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 77 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24 th day of July 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 78 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/25 Assure Services & Technology Ltd (“the Manager”) which was incorporated in Australia and which carries on business in Sydney, Australia. The Manager has no offices or employees outside Australia. The Manager is the responsible entity and trustee of the Fund. 2.The objective of the Fund is to outperform the benchmark of the MSCI World Index in AUD by investing in a diversified portfolio of international shares. The MSCI World Index is the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index which includes the stocks of 1,575 companies representing the stock markets of 22 countries. 3.A prospectus has been registered in Australia and with the Registrar of Companies in New Zealand. An investment statement has been issued for Class B units which are to be offered to New Zealand investors. All New Zealand investors will invest directly into the Funds either personally or through a nominee. Wrap account and master trust services referred to in the prospectus represent separate entities in Australia and will not be used in New Zealand. Class B units differ from Class A units in regard to the Responsible Entity’s fees and charges, repurchase policy and distribution policy. In all other respects the classes of units are equivalent. 4.Applications for the allotment of units are to be made to the Manager: Clause 19.1 of the Constitution. The application form for the allotment of units provides that the signature of the investor confirms acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in the investment statement relating to the particular investment. 5.The Investment Statement says that the operation of the Fund is governed by its Constitution, the Corporations Law and the general law of Australia. The Constitution sets out the conditions under which the Fund operates, the rights and obligations of the unitholders and the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Manager. 6.The Manager may accept or refuse any application for units in total or in part and is not required to give any reason for the refusal of an application: Clauses 19.3 and 19.4. The Manager also has discretion to refuse to register a transfer without giving any reason for the refusal: Clause 17.4. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Assure New Zealand Ltd in respect of Assure Select Global Active Equities Portfolio. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: •Section CF 2(1)(f) •Section CF 3(1)(a) •Section CF 8 •Section CG 1(b) •Sections CG 5(1) and (2) •Sections CG 15(1) and (2) •Section HE 1 The following definitions in section OB 1: •“bonus issue” •“bonus issue in lieu” •“company” •“foreign company” •“foreign entity” •“international tax rules” •“non-taxable bonus issue” •“taxable bonus issue” Section OE 2 The definitions of “FIF rules” and “international tax rules” in section OZ 1(1) Schedule 3 The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of Assure Select Global Active Equities Portfolio (“the Fund”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund is registered as a managed investment scheme under Chapter 5C of the Corporations Law of Australia. The Fund will be managed and controlled in Australia by Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 79 The Manager intends to apply the discretion given under the Constitution to ensure that: •No New Zealand resident will have a control interest in the Fund greater than 40 percent; and •There will not be a group of less than 5 or fewer New Zealand residents with a controlling interest in the Fund. 7.The Manager has discretion to invest the assets of the Fund in any Authorised Investment. Authorised Investments include: •shares, stocks, debentures, bonds, notes, convertible notes, or any unit or option over these; •derivative contracts (including swaps, futures, forward rate agreements and options and any form of agreement creating a contingent liability); •Unit Trust investments (being any units, rights to participate or interest in an undertaking, enterprise or scheme, whether unquoted or quoted on any stock or other securities exchange, including any interest in a managed investment scheme and any prescribed interest, which the Manager and the Fund is not prohibited by the Corporations Law from investing in); •Any deposit with or any negotiable instrument accepted endorsed or issued by, an Australian ADI, as defined in section 9 of the Corporations Law; •Deposits or loans to any financial institution other than Unit Trust Investments; •bills of exchange, promissory notes, commercial bills or other negotiable instruments issued by any financial institution; •the taking, granting, buying or selling of options in relation to any of the above; •any other investment determined by the Manager to be an authorised investment. 8.The Manager may appoint an investment manager for the Fund to act in relation to the investments of the Fund or any part of the Fund: clause 42.1(1). An investment manager has the powers in relation to the investments of the Fund determined by the manager, which may include the power to delegate all or any of the powers granted to the investment manager of the Manager: clause 42.1(2). National Corporate Investment Services Ltd (“National:”), whose headquarters are in Sydney, Australia has been appointed as the first investment manager of the Fund: Clause 42.2 of Constitution. The underlying investment manager is Capital International Inc, a US company whose headquarters are in Los Angeles. National is required to invest in funds managed solely by Capital International. 9.The Manager has discretion as to the investment policy of the Fund but the investment policy must be specified in the first prospectus of the Fund: clauses 29.1 and 29.2. The prospectus (which relates to all Funds established by the Manager) explains the difference in the investment policy of the Funds as follows: Assure initially established two Portfolios, Assure Select Global Core Equities Portfolio and Assure Select Global Value Equities Portfolio, in October 2000, and subsequently established Assure Select Global Active Equities Portfolio.... Assure Select is the umbrella name under which the Portfolios are being offered. A single investment manager is responsible for managing the investments of a Portfolio. Assure has appointed Putnam as the investment manager for the Global Core Equities Portfolio and Lazard as the investment manager for the Global Value Equities Portfolio. Putnam’s investment philosophy is based on the belief that all companies, no matter what they do or make, have an underlying long term business worth and that share prices fluctuate significantly around this long-term worth. Lazard’s investment philosophy is based on bottom-up value stock selection. Lazard focuses on companies that are financially productive yet inexpensively priced. Assure has appointed National as the investment manager for the Global Active Equities Portfolio, with an investment mandate that requires National to invest the Portfolio wholly in funds managed by Capital. Capital’s investment philosophy is based on a bottom-up research approach to stock selection emphasising a company’s stock price relative to the underlying value and expected earnings growth of that company.... The policy of the Fund in respect of currency hedging is as follows: International equity investments are made on an unhedged currency basis. Additionally, hedging may be used selectively for defensive purposes. Cross hedging is also permitted. After agreement with the investment manager, hedging policy may be changed from time to time by Assure. 10.The Manager holds the assets of the Fund on trust for the members: clause 5.2 Constitution. The Manager must clearly identify the assets of the Fund as the property of the Fund and hold the assets separately from any other property held by the Manager: clause 5.3. However, the Manager may engage a custodian to hold the assets in accordance with the Australian Corporations Law: clause 5.4. The Manager Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 80 has appointed State Street Australia Ltd (“State”) as the custodian to hold the assets of the Funds and to perform some administrative functions for the Funds. State was incorporated in Australia and carries on business in, Sydney, Australia. State has no offices in New Zealand. 11.The Manager has entered into a Custodian Agreement with State. Clause 3.13 of the Custodian Agreement permits State to appoint subcustodians to carry out any of the provisions of the Custodian Agreement. State’s duties under the Custodian Agreement are as follows: •State must segregate in its books for the account of the Manager all securities and other non cash property of each Fund, other than securities which are held in a securities system. •State is to release and deliver securities of a Fund held by State or its subcustodians only upon receipt of proper instructions. •State will pay interest on credit balances in cash accounts. •Upon receipt of proper instructions State or its subcustodians may enter into all types of contracts for foreign exchange on behalf of the Manager. •State or its subcustodians may make margin payments on derivatives contracts on behalf of the Manager. •State or its subcustodians may deliver money of the Manager to a third party to be held on deposit for the Manager pursuant to proper instructions. •State or its subcustodians are to use their commercially reasonable efforts to collect on a timely basis all income and other payments with respect to each Fund to which the Manager is entitled. Income that is collected is to be credited to the relevant accounts held for the Manager. •Upon receipt of proper instructions State is to pay out (or direct its subcustodians to pay out) moneys of the Fund for the purchase of securities, the conversion, exchange or surrender of securities of the Fund, the payment of expenses incurred by the Manager, the purchase or sale of foreign exchange or foreign exchange agreements, in connection with trading in derivatives contracts or securities borrowings by the Manager. State may also pay out money of the Fund for any other purpose upon receipt of proper instructions. Refer clauses 3.1, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. State also has general obligations in respect of recordkeeping, procurement of registration of securities, execution of documents required to perform its obligations under the Custodian Agreement. State must also segregate its settlement staff from its accounting staff. Refer clause 3.4. 12.The expression “proper instructions” is defined in the Custodian Agreement as follows: Proper Instructions means instructions (which may be standing instructions) received by the Custodian from the \[Manager\] (or a person duly authorised by the \[Manager\]), the Investment Manager, or any person duly authorised by either of them, in any of the following forms: (a)in writing signed or initialled by the authorised person (subject to the telephone verification callback procedures adopted by the Custodian and advised to the \[Manager\] from time to time); or (b)in a tested communication; or (c)in a communication utilising access codes effected between electro mechanical or elec- tronic devices; or (d)by such other means as may be agreed in writing from time to time by the Custodian and the party giving such instructions including without limitation oral instructions. 13.State may without express authority from the Manager or the Investment Manager: •Make payments to itself or others for minor expenses of handling securities or other similar items relating to its duties under the Custodian Agreement. •Surrender securities in temporary form for securities in definitive form; •Endorse for collection cheques, drafts and other negotiable instruments; and •Attend to all non-discretionary details in connection with the sale, exchange, substitution, purchase, transfer and other dealings with the securities and other assets of the Funds. See Clause 3.19. 14.State’s duties under the Administrative Services Agreement are to provide accountancy services, registry services and taxation services. 15.The beneficial interest in the fund is divided into units: Clause 6.1. A member is a person who is registered as the holder of a unit: definition of “member”, Clause 1.1(39). Unitholders do not have a right to any particular assets or any part of the assets of the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 81 Funds. Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the Constitution provide: 7.1General Entitlement to Assets Each Unit confers on the holder of that Unit an undivided interest in the Assets in the proportion that the Unit bears to the total number of Units on Issue at that time. 7.2No Entitlement to any part of Assets A Unit does not entitle the holder of that Unit to any particular Asset comprised in the Assets or to any particular part of the Assets. 16.Clause 11.1 provides that a unit confers on the member the following: •The right to attend and vote at meetings of members; •The right for the member as at midnight on the last day of a Distribution Period to receive a share of the Distributable Income (if any) for the Distribution Period on a pro rata basis with all other such units; •The right to participate in the division of any surplus assets or profits of the fund on the winding up of the fund on a pro rata basis with all other units; and •Rights on redemption of the units. Members may not interfere with the rights or powers of the Manager in its dealings with the assets of the Fund and the Fund, nor do members have the right to exercise any rights, power or privileges in respect of any part of the assets or investments of the Fund: Clause 12.1. 17.The Manager is required to collect and receive all money, rights and property paid, receivable or arising from the assets of the Fund and must pay the liabilities of the Fund, including tax liabilities: clause 31. The Manager must determine the net taxable income of the Fund for each distribution period: clause 32.2. The distributable income of the Fund for a period is to be determined by applying the following formula which is set out in Clause 32.3 of the Constitution: DI=NTI + I-NCI+C-D Where: DI=the amount of Distributable Income N T I=the amount of Net Taxable Income I=so much of the amount by which Income exceeds the Net Taxable Income that the Manager has determined is to be distributed to Members NCI=Non-Cash Income C=the amount of capital the Manager has determined is to be distributed D=Accumulation Account 18.“Distribution period” is defined in Clause 1.1(25) as follows: (a)for the first Distribution Period, the period from the Commencement Date to the next Distribu- tion Calculation Date; (b)thereafter, the period beginning on the day after the preceding Distribution Calculation Date to the next Distribution Calculation Date until the last Distribution Calculation Date immediately preceding the Termination Date; and (c)for the last Distribution Period, the period from the last Distribution Calculation Date immedi- ately preceding the Termination Date until the Termination Date; The distribution calculation dates are 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December in each year “or any other date the Manager determines from time to time”: Clause 1.1(22). 19.Clause 32.4 provides that each member’s income entitlement in the Fund is to be determined by applying the following formula: IE=DI x UH NU Where: IE=the Income Entitlement of the Member DI=the amount of Distributable Income UH=the Unit Holding of the Member at the close of business on the Distribution Calculation Date NU=the number of Units on Issue at the close of business on the Distribution Calculation Date The distributable income of the Fund is the net taxable income of the Fund (calculated under the rules in the Australian Act or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) with adjustments for distributions of income for any period, non-cash income, capital amounts distributed and accumulation amounts. 20.Clause 32.5 provides: 32.5Distribution Accounts (1)The Manager may: (a) keep separate accounts of different categories or sources of income or capital, or deductions or credits for taxation purposes; and (b) allocate income, capital, deductions or credits from a particular category or source to particular Members. (2)Nothing in this clause 32 or any provision of this Constitution requires the Manager to establish any separate bank for: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 82 (a) any distribution to any Member or the Members; or (b) in respect of the accounts referred to in clause 32.5(1). 21.The Manager must calculate and distribute each Member’s Income Entitlement: clause 32.6. Clauses 32.6, 32.7 and 33.1 provide: 32.6Determination Member’s Income Entitlement Subject to clause 34.1 and to the terms of any issue, for each Distribution Period, the Manager must calculate and distribute each Member’s Income Entitlement. 32.7Member’s Entitlement Vested and Present For each Accounting Period: (1)the Manager holds the Distributable Income which has not been distributed by the end of the Accounting Period for the Members; and (2)each Member will be presently entitled to Distributable Income of the Fund in proportion to the amounts which are distributed pursuant to clauses 32.3 and 32.4 in proportion to their respective entitlements under this Constitution. 33.1Distribution Date Subject to the Security Interest Rules and subject to clause 34.1 and the terms of any issue, the Manager must distribute the Distributable Income to which the Member is presently entitled within 2 months after the end of the relevant Distribution Period. 22.Clause 33.6 provides: The Manager has power to retain and accumulate in respect of an Accounting Period any part of what would otherwise be income for that Accounting Period, and no Member has any interest in the amount accumulated. If the Manager decides to distribute the Accumulation Amount or any part of it in a later Accounting Period, that amount must be treated as a distribution of Distributable Income of that later Accounting Period. However, the Prospectus indicates that the Manager does not intend to exercise the power to retain and accumulate income for the duration of the Prospectus. 23.Clauses 34.1 and 34.4 provide: 34.1Power to Reinvest The Manager may, in relation to a particular class of Units, except in relation to holders of Units of a particular class to which clause 34.4 applies, decide whether, and on what terms, to permit the Members to reinvest some or all of any distribution to acquire additional Units. .... 34.4Non-Discretionary Reinvestment Under the terms of issue of any Units of a particular class, the Manager may reinvest the whole or any part of an amount which a Member would otherwise receive as a distribution under clause 33.1 by way of issuing additional Units in the Fund. Clause 19 does not apply to the issue of Units under this clause 34.4. Subject to the terms of the issue, Units issued under this clause 34.4 will be priced in accordance with clause 20.1. (Clause 19 relates to the procedures for applications for units.) 24.The Investment Statement says: Investors in each Portfolio receive the benefit of all investment returns generated by the underlying assets of each Portfolio, less taxes, expenses and the fees set out above. Returns from Class B units take the form of distributions (both cash and increases in the number of units owned) and any increases in the value of units. You will receive the return from any increases in the value of units you hold when the relevant units are sold or redeemed and the proceeds paid to you. Distributions are made at the times discussed below. .... In general terms, distributions for Class B units comprise your share of a Portfolio’s net income and realised capital gains after Assure has deducted authorised fees and expenses related to that class. Assure will normally make distributions to you within two months of the end of each distribution period, so within two months after 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June in each year at present. Assure may vary the frequency and duration of distribution periods from time to time, but intends there will be at least one distribution of income each financial year. Some or all of the Class B unitholders’ income entitlements in a Portfolio will be automatically reinvested in additional Class B units in that Portfolio. The Manager has the right to determine the proportion of the income entitlements that will be reinvested. At present it is intended for Class B unitholders of each Portfolio, that 90% of income entitlements will be automatically reinvested. 25.The Prospectus says: Distributions Distributions are made in accordance with the constitution. In general terms, distributions comprise your share of a Portfolio’s net income and realised capital gains after the Responsible Entity has deducted authorised fees and expenses. The Responsible Entity has the right to retain and accumulate income however it does not intend to exercise that right for the duration of this Prospectus. Assure will normally make distributions to investors within 2 months of the end of each distribution period, so within two months after 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June in each year at present. The Responsible Entity may vary Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 83 the duration of distribution periods from time to time, and therefore the frequency of distributions, in relation to Class A units or Class B units or both. However, the Responsible Entity intends there will be at least one distribution of income each financial year for each class of units in each Portfolio. Again, remember that if your investment is held through a master trust or wrap account service your account operator may pay you income at times which are different to this. At present it is intended that Portfolios will pay all distributions wholly in cash except in relation to Class B unitholders, 90% of whose income entitlements will be subject to mandatory reinvestment in additional Class B units. The Responsible Entity has the power to revoke mandatory reinvestment, and to increase or decrease the percentage of income entitlement that is subject to mandatory reinvestment, at its sole discretion. (p. 10) 26.Clause 51.1 of the Constitution provides that the Fund must be wound up and terminated on the first to occur of the following dates: •If the members by extraordinary resolution so determine, the date the extraordinary resolution is passed; •If the manager considers it to be in the interest of the members, the date the manager so determines; •The vesting date (being the day that is 80 years less one day after the commencement date); •If the fund is wound up pursuant to an order of the court, the date of the order or such other date as the court determines. 27.Clause 52 sets out the procedure that is to be followed on termination. Clause 52.1 says: The Manager must, as soon as practicable after the Termination Date: (1)convert the Assets into money; (2)pay the liabilities of the Fund and provide for any contingent liabilities or liabilities not yet accrued; and (3)pay the balance of the Assets to the Members in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumptions: i)The Manager is the trustee of the Fund under the general law and for Australian tax purposes. ii)The Fund is not resident in New Zealand. iii)The Fund is not a controlled foreign company as defined in section CG 4. iv)New Zealand members of the Fund will not use the branch equivalent method of calculating income of the Fund. v)All New Zealand investors will invest directly into the Fund either personally or through a nominee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Manager does not make an election that the issue of additional units to New Zealand investors shall be treated as a taxable bonus issue. b)The Manager of the Fund was incorporated in Australia, carries on business there, or has its central management or control in Australia. Accordingly, the Fund is a resident trust estate for Australian tax purposes. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Where units are issued on the terms that the Manager is not obliged to distribute income entitlements relating to the units and has the power to reinvest the whole or part of the income entitlements in additional units, the issue of additional units to the persons holding such units will constitute a non-taxable bonus issue and, accordingly will be excluded from the definition of a dividend in terms of section CF 3(1)(a) of the Act. •The interest of New Zealand investors in the Fund will not constitute an interest in a foreign investment fund by virtue of the exemption in section CG 15(2)(b). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24 th day of July 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 84 FORESTRY RIGHTS – SECONDHAND GOODS GST INPUT TAX DEDUCTION PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 01/08 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 3 rd day of September 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 98/5 which was published in TIB Vol 10, No 12 (December 1998). BR Pub 98/5 applies up until 30 September 2001. This new ruling takes into account minor changes to the legislation since BR Pub 98/5 was issued, and the commentary has been expanded. Its period of application is from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2006. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the section 2(1) definition of “secondhand goods”, section 3A(1)(c) definition of “input tax”, and section 20(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply to a GST registered person of a “forestry right” (as defined in the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983) by way of sale in the following circumstances: •The sale is not a taxable supply; and •The right is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and •The right is acquired by the registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies; and •The right has been used by at least one prior owner for its intrinsic purpose. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •A forestry right is a secondhand good for which an input tax deduction is available within the section 2(1) definition of “secondhand goods”, section 3A(1)(c) definition of “input tax”, and section 20(3). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 85 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/08 (4)No right created under this section is capable of conferring a right of exclusive possession of the land. Section 3(1) of the FRRA states: Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, every forestry right shall be deemed to be a profit à prendre. Section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 defines “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money. Section 3A(1)(c) defines “input tax” in relation to secondhand goods: (1)Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means— .... (c)an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). Section 20(3) allows deductions from output tax, and states: (3)Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— (a)In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax— ... (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: ... (b)In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax— (i)In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 01/08 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 98/5 (Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 12 (December 1998) at page 43, under the heading “Forestry Rights – secondhand goods GST input tax deduction”). This Ruling extends that coverage to 30 September 2006. Background We had been asked to clarify whether a GST registered person who buys a forestry right by way of a non- taxable supply may make a secondhand goods input tax deduction. It had been unclear whether a forestry right can be a secondhand good. Legislation Section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 (“FRRA”) defines “forestry right” (for the purposes of that Act): Forestry right means a right created in accordance with this Act: Section 2A of the FRRA deals with the creation of forestry rights. It states: 2ACreation of forestry rights (1)A forestry right may be created by the proprietor of land— (a)By creating in accordance with subsection (3); or (b)By granting to any other person; or (c)By reserving to the proprietor on the sale of the land,— the right to— (d)Establish, maintain, and harvest; or (e)Maintain and harvest,— a crop of trees on that land. (2)The forestry right may also— (a)Grant or reserve rights of access and rights of construction and use of tracks, culverts, bridges, buildings, and other works and facilities if those rights are ancillary to and necessary for the purposes of subsection (1): (b)Provide for charges, payments, royalties, or division of the crop or the proceeds of the crop,— whether or not such rights or provisions are coupled with an obligation. (3)Despite any enactment or rule of law, the proprietor may, in accordance with this section, create a forestry right for the proprietor. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 86 Application of the Legislation Under sections 2(1), 3A, and 20(3), seven conditions must be met before the purchase of a forestry right by a GST registered person will permit a secondhand goods input tax deduction: •Forestry rights must be “goods” as defined in section 2(1). •The supply of a forestry right must be by way of sale. •The supply of the forestry right must be a non- taxable supply. •The sale must involve payment in the taxable period for which an input tax deduction is sought. •The forestry right must be secondhand. •The forestry right must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. •The forestry right must be situated in New Zealand at the time of sale. The following paragraphs consider some of these requirements. “Goods” The Commissioner considers that a forestry right (as defined in section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983) is a “good” for GST purposes. “Goods” means all real and personal property but does not include choses in action. Section 3(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 deems forestry rights to be profits à prendre. A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. A profit à prendre is an interest in land. It is not a chose in action because the rights under a profit à prendre are of a possessory nature, whereas a chose in action can only be enforced by action. An example of a “chose in action” is the granting of a licence at a boat marina. The benefits arising from the licence cannot be obtained by taking possession of the licence, but by action against a licensor who refuses to honour the licence. On the other hand, a forestry right, which can be enforced by taking possession, is real property and a “good” for GST purposes. “Sale” A secondhand goods input tax deduction is only available if there is a supply by way of sale. Forestry rights are a form of transferable property right, like other profits à prendre, and may be sold. It will be a question of fact whether there has been a sale rather than a lease or sub-grant of a forestry right. Because of the definition of “input tax” in section 3A, a secondhand goods input tax deduction is available only where there is a sale (section 3A(2)). The sale must be by way of a non-taxable supply for an input tax deduction to be available. “Payment” An input tax deduction is only available to the extent that there has been payment for the goods in the relevant taxable period. Therefore, if there is a sale by instalments, input tax deductions are available only in the taxable period in which each instalment is paid. “Secondhand” The forestry right must be “secondhand” before an input tax deduction is available. The Commissioner considers that land is a secondhand good. This is supported by case law, e.g. Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,105. The Court of Appeal decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 appears to have confirmed this view, notwithstanding earlier obiter dicta that land may not be a secondhand good in L R McLean v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211 (CA) and King v Bennetts (1994) 16 NZTC 11,370. However, when a specific interest in land, like a forestry right, is newly created, it is a unique mix of rights distinct from the original land over which it was created. Accordingly, the original creation of a forestry right cannot be a sale of secondhand goods. The forestry right is a new item of property. Before a forestry right can be a secondhand good, at least one prior owner must have made use of the right for its intrinsic purpose, L R McLean v CIR (CA), being some exercise of the rights conferred by the forestry right. A forestry right is a bundle of rights giving its owner the right to either: •establish, maintain and harvest; or •maintain and harvest, a crop of trees on that land. The forestry right will be considered a secondhand good so long as the prior owner has used the forestry right for its intrinsic purpose, namely has exercised some of the rights provided under that forestry right (for example the prior owner has established, maintained and/or harvested a crop of trees). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 87 Examples Example 1 Purchaser is a GST registered person who intends to enter the forestry industry in a small way. On 1 July 2000 she buys a forestry right from Supplier, who is not registered for GST. Supplier had bought the right 18 months earlier from a farmer who had decided not to diversify into forestry. Supplier had used the right on a small scale to remove a small amount of timber. The purchase price is $20,000 payable in four quarterly instalments. The first payment is made on 1 August 2000. Purchaser is entitled to a secondhand goods input tax deduction because the forestry right was disposed of by sale, the seller was unregistered (non- taxable supply), the forestry right was secondhand, and Purchaser acquired the right for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In Purchaser’s next GST return (for the two months ending 31 August 2000) she should deduct as input tax the tax fraction of the amount of the first instalment ($5,000). Accordingly, she may deduct $555.55. Example 2 The same facts as example 1 above, but neither the Supplier nor any other previous owner has harvested any trees but the Supplier has used the existing forestry right to plant a crop of trees on the land. Once again a secondhand goods credit would be available as the Supplier has used the forestry right for one of its intrinsic purposes, being the right to establish a crop of trees. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 88 NEW LEGISLATION FRINGE BENEFIT TAX – PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST ON LOW-INTEREST, EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest, employment-related loans has decreased from 7.95% to 7.69% for the quarter beginning 1 July 2001. The new rate was approved by means of an Order in Council signed on 27 August 2001 and applies from the quarter beginning 1 July 2001. The rate is reviewed regularly to ensure it is in line with the Reserve Bank’s survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from the quarter beginning 1 April 2001. Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2001 (2001/219) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 89 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. SHORTFALL PENALTIES IN RESPECT OF AGREED ADJUSTMENTS QB 2104 We have been asked whether shortfall penalties should be determined at the same time as an agreed adjustment and included on the agreed adjustment form. Background During an audit, Inland Revenue may identify discrepancies in respect of taxpayers’ returns, the effect of which will be an alteration to the amount of a taxpayer’s liability to tax as stated in the return. In most instances, both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue will come to an agreement as to what adjustments are to be made to the return, thus avoiding the necessity to enter the disputes process. As a result of this agreement, both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue sign an “agreed adjustment” form which lists the item and amounts that have been agreed upon as requiring adjustment. However, where the agreed adjustment will result in an increased tax liability for the taxpayer, the taxpayer may also incur shortfall penalties as provided for in section 141 Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Section 94A(3) TAA allows the Commissioner to make the shortfall penalty assessment either before or after unpaid tax has been assessed, or has become assessable or payable, or has been paid. The legislation does not prevent the Commissioner from assessing the shortfall penalty at the same time as the adjustments are being determined or finalised. Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 6, No 3 (August 1996), states (at page 16): One of the objectives of the new disputes resolution process is the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes. To be consistent with this objective, the Commissioner will raise the issue of penal tax or shortfall penalties as soon as is practicable, which in most cases will be at the same time the substantive issues are being discussed. Practice The Commissioner’s practice is to reach agreement with the taxpayer on any shortfall penalties at the same time as other tax adjustments and to include these shortfall penalties on the agreed adjustment form unless the taxpayer advises otherwise, or circumstances exist where it is inappropriate to do so, eg prosecution. Where the shortfall penalty is not included in an agreed adjustment, Inland Revenue will inform the taxpayer that shortfall penalties may still apply. This will allow the taxpayer to know “up front” his or her potential total liability at the time agreement is reached in respect of the adjustments. The Commissioner considers it is desirable, from the view of both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue, that there is a swift resolution to taxation matters in dispute. A swift resolution also provides certainty to the taxpayer that all matters have been dealt with. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 90 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. RELEASE OF INFORMATION – IR-SPS GNL 170 Introduction This standard practice statement provides guidelines for responding to requests for information made under the Official Information Act 1982 (Official Information Act) and the Privacy Act 1993 (Privacy Act). This statement also explains the relationship of these Acts with the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Tax Administration Act) and how the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act and Child Support Act 1991 (Child Support Act) will be applied. Application This Standard Practice Statement applies from 11 September 2001. Summary Requests for information can be made orally or in writing. Inland Revenue is required to make a decision on a request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case no later than 20 working days after the receipt of the request. Where Inland Revenue is unable to do so, it will write to the requester extending the timeframe. Charging for the provision of information is permissible under the Official Information Act where considerable departmental resources will be required to satisfy the request. All information held by Inland Revenue is “official information”. Requests by natural persons for information about themselves are governed by the Privacy Act. Under that Act, individuals have a right of access to information about themselves, subject only to the reasons for refusing access stipulated in the Act. All other requests for information are required to be determined under the Official Information Act. Part II of the Official Information Act covers requests for information, including personal information by natural persons about natural persons other than themselves. Part III of the Official Information Act covers requests for internal rules (section 22) or reasons for decisions (section 23). Part IV of the Official Information Act relates to requests by bodies corporate for information about themselves (section 24). Under the Official Information Act, there are different reasons for refusing information requests depending on whether Part II, Part III or Part IV applies. Neither the Privacy Act nor the Official Information Act restricts the effect of the secrecy obligations imposed on Inland Revenue staff by the Tax Administration Act. When a request is to be considered under the Tax Administration Act, Inland Revenue will consider the intent of the Official Information Act and/or the Privacy Act. For example, there are times when personal information about a requester would not be given to the requester: •once Inland Revenue has advised that a tax investigation is to commence and disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of the investigation; •when the information requested would disclose the identity of a person who has supplied information to Inland Revenue thereby breaching an obligation of confidentiality; •when the information requested would disclose particular targeting or investigation techniques and selection criteria which, if disclosed, would prejudice Inland Revenue’s ability to investigate in the future. In these cases a request may be refused as the release of this information would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the law. Legislation Official Information Act 1982 The purpose of the Official Information Act is to increase the availability of official information. Section 5 provides that information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 91 The reasons for refusal to supply official information are contained in sections 6, 7, 9 and 18 of the Official Information Act. For Inland Revenue, the following reasons to withhold information are particularly relevant. Section 6 Disclosure of the information requested would: •prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand; •prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government of New Zealand on a basis of confidence by an international organisation or another government or any agency of such Government; •prejudice the maintenance of the law including the prevention, investigation and detection of offences; •endanger the safety of any person; •damage seriously the economy of New Zealand by disclosing prematurely decisions to change or continue Government economic or financial policies relating to, inter alia, taxation. Section 9 Withholding of the information requested is necessary to: •protect the privacy of natural persons; •avoid unreasonable prejudice to the commercial position of the person who supplied or is the subject of the information; •protect information which is subject to an obligation of confidence, where disclosure would be likely to prejudice the supply of similar information, which supply is in the public interest; •avoid prejudice to the substantial economic interests of New Zealand; •maintain the constitutional conventions which protect, for example, collective and individual ministerial responsibility, the political neutrality of officials and the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers and officials; •maintain the effective conduct of public affairs through the free and frank expression of opinions by or between or to Ministers, or employees of any department in the course of their duty; •maintain legal professional privilege; •enable a Minister or any department to carry on, without prejudice or disadvantage, negotiation. The reasons for refusal contained in section 9 are subject to the public interest. They will not provide good reason to withhold information, where the withholding of that information is outweighed by other considerations which render it desirable, in the public interest, to make that information available. Section 18 The information requested may be withheld if: •the making available of the information requested would be contrary to the provisions of a specified enactment; •the information requested is or will soon be publicly available; •the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collection or research; •the information requested is not held by the department; •the request is frivolous or vexatious or that the information requested is trivial; Section 27 (Reasons for refusal of requests for personal information by bodies corporate) •disclosure would prejudice the interests protected by section 6(a) to (d), section 7 or section 9(2)(b); •disclosure would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another person or of a deceased person; •disclosure would breach legal professional privilege; •the request is frivolous or vexatious or the information requested is trivial. Section 52 of the Official Information Act states that the Official Information Act does not override a provision in another Act that imposes a prohibition or restriction in relation to the availability of information. Privacy Act 1993 The purpose of the Privacy Act 1993 is to promote and protect individual privacy. The Information Privacy Principles contained in section 6 set out the rules for the collection, use, access to and disclosure of information relating to individuals by public and private sector agencies. Inland Revenue is subject to those Information Privacy Principles. Principle 6 provides that where an agency holds personal information in a form that is readily retrievable, individuals are entitled to have access to information relating to them. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 92 An agency may refuse to disclose information requested in certain circumstances. Reasons for refusal to supply information are contained in sections 27, 28 and 29. The following reasons to withhold information are particularly relevant to Inland Revenue. Section 27 •disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial; •disclosure would endanger the safety of any individual; Section 29 •disclosure would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another individual or a deceased individual; •disclosure would breach legal professional privilege; •the request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information requested is trivial; •the information requested is not readily retrievable; •the information requested is not held by the department and the person responding to the request has no grounds for believing that the information is either held by another agency or connected more closely with the functions or activities of another agency. Section 7 of the Privacy Act states that Information Privacy Principles 6 and 11 do not override a provision in another Act that imposes a prohibition of restriction in relation to the availability of information. Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 81(1) requires all officers of Inland Revenue to maintain secrecy in respect of all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts. It also provides that officers of Inland Revenue shall not communicate any such matters to any person during or after their employment except “for the purpose of carrying into effect” the Inland Revenue Acts or the other Acts listed in this subsection. This exception is referred to as the general exception. Section 81(4) lists a number of specific instances where the Commissioner may disclose information. Under section 81(4)(l) the Commissioner may provide information to a person from whom or in relation to whom such information is held or was obtained. The information must be readily available and the Commissioner must consider it reasonable and practicable to release the information. Child Support Act 1991 Section 240 of the Child Support Act deals with secrecy of child support and other revenue matters. The Child Support Act is an Inland Revenue Act and as such, section 240 needs to be read in conjunction with the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act. Section 240(2) contains communications, which are deemed to be communications of matters made for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Child Support Act. Under certain circumstances communication of information is allowed to the police, the qualifying custodian, the recipient of spousal maintenance, the chief executive of the department for the time being responsible for the administration of the Social Security Act 1964 and the chief executive of the Department for Courts. Discussion Information held by Inland Revenue may be requested orally or in writing by any of the following: •a New Zealand citizen; •a permanent resident in New Zealand; •a person who is in New Zealand; •a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand; •a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand which has a place of business in New Zealand. The nature of the information being requested and the identity of the requester will determine the Act under which the request is to be considered. The request need not refer to the Act. If the request is made by or on behalf of a natural person for information about that person it will be considered under the Privacy Act. All other requests, including requests for information relating to another person or requests from bodies corporate for information about themselves, will be considered under the Official Information Act. The provisions in the Official Information Act and Privacy Act do not derogate from the secrecy provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act. If the Tax Administration Act precludes the disclosure, the reason for the refusal must be one of the reasons stipulated in sections 6, 7, 9, 18 or 27 of the Official Information Act or sections 27, 28 or 29 of the Privacy Act. The Tax Administration Act contains exceptions to the obligation of secrecy. In particular sections 81(1) and 81(4). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 93 Section 81(1) This exception provides for disclosure where this is considered necessary to carry into effect the Acts referred to in this section. This exception will apply whether it is officers of the department or third parties carrying into effect the Acts. The Court of Appeal in Knight v CIR \[1991\] 2 NZLR 30 has held that the carrying into effect of the Inland Revenue Acts must include their proper implementation or administration. It is not confined to the collection of revenue and therefore careful consideration, on a case by case basis, must be given to all duties and responsibilities of officers under the Inland Revenue Acts. Section 81 requires a restrictive approach by the Commissioner to releasing taxpayer information to other persons. In practice this will mean the stringent application of the secrecy provision when a request is made for information about another taxpayer’s affairs. Section 6 of the Tax Administration Act reinforces the right of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential. Section 81(4) This subsection lists a number of instances where the Commissioner may release information. Most importantly, under paragraph (l) the Commissioner is permitted to provide information in the Commissioner’s possession to a person from or on behalf of or in relation to whom that information is held or was obtained, provided that the person making the request is either the person concerned, their legal representative, or their agent authorised in writing (or authorised in such other manner as the Commissioner prescribes). Section 81(4)(l) also stipulates that the information must be readily available and that the Commissioner must consider it reasonable and practicable to release the information. If, in order to comply with the request, a substantial amount of work would be involved in locating, extracting and collating the requested information, it may be that the information is not readily available and can be refused in terms of section 18(c)( i) of the Official Information Act or s27(1)(c) of the Privacy Act. Pursuant to section 81(4)(l), information about a person will be released upon request to that person unless there are good reasons to withhold that information under either the Official Information Act (for bodies corporate) or the Privacy Act (for individuals). The facts and the surrounding circumstances of each case must be carefully considered. There are times when personal information would not be given to a taxpayer or an agent. These include the following examples: •once Inland Revenue has advised that a tax investigation is to commence and disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of the investigation; •when the information requested would disclose the identity of a person who has supplied information to Inland Revenue on the basis of confidentiality; •when the information requested would disclose particular targeting or investigation techniques and selection criteria which, if disclosed, would prejudice Inland Revenue’s ability to investigate in the future. In these cases a request may be refused in terms of section 27(1)(c) of the Privacy Act (for individuals) or section 27(1)(a) of the Official Information Act (for bodies corporate). Providing reasons for decisions and access to internal rules affecting decisions Sections 22 and 23 of the Official Information Act provide a right of access to internal rules affecting decisions and to reasons for decisions affecting a person in their personal capacity. Together these sections identify that where persons are affected in their personal capacity by a decision or recommendation of Inland Revenue, they are entitled to know about the applicable rules and policies. They are also entitled to receive adequate information about why the decision or recommendation came to be made. Compliance with these sections will promote the accountability of Inland Revenue by enabling decision-making processes to be more transparent and understandable to the people they affect. Where section 81 of the Tax Administration Act applies and secrecy is required, access to information can be refused under section 6(c) of the Official Information Act because disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law, namely the proper operation of section 81 of the Tax Administration Act. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 94 Standard Practice Receiving a request Requests can be received orally or in writing. However, it may be appropriate for Inland Revenue to ask the requester to submit their request in writing to reduce any opportunity for misunderstandings. Requests for official information are required to be “specified with due particularity”. This means that Inland Revenue must be able to identify the information being sought. If a request is so general in nature that it is impossible to identify the nature of the information sought, it is reasonable for Inland Revenue to ask the requester to be more specific. The fact that a request is for a large amount of information does not in itself mean that the request lacks due particularity. In respect of requests for all personal information held about the requester, it is reasonable for Inland Revenue to seek clarification as to whether the requester wishes to be supplied with copies of material that has already passed between the requester and Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is required to provide reasonable assistance to persons requesting information. Where the requested information is not held by Inland Revenue but believed to be held by another Government agency or Minister, Inland Revenue is required to transfer the request within 10 working days. Responding to the request In all cases information will be released upon request unless there are good reasons to withhold that information under either the Official Information Act or the Privacy Act. Timeframe Both the Official Information Act and the Privacy Act place an obligation on Inland Revenue to make a decision as to whether the information requested will be released as soon as practicable, and in any case within 20 working days after the day on which the request is received. Therefore, any request for the release of information will be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Extension of time Inland Revenue will write to the requester extending the timeframe if the request involves a large quantity of information and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of Inland Revenue or where consultation is necessary in order to make a decision on the request. If the requester is dissatisfied with the extension of time, they can seek a review by the Ombudsman or Privacy Commissioner. A response to a request made under the Official Information Act or Privacy Act will include: •a repeat of the original request; •a reference to the Act the request has been considered under; •Inland Revenue’s decision on the request; •the reason for refusal where Inland Revenue has refused the request in whole or in part; •the requester’s right to seek an investigation and review by the Ombudsmen, or Privacy Commissioner of the decision, or have the decision reviewed by a review officer who reports directly to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in case of a refusal. Charging The Official Information Act permits charging for the supply of official information. Inland Revenue will consider charging when considerable departmental resources will be required to satisfy the request. If Inland Revenue intends to charge for providing the information, an interim letter will be issued detailing the proposed charge and whether whole or part payment is required before the information will be released. In line with State Services Commission guidelines and practice by other government departments, Inland Revenue’s policy is not to impose charges on Members of Parliament and parliamentary research units. Inland Revenue will not charge a natural person for the supply of personal information about that person. Deletion of information from documents Where the information requested is contained in a document and there is good reason for withholding some of the information contained in that document, the other information in that document will be made available by making a copy of the document with the necessary deletions clearly identified in the document.

WHETHER TRUST’S PURPOSES WERE CHARITABLE Case:(Latimer & Ors for the) Crown Forestry Rental Trust v CIR Decision date:7 August 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Charitable status Summary O’Regan J found in favour of the Commissioner. Facts On 20 July 1989 the Crown, the New Zealand Maori Council, and the Federation of Maori Authorities Inc executed an agreement to provide for the terms and conditions upon which the Crown would sell existing tree crops on Crown forestry land to commercial purchasers together with a licence to use the land on an ongoing basis. The rent payable by each purchaser was to be put in a fund administered by a rental trust. The interest earned by the investment of the rent was to be made available to assist Maori making claims involving land before the Waitangi Tribunal. The Crown Forestry Rental Trust (“the Trust”) was established in 1989. Under clause 2.1 of its Trust Deed it is stated as being established to: (a)Receive the Rental Proceeds from the Licences; (b)Make the interest, earned from investment of those Rental Proceeds, available to assist Maori in the preparation, presentation and negotiation of claims before the Waitangi Tribunal which involve, or could involve, Licensed Land. Decision O’Regan J held that the Trust had two purposes, only one of which was charitable (assisting Maori claimants) so that it was not entitled to tax exemption under section 61(25). He accepted the Commissioner’s submission that the Trust’s stakeholder role of retaining and investing capital funds was different from the “receive and hold” obligation of other trusts, that therefore it was a purpose and not just an administrative power, that it was not a purpose ancillary only to its other purpose, and that it was non-charitable. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 96 SALE OF BUSINESS PACKAGES – WHETHER DISPUTANTS ENTITLED TO GST INPUT CREDIT ON SECONDHAND GOODS; WHETHER COMMISSIONER ESTOPPED FROM REASSESSMENT An investigating officer was assigned to review the case in late 1996, and after discussing several unrelated matters with ABC’s accountant, was alerted to the business package sales. A decision was made to expand the review to cover the GST input credit refund, and after further consideration the matter was referred to the Adjudication Unit which concluded that the input tax credit was not available and a reassessment was issued. The consideration paid by ABC was by way of credit to the shareholder-vendors’ current accounts. As part of the above review, the value of the business packages was also considered, and an expert valuation was undertaken. As a result of this valuation, it was determined that Mr A and Mr B were liable to tax on a deemed dividend under section 4(1)(a) and/or (d) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ITA), in respect of the amount by which the payment exceeded the value of the package supplied. Decision Legitimate Expectation Apart from the questions relating to the GST refund and the deemed dividend, there was also a dispute as to whether the Commissioner was in some way estopped from issuing his reassessment of the GST refund because ABC had a legitimate expectation that it could rely upon the earlier assessment allowing the refund. The Commissioner contended that ABC was prevented from raising that matter in argument because the question was not raised in ABC’s Statement of Position. Judge Willy noted that there was no express mention of the matter anywhere in ABC’s Statement of Position, and its only option then was to rely upon an inference which it sought to have drawn from a particular passage in an attachment to its Statement of Position. His Honour was satisfied that such an inference could not be drawn. He then went on to consider whether the Authority should exercise its jurisdiction under section 138G(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and allow ABC to argue the new material. This discretion is expressly limited by two cumulative requirements, and, after noting that the matter could easily have been raised in ABC’s Statement of Position had it exercised due diligence in preparing it, His Honour declined to allow the matters to be raised. Case:TRA Number 003/00, 016/00 and 017/00. Decision Number 007/01 Decision date:9 August 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Legitimate expectation; secondhand goods; deemed dividends Summary The Taxation Review Authority found for the Commissioner on the GST issue and for the disputants on the deemed dividend issue. Facts There are three disputants in this case—ABC Limited (“ABC”), Mr A, and Mr B. Both Mr A and Mr B are directors and shareholders of ABC. Mr A and Mr B wished to develop ideas through ABC. The ideas were a low cost housing scheme and a group and corporate travel scheme respectively. In order to safeguard against the proprietor of the idea leaving ABC and taking the idea to another entity, ABC’s accountant suggested that each of the shareholders enter formal agreements between themselves and ABC regarding their ideas. The object of the agreement was to make it clear, and legally binding, that ABC owned the intellectual property that it was setting out to develop, rather than the original proprietor. In connection with this, the “business packages” were sold by the vendor owners to ABC. The same basic contract was used with necessary modifications for each package; the basic contract drafting was done by Mr B. The low-cost housing package was sold for $750,000, and the group and corporate travel plan for $275,000. It was in respect of these sales that ABC made a second-hand goods GST input claim, based on the amount of the contract price. The Inland Revenue was invited to review the transactions, and an officer of the Department went to ABC’s premises. The transactions were approved, and the input claims allowed on 28 February 1996. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 97 Judge Willy did, however, go on to record his findings in respect of this issue, in case he was wrong in exercising his discretion that way. After traversing Counsels’ submissions on the point, along with the leading cases, His Honour observed that the Commissioner “cannot be precluded from carrying out his statutory function of correctly assessing the GST liability of a given taxpayer” and was accordingly satisfied on the facts that ABC’s arguments as to legitimate expectation and estoppel must fail. GST Input Claim In determining whether the packages sold to ABC were second-hand goods such as to give rise to an input credit, His Honour considered in some detail the term “second-hand goods”. It was accepted by Counsel for the Commissioner that the packages were not within any of the exceptions to the definition of second-hand goods, but beyond that recourse needed to be had to the ordinary meaning of the words. His Honour noted that the term was a composite one, of which both aspects must be satisfied by ABC. His Honour turned first to “goods”, and, after considering the definition in section 2 of the GST Act 1985 (“...all kinds of personal or real property...”), went on to consider the meaning of the word “property”. He accepted that the definition of property did not include “mere information, confidential or otherwise”. It was submitted for the Commissioner that, to the extent that the business packages comprised “information”, the supply of that information would not constitute the supply of property and thus would not be the supply of goods. After considering the entry in Garrow and Fentons Law of Personal Property in New Zealand, along with Salmond’s work on jurisprudence, Judge Willy concluded that: “both the content of the documents evidencing the two concepts and the rights to exploit the concepts themselves, are capable of being described as property and therefore satisfy the definition of what constitutes goods in section 2” His Honour distinguished FCT v United Aircraft Corporation to find that what was transferred in both instances was not merely knowledge, but the right to use the knowledge exclusively for the term of the agreement (for the low-cost housing scheme), as well as an obligation to provide physical assistance and copyright entitlements (for group and corporate travel). His Honour then went on to find that this property was not a chose in action but was “the right to physical possession of the bundle of rights contained in the contracts evidencing the transactions”. As regards whether the goods were second-hand, His Honour discussed various judgments on this point (including T28 and McLean v CIR) and concluded that in applying ordinary English usage it could not be said that the property was second-hand, “there being no evidence that the property ... was used in any way by either of the vendors prior to the sale to the company.” The issue was this disposed of in favour of the Commissioner. Deemed Dividends In the relevant part, section 4(1)(a) and (d) of the ITA states that the term “dividends”, in relation to any company and any payment made by the company to any person having regard to that person’s or any other person’s capacity as shareholder in that company, includes credits to a shareholder’s current account, and in respect of property acquired from a shareholder of the company, the extent to which consideration provided by the company exceeds the market value of the property. Judge Willy relied on previous observations made in Q49 and Q6 and held that the act of ABC in crediting the vendors with the amount of the purchase price constituted a payment to the shareholder-vendors. The next question which arose was whether those payments were made “having regard to that person’s or any other person’s capacity as shareholder in that company”. The test for this is contained in section 4(1)(a) of the ITA, which requires a disputed payment to be tested against similar payments made to persons unconnected with the company. Having already made findings of fact at some length relating to the bona fides of the transactions, and having held that the transactions were conducted truly at arm’s length, His Honour was satisfied that “an honest commercial evaluation was made of the value of each of the concepts to the company and therefore indirectly its contributors.” Judge Willy found it of some importance that the purchase price in each case differed significantly and was, therefore, “not satisfied that ... the transactions were on terms which were different from those which would have \[been\] obtained in the case of persons who were ‘neither shareholders in the company nor connected with shareholders in the company’.” The matter was disposed of in favour of Mr A and Mr B, and His Honour did not go on to consider the questions of market price or true value. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 98 WHETHER COMMISSIONER’S REASSESSMENT OF GST RETURN WAS PROCEDURALLY VALID His Honour noted that section 114 of the TAA, which states that the validity of an assessment shall not be affected by reason that any of the provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts have not been complied with, seemed to “cut the ground completely from under the Plaintiffs”. Putting that aside, he then went on to observe that the disputes procedures were somewhat flexible, and that failure to arrange a conference, for example, would not seem to be the sort of procedural error that would give rise to invalidity. The conference stage, although required under the procedures set out in a chart published in the Commissioner’s TIB, was not a statutory requirement. After considering a further example of this nature, His Honour observed that while there was some weight in the plaintiff’s complaint that proceeding straight to the assessment meant neither of the parties has clarified the facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law up to that point: “the decision not to follow the procedure was to protect the limitation point and it would seem that by agreement or in any event the Part IVA procedure could be revived and continue. Obviously it would need agreement on both sides but I do not see that as impossible in the circumstances.” Heron J also relied on Abbatis Properties Ltd, which he found supplied the key to this case—for the protection of time limitation an assessment may be issued notwithstanding that other dispute procedures are in place. In most cases the Commissioner would act in accordance with the dispute procedures, and assessing in the face of a time limitation “does not in a real sense prevent the taxpayer from getting a fair hearing or favourable decision”. As far as the legislative history to Part IVA was concerned, His Honour did not find anything in it to support disturbing the power of assessment conferred on the Commissioner, and noted that the reforms were “remedial in nature but not such as to challenge validity in my mind”. Case:PLM Software Limited v CIR Decision date:10 August 2001 Act:Judicature Amendment Act 1972 Keywords:Judicial Review Summary The Plaintiff was unsuccessful in its challenge to the Commissioner’s procedure. Facts The Plaintiff company filed a GST return for the period ending 30 April 1996. After reviewing the return, the Commissioner accepted that a GST refund was due and issued a cheque for the refund. On 30 January 1998 the Commissioner decided to review the return, and issued a NOPA in which he proposed to cancel the refund. On 29 February 2000 the Commissioner issued a second NOPA raising one further issue (sham), and on 28 April 2000 the plaintiff filed a response. Also on 28 April 2000 the Commissioner advised the taxpayer of his intention to reassess on five of the nine grounds contained in the February NOPA. The remaining four grounds, including sham, were abandoned. As the statute bar was to take effect from 1 May 2000, the challenged assessment was also issued. The Plaintiff sought judicial review, alleging that the Commissioner’s action in purporting to reassess the plaintiff for GST for this period was invalid for failure to comply with the statutory disputes procedure as provided by Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). In short, the Plaintiff’s case was that the Commissioner must, prior to making an assessment, have issued a NOPA, received a NOR, held a conference, issued a disclosure notice and SOP, and then referred the matter to adjudication. The Commissioner submitted that the only mandatory step under the legislation was to issue a NOPA, and that had been done. Decision In deciding the matter, Heron J felt that it should be approached “on a basis which does not confine itself to the words of the various sections which go to make up \[Part\] IVA, but as a matter of broad taxation principle”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 99 WHETHER THERE WAS SALE OF A GOING CONCERN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT; WHETHER COMMISSIONER ENTITLED TO AN EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FILING APPEAL Case:CIR v Fatac Limited (in Liquidation) Decision date:22 August 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Going concern; Extension of time; Proof of debt Summary The Commissioner was successful. Heron J found that there was a sale of a going concern but there was no written agreement for the purpose of section 11(1)(c)(ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Facts On 1 July 1996 the Disputant entered into an agreement for the sale of a property. The property was sold subject to a licence to a third party, evidenced by an agreement dated 30 April 1991, permitting it to operate a quarry on the land. The agreement was conditional upon the purchaser reaching an agreement with the third party over some of the quarrying conditions. Following settlement a new licence agreement was entered into. Both vendor and purchaser were registered for GST. The agreement provided that the purchase price was “inclusive of GST (if any)”. The words “plus GST (if any)” were deleted, and the agreement provided that only if both possibilities were deleted then “the purchase price includes GST (if any)”. The purchasers claimed a GST refund, which was accepted by the Commissioner, and the Commissioner then sought the disputant for output tax. The liquidator of the company disputed this assessment and the Taxation Review Authority found in the Disputants’ favour. The Taxation Review Authority found that the relevant taxable activity was quarrying and that the goods and services necessary for the continued operation of that activity had been supplied. The Authority also found that the agreement contained the required agreement in writing for the supply of a going concern. The Commissioner filed a Notice of Appeal. The appeal was filed by way of case stated. A subsequent judgment (CIR v Dick and Anor \[2000\] 19 NZTC 15,849) held that to be the wrong procedure for appeals. The Commissioner filed a fresh notice of appeal and an application to extend the time for filing the appeal. On the basis of the Taxation Review Authority’s decision the liquidator rejected the Commissioner’s proof of debt for the GST. The liquidators’ notice advising the Commissioner was not challenged until some months later. The Commissioner then applied for orders to review the liquidators’ decision and for an extension of time within which to make the application. Decision The relevant taxable activity was the licensing of land and not quarrying as found by the Taxation Review Authority. The licence between the vendor and the third party had not been transferred on settlement. Hansen J held that there was a licence and not a lease. Had a lease been assigned to the purchaser, the goods and services necessary for the continued operation of the taxable activity would have been supplied. It also has relevance to the issue of whether the parties agreed that there had been a supply of a going concern. Three things are required for the supply of a going concern: (i)There be a supply of the whole or part of a taxable activity which is capable of separate operation; and (ii)All goods and services necessary for the continued operation of the activity are supplied; and (iii)The supplier has carried on the activity up until time of transfer. It was held that all three requirements were satisfied. Hansen J stated that the cases confirm that the critical issue is not whether the purchaser carries on the activity transferred but whether it is capable of being carried on at the time of transfer. He held that there was a supply of the taxable activity and of the goods and services necessary for its continued operation. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001) 100 The agreement between the vendor and the purchaser made possible the continuation of the taxable activity. The fact it would be operated on somewhat different terms following settlement did not affect this position. Hansen J stated that the supplier and recipient must agree that the supply is of a going concern and this must be evidenced expressly. He held that the Taxation Review Authority was wrong to find that the vendor and purchaser had agreed in writing that there had been supply of a going concern. Accordingly, there was a sale of a going concern, namely the taxable activity of supplying land for the purpose of quarrying, but that it was not agreed by the parties for the purpose of section 11(1)(c)(ii). Justice Hansen held that there could be no real opposition to the application for an extension of time as there was no prejudice to the disputant caused by the delay and the merits of the appeal favoured the grant of the extension. It was stated that the Commissioner’s application for an order to review the liquidators’ decision to refuse his proof of debt for the GST was premature. Section 304(3) of the Companies Act 1993 provides that if a liquidator subsequently considers that a claim has been wrongly admitted or rejected in whole or in part, he may revoke or amend that decision. Accordingly the Commissioner can invite the liquidator to reconsider his decision to reject the claim in the light of the outcome of the substantive appeal. It was further held that there was a limit of time prescribed to make an application for an order to review and no rights to extend could be read into it.

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand currency
-------------------------------------------------------------

In TIB Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001), there was an item with exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the CFC and FIF rules for the 12 months ending March 2001.

The internet version of the TIB showed the correct conversion rates. However the paper copy contained an error in both the mid-month and end-of-month rates for 23 countries. In each case the numeral to the far right of the decimal point had been rounded down by a value of one as a result of a software conversion problem.

The corrected tables are republished in this month’s TIB.

Corrections
-----------

Product ruling BR Prd  01/17 - correction
-----------------------------------------

Two errors in statutory nomenclature have been identified in BR Prd 01/17. These errors are classified as “minor errors” under section 91 GI of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner is therefore not required to withdraw the ruling and issue a replacement ruling. The original ruling has been corrected.

In the sixth bullet point of “How the Taxation Laws Apply to the Arrangement”, the words “assessable income” should be read as a reference to “gross income”.

The paragraph, as corrected, reads:

*   Any distribution of category B income to category B unitholders is included within the definition of “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1, and is included in the gross income of the unitholder under section HH 3(1).

In the eighth bullet point of “How the Taxation Laws Apply to the Arrangement”, the words “ not assessable” should be read as a reference to “not gross income”.

The paragraph, as corrected, reads:

The amount paid to category B unitholders on the redemption of units is not gross income to the unitholders under section HH 3(5), to the extent that it does not include any “beneficiary income”.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/34 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Port of Tauranga Limited (POTL). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 2(1)(g), CF 3(1)(b), CF 3(14) and the relevant definitions in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is POTL’s proposed return to shareholders of surplus capital by way of an off-market pro rata whole share repurchase and cancellation in the ratio of one share for every eight shares at a repurchase price of $7.00 per share. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the following paragraphs. 1. POTL is a widely held company listed on the NZSE. Prior to this cancellation there are 76,482,512 fully paid ordinary shares on issue, conferring all the rights and powers attaching to shares under section 36(1) of the Companies Act 1993 and carrying full “shareholder decision- making rights” (as defined in section OB 1). POTL has only ever issued one class of share. All shares have been issued for cash or other consideration. 2. POTL’s shareholders as at 15 August 2001 were as follows: MEMBER NAME PRESENT PRESENT NO OF SHARES (M) (%) Quayside Securities Ltd 42.11 55.06 ANZ Nominees Ltd 15.30 20.01 Rotorua Energy 3.82 5.00 Charitable Trust QBE Insurance (Inter) Ltd 1.87 2.45 Citibank Nominees (NZ) Ltd 0.43 0.56 Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corp – A/c NZCSD 0.35 0.46 Lilian Valder 0.20 0.26 MFL Mutual Fund Ltd – 0.18 0.23 NZCSD Guardian Trust Investment 0.16 0.20 Nominees (RWT) Ltd Tea Custodian Ltd – NZ Mid 0.16 0.20 Cap Index Fund A/c – NZCSD Other 11.91 15.57 Total 76.48m 100.00% Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 5 3. Options over shares in POTL, that carry “shareholder decision-making rights” (as defined in section OB 1), have never been issued. 4. POTL was established under the Port Companies Act 1988 and an Establishment Plan approved by the then Minister of Transport, and commenced trading on 1 October 1988. POTL provides wharf facilities and associated services at Mt Maunganui and operates a container crane terminal at Sulphur Point, Tauranga. POTL has extended its port services by establishing an inland port facility in Auckland, “Metroport”. It has further extended its port related interests, entering into a joint venture agreement with Northland Port Corporation to establish a deep water port at Marsden Point. 5. Since 1988, POTL has been steadily increasing its revenue base and profitability. With development projects in place and after considering future growth opportunities, the directors have concluded that POTL is in a commercially under-geared position and has capital which is surplus to its current and ongoing requirements. 6. By resolution on 3 August 2001, a copy of which was provided to Inland Revenue with the ruling application, the Directors decided targets for debt to debt plus equity ratio, interest cover and dividends, and that a return of surplus capital of $67 million be made to shareholders by way of an off-market pro rata share repurchase in the ratio of 1 share for every 8 shares at a price of $7, subject to: (a) A binding ruling from the Inland Revenue Department that the distribution is tax free. (b) The approval of the High Court of New Zealand. (c) Shareholder approval. 7. On 7 August 2001 the Chairman announced to the NZSE and to the media the proposed share repurchase: RETURN OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS Directors have announced that the Company ntends to return to shareholders, on a pro rata basis, surplus capital of $67 million and to cancel, in the process, one in every eight shares held. The return of capital is subject to receiving a favourable binding ruling from the Inland Revenue Department confirming that it will be tax free, and High Court approval of the arrangement. The Chairman, Mr Fraser McKenzie said today that the purpose of the capital reduction is to optimise the financial structure of the Company and to thereby maximise the return on funds employed in the business. Mr McKenzie said that after careful analysis the Directors had decided that returning surplus capital now was in the best interests of all shareholders and would allow the Company to improve its return on shareholder’s equity for the future. Mr McKenzie confirmed that the Company’s dividend distribution policy would remain the same after the capital reduction. The Company will be applying to the High Court for approval to return $67 million to shareholders by the cancellation of one in every eight shares held by each shareholder in the Company, and the payment to that shareholder of $7.00 for each share cancelled. This will give rise to the cancellation of approximately 9.6 million shares leaving approximately 66.9 million shares on issue at the completion of the transaction. Port of Tauranga Limited have targeted to complete this process including shareholder confirmation as quickly as possible dependent upon the favourable outcome of the binding ruling process. 8. Shareholders were notified directly by way of letter dated 16 August 2001: Dear Shareholders RETURN OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS On 7 August 2001, your Directors announced that the Company would be seeking the approval of the High Court of New Zealand to return to shareholders, on a pro rata basis, surplus capital of $67 million and to cancel, in the process, one in every eight shares held. The return of capital is subject to a favourable binding ruling from the Inland Revenue Department confirming that it will not be a taxable dividend. Shareholder approval will be sought at the earliest available opportunity. You will all recall that in my report for the year ended 30 June 1998 we highlighted the matter of a balance sheet restructuring. Since that date the Company has seen container numbers grow threefold and an increase in reported profit of 82%. Additionally we have acquired a fleet of 12 straddle carriers, established New Zealand’s first fully integrated inland port - METROPORT AUCKLAND, doubled the capacity of our on wharf cool storage capacity, invested in sophisticated information technology and commenced a 50% joint venture construction of a deepwater commercial port at Marsden Point. Despite the growth Directors have determined this capital to be surplus to the Company’s current and future capital requirements. In this way, we will be able to optimise the financial structure of the Company and to maximise the return on funds employed in our business. The Company’s dividend distribution policy will remain the same after the capital reduction. 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 01 (January 2002) Subject to High Court approval, the return of $67 million capital to shareholders will involve: • the cancellation of one in every eight shares held by each shareholder in the Company; and • the payment to each shareholder of $7.00 for each share cancelled. The process will lead to the cancellation of approximately 9.6 million shares. Approximately 66.9 million shares will remain on issue at the end of the transaction. ... 9. POTL will return capital under a Court approved arrangement under section 236 of the Companies Act 1993. This Court approved arrangement will be binding on all parties, including POTL and the shareholders. The share acquisition will not occur on a stock exchange. 10. The substantive purpose of the repurchase and cancellation is the regearing of POTL, with the replacement of equity with debt. POTL directors have acted consistently with advice provided by two major financial institutions that POTL was undergeared, and to recommendations on the optimal capital structure of POTL. 11. As far back as 1997, the Directors signalled the need to review the capital structure of the company. The chairman advised shareholders that: Shareholders funds now represent a healthy 66.7 percent of total assets, a figure which is at the upper end of the range deemed to be appropriate by the Directors. In the year to 30 June 1998, the Board will be considering several business initiatives likely to warrant major capital expenditure. At present, the company is in a strong position to finance these through borrowings. If, however, the proposed capital investment projects fail to satisfy our investment criteria, the Directors will review the company’s, proprietorship ratio in a fresh light... 12. In 1999 an asset revaluation raised the ratio of shareholder funds to total equity to 76.6%. This revaluation was undertaken for the reasons set out below expressed by the Chairman in the Annual Report: It has been ten years since the Company was formed, and the book value of its net assets was established. The Directors recently decided that it was timely to undertake an asset revaluation to ensure the level of investment in the Port was more accurately recorded. As a result the net asset backing per share has increased from $1.49 per share pre revaluation to $3.52 per share. 13. In the month of August 2001, the lowest traded price for POTL shares was $7.00 and the highest traded price was $7.25. The market value of all the 76,457,712 shares during this period was between $535.2m and $554.3m. The repurchase of 9,557,214 shares at a price of $7.00 provides a total repurchase amount of $66.9m. In the month of August 2001, this amount represented 12.5% of the market value of all POTL shares at their lowest traded price, and 12.1% at their highest traded price. 14. The total number of shares issued by POTL both before and at the close of 1 July 1994 was 76,219,712 and the total number of shares on issue prior to this cancellation is 76,482,512. The total amount of paid up capital on the shares before 1 July 1994 was $76,219,712. The total “qualifying share premium” (as defined by section OB 1) paid to POTL before 1 July 1994 was $41,815 not including any amounts that were later applied to pay up capital on shares in POTL. 15. POTL has never made a bonus issue. 16. No amounts have previously been distributed by POTL on the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares. 17. POTL has advised that the amount of “available subscribed capital” (under section OB 1) has been calculated using the statutory formula a + b – c with the following values: a $76,261,527 b $1,017,592 c $530,000 The amount of “available subscribed capital” using these values is $76,749,119 ($76,261,527 + $1,017,592 - $530,000). All relevant amounts of available subscribed capital have been paid up (other than by way of bonus issues). 18. The total number of shares prior to this cancellation is 76,482,512. The number of shares to be cancelled, on a 1 for 8 basis, is 9,560,314. The amount of “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” (under section OB 1) is $8.03 ($76,749,119/9,560,314). The amount to be distributed per share is $7.00. 19. The repurchase is to be funded by POTL’s existing bankers with POTL issuing commercial paper after obtaining Standard & Poors rating. 20. The 2001 financial year results show the debt to debt plus equity ratio is 22.71%. The return of $67m of surplus capital is forecast to result in a ratio of 45.11% in the 2002 financial year. 21. The company’s dividend distribution policy will remain the same after the capital reduction. Actual ordinary dividends over the last five years have been 68.84%, 85.23%, 75.96%, 85.52% and 81.9%. In addition, special dividends Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 7 were paid in 1999 and 2000. Total dividend distributions in the period 1996 to 2001 exceeded total net profit after tax. 22. Group retained earnings stated in the statutory accounts in the period 1998 to 2001 were: 1998 $37.189m 1999 $26.268m 2000 $16.890m 2001 $32.340m 23. In 2001, with profit after tax of $22.412m, the return on equity was 8.4%, and the earnings per share 29.31 cents per share. In 2002, with forecast profit after tax of $20.768m, the return on equity is forecast at 9%, and the earnings per share 31.04 cents per share. In 2006, the forecasts are 10.6% and 33.27 cents per share. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) No “market value circumstance” (as defined in section OB 1) exists in POTL at the time of repurchase and cancellation. b) There were no special circumstances that mean that the last NZSE traded price for POTL shares at the time POTL first notified shareholders of the proposed relevant cancellation is not a fair reflection of the market value of POTL shares at that time. c) The cancellation of shares does not affect the current or future application of POTL’s dividend policy. d) At the time of the repurchase, POTL does not anticipate issuing any shares or raising any share capital subsequent to the cancellation. e) The “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” (under section OB 1) is not less than $7.00. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The proposed share cancellation is a “ten percent capital reduction” as defined in section CF 3(14). • The proposed share cancellation is excluded from the definition of “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the date of signing until 30 June 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20th day of November 2001.

The student loan scheme interest write-off threshold, which sets the level of income that part-time or part-year students may have and still be entitled to a full interest write-off, will increase from its current level of $25,073 to $25,378 for the 2002–03 income year. The student loan scheme repayment and interest write-off thresholds are based on the amount of the domestic purposes benefit payable to a person with two or more children. The repayment threshold is aligned to the gross amount of the benefit, rounded up so that it is divisible into whole dollars on a weekly basis, and the interest write-off threshold is aligned to the amount of other income at which the benefit is fully abated. These thresholds are reviewed annually in December each year and are set on the basis of the amount that it is projected will be payable from 1 April of the following year.

WHETHER SUPPLY OF A GOING CONCERN TO A REGISTERED PERSON WAS ZERO RATED Case: CIR v Capital Enterprises Limited Decision date: 18 December 2001 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Going concern, zero rating, time of supply, agency, nomination, novation Summary The Commissioner’s appeal was upheld by the High Court. Facts A property in Wellington was sold to a property developer while subject to an existing tenancy. The vendor would accept no less than $2.85 million net of GST and the purchaser would pay no more than $2.5m. The parties finally signed an agreement for sale and purchase (ASAP) for $2.80m stating the contract to be “GST inclusive if any” and “subject to existing tenancy”. The purchaser was said to be “\[a named individual\] or nominee”. The purchaser set up a company, CASD, which would act as a holding company in order to pass it on to a development company and claim an input credit on the second supply. CASD was formed after the ASAP was signed and the deposit was paid by a cheque from CASD’s account. The purchaser, still not having made a nomination, applied to the IRD for a binding ruling on the proposed transaction. The ruling considered that the transaction was caught by section 76 of the GST Act. The purchaser applied for a second ruling on a varied transaction where the named individual, who was not registered for GST, took the property in his own name before transferring it to his development company and claiming an input credit. This transaction was approved by Adjudication and Rulings on the facts submitted and the settlement proceeded on that basis. The Commissioner assessed the Plaintiff for output tax on the sale to the named individual, the basis being that although the supply may have been of a going concern, the purchaser was not a registered person. The Plaintiff contended that the purchaser was in fact CASD (who took the property from the named individual a few days later). The Taxation Review Authority concluded that the transaction was the sale of a going concern and that the disputant knew that at all times the purchaser was acting on behalf of a registered person. This, notwithstanding that no nomination was ever made and the property passed in fact to the named individual. Willy J also found that the purchaser deliberately misled the vendor as to his intention to take the property in his own name. The Taxation Review Authority decision was appealed by the Commissioner. Decision Durie J first considered the general approach taken by the Authority, that is, an excessively wide review of the factual background in order to determine the real justice of the case. He concurred with the Commissioner’s submissions: “The decision is peppered with observations on the respondent’s subjective and unilateral perceptions. Such an approach to the facts, unless it can be strictly justified ..., threatens the reliance of persons, whether parties to the contract or not, on that which has been formally recorded as representing the parties’ agreement. ... The Commissioner must place primary reliance on the core documents, ... and only to such other material as may be put in in the Disputes process as evidencing consensual change or consequential steps.” Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 13 The first sub-issue was then whether a taxable supply could exist independent of contract. The respondent had submitted that section 9 of the GST Act set the deemed time of supply and at that point (in this case, the payment of the deposit by CASD) CASD was deemed by the section to be the recipient irrespective of the form of the contract. Durie J rejected this argument stating that section 9 does no more than set the time and does not assist in the identification of the recipient. Also, the Act does not supplant common law but merely imposes tax on transactions which are essentially contractual. The second sub-issue was whether CASD was substituted by consent as the purchaser/recipient. This argument imported further issues of nomination. His Honour held that no nomination had in fact occurred; the term “or nominee” merely giving the purchaser the right to so nominate if he wished. It was held to be immaterial that the named individual may have had an obligation to nominate a GST registered company, but the actual transfer which the parties effected, and the terms of the contract (“inclusive of GST if any”) were determinative. Next His Honour considered the main point of the whole dispute: whether Mr Stewart received the supply as agent for CASD? Durie J overturned the Authority’s finding of fact in this respect. He held that the particular facts relied upon by the Authority to support that conclusion were not obvious, and that all the evidence showed was that the purchaser was merely keeping his contractual options open. In the end he decided to take title himself, an act inconsistent with the fiduciary nature of an agency relationship. See LC Fowler & Sons Ltd v St Stephens Board of Governors \[1991\] 3 NZLR 304 at 306. The Authority, during the hearing, raised the possibility that section 183 of the Companies Act 1993 might apply; that there was a pre-incorporation contract. On the admitted facts Willy J had found that such was contemplated by the purchaser and that payment of the deposit by CASD was ratification. In the High Court His Honour held that this fell far short of a pre-incorporation contract as such evidence was merely the testimony of the director of the respondent company. “The Judge mat have had other evidence in mind but on this appeal \[counsel for the respondent\] was unable to point to it.” In conclusion His Honour said: “I consider the Judge erred in the conclusions that he reached as a result of his overall approach which effectively determined issues as between the respondent and \[the named individual\] and which coloured the determination of the question whether the supply was in fact to \[him\] or CASD. CLAIMS DISALLOWED BECAUSE OF LACK OF EVIDENCE Case: TRA Number 97/021. Decision Number 11/2001 Decision date: 6 December 2001 Act: Income Tax Act 1976, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Undeclared income, disallowed deductions Summary The objector was unsuccessful in his objection to the Commissioner’s assessments. Facts This case concerned assessments of the objector’s income for the financial years 1989 to 1992 (inclusive) in terms of undeclared income, expenditure which was disallowed deductibility, consequential GST assessments, and failure to withhold tax on certain commissions paid by the objector. The grounds of assessment were that the objector had failed to return income required to be returned pursuant to section 65(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, and that the objector was not entitled to certain deductions claimed because they were private in character (section106(1)(j)), or non-business related expenditure (section 104), or not evidenced as required (section 106E). The objector was, at material times, a consultant and provider of accountancy services, and a partner in a partnership operating as a security firm. During the 1989 and 1990 income tax years he was also a type of commission agent for health insurance and life insurance companies, and referred to his frequent overseas travel at material times as: “related to his business activities including raising off-shore finance, making enquiries into forestry markets and franchises and chemical purchases, and to most of his claimed deductions relating to those activities.” Throughout the hearing Barber J gave various adjournments for the objector to attend at various professional offices to obtain documentary evidence, which he said was available to support his case, but no such material was ever obtained. Accordingly, a decision was issued. 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 01 (January 2002) CHALLENGE TO ASSESSMENT OUTSIDE RESPONSE PERIOD – REVIEW OF TEST Case: CIR v Fuji Xerox Ltd Decision date: 13 December 2001 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 138D Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords: Response period, leave to proceed with challenge. Summary The Commissioner was successful in his appeal against the High Court judgment. Facts The Commissioner undertook an audit of the tax affairs of the taxpayer. The tax audit began in the middle of 1998. The tax audit at first concerned Fuji Xerox’s income tax affairs, but later was expanded to include GST matters as well. KPMG is the taxpayer’s nominated tax agent in respect of income tax matters and all correspondence in relation to the tax audit (both in respect of income tax matters and GST matters) has been conducted by KPMG on behalf of the taxpayer. However, KPMG is not the taxpayer’s nominated tax agent in respect of GST matters, and so the authorised address in the Department’s computer system of the for GST assessments in relation to the taxpayer is the taxpayer’s own address rather than that of KPMG. There was considerable correspondence between Inland Revenue and KPMG in relation to the tax audit. A letter dated 28 May 1999 from Inland Revenue was sent to the taxpayer itself and copied to KPMG but the subsequent correspondence was between KPMG on behalf of the taxpayer and Inland Revenue. The last letter is important because it indicates that Notices of Assessment will be issued. The letter is addressed to KPMG (not to the taxpayer care of KPMG), refers to recent discussions, attaches a Statement of Amendment and contains the statement “Notices will be issued in due course”—without saying to whom the Notices will be issued. It then continues: “As you are aware, to protect your client’s objection rights, certain actions must be taken by you within two months of the Notice. Full details are contained on the back of the Notice.” Decision There were only two witnesses—the objector and the audit investigator for the Commissioner. After hearing both witnesses, His Honour commented that: “I could not assess the objector as a credible witness. I record that I have had 20 years experience at endeavouring to assess the truthfulness of taxpayers and I made my assessment, as to the lack of credibility of the objector, after considering his evidence overall and in context of the total evidential fabric of the case, and also taking into account his manner, demeanour, and body language when giving evidence.” After considering the evidence for the Commissioner in some detail, His Honour noted that, in his view, “\[the investigator\] has gone to great pains to assist the case of the objector taxpayer in every possible way but, to a substantial degree, could not alter the assessments due to lack of information from the objector.” His Honour then turned to the evidence of the objector and outlined further background that emerged from it. While a firm submission of the objector was that his expenditure, claimed as deductible, was spent in the course of one of his income-earning processes, in terms of evidence the objector added, “I can’t say more than that.” “After a while in cross-examination, he seemed to be admitting that invoices and the like needed to support his claims were not available, and he said ‘I accept that they are not there ... I cannot take further’ proving that particular items of expenditure were business related. “Also in cross-examination, Ms Grills took the objector through many of the financial items in dispute, but the objector could offer no supporting evidence of his various claims. He frequently, and quite candidly, said ‘I can’t provide evidence to support my claim’.” Despite the objector’s assertions that there was sufficient evidence available to support his claims, the objector agreed with Barber J that, “many aspects of his case could be regarded as somewhat bizarre and that a common thread is an absence of records, and that there is, generally, only the existence of the objector’s word about the various issues.” Accordingly, there being a lack of credible evidence from or on behalf of the objector, the objections failed and a total adjusted assessment figure was confirmed. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 15 Decision The Court of Appeal, in a decision delivered by Anderson J, found for the Commissioner on the basis of straightforward statutory interpretation. The Court considered that O’Regan J had erred in a number of respects: • In following the Milburn and Treasury Technology decisions, the High Court erred in requiring the “event or circumstance” in section 138D to be, in itself “exceptional”. The term “exceptional circumstance” has its own statutory meaning. • Such analysis thus confused the issue of the taxpayer’s expectations (which may go to justification) with whether the event was beyond the control of the taxpayer. • The Judge did not in fact give specific reasons for finding sufficient or any justification. • The term “agent” in section 138D(2) does not mean “tax agent” as defined in section 3. It is a general term which includes employees of the taxpayer. The Court identified the “event” as the sending of the assessments by the Commissioner to the taxpayer directly, against the background of the correspondence with KPMG. These circumstances were entirely within the taxpayer’s control and provided no justification for the lack of response: “In our view there is no basis whatever for criticising the Commissioner for sending the notices of assessment to the relevant address for GST purposes. That act was not in any sense causative of the Respondent’s default. The real and effective cause of that default lay in the systemic and human failures of the Respondent itself.” The Court added that it did not find it necessary to analyse the different approaches of the Milburn and Treasury Technology cases, other than noting that the requirement to find an “exceptional circumstance” (rather than an “event or circumstance”) was an “unnecessary additional gloss”. It is noteworthy that this warning refers to action being taken by “you” (ie KPMG, not the taxpayer). In fact the formal assessments referred to in the letter of 5 December were issued on 6 December 2000 (with one exception which was issued on 18 December 2000). Because the taxpayer’s address was the one which was contained in Inland Revenue’s computer system the Notices of Assessment were sent to the address of the taxpayer and not to KPMG. Fuji’s chief accountant gave evidence that he was informed by members of his staff that Notices of Assessment had been received, but that he had no reason to expect any correspondence from Inland Revenue concerning the investigation and so he did not discuss the nature of them with his accounts staff. However, payment of the assessments was made because the taxpayer’s policy was to pay all amounts due to Inland Revenue on time to avoid interest and penalties. Meanwhile, the person responsible for the taxpayer’s affairs at KPMG also expected that the assessments would be sent to KPMG. He had previously worked at Inland Revenue and his evidence was that he was not sure when the assessments would arrive and that his experience was that they could sometimes arrive some time after the advice that an assessment was about to be issued. However, he became concerned when no assessments had arrived by early February and rang the responsible officer at Inland Revenue on 7 February 2001. He was told that the assessments should have been issued, but no details were provided. He did however enquire with Fuji’s chief accountant whether he was aware of any Notices of Assessment being received and he, without checking, said he was not aware that they had been received by the taxpayer and that he expected they would be sent to KPMG. It was only some time later it was discovered that the Notices of Assessment received by Fuji’s accounts staff back in December 2000 had in fact been the Notices of Assessment to which the letter to KPMG of 5 December 2000 referred. By then the response period had expired and Fuji took these proceedings seeking leave under section 138D of the Tax Administration Act, to commence a challenge out of the response period. The High Court gave the plaintiff leave to proceed with a challenge to the Commissioner’s assessment, which was appealed by the Commissioner. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 01 (January 2002) Further it was held that section 27 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908 provides that an antecedent debt or liability constitutes valuable consideration for a bill of exchange. If the notice or request, as the case may be, had not been received by the accountant by 10 February then clearly there was valuable consideration for the cheque. The CIR was therefore obliged to honour the cheque. In a third and final judgment the Master considered Sea Hunter’s claim for interest pursuant to section 57(a)(ii) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908 at 11% per annum from 27 February 1998. The Master considered that if a cheque had not been issued and if the Department had simply failed to make payment, then the interest due to Sea Hunter would be fixed in accordance with the Tax Administration Act. There had not been any evidence put before him about the appropriate commercial rate and so the Master could not see any justification for departing from the rate prescribed in that Act. The Master therefore entered judgment for interest as at 23 May 2001 in the sum of $414,780.66 and stated that the judgment debt itself would carry interest from that date until satisfied pursuant to rule 538 of the High Court Rules. Decision Justice Blanchard delivered the decision of the Court. Firstly, the Court dismissed Sea Hunter’s application to cross-appeal out of time against the interest judgment regarding the appropriate interest rate that should have been applied by Master Faire. The Court then dealt with the substantial appeal holding that they are not persuaded that the Master took the wrong view of section 46. The Court accepted that the CIR is not precluded from commencing an investigation and making a request for information after the expiry of the 15 working days period. However, Parliament has deliberately chosen a short period for the CIR to make up his mind whether he needs further information or wishes to investigate the circumstances of the return. If he does not do so in due time, although he is not precluded from taking the matter further, he must, in the meantime, promptly make the claimed refund. It is the Court’s view that under section 46(4) a request is not given by the CIR until it actually reaches the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s agent or is deemed to have been received within section 14(2) (notices sent by post section). The CIR can therefore not be taken to have given a request for information by posting to the taxpayer a request that did not reach the taxpayer until after the 15th working day and would not have been delivered in the normal course of post within that period. SUMMARY JUDGEMENT Case: CIR v Sea Hunter Fisheries Ltd Decision date: 13 December 2001 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary The Commissioner’s appeal was allowed to the extent of setting aside the summary judgment in the sum of $2,510,414.82. There will instead be judgment for Sea Hunter in the sum of $1,247,925. Facts Sea Hunter Fisheries Ltd (”Sea Hunter”) is a company that carries on business as a fishing vessel owner. Sea Hunter claimed an input tax credit under section 21(5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in respect of the fishing vessel. The claim was made in a GST return received by the CIR on 19 January 1998. It was for the period ended 31 May 1997. The return sought a GST input tax credit of $2,495,850. The senior investigator handling the matter determined that more information needed to be sought from Sea Hunter before a credit adjustment or refund could be considered. As a result an account halt was activated on 3 February 1998. The account halt was due to expire on 18 February 1998. On 18 February 1998 the account halt expired. A refund cheque was issued to Sea Hunter. The investigator became aware that the GST credit adjustment claim had been released notwithstanding an incomplete review of the matter. The investigator tried unsuccessfully to access the Department’s computer system due to the power cuts in the Auckland region at the time and hence a stop payment request was issued through the banking system. Accordingly, on 27 February Sea Hunter banked the cheque. However, on 5 March 1998 Sea Hunter’s bank account was debited as a result of the stop payment request. On 8 September 2000 Sea Hunter issued proceedings in the High Court claiming judgment for the amount of the cheque plus interest at the Judicature Act rate of 11% per annum from 27 February 1998. It sought summary judgment. The CIR sought the striking out of the proceedings. On 2 May 2001 the Commissioner issued an assessment denying the input tax claim to Sea Hunter. The High Court held that in order to invoke the provisions of section 46, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of his intention to invoke the section, and the taxpayer must receive that advice within 15 working days of the submission of the return. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 17 As of 2 July 2001, two months after the assessment was issued, the Commissioner became entitled to offset against his liability on the cheque, the amount due for non-deferrable tax that was due from Sea Hunter. On the interest point the Court found the matter too difficult to decide. Their Honours were clear, however, that it is not appropriate where there is a statutory regime for the fixing of an interest rate that a different rate should apply after a judgment has been given. The Court decided that all other questions of liability of interest on either side should be deferred until the result of the challenge to the assessment is known. WHETHER SALE OF VESSEL ATTRACTED GST – JUDICIAL REVIEW Case: Simunovich Fisheries Ltd v CIR and Owen Joseph Knock Decision date: 10 December 2001 Act: Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Judicial review Summary The taxpayer’s appeal was partially successful Facts In June 1995 Simunovich Fisheries Ltd (“Simunovich”) purchased a fishing vessel (Longva III subsequently renamed Kermadec). Simunovich claimed the purchase price of the vessel as an input tax credit for the GST period ending 31 July 1995. In December 1997 Simunovich sold the vessel. For the GST period ending 31 January 1998 the Plaintiff claimed that the vessel was subject to GST at a 0% rate. On 10 August 1999 the Commissioner issued Simunovich with a NOPA for the 31 January 1998 GST period. The NOPA proposed that the sale proceeds of the vessel should, so far as the 31 January 1998 taxable period was concerned, attract GST. The NOPA asserted that the transaction attracted GST because the vessel’s acquisition by the Plaintiff in January 1995 was the supply of a secondhand good by an entity which was not registered for GST. That assertion was contrary to the stance previously adopted by the Commissioner for the 31 July 1995 GST taxable period in respect of which the last Notice of Assessment issued (6 November 1995) allowed the purchase price of the vessel as an input tax credit, ie as a taxable supply. The High Court found for the Commissioner on all issues. Decision Richardson P delivered the judgment of the Court. The Court found that there was ample evidence that the Commissioner had actually assessed Simunovich on the basis of the purchase being a taxable supply and that this assessment has never been reversed. This being the case the Court held that it was not open for the Commissioner to make an amended assessment in respect of the sale of the Kermadec, as proposed, in the NOPA, on a basis inconsistent with the current amended assessment in respect of its purchase, ie, unless and until the Commissioner lawfully alters the basis of the 1995 assessment, he cannot amend the assessment for the 31 January 1998 period. Their Honours held that in making the amended assessment in November 1995 the Commissioner fixed the vessel with the taxable supply GST classification. Unless removed or changed it became the basis for calculating GST on sale. On first principles, if an asset is given a character for a particular purpose, it must retain that character unless and until it is lawfully changed. Further: “It would be inconsistent to have the same asset of the same taxpayer taxed on sale as having a different character from its characterisation in respect of its purchase. For the Commissioner to disregard a basis inconsistency of that kind would undermine the integrity of the tax system which he has a duty under s6 of the 1994 Act to use his best endeavours to protect.” Therefore, in order for the Commissioner to be able to assess the output tax on the sale of the Kermadec in the 31 January 1998 period at the 12.5% rate, the vessel must have had the GST character of secondhand goods in respect of the input tax on the purchase. Their Honours state that this is plain from para (c) of the definition of input tax and para (d) of the proviso to section 11(1). In this case the Commissioner wants to change the characterisation he gave to the vessel for GST in respect of its purchase by Simunovich. According to their Honours the only way the Commissioner can lawfully do this is by altering the basis of the November 1995 assessment. Their Honours went on to state that the principles that they are discussing are reflected in section 29 of the GST Act. Contrary to the Commissioner’s submissions, Their Honours held that section 29 binds the Commissioner to the grounds of his assessment so that he cannot make a later assessment for another period that is inconsistent with it without first legally changing the first assessment. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 01 (January 2002) Their Honours stressed that this is an unusual and exceptional case because of the linkage proviso in section 11(1), ie linking the treatment of the purchase of the vessel to the treatment of the sale of the same vessel, and that it is this linkage that has given rise to the procedural difficulty the Commissioner faces. Their Honours stated that certainly in normal circumstances the issue of a NOPA could not be challenged on the ground that the notified proposed adjustment was wrong. Having found that the Commissioner must first alter the 1995 assessment before he can alter the 1998 assessment, Their Honours declined to issue a declaration of invalidity for the NOPA. Their Honours in fact went on to state that the Commissioner may be able to issue another NOPA and may be able to revisit the 1995 assessment. They also declined to issue a decision on the section 108A time bar issue stating that if and when the Commissioner purports to alter the 1995 assessment, etc, those decisions may be susceptible to challenge and the implications for the time bar will require further consideration at some point. On the legitimate expectation issue, Their Honours dismissed the taxpayer’s application stating that, if legitimate expectation is available on the law, then it must fail on the facts. Simunovich must have been aware that, when it obtained the refund, the Commissioner was still investigating the matter and the possibility that the matter could be revisited remained open. Any possible application of the time bar was still nearly two years away when Simunovich sold the vessel. Further, the Commissioner was not even told of the proposed sale of the vessel. JUDICIAL REVIEW Case: Ronald George Lawton v CIR Decision date: 19 December 2001 Act: Judicature Amendment Act 1972 Keywords: Judicial review Summary The taxpayer was unsuccessful in his judicial review of the Commissioner’s refusal to allow a late objection or reassess on an amended return. Facts The taxpayer bought and sold shares in the period 1986 to 1992. This was on a large scale. In so doing he made gains in two years but losses in others. The losses outweighed the gains substantially. He returned neither the gains nor the losses in his original returns, but in 1993, having become aware of another case, he filed amended returns and objected to the assessment to his 1993 return. His 1993 year objection was allowed, but the earlier years were treated as late objections and rejected as such. The late objection decision was reconsidered and confirmed several times in the period 1994 to 1997. The taxpayer commenced the case in 2001. Decision The reassessment provisions did not provide a separate avenue for the taxpayer, outside the late objection provisions. They are discretionary in nature and cannot be elevated to the point of statutory duty as contended by the taxpayer. Such obligation as there may be to ensure correctness in the quantification of tax liability is not an absolute value. The only statutory means available to a taxpayer to oblige the Commissioner to issue an amended assessment is by the statutory objection procedure under Part III Income Tax Act 1976 (as then was—now, of course, Part VIII or Part IVA/Part VIIIA Tax Administration Act 1994). “If the Commissioner were obliged to re-assess under section 23 whenever a request was made, the whole process of objection under section 30 within a defined limit would be circumvented. That cannot have been the statutory intention.” The Commissioner was entitled to treat the amended returns as applications for late objection. Implicitly, the judgment holds that the Commissioner has an obligation to consider exercising the discretionary power to reassess, but it appears that His Honour considers that that obligation was discharged as part of the consideration of the late objection. His Honour found as a matter of fact that the Commissioner did give consideration to both section 23 and section 30 when making the decision not to allow a late objection. The scope for legitimate expectation in taxation matters is doubtful and of limited application—that follows from the scheme and purpose of income tax legislation. In any event, the taxpayer’s argument that he had a legitimate expectation that the Commissioner would reassess failed on the facts. There could be no general expectation that the Commissioner will in all or even most cases permit the re-opening of transactions after the limitation period. Although the Commissioner had considered the taxpayer was entitled to a deduction, the obligation to ensure the correctness of the decision was not absolute. The merits of the claim and the need to ensure correctness of the tax liability were Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 19 fully canvassed by the Commissioner. The decision- maker carefully considered the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. There is no impediment to the department adopting policies or guidelines (such as existed for the late objection procedure) so long as the policies or guidelines: • are not inconsistent with statute • permit consideration of the individual case, and • allow for exceptions to the policy. In the facts of this case the Commissioner did not take irrelevant considerations into account in reaching the decision not to allow a late objection to be made, nor did he act unreasonably. The natural justice case also failed on its facts. There was no evidence that the taxpayer was denied the opportunity to make representations on the Inland Revenue conclusions. The Commissioner had gone to substantial lengths to consider the taxpayer’s case on several occasions from 1994 to 1997. Then there was a delay of almost four years before judicial review proceedings were issued. While, as above, there was no basis for a successful judicial review, had there been any basis for review there would have been powerful arguments to support the Commissioner’s contention that relief should be declined. 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 01 (January 2002) FEBRUARY 2002 5 Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due GST return and payment due (for 30/11/01) 7 2001 end-of-year income tax due For people and organisations with a March balance date and who do not have an agent 20 Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 28 GST return and payment due MARCH 2002 5 Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due GST return and payment due (for 30/11/01) 7 Provisional tax instalments due For people and organisations with a March balance date 20 Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 28 GST return and payment due DUE DATES REMINDER REGULAR FEATURES Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 01 (January 2002) 21 Name Address Draft standard practice statement Comment deadline ED0025: Voluntary disclosures 28 February 2002 Items are not generally available once the comment deadline has passed Affix Stamp Here No envelope needed—simply fold, tape shut, stamp and post.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 3 4 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/01 Note: Product ruling BR Prd 01/30 was withdrawn on 24 January 2002 to allow for a replacement ruling to be issued taking account of the change of trustee from BNZ Investments Limited to TOWER Superannuation Limited. The replacement ruling, BR Prd 02/01, is set out below. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Limited as Administration Manager of the BNZ International Equity Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections HH 3(5) and the section OB 1 definitions of “qualifying trust” and “superannuation fund”. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the BNZ International Equity Index Fund (“the Fund”) pursuant to the Trust Deed of the Fund, dated 21 May 1997, as replaced in an amended form by the Trust Deed, dated 1 July 2001 and as amended by the Deed of Amendment dated 21 December 2001 (“the Trust Deed”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Fund invests in equity securities that correspond to the composition of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (“MSCI”), modified such that the securities invested in will be of those countries specified in Part A of Schedule 3 to the Act (“grey-list countries”) that each comprise 1% or more of the MSCI (“the BNZ Index”). The Fund has been designed to enable investors to obtain, through one security, the same financial results that can be obtained through the direct investment in the securities of those companies that make up the BNZ Index. 2. The Trustee of the Fund initially was BNZ Investment Management Limited but is now TOWER Trust Superannuation Limited, (“the Trustee”). 3. The Administration Manager of the Fund is BNZ Investment Management Limited (the “Administration Manager”). The Investment Manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (“the Investment Manager”). 4. The Sponsor of the Fund is the Bank of New Zealand. 5. The Fund is a wholesale superannuation fund into which other wholesale and retail superannuation funds invest. The Fund was established for the purpose of being a wholesale investment vehicle for retail superannuation funds, other wholesale superannuation funds Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 5 and for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. There is no minimum investment amount. 6. The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. 7. The Trust Deed states that: “The investment policy of the Fund will be: (a) to invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool) in accordance with Schedule 2 to this Deed only in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the modified grey list components of the World Index; and (b) to invest the Cash Pool in restricted investments, being deposits with banks, and futures contracts.” 8. The Fund buys and sells shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond to the BNZ Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, the Trust Deed states: “The Fund and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Index Company securities.” 9. The Applicant has confirmed that all material aspects of the previous rulings (Prv 97/125, Prv 01/11, Prv 01/65, Prd 97/38 and Prd 01/30), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. 10. The only amendments to the Trust Deed are those contained in the Deeds dated 1 July 2001 and 21 December 2001. There has not been any material change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. Date of adjustments 11. The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: • If a security is outside its BNZ Index weight by the lesser of: – 0.5% of the total Fund, whether positive or negative, or – three times the BNZ Index weight of the individual security, and • When the periodic (currently quarterly) adjustments are made to the MSCI, and • If there are any MSCI market-driven changes or corporate actions such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any index company in the BNZ Index. 12. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within five business days. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 13. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Trustee will only dispose of securities (other than cash pool investments) if: • the Fund is wound up • there is a change in the BNZ Index and composition of the securities of the Fund no longer tracks the BNZ Index (whether as a result of a change to the countries included or a change to the securities included) • there is a compulsory acquisition of one of the Fund’s securities or a security is acquired on a compulsory acqusition that does not track the BNZ Index • there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by members • there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be otherwise satisfied, or • the fund is rebalanced in accordance with the first bullet point in paragraph 11 above. Rights issues 14. In the event of any rights issue by an Index company, the Investment Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities (if the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the BNZ Index). 15. Notwithstanding paragraph 14, if the securities that are the subject of the entitlement are over- represented, the Investment Manager will sell the entitlement and reinvest the proceeds in the Index companies to track the BNZ Index. 16. If the Investment Manager does not know whether the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index, the Investment Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index companies to track the BNZ Index. Mergers, takeovers and share buy-backs 17. The BNZ Index may be adjusted from time-to-time because of mergers, takeovers, share buy-backs, distributions of capital, cash issues and substitutions of companies in the BNZ Index. 18. In the event of a merger or takeover of a BNZ Index company, the Investment Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible (but in any event within five business days) to the time the BNZ Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless, as a consequence of not accepting the offer, the Fund would track the BNZ Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) 19. The Investment Manager will not participate in a share buy-back by a BNZ Index company. Hedging 20. There is no specific provision in the Trust Deed that allows the Fund to hedge foreign exchange risks. 21. The Fund will not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund being held in non-New Zealand currencies. Borrowing 22. Clause 10.1(c) of the Trust provides: ...The Trustee may: borrow money for the purpose of the Fund upon terms and conditions agreed by the Sponsor and the Trustee and charge all or part of the assets of the Fund with repayment and payment of interest on the moneys so borrowed; 23. However, the Fund will not in fact borrow, although involuntary borrowing may occur if there is a settlement mismatch between the purchase and sale of securities. Cash investments held by the Fund 24. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Trustee and the Investment Manager may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Trustee and the Investment Manager is on call. Wherever possible, futures contracts will be entered into by the Investment Manager to cover cash held by the Investment Manager. This is known as “equitised cash”. 25. The Investment Manager or the Trustee will hold cash in the following circumstances: • following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the BNZ Index or in the course of a compulsory acquisition, pending the reinvestment of that cash • following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution • following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a member • when a dividend is paid to the Fund in respect of an investment in a security • to accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the BNZ Index (“the minimum investment level”). The Investment Manager has advised that this amount is presently approximately $NZ5 million, and will increase to $US3 million as at 31 May 2002 (to take account of changes to the MSCI described in the MSCI Announcement, dated 10 December 2000). The minimum investment level may also increase (or reduce) in the future to the extent that a different amount is required to purchase the equivalent representation of securities on the BNZ Index. 26. The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to 10 business days preceding an MSCI structural change or for up to three business days following a significant new investment • for up to three business days after an MSCI structural change • for up to 10 business days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. 27. In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Trustee may hold up to NZ$2 million in cash. This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to 10 business days if there are withdrawals pending in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request, or • for up to three business days if the excess results from a significant new investment. 28. At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Trustee, and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) of 5% of the total Fund (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 29. The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 30. The following futures contracts are used: Country Contract Australia SPI200 Canada S&P/TSE60 Japan Nikkei 225 Germany DAX United Kingdom FTSE100 United States S&P500 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 7 31. In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the BNZ Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such an alternative contract or contracts. Dividends 32. The Investment Manager will receive the dividend (and other income) distributions from the securities in which funds are invested and will hold these as part of the cash pool, subject to the terms of paragraph 25 above. 33. The Investment Manager will not elect to participate in any dividend reinvestment plan. Foreign currencies 34. The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or sell the foreign currencies necessary to invest in BNZ Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within two business days. Suspension of subscriptions and withdrawals 35. Clause 18.7 of the Trust Deed enables the Fund to suspend the payment of benefits relating to withdrawal requests. The Fund has not previously suspended withdrawals. The Fund also has the power under clause 3.2 of the Trust Deed to refuse any application for membership without giving reasons. The Fund has never exercised this power. 36. The Fund will only suspend withdrawals or subscriptions in the following exceptional circumstances: • if the volume of withdrawals is too large to be processed, or • if the volume of withdrawals exceeds the immediately available funds, or • trading on the relevant equity markets has been suspended. 37. Any suspension will only be for three business days, unless the exceptional circumstance giving rise to the need to suspend is beyond the control of the Trustee and Investment Manager, in which case the suspension will only be for such period as is strictly necessary for the Trustee and/or the Investment Manager to recover from that event. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) If the Fund is resettled, this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. b) The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment by superannuation funds which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons or, (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. c) The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. d) All investors in the Fund who are not natural persons are registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. e) The existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR Prv 01/114) remains in force and continues to apply in all respects to the Arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The Fund is a “superannuation fund” as that term is defined in section OB 1. • The Fund is a “qualifying trust” as that term is defined in section OB 1. • Investors are not assessable to income tax on withdrawals from the Fund, by virtue of section HH 3(5). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 24 January 2002 to 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24th day of January 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) LIVESTOCK VALUES – 2002 NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has released a determination, reproduced below, setting the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 2001/2002 income year. These costs are used by livestock owners as part of the calculation of the value of livestock on hand at the end of the income year, where they have adopted the national standard cost (NSC) scheme to value any class of livestock. Farmers using the scheme apply the one-year NSC to stock bred on the farm each year, and add the rising two-year NSC to the value of their opening young stock available to come through into the mature inventory group at year-end. Livestock purchases are also factored into the valuation of the immature and mature groupings at year-end, so as to arrive at a valuation reflecting the enterprise’s own balance of farm-bred and externally purchased animals. NSCs are developed from the national average costs of production for each type of livestock farming based on independent survey data. Only direct costs of breeding and rearing rising one- and two-year livestock are taken into account. These exclude all costs of owning (leasing) and operating the farm business, overheads, costs of operating non-livestock enterprises (such as cropping) and costs associated with producing and harvesting livestock dual products (wool, fibre, milk and velvet). The NSCs calculated for the year ending 31 March 2002 have increased quite significantly for sheep, beef and dairy cattle. Total expenditure on these farm types increased substantially in the survey years on which the NSCs are based. These increases are mainly a result of improved farm incomes permitting additional expenditure, plus some cost inflation as a result of the depreciated New Zealand dollar, and on-farm responses to seasonal conditions such as drought resulting in higher feed costs. While much of this expenditure increase is aimed at producing more of the dual products (particularly milk), and is consequently excluded from the NSCs calculated, some of the increases in costs flow to the higher average cost of producing livestock. One-off movements in expenditure items are effectively smoothed within the mature inventory grouping, by the averaging of that year’s intake value with the carried forward values of the surviving livestock in that grouping. For the farm-bred component of the immature inventory group, the NSC values will appropriately reflect changes in the costs of producing those livestock in that particular year. The NSC scheme is only one option under the current livestock valuation regime. The other options are market value, the herd scheme and the self-assessed cost (SAC) option. SAC is calculated on the same basis as the NSC but uses a farmer’s own costs rather than the national average costs. LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 9 NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK DETERMINATION 2002 This determination may be cited as “The National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock Determination 2002”. This determination is made in terms of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994. It shall apply to any specified livestock on hand at the end of the 2001/2002 income year, where the taxpayer has elected to value that livestock under the national standard cost scheme for that income year. For the purposes of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994, the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 2001/2002 income year are set out in the following table. Kind of livestock Category of livestock National standard cost $ Sheep Rising 1 year 19.00 Rising 2 year 12.20 Dairy cattle Purchased bobby calves 164.00 Rising 1 year 569.00 Rising 2 year 98.40 Beef cattle Rising 1 year 179.00 Rising 2 year 103.00 Rising 3 year male non-breeding cattle 103.00 (all breeds) Deer Rising 1 year 59.50 Rising 2 year 29.80 Goats (meat and fibre) Rising 1 year 14.50 Rising 2 year 9.80 Goats (dairy) Rising 1 year 91.60 Rising 2 year 15.20 Pigs Weaners to 10 weeks of age 79.60 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age 63.20 This determination is signed by me on the 23rd day of January 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) Fundamental to the effective progression of a case in dispute is a commitment by the parties involved to work through the process in a constructive manner and to a reasonable timeline. This SPS sets out the steps the Commissioner will follow when a case enters the disputes resolution process. This includes both statutory requirements and administrative practices. While the emphasis of the disputes resolution process is to obtain agreement, the SPS covers all the stages of the disputes resolution process that could be involved in any one dispute to establish the timelines and procedures that Inland Revenue staff will follow. Discussion Timelines for completing the disputes resolution process Each case in dispute will have a different set of circumstances and features. Nevertheless, there is practical value in establishing timelines for completing the steps in the disputes resolution process. The suggested timeline outlined below should form the basis of discussing and agreeing timelines for a specific case in dispute. As a yardstick, a simple case in dispute can take up to 16 months from the time a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) is issued until the assessment is issued. The following diagram is indicative of the timeline for a simple dispute initiated by the Commissioner. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENT These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. TIMELINESS IN RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES – IR-SPS INV-170 Introduction This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) establishes administrative practices and timelines that will assist in the timely progression of cases in dispute. Application This SPS shall apply from 1 March 2002 to all cases in dispute. Summary The disputes resolution process aims to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes. Taxpayers have a right to have their dispute go through the whole disputes resolution process. When it becomes evident that a case is likely to proceed to dispute, a timeline should be negotiated between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer involved to ensure timely and efficient progression of the case. While both Inland Revenue staff and taxpayers should endeavour to meet the agreed timelines, if it becomes apparent the negotiated timeline cannot be achieved, this will be discussed with the taxpayer with a view to agreeing a new time line. Negotiating timelines for the timely resolution of disputes is an administrative practice encouraged by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Failure to negotiate an agreed timeline or adhere to the agreed timeline will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes resolution process. Background In 1996, the disputes resolution process was introduced to ensure the effective and efficient resolution of tax disputes. The process requires the issues and evidence to be considered by the Commissioner and the disputant before proceedings commence in a court. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 11 Assessment issued Addendum to CIR SOP Conference stage 2 month response period Disclosure notice/ CIR SOP Taxpaye rs SOP Taxpaye r to seek agreement to prov ide additional inform ation (perhaps 1 month) Possibl e Addendum T/p SOP NOPA issued Taxpaye r NOR issued One month preparation time is included allowing for the Adjudication 1 Adjudication 2 month response period 2 month response period for taxpaye r to issue NOR 1 month for CIR to review 3 months on av erage 1 Allow 5 months (includes preparation time to forward file to adjudication ) Factors that may influence the agreed timelines While it is expected that the agreed timelines established between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer will closely follow the timelines suggested above, there may be aspects of the particular disputed case that could have a bearing on the timely progression of that case. These aspects are commented on below. • Information on which to form opinions and make fact-based decisions Critical to the timely and satisfactory progression of a case in dispute is the Commissioner’s need to have all the information and facts necessary on which to form opinions and make fact-based decisions. Any delay in providing information will inevitably impact on the timely progression of the case. Where circumstances warrant, the Commissioner will take assertive action to seek information required. The actions will include use of the information requisition powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The prime objective remains to effectively resolve the dispute by way of agreement or move to formal proceedings in a timely manner. • The conference phase The conference phase is an administrative practice designed to identify and clarify facts or issues, and to attempt to resolve those facts or issues in dispute. The time suggested for the conference phase is an average of three months. The time will vary according to the facts of the specific case. 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) The conference is an important part of the overall disputes resolution process. The Commissioner’s intention is to encourage open and full communication. Conferences provide Inland Revenue and taxpayers with an opportunity to precisely identify the facts and issues causing the dispute. Effective dialogue between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer increases the prospect of a productive outcome. For example, dialogue may identify common ground, inconsistencies, erroneous arguments or alternative agreements. The parties to the dispute should carefully assess the significance of conducting a conference. In brief, taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff should perceive the conference phase as an effective option to progressing or resolving the dispute. The clarity of each party’s position in respect to the matters in dispute, the level of cooperation and the nature of the communications to date would be factors taken into account in determining whether or not to conduct a conference or determining how long the conference phase should be. The decision to either conduct or waive a conference should be by mutual agreement. The timelines involved in completing the next step in the agreed process would be expected to be an important outcome from the overall discussions. • Time-bar waivers Timelines for investigations and resultant dispute proceedings will take account of the time bar reopening limitations set out in sections 107A, 108, and 108A of the TAA. If the original timeline established for progressing a dispute has not been met, it is still important to ensure, as far as practicable, that the case follows the full course of the disputes resolution process, and in particular, to have the case adjudicated by the Adjudication Unit. If a case is likely to be time-barred, the taxpayer will be contacted and asked to waive the time bar under section 108B of the TAA. Exercise of the time-bar waiver will allow further opportunities for the disputed case to be resolved before issue of the assessment notice, including by way of an independent review by the Adjudication Unit. In the event that the request to waive the time bar is declined by the taxpayer, the Commissioner will consider the options available to progress the case towards finality. Standard Practice Upon receipt or issue of a NOPA, unless already negotiated, the Inland Revenue officer involved will contact the taxpayer to negotiate a timeline for progression and finalisation of the dispute. Negotiation of the timeline will take into account the following statutory and administrative timeframes. Where a NOPA is issued by the Commissioner Issue of a NOPA When the Commissioner issues a NOPA, the taxpayer or agent will be contacted within 10 working days of the date of issue of the NOPA to ensure that the NOPA has been received. Within two weeks of the expiry of the response period for the NOPA, the taxpayer or agent will be contacted with a view to ascertaining if the NOPA is to be responded to. Consideration of taxpayer’s Notice of Response (NOR) Within one month of receipt of the taxpayer’s NOR, the Inland Revenue officer involved will advise the taxpayer or agent whether the NOR is accepted, rejected in full or in part, or requires further work to be done before a decision can be made. Where the NOR is accepted in full, all “closure” actions on the case (such as issuing the notice of assessment) should be completed within one month of the issue of advice of acceptance of the NOR. If further work is required to be carried out before a decision to accept or reject a NOR can be made, the Inland Revenue officer will regularly update the taxpayer or taxpayer’s agent on the progress of further analysis or enquiry work being undertaken. The conference phase The time suggested for the conference phase is an average of three months commencing one month after receipt of the NOR. This time is intended to cover any analysis required as well as organising and conducting a conference. The time may well vary according to the specific facts of the case. If by the end of this phase, the dispute has not been resolved, or if by mutual agreement no conference is held, a Disclosure Notice will be issued together with the Commissioner’s Statement of Position (SOP). Taxpayer’s response The taxpayer must file their SOP within the statutory response period for the Disclosure Notice, that is two months. This time may be extended by application to the High Court. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 13 Additional information by the Commissioner Within two weeks of receipt of the taxpayer’s SOP, the taxpayer will be advised whether or not the Commissioner proposes to provide additional information by way of Addendum to the SOP. Additional information by taxpayer Where the Commissioner has agreed to accept additional information from the taxpayer, the timeline above suggests one month for agreement to be reached and information provided. File preparation and adjudication Where agreement cannot be reached, the disputed case should proceed to adjudication. Before the case is forwarded to the Adjudication Unit, the Inland Revenue officer involved will send to the taxpayer a copy of the Adjudication cover sheet. The cover sheet includes a list of the evidence being sent to Adjudication with the file. The taxpayer should respond within 10 working days, advising whether they want any other material already disclosed and not listed on the cover sheet to be included in the file. The file will be sent to Adjudication within 12 working days of the taxpayer being sent the cover sheet. Where the NOPA is issued by the taxpayer The processes and steps involved in progressing the dispute towards settlement or formal proceedings when a taxpayer has issued a NOPA are generally the same as those outlined above. Establishing agreed timelines to assist in the timely progression of a case, where the taxpayer has initiated the dispute proceedings, is as important as where the Commissioner has initiated the disputes resolution process. When discussing timelines for resolving taxpayer initiated disputes, three key differences from a Commissioner-initiated dispute will be taken into account: • Within two weeks of the expiry of the response period for the NOPA, the taxpayer will be contacted and advised whether the Commissioner intends to respond to the NOPA by issuing a NOR. At this stage, the Inland Revenue officer involved will initiate timeline negotiations with the taxpayer. • The Commissioner will initiate the conference stage within one month of receipt of the notice of rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR. • An additional two months must be added to the timeline to recognise the fact that the Commissioner’s SOP does not accompany the Disclosure Notice, but is issued within two months of the date of issue of the taxpayer’s SOP. Inability to meet negotiated timelines While both Inland Revenue staff and taxpayers should endeavour to meet the agreed timelines, if it becomes apparent the negotiated timeline cannot be achieved this will be discussed with the taxpayer with a view to agreeing to a new timeline. Negotiating timelines for the timely resolution of disputes is an administrative practice encouraged by the Commissioner. Failure to negotiate an agreed timeline or adhere to the agreed timeline will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes resolution process.

We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER ASSESSMENT WAS INVALID Case: TRA Number 93/26 and 93/27 Decision Number 001/2002 Decision date: 15 January 2002 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Assessment, Notice of Assessment Summary The Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) found that the assessments were valid and correct. If need be Taxation Review Authority would exercise its own power to raise assessments to cure any procedural defects in Commissioner’s assessments Facts This was a final hearing of a case which was first reported as Case T49 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,335. In that decision the TRA held that what it perceived to be defects in the notice of assessment to the taxpayers rendered the assessment invalid. The Commissioner successfully appealed Case T49 to the High Court, and the Court of Appeal upheld the Commissioner’s argument: see CIR v Hyslop (2000) 19 NZTC 15,560 and Hyslop v CIR \[2001\] 2 NZLR 329; (2001) 20 NZTC 17,031. As a result the remaining issues were remitted back to be dealt with by the TRA. The case was similar to Case M7 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,046 \[also reported as Case 84 (1990) 14 TRNZ 21; TRA No 88/9; Dec No 89/107\] (Judge Bathgate) except that M7 dealt with the 1982 to 1984 financial years (inclusive) of the objectors and Case T49 deals with 1985 to 1989 inclusive. The essential tax issue was whether the husband and wife objectors successfully split some income among their children consequential to measures taken in about September 1982 to gift capital to their children. The remaining issues involved the correctness of the assessments, whether the assessments had validity, whether the taxpayers could challenge their validity in any event and whether the Taxation Review Authority could cure any invalidity. Decision Barber DCJ adopted the Commissioner’s submissions on all points. He held that the taxpayers could not pursue a validity argument as they had not put validity in issue in their notice of objection and that there was no res judicata from the T49 decision. The investigator had satisfied the requirements for a valid assessment and had applied the law as he understood it to be to the facts as he understood them to be, and this amounted to independent and adequate enough judgment for the purposes of a valid assessment. It was made in good faith and was not arbitrary. In any event, any procedural defects in the Commissioner’s assessments (on the basis of the above, there were none) have been cured by hearings before the TRA and so it was appropriate for the TRA to in effect ratify the Commissioner’s assessments by raising its own assessments under section 32(1)( b) Income Tax Act 1976 (now s138P(1)(b) Tax Administration Act 1994). The assessments were held to be correct for the same reasons as set out in Case M7. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 15 SALE OF LAND – BUSINESS OR PRIVATE USE? Case: TRA Number 038/00 Decision Number 005/2002 Decision date: 5 February 2002 Act: Goods and Service Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Taxable activity, course or furtherance, sale of land, private use Summary This decision is an interim decision. The disputant was successful in the output tax argument, but the assessments will not be amended until relevant input tax claims are clawed back. Parties are to confer or apply for directions. Facts The disputant company owned land at a beach resort in a popular holiday destination, which it held in its own name as an undivided lot since purchase in 1972. Over time smaller lots were divided off and sold, the original 52-odd hectares becoming 23-odd by 1986 when the disputant registered for GST. The disputant thereafter provided GST returns that included claims for input credits for all expenditure relating to the whole land and two businesses run by non-registered subsidiaries of the disputant. The disputant provided part of the land free of charge to one of the subsidiaries, a residential educational business. The disputant experienced financial difficulties in 1991 and was encouraged by its bankers to survey and subdivide the property to provide the bank a better security. The disputant was threatened with a mortgagee sale of the entire property if a sale or subdivision did not occur. The mortgagee sale was averted by the sale of other property and the disputant refinanced the property (now in six subdivided titles), with a different bank. In July 1996 the disputant sold two lots and part of a third to a local property developer for $900,000 “...inclusive of GST, if any.” As the result of an audit, the Commissioner issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”), contending that the land was sold in the course or furtherance of the disputant’s taxable activity. The disputant in response claimed that the land it had disposed of had no physical business use and only marginal private use. It acknowledged that a small part of the land had been used by a subsidiary contracting business for storage and made a small GST payment in respect of that portion in 2000. Decision His Honour Barber DCJ held that the land in question was employed not as part of a taxable activity, but as a private asset that was mixed with business assets by way of a “streamlined” accounting system, which combined all three legal entities (the disputant and its two subsidiaries). He so found on the evidence of Mrs G, the disputant’s director and operator of the education centre. In so doing, he placed less weight on the Commissioner’s evidence, which rested mainly on the disputant’s GST and general accounting treatment of the land and the businesses conducted thereon. In particular, the Commissioner submitted that the business could not have continued unless the subdivided land had been used as security for refinancing. His Honour rejected this argument, preferring to look at the physical use of the land first and finding that it was “... not brought into the disputant’s taxable activity.” Having so found, Judge Barber went on to say that, as the disputant had claimed all inputs for GST purposes (including the costs of survey, subdivision and valuation), “...it was understandable that \[the Commissioner\] considered that in 1986 all the disputant’s land was introduced into the disputant’s taxable activity. However, the land now in issue was private residential/ recreational land and so not part of any taxable activity and such inputs should not have been allowed in respect of it. ... in terms of s21 of the Act, there may need to be an apportionment between the taxable and non-taxable supplies made where a portion of a total landholding is private and not part of a taxable activity. ... the disputant should not have been claiming every outgoing in respect of the land in issue as a GST input, nor claiming such as a deduction for income tax purposes.” His Honour formally held that the sale of the land in question was not in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. However, he declined to revoke the GST assessments until there is a review of the GST inputs and income tax deductions claimed by the disputant in accordance with the evidence given. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) PENAL TAX Case: TRA Number 97/041 Decision Number 003/2002 Decision date: 17 January 2002 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Penal tax Summary The Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) upheld the Commissioner’s assessments and penal tax assessments. However, in light of some deductions conceded by the Commissioner since assessment, a new statement of overall position was required. Facts The objector was an accountant who filed false returns both on his own account and for clients. He claimed refunds for his clients and himself, and banked all the proceeds himself. He served 24 months’ periodic detention as a result of criminal charges arising out of this behaviour. The Commissioner assessed him by reversing the refunds claimed, assessing income tax on (undeclared) interest derived from the refunds and charging penal tax on the overpayment. The Commissioner had originally also assessed the objector for income tax on the refunds received by him as a result of the false returns for his clients, but after the Court of Appeal decision in “A Taxpayer” v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,350 it became clear that this was not taxable income. However, by that stage the case was filed in the TRA and the adjustment had to wait until resolution of the other matters. Decision Barber DCJ made some adverse credibility findings against the objector saying that any allegation of hatred by Inland Revenue staff against the taxpayer was preposterous. He held that the penal tax assessments were made by experienced Inland Revenue officers, who were acting properly, intelligently and in good faith. The allegations of improper purpose were somewhat beside the point, because the Authority has the power to assess de novo and any defects will be cured at that point. His Honour found for the Commissioner on the interest adjustment. The account was the objector’s and he derived the income. The objector was not being charged tax or penal tax on the amounts he had embezzled from clients, but he was being assessed with respect to interest that he gained from using those embezzled funds. The TRA was satisfied that the objector had evaded tax by claiming donation rebates in the 1993 and 1994 years under a false name and false IRD number, when he had already claimed donation rebates under his own name up to the maximum and had refused to produce any receipts to substantiate the claims. His Honour also held that the quantum of penal tax was justifiable, saying that “the objector had been blatantly dishonest, furtive and deliberate... unrepentant... the offending was extensive...breach of position of trust...no cooperation” and that the objector continued with his accountancy activities after he knew of the Inland Revenue investigation. The objector has caused the general body of taxpayers (the State), and Inland Revenue inordinate expense in a series of unmeritorious appeals and hearings in various jurisdictions. DECISION ON PUBLIC INTEREST IMMUNITY AND MAIL TO POST OFFICE BOXES Case: EC Hieber & Hieber Family Trust & Fleming Investments v CIR; London Continental Limited v CIR Decision date: 31 January 2002 Act: Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords: Discovery, Public Interest Immunity, section 14 TAA, mail to post boxes Summary This was one of the preliminary hearings to address various orders sought by parties (discovery, consolidation of the actions, legal privilege claims and submitting original documents to forensic examination). This judgment deals with Public Interest Immunity from discovery and the Master’s conclusions on section 14 Tax Administration Act 1994. Facts The plaintiffs had challenged income tax assessments arising from evasion involving offshore funding. The plaintiffs had sought discovery of the identity of the informant or informants that had alerted the Commissioner to the evasion. The Commissioner resisted this, relying upon the grounds of Public Interest Immunity from disclosing that information. In turn, the Commissioner sought to limit the plaintiff’s ability to bring evidence, as notices under Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 2 (February 2002) 17 section 21 TAA 1994 (dealing with information requests relating to offshore payments) had been issued. These were send to the plaintiffs’ accountants at their post office box number. The plaintiffs argued that this was not notice to the plaintiffs under section 14 TAA, which provides: “14 Giving of notices 14(1) \[Communication of notices\] Any notice required by this Act or any other Act to be given by the Commissioner to any person may be— (a) Given to the person personally; or (b) Sent to the person by post addressed to the person at the person’s usual or last known place of abode or business; or (c) Given personally to any other person authorised to act on behalf of the person; or (d) Sent to that other person by post addressed to that other person at that other person’s usual or last known place of abode or business. 14(2) \[Notices sent by post\] Any notice sent by post to any person, or to any other person authorised to act on behalf of that person, shall be deemed to have been received by that person, or that other person, when in the normal course of post it would have been delivered.” This case is noted because of the comments of Master Kennedy-Grant in relation to Public Interest Immunity and section 14 Tax Administration Act 1994. All other issues are particularly fact specific and not of general interest. Decision Public Interest Immunity The Master concluded the claim of Public Interest Immunity was properly made. The plaintiffs argued that if, as a result of the investigation prompted by the informant’s disclosure, the informant’s identity or likely identity was discerned, then the immunity was lost. The Master rejected this argument saying: “Given the purpose of the immunity, namely to ensure the continued supply by third parties of information to relevant authorities in relation to actual or possible breach of the law by a person or persons, I am unable to accept the proposition that the subsequent involvement of an informer in the investigative process in a manner which results in his or her identification as the informer or probable informer, results in the loss of the immunity against disclosure of the fact that he or she was indeed an informer. What is protected by the immunity is the fact of informing, not the content of the information. Informers trigger the commencement, renewal or redirection of the investigative process by giving the information to the relevant authority in the first place. It is the fact that they were the persons who triggered the investigative process that is protected by the immunity. If the immunity were to be lost by reason of the mere involvement of an informant in the subsequent investigative process in a manner which identifies that person as an informer or probable informer, the effectiveness of the immunity as an encouragement to informers would be substantially weakened.” \[at par 26\] He also considered said that: “If regard is had to the purpose of the immunity, namely the encouragement of the continued supply of information by third parties to relevant authorities regarding illegal or potentially illegal activities of persons, seems to me that the immunity must apply not only where the informer is identifiable as a particular individual but also where the informant is identifiable as one of a small, clearly defined, group. \[at par 29\] It was submitted by the plaintiffs that Public Interest Immunity does not cover situations were the information inferred the identify of the informant or informants. Rather it only covered information that positively identified the informant or informants. The Master considered this “is to impose too high a standard of proof.” And that to accept this would “weaken the effectiveness of the immunity as an encouragement to the provision of information by third parties such as the informer or informers in this case.” Section 14 TAA 1994 The Master noted that the provisions of section 14 TAA regarding the giving of notices were phrased that the giving of notices “by the Commissioner to any person may be...” (section 14(1) TAA 1994, emphasis added). He also noted the effects of Abbattis Properties (2001) 20 NZTC 17,013 at 17,17,015 and Sea Hunter Fishing (2001) 20 NZTC 17,206 at 17,215 to conclude: “Given that the stated purpose of the \[TAA\] is, inter alia, ‘to reorganise and consolidate the law relating to... the administration of income tax matters’, that s 14 is important in the scheme of tax administration (because of the large number of documents to which it can apply), and that the consequences of some of those documents...are serious, I am satisfied that, notwithstanding the use in the section of the word ‘may’, as opposed to the word ‘shall’, s 14 ought to be held to be mandatory. Such an interpretation produces certainty without placing unreasonable requirements in the way of the Commissioner. I am not persuade to the contrary view by the \[Commissioner\] ... Parliament has seldom been rigorously consistent in the manner in which it has expressed itself.” \[at par 50\[d\]\] Having so concluded, the Master then turned to consider if posting notices to the plaintiffs’ accountant’s post office box number was compliance with section 14 TAA. The Master concluded that it was not. He accepted that a post office box is geographically separated from a place of abode or place of business and this was in accordance with the “ordinary and natural meaning” of the words of the section. Thus effective notice under section 14 had not been given, despite the Master accepting that the accountants were the plaintiffs’ agents in dealing with the Commissioner. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 2 (February 2002) MARCH 2002 5 Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 7 Provisional tax instalments due for people and organisations with a March balance date 20 Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 28 GST return and payment due APRIL 2002 5 Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 8 End-of-year income tax • 7 April 2002, 2001 end-of-year income tax due for clients of agents with a March balance date • 7 February 2003, 2002 end-of-year income tax due for people and organisations with a March balance date and who do not have an agent 22 Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and Employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 30 GST return and payment due DUE DATES REMINDER REGULAR FEATURES INLAND REVENUE NATIONAL OFFICE PO BOX 2198 WELLINGTON TELEPHONE (04) 472 1032

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/35 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Hertz Fleetlease Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CI 3(1), GC 15, GC 17, and Schedule 2, Part A, clause 1(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of motor vehicles by Hertz Fleetlease Limited (“Hertz”) to employers (“Lessees”) under its 12x12x12-month lease product, when the Lessees provide the motor vehicles to their employees for their private use and enjoyment. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. Hertz conducts a fleet leasing business. One of the options offered to customers is a motor vehicle lease with a lease term of 12 months, and the possibility of entering two further leases of 12 months respectively. This option is referred to as a 12x12x12-month lease. 2. The lease from Hertz to the Lessee is made under the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease Agreement and Guarantee (“MLA”), the Vehicle Quotation and the Vehicle Schedule (copies of which were received by the Rulings Unit on 10 November 2001. In addition, a revised version of the Vehicle Quotation for this particular Arrangement was received on 30 November 2001). 3. There are no penalties imposed on Lessees if they do not take up a further lease of the vehicle. 4. There is no provision in the lease documentation that offers an incentive to Lessees if they take up a further lease of the vehicle. 5. Hertz expects Lessees to find the 12x12x12-month lease product appealing because it provides greater flexibility to employers than standard leasing arrangements. 6. The leasing of the motor vehicles by Hertz to lessees comprises the following steps: 1. Initial Processes After an initial sales enquiry Hertz consults with the potential customer to determine their leasing requirements. This may be a combination of full maintenance or non-maintained leases, fleet management services and other lease services. A proposal is constructed and presented to the customer for consideration. This document sets out in broad detail what products and services Hertz offers. A credit application form is also attached. Completion of this form is the next step should the prospective lessee wish to apply for approval to commence a relationship with Hertz. Once the lessee’s credit application is approved, a Master Lease Agreement is drafted and sent to the lessee for their consideration. This document establishes all the terms and conditions on which the business relationship between the lessee and Hertz will be based. All vehicles that are subsequently leased to the lessee are subject to this Master Lease Agreement. The individual vehicle schedules produced at the start of each vehicle lease term refer back to the Master Lease Agreement. 4 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 5 If the employer is already a client of Hertz, and wishes to extend their relationship with Hertz, the lessee can request Hertz to provide a quotation for a particular vehicle. The request should outline the vehicle make and model, accessories required, the lease term and the required kilometres. Hertz will then provide the lessee with a quotation. If the prospective lessee accepts the quotation a vehicle requisition is produced detailing the order. Once the requisition is signed and returned to Hertz an order is placed with the vehicle distributor. On delivery of the vehicle a vehicle schedule is produced confirming the details of the lease (delivery date, lease term, driver details, vehicle details etc). The schedule discloses, in addition to the customer’s personal number (referred to as the “contract number”) a schedule number that is unique to each individual lease that is entered. 2. Terms and Conditions of the Master Lease Agreement The Master Lease Agreement does not refer to the particular vehicles subject to its terms. Specific details such as the make and model, the registration number, the term of the lease and the cost of the lease are contained in the vehicle schedule, which is the Second Schedule to the Master Lease Agreement. An example of a completed vehicle schedule is enclosed with this application. The terms of the vehicle schedule are incorporated into the Master Lease Agreement. Items 12(a) and 12(b) of the vehicle schedule specify the contract start date and the expected contract end date. The term of the lease is specified as 12 months. There is no obligation or right of renewal on the part of either party to the lease. In addition, there are no penalties imposed if a further lease is not entered. 3. Procedure at the end of the lease Prior to the end of the original lease term Hertz advises lessees that the vehicle lease is due to expire and asks whether the lessee wishes to enter a new lease (the standard letter issued by Hertz for this purpose is enclosed). If the lessee intends to enter into a subsequent lease in respect of the leased vehicle, a new lease is entered for a further 12-month term. We have enclosed an example of a vehicle schedule issued when a lessee enters a second or third lease. A separate schedule number is assigned to the new lease. The new rental rate will be lower, subject to the expected mileage being adhered to, and is based on the depreciated value of the vehicle. 4. Vehicle Valuation Under item 7 of the standard vehicle schedule Hertz is required to specify the market value of the vehicle at the start of the 12-month lease period. The market value assessment takes into account the type of car, its age, condition and mileage. When providing a quotation Hertz provides lessees with market value forecasts of the value of the motor vehicle for subsequent periods. However, these forecasts are for indicative purposes only. Market values are reviewed prior to the commencement of any subsequent leases. 7. At a time between one and three months prior to the end of each separate lease term, Hertz contacts Lessees to advise that the vehicle lease is due to expire and asks whether the lessee wishes to enter a new lease. The customer is asked for the current kilometre reading as well as the expected usage for the next lease period (if one is to be entered into). The customer is also asked whether they wish to have Excess Kilometre charges settled as a separate charge or amortised over any new lease. From this information, a new quote is put to the client for approval or rejection. 8. The standard letter advising a Lessee that the lease term is due to expire is sent one month before the expiry of the lease (a revised copy of this standard letter was received by the Rulings Unit on 12 December 2001). 9. There is no obligation or right of renewal on either party in relation to any subsequent lease term. 10. If the Lessee does not wish to lease the vehicle for a further lease term of 12 months, the vehicle is returned to Hertz upon expiry of the lease. If the Lessee wishes to retain the vehicle, a new lease is entered into for a further period. 11. This new lease term is assigned a separate Vehicle Schedule number, confirming the fact that a new lease term has been entered into, rather than the old one being extended. In all cases, the old record for the previous lease is noted as having terminated. In addition, a new Vehicle Quotation and Vehicle Schedule are required for each new lease. The general conditions set out in the MLA are incorporated into the new lease agreement. 12. The new Vehicle Schedule will outline the contract start date and the expected contract end date of the new lease. 13. The Vehicle Schedule will also include the specified distance of the lease, the maximum permitted lease term of 12 months and the market value of the vehicle. The Vehicle Schedule will also record the odometer reading of the vehicle at the contract start date and the odometer reading at the contract end date. 14. The rental rates for the second and third agreements (as outlined in the Vehicle Quotation) will be lower than for the first agreement. The rates reduce as the depreciation on the vehicle reduces. The market value of the vehicle is calculated at the time of the commencement of the lease and is included in the new Vehicle 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 7 Schedule. The lease documents do not confer on either party to the lease a right or option to renew, extend or vary the term of the lease. 15. Before the new lease commencing, Hertz will determine the market value of the vehicle at the start of each new 12-month lease period, taking into account the type of vehicle, its age, condition and mileage. Hertz advises Lessees of the market valuation of the vehicle, and provides market value forecasts for subsequent periods for indicative purposes only. Market values are reviewed before the commencement of subsequent leases (if any) to ensure whether the forecasts are accurate or need to be changed in any way. 16. The Lessee may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations pursuant to clause 21.4 of the MLA. 17. The total term of the leases does not exceed 75% of the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The motor vehicles leased by a Lessee under this Arrangement are leased for the private use or enjoyment of their employees or made available for the private use or enjoyment of their employees. b) The lease is not a “finance lease” as defined in section OB 1. c) No Lessee is associated with Hertz pursuant to section OD 7. d) No contract, agreement, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) is entered into between Hertz and the Lessee in relation to the Arrangement, other than the MLA, the Vehicle Quotation and the Vehicle Schedule. e) Any rental rate for the Lessee for a subsequent lease period is the same rental rate that would be offered to any other customer for that particular vehicle and lease period (taking into account the customer credit rating, customer fleet size, kilometre allowances and general service components of the lease including vehicle maintenance) irrespective of whether a previous lease for that vehicle was entered into by that Lessee. f) There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally unenforceable or not) that any party will, or will if requested, renew, extend or vary the lease term. g) There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally unenforceable or not) at the time of entering into any lease under this Arrangement, that the parties will enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle. h) There is no other documentation, agreements, or contracts that concern or affect the terms of the leases entered into under this Arrangement apart from the MLA, the Vehicle Quotation and the Vehicle Schedule. i) There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether formal or informal, and whether intended to be legally unenforceable or not) at the time of entering into any lease under this Arrangement, that there will be penalties for choosing not to enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle. j) All calculations, factors, and/or projections which are taken into account in formulating the rental rates applying to each lease are not in any way based on a lease of the relevant motor vehicle for more than 12 months. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The market value of a motor vehicle under this arrangement, for the purposes of calculating the fringe benefit value of that vehicle under section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2, Part A, clause 1(c), is determined on the date on which each new 12 month lease commences. • Section GC 15 does not apply to the Arrangement. • Section GC 17 does not apply to the Arrangement. • Section BG 1 does not apply to negate or vary the conclusions above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 21 December 2001 to 21 December 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21st day of December 2001.

Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Hertz Fleetlease Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CI 3(1), GC 15, GC 17, and Schedule 2, Part A, clause 1(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of motor vehicles by Hertz Fleetlease Limited (“Hertz”) to employers (“Lessees”) under its 15x15x15-month lease product, when the Lessees provide the motor vehicles to their employees for their private use and enjoyment. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. Hertz conducts a fleet leasing business. One of the options offered to customers is a motor vehicle lease with a lease term of 15 months, and the possibility of entering two further leases of 15 months respectively. This option is referred to as a 15x15x15-month lease. 2. The lease from Hertz to the Lessee is made under the terms and conditions contained in the Master Lease Agreement and Guarantee (“MLA”), the Vehicle Quotation and the Vehicle Schedule (a copy of the MLA was received by the Rulings Unit on 10 November 2001. The sample Vehicle Quotation, in relation to this particular Arrangement, was received on 30 November 2001 and the sample Vehicle Schedule was received on 6 December 2001). 3. There are no penalties imposed on Lessees if they do not take up a further lease of the vehicle. 4. There is no provision in the lease documentation that offers an incentive to Lessees if they take up a further lease of the vehicle. 5. Hertz expects Lessees to find the 15x15x15-month lease product appealing because it provides greater flexibility to employers than standard leasing arrangements. 6. The leasing of the motor vehicles by Hertz to lessees comprises the following steps: 1. Initial Processes After an initial sales enquiry Hertz consults with the potential customer to determine their leasing requirements. This may be a combination of full maintenance or non-maintained leases, fleet management services and other lease services. A proposal is constructed and presented to the customer for consideration. This document sets out in broad detail what products and services Hertz offers. A credit application form is also attached. Completion of this form is the next step should the prospective lessee wish to apply for approval to commence a relationship with Hertz. Once the lessee’s credit application is approved, a Master Lease Agreement is drafted and sent to the lessee for their consideration. This document establishes all the terms and conditions on which the business relationship between the lessee and Hertz will be based. All vehicles that are subsequently leased to the lessee are subject to this Master Lease Agreement. The individual vehicle schedules produced at the start of each vehicle lease term refer back to the Master Lease Agreement.

The term of the lease is specified as 15 months. There is no obligation or right of renewal on the part of either party to the lease. In addition, there are no penalties imposed if a further lease is not entered. 3. Procedure at the end of the lease Prior to the end of the original lease term Hertz advises lessees that the vehicle lease is due to expire and asks whether the lessee wishes to enter a new lease (the standard letter issued by Hertz for this purpose is enclosed).

The total interest rate has two components—the base interest rate and the interest adjustment rate. These are 3.1% and 3.9% respectively for the 2001–02 income year. From 1 April 2002 the base interest rate will increase to 5.1% and the interest adjustment rate will decrease to 1.9% Student Loan Scheme (Interest Rates) Regulations 2002 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX – PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST ON LOW- INTEREST, EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest, employment-related loans has decreased from 7.19% to 6.7% for the quarter beginning 1 January 2002. The new rate applies from the quarter beginning 1 January 2002. The rate is reviewed regularly to ensure it is in line with the Reserve Bank’s survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from the quarter beginning 1 October 2001. Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2002 TAX SIMPLIFICATION – REDUCING COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS The tax rules for non-resident contractors who come to New Zealand to work for short periods each year have been simplified. Under the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax requirements, payments to non-resident contractors are subject to a 15% withholding tax, unless the contractor holds a certificate of exemption from tax in New Zealand. Non-resident contractors—or their employers—must apply for this exemption even if they are exempt from paying tax in New Zealand. For example, the non-resident contractor may be from a country with whom New Zealand has a double tax agreement that exempts the contract activity being undertaken. Under an amendment to Regulation 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, non-resident contractors who are exempted from tax under a double tax agreement and are present in New Zealand for less than 62 days in all in any 12-month period will no longer have to apply for a certificate of exemption. The change will apply to contract payments made on or after 1 April 2002. Example of when the amendment will apply An independent contractor resident in the United Kingdom has a contract with a New Zealand company to provide building re-fit services. The non-resident contractor will be present in New Zealand for two different periods, from 1 April to 1 May 2002, and 1 June to 15 June 2002. If this is the aggregate time that is spent in New Zealand, the amendment will apply, as the contractor will be present in New Zealand for less than 62 days in total in the 12-month period beginning 1 April 2002. Examples of when the amendment will not apply 1. An Australian resident company is contracted to supply well-head engineering services to a New Zealand company drilling for oil. The Australian company is expected to be present in New Zealand for 50 days to perform the contract. Article 5(4)(b) of New Zealand’s double tax agreement with Australia, however, deems Australian contractors doing this type of work to have a permanent establishment (and therefore be taxable) in New Zealand. So even though its presence in New Zealand will be for less than 62 days, the Australian company is not exempt under the relevant double tax agreement and consequently cannot apply the amendment. 2. A Canadian company has a contract to provide technical assistance to a New Zealand company. The Canadian contractor is expected to be present in New Zealand for less than 62 days in total to perform the relevant service. However, under Article 12(3)(b) of New Zealand’s double tax agreement with Canada, payments for such assistance are regarded as a “royalty” and are not exempt from tax in New Zealand. Once again, even though the non-resident contractor is present in New Zealand for less than 62 days, the amendment will not apply. 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 15 Remedial Changes Under an amendment to Regulation 2 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, the definition of “contract activity” has been clarified by removing the redundant “contract project” concept from the Regulations. Before the scope of the Regulations was widened in the early 1990s to include all non-resident contractors performing services in New Zealand, only non-resident contractors performing services in connection with a “contract project” (typically, large-scale construction and exploration activities) were subject to withholding tax. Regulation 12 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 has also been amended to remove an exemption for shearing contractors from deducting and paying PAYE. These remedial changes will apply from 1 April 2002.

We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT Case: Commissioner of Inland Revenue v R Peterson Decision date: 19 February 2002 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Film loss claim, tax avoidance arrangement, BNZI knowledge, special partnership Summary This was an appeal from a decision of Judge Willy reported as Case U6 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,038. It concerns one of the “films cases” that originated in the 1980s. The Commissioner’s appeal was unsuccessful. Facts The objector was a lawyer who attended to the legalities of a film venture. He was also investor in the venture. The film, “Lie of the Land”, was to be produced, marketed and distributed by a special partnership, which was also to acquire the rights to the film. The partnership was funded by equity investment and loans. Part of the funding was by way of limited recourse loans (where the lender could only expect to be repaid out of any profits from the film). The film was made, but was not a success. After an investigation, the Commissioner took the view that, to the extent the funding was non-recourse (and apparently circular) that was not deductible to the taxpayer. He further concluded that certain expenses for marketing were not in fact incurred. The objector objected and was successful before the TRA. The Commissioner appealed. Decision After considering the general scheme used to make the film Justice Hammond, by way of introduction, was careful to say that the role of the Courts was not to “evolve tax policy”, particularly with regard to mass marketed tax schemes. His Honour acknowledged that films (and their financing) were a high-risk industry and concluded that this case was not a “true test case”. He then relied heavily upon the Court of Appeal’s decision in CIR v BNZI (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103 to find against the Commissioner. His Honour quoted from CIR v BNZI: “The first is as to the extent of the arrangement; the second is as to whether it has the purpose or effect of tax avoidance and the third, which arises only where the second is answered affirmatively, is as to the adjustment to be made to counteract the tax advantage. The adjustment can be made against both a party to the arrangement and a person affected, who is not necessarily a party. But it can be made only where a tax advantage has been obtained “under that arrangement”. (Blanchard J at par 175 in BNZI) He adopted the mutuality test developed in BNZI (Richardson P at par 50 and 52 of BNZI) and concluded there was no evidence of actual knowledge of the circular funding involved in the financing. Nor was there any evidence to conclude that the objector was wilfully blind as to the financing arrangements. Finally there was no evidence that Mr M (as the promoter) could be properly characterised as the objector’s agent due to the particular nature of special partnerships: “The scheme of the legislation \[creating special partnerships\] recognised two classes of partners, general partners and special partners. Special partners are pure investors... these persons are really “sleeping partners”. ... General partners, on the other hand, in functional terms are managing partners. They are jointly and severally responsible as general partners are now by law. The general law of partnership does not apply to any special partnership except so far as it is (expressly) declared to be applicable by the statute. This conceptual scheme is reflected in the actual deed of participation. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 17 \[The taxpayer’s counsel\] submitted that there is here “no relevant agency”. In my view the submission is well founded. A special partnership is sui generis. To contend, as here, that it constitutes an “agency” for the purpose of the test in CIR v BNZ seems to me to fly in the face of the fundamental conception of a special partnership.” (at par 72 to 73) Justice Hammond also rejected the Commissioner’s argument that certain costs had not been incurred. The Commissioner submitted that marketing costs had not been incurred but, His Honour concluded that the contract entered into was a fixed price contract and it was wrong to break it down to component parts. “Put shortly, both the commercial context of the transaction and the essential incidents of it, support the taxpayer’s position that this was a fixed price contract”(at par 79) UNCLAIMED MONEY Case: Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Thomas Cook Limited Decision date: 21 February 2002 Act: Unclaimed Money Act 1971 Keywords: Unpresented drafts, unclaimed money, Summary The Commissioner lost his claim that unpresented drafts are unclaimed money. Facts Thomas Cook Ltd (“Thomas Cook”), in the course of its business, receives money in respect of which it issues documents headed “international cheques”. The drafts specify a payee, an amount in foreign currency, and a foreign bank, which is to make the payment of the specified amount to the payee. This case concerns drafts issued by Thomas Cook prior to 31 December 1992 and which were not presented by the relevant payee within six years of the purchase of those drafts. In the years prior to 31 December 1992, there was no written contract or other terms or conditions set out in writing applicable to the particular transaction as between Thomas Cook and the customer. Upon the issue of a draft, the customer was simply provided with confirmation of the relevant foreign currency, the amount of that foreign currency, the exchange rate for that foreign currency, the New Zealand dollar equivalent amount, the serial number of the draft, the payee’s details, and the details of the commission and the total amount payable. The Commissioner claimed that Thomas Cook is holding, in respect of unpresented drafts issued before 31 December 1992, more than $400,000, which, the Commissioner said, is “unclaimed money” in terms of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. He said that Thomas Cook has an obligation to pay the money to the Crown under section 3. He sought declaratory relief. Thomas Cook asserted that the money is not “unclaimed money” and accordingly is not so payable. Decision The High Court held that there can be no doubt that the drafts are bills of exchange as defined in section 3 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908. It is a fundamental tenet of New Zealand law that bills “must be duly presented for payment” (see Bills of Exchange Act, section 45(1)). Where the bill is payable on demand, presentment must be made within a reasonable time after its issue in order to render the drawer liable (see section 45(2)(b)). Similar provisions are to be found in most jurisdictions (see Byles on Bills of Exchange (26th ed), chapter 12). It is important to note that our Bills of Exchange Act effectively copied the United Kingdom Bills of Exchange Act 1882, which was itself a codification of English common law. That code was adopted as the basis of the law in the United States, the former British dominions, and other countries in the British Commonwealth of Nations (see Byles, p 3, and International Ore & Fertilizer Corporation v East Coast Fertiliser Co. Ltd \[1987\] 1 NZLR 9 (CA) at 14). The key is presentment. Until presentment, the money is not payable. The High Court held that is the simple answer to this case. These drafts have never been presented, with the consequence that the money has not become payable by Thomas Cook. The money is therefore not “unclaimed money” within section 4(1)(e) of the Unclaimed Money Act. In view of its decision on the first issue, the Court did not go on to consider whether the money was situated in New Zealand. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 19 VALID ASSESSMENT Case: TRA No 02/01. Decision No 6/2002 Decision date: 14 February 2002 Act: Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords: Valid Notice of Determination Summary Judge Barber in his interim decision, decided in favour of the Commissioner. Facts The disputant filed his 1992 income tax return claiming a tax loss in 1996. In 1999 one of the Commissioner’s investigators commenced an investigation into the loss. It was determined that the loss was not claimable in the 1992 tax year, as it arose when a company was struck off in December 1990 (the 1991 income tax year). It was further considered that the loss might not be claimable at all. Consequently, the investigator issued an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. In doing so the investigator relied upon section 89C(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) as he had formed the opinion that the return contained a simple or obvious mistake or oversight, which the assessment merely corrected. The disputant commenced a challenge on the basis there was no simple or obvious mistake or oversight. The correctness of the assessment was NOT challenged. The Commissioner pointed out that the opinion formed under section 89C was unable to be challenged (section 138E(1)(e)(iv) TAA). The matter went to Adjudication and Rulings where it was determined (broadly) that the taxpayer was correct regarding the assessment, but that there was no remedy available to him. The disputant continued his challenge to the Taxation Review Authority. Decision His Honour accepted that the Commissioner’s opinion under section 89C(b) was not capable of being challenged before the Authority due to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words in section 138E(1)(e)(iv) TAA. Judge Barber accepted that “the legislation indicates that failure to issue a NOPA will not invalidate an assessment” as the disputant at section 89D can challenge an assessment whether or not the Commissioner complied with section 89C before making the assessment. If a breach of section 89C invalidated an assessment, there would be no need to challenge it, as it wouldn’t be an assessment at all. He noted the disputant had not challenged the assessment on the basis that it was tentative or provisional or not a genuine attempt to make an assessment, and concluded: “Prima facie, there is no remedy that this Authority can offer the disputant in this case as he has not challenged the correctness of the assessment, and it must, therefore, be assumed that the assessment is correct”(par 63) His Honour accepted the argument for the Commissioner that, unless the procedural defect relied upon by the disputant meant the assessment was incorrect, then there was no remedy available. His Honour accepted that he must find the assessment was valid and correct, as there was no appropriate challenge to it. However, His Honour went on to say that he did not think there was a simple mistake or oversight and that the Commissioner had not merely corrected that mistake or oversight. His Honour considered the situation to be unsatisfactory as the loss had effectively “evaporated”. But he also acknowledged that the disputant had proceedings related to the 1991 tax year pending (par 74). His Honour expressed himself “keen” to deal with the substantive matter and made an order that “there be an amended assessment to exclude the said loss in that year \[1992\] on the basis that I am not presently satisfied of its deductibility, and not as merely a correction.”. DEPRECIATION OF TRADEMARKS Case: Trustees in the N C Simkin Trust v CIR. Trustees in the C B Simkin Trust Decision date: 26 February 2002 Act: Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords: Depreciation, trademark, ownership/owner of right to use Summary The plaintiffs’ claim for depreciation of various trademarks was disallowed. Facts These two challenges were heard together as their facts are very similar. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 19 A company, Constellation Enterprises Ltd, registered the trademark “The Mill” and sold the names “The Mill”, “the Mill Liquor Store” and the trademark “The Mill” to the first plaintiffs on 17 October 1995 for $1,154,000 plus GST. On the same day, the first plaintiffs, by deed of licence, gave Constellation Enterprises Ltd the right to use the trademark for seven years, for an annual royalty of $230,800 plus GST. By deed of licence, the first plaintiffs sold the residual rights to the trademark to Riversdale Enterprises Ltd on 7 December 1995 for $155,790 plus GST. The trademark remained the property of the first plaintiffs until 17 October 2002. The first plaintiffs depreciated the trademark for five months in the 1996 tax year (claiming $59,417) and for the entire 1997 tax year (claiming $142,601). The Commissioner disallowed the depreciation claimed on the basis that intangible assets are only allowed to be depreciated in certain circumstances. The facts in relation to the second plaintiffs are very similar, though relate to different trademarks and different amounts. Decision Ronald Young J noted that the right to depreciate intangible assets was a relatively new one, the current regime having been introduced in 1994. Section EG 1 permits deductions for depreciable property. Intangible property is generally unable to be depreciated unless it comes within the definition of “depreciable intangible property”: “depreciable intangible property” means intangible property of a type listed in Schedule 17, which Schedule describes intangible property that has – (a) A finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and (b) If made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes: Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 lists depreciable intangible property. “The right to use a trademark” is depreciable intangible property. Ronald Young J noted that: “Depreciation is concerned to allow for the replacement of wasting assets. Thus a limited economic life underlies depreciation. A trademark has effectively an unlimited right. It can be renewed in perpetuity. In contrast, the right to use a trademark will have a finite life”. The plaintiffs argued that “the right to use” the trademark was the ownership of the right to use, held by the trusts. The Commissioner argued that “the right to use” was held by the licensees who had licensed it from the trusts. At the moment the trusts acquired the trademarks, they had the right to hold them in perpetuity. His Honour concluded that the fact that the trusts had decided to sell the trademarks in seven years’ time was not relevant. That was their choice. The submission that triggered a “finite life”, as required by the definition of depreciable intangible property, was rejected. His Honour concluded: “This is inconsistent with the concept of depreciation based on wasting assets and a limited economic life.” LUPTON VERSUS CRANSON LINE OF AUTHORITY Case: TRA No 023/01. Decision No 08/2002 Decision date 27 February 2002 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Redundancy payment, retiring leave payment Summary The objector was not successful in his challenge. Facts The objector was employed by Telecom Wellington Limited (“Telecom”) as a Design and Build Consultant. At material times, the objector was 56 years old and had 41 years’ service with Telecom. The objector’s conditions of employment were governed by the Telecom Individual Contract Employees’ Standard Conditions of Employment dated 29 September 1992. The redundancy and early retirement provisions in that contract were materially identical to those contained in the Telecom Employees’ Collective Employment Contract 1992 and 1993 (TECEC). By letter dated 22 February 1993, the objector was advised by Telecom that his position had become surplus to Telecom’s needs due to restructuring. The objector was asked to indicate his preferred option of either ceasing or remaining with Telecom, but was advised that the opportunities for redeployment were extremely limited. The objector expressed a preference for “severance with early retirement”. In March, Telecom advised the objector that his preference had been accepted and approved, and that his cessation date would be 2 April 1993. Shortly after being notified, the objector discussed the tax consequences of the “retiring leave” component of his severance payment with Telecom, who advised that he was being made redundant rather than taking early retirement, therefore his payment would be taxed. 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 21 In a memorandum dated 11 March 1993, the objector asked Telecom to review his severance with a view to making the “retiring leave” a retirement allowance so tax would not be payable. The next day, Telecom confirmed to the objector that he was being made redundant as a result of his position being declared surplus to needs. The objector’s employment ceased on 2 April 1993, and on 8 April 1993 he received a gross severance payment of $104,317.92, which included $29,400 “cessation leave”. Telecom deducted PAYE on the full amount of the payment. The gross severance payment was calculated in accordance with the clause in the objector’s contract that related to termination of employment by redundancy. This provided a number of components to the payment: length of service, number of dependants, and either “retiring leave” for employees with 20 years’ or more qualifying service or “cessation leave” for employees with less than 20 years’ service. In May 1994, the objector filed his income tax return for the year ended 31 March 1994 and declared his income to be in accordance with the IR12 deduction certificate issued by Telecom, which included the full amount of the severance payment. However, following assessment of the objector’s 1994 return of income for the year ended 31 March 1994, the objector considered that Telecom was incorrect in deducting tax from the retiring leave payment, and he sought a refund of that tax. Decision His Honour Judge Barber considered it clear from section 68(2) that, where any payment is made in a lump sum by way of a retiring allowance other than a redundancy payment, in respect of the employment or service of a taxpayer on the termination of that employment or service, that termination being the occasion of the taxpayer’s retirement, the payment is deemed not to be assessable income. He also noted that the character of a severance payment is to be determined from the legal arrangements entered into by the parties, irrespective of the nomenclature used by the parties, and from considering the surrounding circumstances to ascertain why employment was terminated. On the evidence, His Honour found that the objector was specifically told by Telecom that his position was surplus to requirements, and that the payment in issue was made to the objector because of redundancy. He went on to state that: “Whether the $29,400 ingredient of the total payment is called a cessation leave payment or a retiring leave payment, it was not made on the occasion of the objector’s retirement because the objector did not in fact retire. He was made redundant.” He further considered that the true nature of the legal arrangement between the parties was made under clause 7.3(b) of the objector’s contract, which dealt with employees who have been made redundant: “The objector was made redundant and, in view of his past service, he became entitled, as a component of his voluntary severance payment, to a cash sum calculated in accordance with the scale for “retiring leave”.” In terms of section 68(2), then, the lump sum paid to the objector was not paid as a retiring allowance due on the termination of his employment by Telecom; nor was it paid on the occasion of the objector’s retirement. The objector had not retired, but had been made redundant. Accordingly, the payment of $29,400 labelled “cessation leave” was not made on the occasion of the objector’s retirement, and His Honour held that the Commissioner has acted correctly in not reassessing the objector’s income tax to exclude as assessable the “retirement leave” component of the objector’s severance payment. The assessment regarding the 1994 financial year was confirmed. 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 21 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 23 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 23 APRIL 2002 5 Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 8 End-of-year income tax • 7 April 2002, 2001 end-of-year income tax due for clients of agents with a March balance date • 7 February 2003, 2002 end-of-year income tax due for people and organisations with a March balance date and who do not have an agent 22 Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 30 GST return and payment due MAY 2002 6 Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20 Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) • Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due • Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 31 GST return and payment due FBT return and payment due DUE DATES REMINDER REGULAR FEATURES 24 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 25 24 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 3 (March 2002) 25 Name Address Draft interpretation statement Comment deadline IS3448: Home as a business site or work 30 April 2002 base—Motor vehicle use—FBT consequences Items are not generally available once the comment deadline has passed Affix Stamp Here No envelope needed—simply fold, tape shut, stamp and post YOUR CHANCE TO COMMENT ON DRAFT TAXATION ITEMS BEFORE THEY ARE FINALISED This page shows the draft public binding rulings, interpretation statements, standard practice statements and other items that we now have available for your review.

It establishes a system under which the Ministry of Health designates private sector providers of health care services. It makes a number of consequential amendments to defi nitions in the Inland Revenue Acts relating to hospitals and healthcare. Child Support Act 1991 and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 An amendment to section 73(3) of the Child Support Act 1991 reads: Hospital patient means a person who is – (a) a patient in a hospital care institution within the meaning of section 58(4) of the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001; or (b) repealed (c) a resident in an institution certifi ed under the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966. An amendment to section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 reads: Hospital – (a) means an institution – (i) that is a hospital care institution within the meaning of section 58(4) of the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001; or (ii) whose principal purpose is to receive and treat people needing medical treatment or suffering from a disease; and (b) includes all clinics, dispensaries, offi ces, outpatient departments, services, and undertakings, maintained in connection with, or incidental to, such an institution.

In section 118 of the Hospitals Act 1957: Licensed hospital means a hospital in respect of which a licence is in force, or is deemed to be in force, under this Act. Hospital means any premises in which two or more patients are maintained at the same time, other than – (a) an institution that, immediately before the commencement of the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992, was a licensed institution under section 9 of the Mental Health Act 1969; (b) an institution in which habitual inebriates or any other persons are detained under the authority of any Act, unless any individual (other than a person so detained) is maintained therein.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defi ned by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption that applies for the income year ended 31 March 2002. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR13”. The full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 2002 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2001 exemption. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for: – an interest held in an FIF – an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defi ned in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determining exemption from disclosure it includes: 1. an income interest held directly in a foreign company 2. an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3. an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defi ned by section OD 8(3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater”, which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example, the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in an FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 478, IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 442 or IR 443 form (see “Overlap of interests” on the following page). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 2002 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company that is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on an Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule (IR 477 or IR 479) form. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: • Attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. • To identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specifi ed in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company that is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002) 7 • The requirement for a CFC that is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specifi ed within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: – rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust) – an entitlement to benefi t from a foreign superannuation scheme – an entitlement to benefi t from a foreign life insurance policy – an interest in an entity specifi ed in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifi cally excluded as an interest in an FIF under section CG 15(2) does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exclusions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: – an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company) – an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specifi ed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America) – an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme – a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for fi ling the person’s 2002 tax return. (See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas private pensions (IR 257) for more information) – interests in foreign entities held by a natural person other than in that person’s capacity as a trustee, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year – an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profi t or gain, or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency – an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the fi rst time, for a period of up to four years. A resident who holds an interest in an FIF at any time during the 2002 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form Interest in foreign investment fund disclosure schedule (IR 439, IR 440, IR 441 or IR 443). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profi ts method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method). Therefore, the Commissioner has prescribed four forms to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in an FIF using one of the methods. The respective forms to use for whichever FIF income calculation method you choose to apply is as follows: – IR 439 for the accounting profi ts method – IR 440 for the branch equivalent method – IR 441 for the comparative value method – IR 443 for the deemed rate of return method. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in an FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in an FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either the IR 477 or IR 479, or the IR 439, IR 440, IR 441 or IR 443) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to fi le: 1. Use the appropriate IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 442 or IR 443 form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: – an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) – an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country – an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) 2. Use the IR 447 or IR 479 forms to disclose an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on an IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 442 or IR 443 form. Disclosure is not required on any of the forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest that is covered by the Schedule 3, Part A exclusion from the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 2002 disclosure exemption removes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply, for example, to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 2002 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (ie, it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. The 2002 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR13” 1. Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2001. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies that are interests in FIFs, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defi ned by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption (i) Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in an FIF), in the income year ending 31 March 2002, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defi ned by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. (ii) Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in an FIF in the income year ending 31 March 2002, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: – no attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002) 9 – no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 22nd day of March 2002. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2002. The conversion rates for the fi rst six months of each income year are published in the Tax Information Bulletin following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: – branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 – foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 – FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profi ts, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key X Y “x” is the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. “y” is the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 September 2001. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2001 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD200,000 ÷ 3.2712 = NZ$61,139.64 A similar calculation would be needed for an FIF, using the branch equivalent or accounting profi ts methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is an FIF) for 350,000 pesos (PHP) on 7 September 2001. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP350,000 ÷ 20.8480 = NZ$16,788.18 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x”, which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2001 and has a balance date of 30 September 2001. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars (SGD) was derived. (i) Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May to September 2001: (0.7621 + 0.7570 + 0.7460 + 0.7545 + 0.7329) ÷ 5 = 0.7505 (ii) Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD500,000 ÷ 0.7505 = NZ$666,222.52 FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS – CONVERSION TO NZ CURRENCY Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002) 11 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 2002. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: – items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula – foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 30 September 2001 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 30 September 2001 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB500,000 ÷ 17.7151 = NZ$28,224.51 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible. 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) Country Foreign currency to NZ$

The major change from SPS INV-250 is in respect of the Commissioner’s practice regarding prosecution in the event of a voluntary disclosure. The new practice is that prosecution may be undertaken in cases of evasion and fraud when a post-notifi cation disclosure is made. Pre-notifi cation disclosures will still have full immunity from prosecution. Summary A taxpayer may make a voluntary disclosure either before being notifi ed of a pending tax audit or investigation (“pre-notifi cation disclosure”) or after the fi rst notifi cation but before the audit or investigation starts (“post-notifi cation disclosure”). The disclosure must be full and complete. The minimum details required are: – taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth or incorporation, contact telephone number and contact times) – the nature of the errors or omissions – an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred – adequate information to enable an assessment of the tax shortfall to be made – a declaration signed by the taxpayer, if possible – further information as is necessary to make an assessment. A full and complete disclosure will result in a reduction in the applicable rate of shortfall penalty. Where a pre-notifi cation disclosure is made, Inland Revenue will not consider prosecution. For a post-notifi cation disclosure, prosecution may be considered in cases of evasion or a similar offence (those offences listed in section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). All legislative references in this SPS are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise specifi ed. Background The New Zealand tax system is based on voluntary compliance. It relies on taxpayers meeting their obligations under the tax laws, for example, fi ling tax returns and returning all income. The voluntary disclosure system provides an incentive to taxpayers to determine their correct tax liability. It also refl ects the savings to Inland Revenue from voluntary admissions of irregularities and other benefi ts of cooperation by taxpayers. By making a full and complete voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer will get the advantage of reduced levels in any shortfall penalty imposed. If a taxpayer makes a pre-notifi cation disclosure, the level of any shortfall penalty will be reduced by 75%. If a post-notifi cation disclosure is made, the reduction in shortfall penalty will be 40%. Legislation Section 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides as follows 141G Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure– (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either (a) Before the taxpayer is fi rst notifi ed of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “pre-notifi cation disclosure”); or (b) After the taxpayer is notifi ed of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “post-notifi cation disclosure”). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002) 17 (2) The Commissioner may from time to time– (a) Specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure; and (b) The form in which it must be provided. (3) The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced– (a) For pre-notifi cation disclosure is 75% (b) For post-notifi cation disclosure is 40%. (4) The taxpayer is deemed to have been notifi ed of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if– (a) The taxpayer; or (b) An offi cer of the taxpayer; or (c) A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or (d) A tax advisor acting for the taxpayer; or (e) A partner in partnership with the taxpayer; or (f) A person acting for or on behalf of or as a fi duciary of the taxpayer,– is notifi ed of the pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started. (5) An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of– (a) The end of the fi rst interview an offi cer of the Department has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s representative after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (b) The time when– (i) An offi cer of the Department inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (ii) The taxpayer is notifi ed of the inspection. Standard Practice Voluntary disclosure methods Taxpayers can make a voluntary disclosure in any one of the following ways: – by visiting an Inland Revenue offi ce – by telephone call – by letter, fax or email – during an interview. Visits and telephone calls If a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure by visiting or telephoning Inland Revenue, as much information as possible will need to be provided by the taxpayer. Any Inland Revenue offi cer is able to record a voluntary disclosure when a taxpayer comes into or contacts Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will request taxpayers making a voluntary disclosure to sign a form refl ecting their disclosure. Written disclosure If a voluntary disclosure is received in writing between the time of fi rst notifi cation of the audit and the fi rst interview, it will be referred to the auditor who is conducting the audit or investigation. The auditor will incorporate this as correspondence relating to the audit or investigation. An acknowledgment will be made that the disclosure has been received. During the fi rst interview For disclosures made during the fi rst interview, the Inland Revenue auditor will consider whether the disclosure is complete and reveals all the relevant information necessary to ascertain the correct tax position. Notifi cation Subsection 141G(4) provides that a taxpayer has been notifi ed of a pending audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if any of the following persons have received notifi cation: – the taxpayer – an offi cer of the taxpayer – a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies) – a tax advisor acting for the taxpayer – a partner in a partnership – a person acting for, or on behalf of, or as a fi duciary of the taxpayer. An offi cer includes a director, secretary, receiver or liquidator. It does not include an employee. Time of notifi cation Notifi cation will occur at the earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer or agent of the written advice or the time of a telephone call advising the commencement of the audit or investigation. If the exact time of receipt of the written notice becomes crucial, it will be ascertained from the expected time for the mail to reach its destination as prescribed by section 14(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Any telephone call advising of an audit or investigation will be followed up by written advice as soon as possible. 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) Unannounced visits In the case of unannounced visits, the time of the notifi cation will be the date of fi rst contact with the taxpayer. Date an audit or investigation starts Section 141G(5) states that a tax audit or investigation starts at the earlier of: – the end of the fi rst interview an Inland Revenue offi cer has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s representative, after the taxpayer receives the notice, and – the time when: – an offi cer of Inland Revenue inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives notice, and – the time the taxpayer is notifi ed of the inspection. Taxpayer’s authorised representative present at interview If the taxpayer does not attend the fi rst interview but instead sends a representative, the taxpayer cannot claim the benefi t of a post-notifi cation disclosure for any additional tax shortfall revealed after the interview. This is the case even if the representative was not given any information by the taxpayer from which to make a disclosure. Disclosure by a subsidiary of a company An audit of a parent company, or a subsidiary of that company, may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries within the group. In such cases, disclosure would depend upon which entity had been notifi ed. If the parent company had received notifi cation that the audit was restricted to that entity, then any disclosure made by the subsidiary is voluntary disclosure prior to notifi cation of an audit. However, if another company in the group has been notifi ed that the audit is being extended, any disclosure made by that other company would be considered a disclosure after notifi cation of an audit. When a company has a branch or branches, they are considered to have been notifi ed at the same time as the company, as they are part of the company and not separate entities. Full disclosure Any voluntary disclosure will initially be considered, subject to the applicable time bar, as a request for an amendment of an assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The disclosure must be full and complete. It is not up to the Commissioner to elicit the required information from the taxpayer. This does not necessarily mean disclosing the discrepancies to the last dollar, but does require providing enough information to enable the auditor, investigator or offi cer to make an assessment. Each case will have to be considered on its own merits. If a taxpayer is not able to provide full details at the fi rst point of contact with Inland Revenue, the Commissioner will allow the taxpayer reasonable time to obtain more information. The time period for obtaining this information will be negotiated between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue offi cer. Once this information is provided and the disclosure is considered full and complete, the date of the voluntary disclosure will be the date of the fi rst point of contact. Minimum details required To satisfy full and complete disclosure, the following minimum details must be provided: – taxpayers details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth or incorporation, contact telephone number and contact times) – the nature of the errors or omissions – an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred – adequate information to enable an assessment of the tax shortfall to be made – a declaration signed by the taxpayer, if possible – further information as is necessary to make an assessment. Where this information is not provided, the Commissioner will consider on a case-by-case basis whether the information provided is suffi cient to satisfy the full and complete disclosure requirements. In doing so, the Commissioner will have regard to the taxpayer’s reasons for not making the specifi ed information available. More than one tax shortfall Each tax shortfall is considered separately. If there is more than one tax shortfall, one being the subject of voluntary disclosure and the other being detected by an audit, the shortfall detected by the audit will not come within the voluntary disclosure regime. If the items are identical or similar, they will be treated as one tax shortfall. Therefore, for a full and complete voluntary disclosure, both items will need to be disclosed prior to the end of the fi rst interview. If one of the items is not disclosed until after the fi rst interview, this will result in the taxpayer not satisfying the requirements of a full and complete disclosure. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002) 19 Disclosure of another tax type If an audit is being carried out on one tax type and the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure regarding another tax type, and they have not been notifi ed that the other tax type is being audited, the taxpayer will qualify for voluntary disclosure prior to notifi cation of an audit as long as the disclosure meets all other requirements. Disclosure of another period It is common for a notice of intention to carry out an audit to state that a particular year or period is to be audited, but previous years or periods may be looked at if necessary. The year or period referred to only is examined in the fi rst instance. If the taxpayer has not been advised that an earlier year or period is being examined, the taxpayer is able to make a pre-notifi cation disclosure for that year or period. Disclosure where Inland Revenue already knows of the shortfall In situations where the information provided is required by law or Inland Revenue knows there is a tax shortfall and has verifi cation of that shortfall, the taxpayer cannot make a voluntary disclosure. An example of this is when an employer fi les their employer monthly schedule without an accompanying payment. The employer cannot voluntarily disclose the non-payment of the PAYE as Inland Revenue will know that payment has not been made. For further information on this refer to Standard Practice Statement INV-260, Notifi cation of a Pending Audit or Investigation published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2. Disclosure forms Where possible it is desirable for the protection of both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue that disclosures be in writing and signed by the taxpayer. Voluntary disclosure (IR 282A) form, which covers both pre-notifi cation and post-notifi cation disclosures, has been prepared for this purpose. However, Inland Revenue will also accept other written and verbal disclosures without the need for the taxpayer to complete the form. Prosecution and Publication of Name If a voluntary disclosure is full and complete: • Inland Revenue will not consider prosecution action for pre-notifi cation disclosures. • In post-notifi cation cases, prosecution may be considered in cases of evasion or similar offences (those offences listed in section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). • There will be no publication of the taxpayer’s name in the New Zealand Gazette.

SETTING ASIDE OF BANKRUPTCY NOTICE Case: Moti Singh v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date: 5 April 2002 Act: Insolvency Act 1967 Keywords: Bankruptcy notice, application to set aside Summary The applicant was unsuccessful in his attempt to have a bankruptcy notice set aside. Facts A bankruptcy notice was issued on 16 November 2001 following the entry of a fi nal judgment for $84,473.94 in the District Court. The bankruptcy notice claimed an additional $10,247.08 in costs, making a total of $94,721.02. The debtor applied to have the notice set aside. The grounds advanced by the debtor to set aside the notice were that: 1. He had a counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand against the Commissioner that equalled or exceeded the amount claimed, which he could not have set up in the action in which judgment was obtained. 2. The Commissioner had seized approximately $87,000 from the debtor’s bank accounts dating back to November 1992 on the pretext that the debtor owed some $129,000 in outstanding taxes and various penalties. 3. He had persistently disputed the alleged tax liability and had requested the matter be determined by the TRA, which the Commissioner had been delaying. 4. The Commissioner had previously undertaken not to bankrupt him until his taxation appeal had been determined by the TRA. 5. The judgment upon which the Commissioner’s claim is based was defective and the debtor would be seeking judicial review of that judgment. 6. Unless his tax liability is fi nalised conclusively he is in no position to satisfy the judgment debt. 7. The Commissioner’s conduct in seeking the bankruptcy notice was an abuse of the process of the court and the Commissioner was motivated by vindictiveness and vendetta. The debtor also put forward Bill of Rights and Human Rights arguments relating to the right not to be subjected to cruel, degrading, inhuman or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment. Decision Master Gendall dealt with the application under section 19(1)(d) and section 20 of the Insolvency Act 1967, and rule 41 of the Insolvency Rules 1970. On the fi rst ground of the debtor’s application, the Master found that, while a credit of some $35,000 had already been given, there would still be a substantial amount outstanding under the bankruptcy notice, even if a further contingent tax credit were granted. He also noted that the debtor had not appealed or reviewed the judgment upon which the Commissioner relied in this matter, nor had the debtor appealed a separate tax matter decided in the TRA. Accordingly, the Master was not satisfi ed that the debtor had set up any matters that he could not have set up in the District Court proceedings, or similarly in any counterclaim, set-off or cross demand proceedings. The second ground was dismissed as having no substance in it for setting aside a bankruptcy notice. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002) 23 As to the third ground, Master Gendall noted that the debtor’s tax position had been conclusively determined by the TRA, and the debtor had been unable to place before the Court in the current proceedings any other material to support this ground. For his fourth ground, the debtor relied on an affi davit sworn by an offi cer of Inland Revenue. However, the affi davit pre-dated the entry of fi nal judgment against the debtor. There was no stay of execution of the fi nal judgment, and the debtor could not put forward any evidence to support his allegations in regard to this point. The ground was dismissed. The fi fth ground was also dismissed, as the debtor was unable to satisfy the Court that he would be seeking judicial review of the judgment and had any real prospects of success were he to do so. In order to succeed on the sixth ground, the debtor had to satisfy the Court that either – a) the amount of the judgment debt has been paid, or b) that the debtor has a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand that equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid and that he could not set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained. As previously noted by the Master, the debtor was unable to do this, and this ground, too, was dismissed. Likewise, the seventh ground was also dismissed. Master Gendall found no evidence of abuse of process or that the Commissioner was motivated by vindictiveness and vendetta. The Master then turned to the last of the grounds put forward by the debtor—the “novel” arguments raised under the Bill of Rights Act and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The debtor contended that the Commissioner’s “overwhelming desire” to bankrupt him breached section 9 and Article 7. However, nothing was placed before the Court to substantiate the claims and they were dismissed. Master Gendall also questioned the relevance of the arguments to the matter at hand. Accordingly, the debtor failed to satisfy the requirements of the Insolvency Act and the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was dismissed. CHILD SUPPORT APPEAL UNSUCCESSFUL, JUDICIAL REVIEW PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL Case: Philip Alan Johnson v CIR & Family Court at Waitakere & Tania Raewyn Hewitt Philip Alan Johnson v Tania Raewyn Hewitt & CIR Decision date: 20 March 2002 Act: Child Support Act 1991 Keywords: Departure orders, judicial review Summary The appellant (applicant) was unsuccessful in his appeal of the Family Court’s decision upholding the Commissioner’s determinations, but partially successful in his judicial review of the Commissioner’s determinations. Facts The Child Support Act 1991 provides a mechanism for determining the amount of child support a non-custodial parent is required to pay. This is known as the formula assessment and is based on the taxable income of that parent and other factors. However, either the liable parent or the custodial parent can apply for a departure from the formula assessment in certain cases. Mr Johnson and Ms Hewitt were married in 1993. Their son, Samuel, was born at the end of 1995 and they separated in 1996. Ms Hewitt, the custodial parent, applied to the Commissioner for departures from the formula assessment in November 1998 and again in February 2000. The November 1998 application resulted in a departure from the formula assessment, and Mr Johnson’s income was set at $38,000 for the purposes of determining his child support liability. The February 2000 application resulted in another departure order and Mr Johnson’s income being set at $36,000. Mr Johnson made an application to the Family Court for a departure order from the Commissioner’s determinations. The Family Court declined the application on 10 April 2001. This case was a combination of two proceedings. Mr Johnson appealed against a decision of the Family Court and also sought to judicially review the Commissioner’s determinations. 24 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) Decision The Appeal O’Regan J analysed the Child Support Act and the different roles of the Commissioner and the Family Court in determining child support liability. O’Regan J noted that Part 6A of the Act (which established a new procedure whereby parents could apply for departures from the formula assessment) had been overlayed on top of the existing Act with little indication as to how the new and old Parts were to interact. The two main issues focused on were whether the Family Court can make retrospective departure orders and whether the Family Court can make suspension orders that effectively terminate liability. O’Regan J concluded that the Family Court did not exercise an appellate function over determinations of the Commissioner and that its jurisdiction to review determinations was not limited to the specifi c grounds relied on by the applicant before the Commissioner. However, section 104 made it clear that the great majority of cases before the Family Court should have been fi rst heard by the Commissioner. O’Regan J also noted various problems with the legislative framework. There were inconsistencies in the right to go to the Family Court once the Commissioner has heard an application. O’Regan J considered that section 104 “requires a comprehensive overhaul, a task which rightly belongs to Parliament.” (paragraph \[46\]) O’Regan J set out a useful summary of the proper procedure most cases would follow at paragraph \[48\] of the judgment. An application to the Family Court is not an appeal, but rather a second overlapping review process. After analysing the legislation O’Regan J concluded that neither the Commissioner nor the Family Court has the power to make retrospective departure orders from assessments relating to a previous year, except in limited circumstances. O’Regan J also held that the power under section 117 to suspend or alter liability for payments was a temporary one. It could not be used to “effectively expunge a party’s liability.” (paragraph \[72\]) O’Regan J considered that, when the decision of the Family Court in this case was assessed against his analysis of the legislation, it was clear that Mr Johnson’s appeal could not succeed. His Honour concluded: “Mr Johnson’s appeal against the Family Court decision fails in all respects.” (paragraph \[78\]) The Judicial Review O’Regan J quickly disposed of the majority of Mr Johnson’s grounds for judicial review. His Honour held that the review offi cer was entitled to fi nd that Mr Johnson had the potential to earn more money as he had discretion to assess evidence and make conclusions. Similarly, the review offi cer could not be said to be wrong and unreasonable in concluding that Mr Johnson had failed to provide requisite information. It could not be said that the 1998 and 2000 determinations were without foundation. However, Mr Johnson was successful in his argument that the Commissioner had made an error of law in the 2000 determination in determining what the statutory phrase “earning capacity” meant in section 105(2)(c)(i) of the Child Support Act. O’Regan J considered that the Commissioner had interpreted the phrase “earning capacity” to mean “the potential to earn more money if steps are taken to improve one’s marketability or employment prospects.” (paragraph \[91\]) O’Regan J considered that “only the reasonable abilities of the liable parent and the opportunities reasonably available to him or her are to be assessed.” (paragraph \[95\]) O’Regan J concluded that the Act does not impose an obligation on a parent to increase their skill base in order to earn more money (and therefore pay more child support) beyond the requirement that he or she utilised their existing skills and opportunities. Therefore, O’Regan J ordered that the determination relating to the 2000 year be remitted back to the Commissioner for reconsideration in light of the correct understanding of the statutory language, as outlined in his judgment. 25 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) 26 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14 No 4 (April 2002) NON-STANDARD BALANCE DATE APPROVED FOR PIPFRUIT GROWERS The Commissioner has approved a non-standard balance date for pipfruit growers of 31 December. Currently, orchardists and pipfruit growers may apply for a non-standard balance date of 1 April to 30 June. With effect from the 2003 income year, pipfruit growers who meet the criteria for having a non-standard balance date, as set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994), may apply to the Commissioner to have a balance date of 31 December approved. For other orchardists, the Commissioner will continue to recognise that the period 1 April to 30 June may be appropriate.

Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Ltd as trustee of the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund (the “Fund”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3(5) and the definitions of “superannuation fund” and “qualifying trust” in section OB 1 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation by the Bank of New Zealand of a superannuation fund known as the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund. The operation of the Fund is governed by the Trust Deed dated 24 February 1997. The Trust Deed was amended on 23 March 2001 (“the Amended Trust Deed”). Details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Trustee of the Fund is BNZ Investment Management Ltd (“the Trustee”). The Fund acts as a “wholesale” superannuation fund into which other “retail” superannuation funds invest. The Fund also operates for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. The minimum investment amount required in respect of natural persons is $200,000. 2. The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, as are the “retail” superannuation funds which invest in it. 3. Members of the Fund will receive payments from the Fund on withdrawal of part or all of the relevant member’s account (being the account maintained for the member under the Trust Deed). Withdrawal may occur as a result of a request made at any time after a member attains the age of 50 years, on death of a member upon a request being made by the member’s legal personal representatives, or at any other time upon a withdrawal request being made by a member. 4. The Fund is a passive investment vehicle, investing only in a portfolio of equity securities each of which is listed on the NZSE. The Fund is managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities which together form the constituent part of an Index known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index (“the Index”). 5. The Index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSE, based on average weekly market capitalisation. The Fund is not subject to any active management as such. Rather, it is managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. The weighting of each security in the Index will reflect its respective market capitalisation on the NZSE at the relevant date. 6. The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in New Zealand tax law. If the equity security is listed on the NZSE and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. There is no discretion as to whether a grey-list country 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) security listed on the NZSE is included in the Index. The equity securities are normally shares but there may also be convertible notes. 7. The market capitalisation for securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand are calculated under the standard NZSE rules for weighting of non-New Zealand equities. 8. Where identical constituent securities exist in the market except for ownership restrictions (such as Air New Zealand A and B shares) (“identical securities”), the Index previously only included one of those constituent securities. The Index now includes all the identical securities. 9. Approximately 95% of the net asset value of the Fund is invested in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds are invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of the net assets of the Fund is maintained in order to minimise the number of sale and purchase transactions and to fund any daily net fund withdrawals and net fund inflows pending purchase of equity securities and to manage the liquidity of the Fund in respect of meeting anticipated liabilities, withdrawals and distributions. The cash pool is only invested in bank accounts, cash or futures contracts that give appropriate equity exposure. 10. Changes will only be made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) At the end of each quarter, securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period. If a security not previously included in the Index has risen at the quarter end above 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. The Trust Deed defines “quarter” as the three months ending on the 15th of April, July, October and January respectively. Currently, the quarterly rebalancing occurs at the end of a month. (b) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume of a security (over a 6-month period leading up to the end of the relevant quarter, after eliminating the highest and lowest months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. This requirement does not apply to a security listed on the NZSE for the first time until the end of the second complete quarter following listing. If there are less than 25 securities which meet the minimum liquidity requirements, then there may be less than 25 securities included in the Index. (c) If an event such as a share issue or share buy-back occurs so as to increase or decrease the number of any constituent security on issue and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the last adjustment, is less than 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, an adjustment to the Index will be made, subject to five business days’ notice, on the 15th of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. (d) If a security is listed on the NZSE for the first time, it will be included in the Index in the month of listing if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period); and (ii) at least 25% of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. If the security is listed before the 15th day of the month, it will be included in the Index on the 15th day and otherwise will be included at the end of the month. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. If a security listed on the NZSE for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) 14. Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Fund (other than those in the cash pool) will only occur in the following circumstances: (a) If the Fund is ever wound up. (b) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Fund no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. (c) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by investing superannuation funds or natural persons which cannot be met out of the cash pool. (d) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. In respect of the events under subparagraphs (a) to (d), sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 15. A fee is payable to the Trustee of 0.3% per annum of the value of the net assets of the Fund. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. b) “Retail” funds which invest in the Fund are registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The Fund is a “superannuation fund” as defined in section OB 1. •The Fund is a “qualifying trust” under paragraph (b) of the definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1 of the Act. (e) If the Trustee recommends, and the Fund’s auditors agree, the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to the rules governing the NZSE 40 Index structure made by the NZSE. (f) If there is a merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court for 100% of the issued securities of a company: (i) the company’s securities will be removed from the Index when the offeror or acquiror becomes entitled to, and announces that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition; and (ii) if the offer has less than 100% acceptance, but nevertheless proceeds and, at that time or any time after the merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement proceeds, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable as a result of the merger or takeover offer, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. 11. The Trustee will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. In circumstances where the Trustee is using best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible, deviation from the Index may occur where it is not possible to exactly replicate the Index for one or more of the following reasons: (a) The time taken to buy equities; (b) Difficulties in acquiring equities; (c) Rounding errors; or (d) Price fluctuations but in any such case deviation from the Index will not exceed the following levels: (a) in the case of securities the Index weighting of which is 10% or greater of the total Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no larger than 1% of the Index; or (b) in the case of securities whose Index weighting is less than 10% of the Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no greater than 10% of the relevant security’s weighting in the Index. 12. The Trustee has appointed an independent party (the Fund’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Fund have conformed to these criteria. 13. The minimum subscription amount for a natural person investing in the Fund is $200,000. The Trustee is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, i.e. a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Fund tracking the then Index composition. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) •By virtue of section HH 3(5), any amounts received by investors from the Fund shall not be included in the gross income of the investor. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20th day of March 2002 Martin SmithMartin Smith Martin SmithMartin Smith Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Public Trustee as trustee of the BNZ NZ Equity Index Trust (“the Trust”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b) and CF 3(7) and the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of the Trust which holds a portfolio of securities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”) and the repurchase by the Manager of, or arranging for the redemption of, units in the Trust for the Unit Holders. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Bank of New Zealand (“the Settlor”) formed a unit trust, under the Unit Trusts Act 1960 known as BNZ NZ Equity Index Trust (“the Trust”). The operation of the Trust is governed by the Trust Deed dated 19 March 1997 as amended by Deeds of Modification dated 26 November 1998 and 23 March 2001. The Trust is managed by BNZ Investment Management Limited (“the Manager”) and its trustee is the Public Trustee (“the Trustee”). Members of the public hold units in the Trust and units in the Trust are offered to new investors continuously. 2. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle, managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities which together form the constituent part of the Index (“the Index”), known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index. The index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSE. The Trust will not be subject to any active management as such. Rather, it will be managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. 3. The Index is an equivalent of the well-known NZSE 10 and NZSE 40 indices, except that it will comprise up to 25 of the largest listed New Zealand equity securities, measured by average weekly market capitalisation. As with the NZSE 10 and NZSE 40 indices, the weighting of each security in the Index reflects its respective market capitalisation on the NZSE at the relevant date. The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in the New Zealand tax law. 4. If the equity security is listed on the NZSE and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. The equity securities are normally shares, but there may also be convertible notes. 5. The market capitalisation for securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand are calculated under the standard NZSE rules for weighting of non-New Zealand equities. 6. Where identical constituent securities exist in the market except for ownership restrictions (such as Air New Zealand A and B shares), the Index previously only included one of those constituent securities. The Index now includes all the identical securities. 7. Approximately 95% of the net asset value of the Trust Fund of the Trust is invested in such investments as the Manager considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds are invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of the net assets of the Trust is maintained in order to minimise the number of sale and purchase transactions and to fund any daily net fund withdrawals and net fund inflows pending purchase of equity securities and to manage the liquidity of the Trust in respect of meeting anticipated liabilities, withdrawals and distributions. The cash pool is only invested in bank accounts, cash, derivatives or futures contracts that give appropriate equity exposure. 8. The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit that will confer a proportional interest in the Trust) confers an equal interest in the Trust, but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Trust or any investment of the Trust. 9. Changes are made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) At the end of each quarter, securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period. If a security not previously included in PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 02/03 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) the Index has risen at the quarter-end above 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. The Trust Deed defines “quarter” as the three months ending on the 15th of April, July, October and January respectively. Currently, the quarterly rebalancing occurs at the end of a month. The change in date is purely administrative, that is, to avoid clashing with the end of the financial year of the Trust and to avoid the inconvenience resulting from the high level of market activity at that time. (b) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume of a security (over a 6-month period leading up to the end of the relevant quarter, after eliminating the highest and lowest months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. This requirement does not apply to a security listed on the NZSE for the first time until the end of the second complete quarter following listing. If there are less than 25 securities which meet the minimum liquidity requirements, then there may be less than 25 securities included in the Index. (c) If an event such as a share issue or share buy-back occurs so as to increase or decrease the number of any constituent security on issue and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the last adjustment, is less that 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, an adjustment to the Index will be made, subject to five business days’ notice, on the 15th day or the last day (whichever next follows the relevant increase or decrease) of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. (However, it should be noted that if there is a rights issue to existing security holders including the Trustee, the Manager will endeavour to take up the rights issue in anticipation of the change to the Index which is expected to result from the issue.) (d) If a security is listed on the NZSE for the first time, it will be included in the Index in the month of listing if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period); and (ii) at least 25% of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. If the security is listed before the 15th day of the month, it will be included in the Index on the 15th day and otherwise will be included at the end of the month. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. If a security listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. (e) If the Manager recommends, and the independent party (the Trust’s auditors) agrees, the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to the rules governing the NZSE 40 Index structure made by the NZSE. (f) If there is a merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court for 100% of the issued securities of a company: (i) the company’s securities will be removed from the Index when the offeror or acquiror becomes entitled to, and announces that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition; and (ii) if the offer has less than 100% acceptance but nevertheless proceeds and, at that time or any time after the merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement proceeds, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable as a result of the merger, take over offer or scheme of arrangement, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) 10. The criteria stipulated in paragraph 9 (with the exception of subparagraphs (d), (e), and (f)) are similar to the criteria adopted with regard to the NZSE 10 Index. The Manager has appointed an independent party (the Trust’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Trust have conformed to these criteria. 11. The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. In circumstances where the Manager is using best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible, deviation from the Index may occur where it is not possible to exactly replicate the Index for one or more of the following reasons: (a) The time taken to buy equities; (b) Difficulties in acquiring equities; (c) Rounding errors; or (d) Price fluctuation but in any such case deviation from the Index will not exceed the following tolerance levels: (a) in the case of securities the Index weighting of which is 10% or greater of the total Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no larger than 1% of the Index; or (b) in the case of securities whose Index weighting is less than 10% of the Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no greater than 10% of the relevant security’s weighting in the Index. 12. The minimum subscription amount for units in the Trust is $5,000. Investors are able to subscribe for units in the Trust by making a cash payment. The Manager is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, i.e. a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Trust tracking the then Index composition. 13. Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust (other than those in the cash pool) only occurs in the following circumstances: (a) If the Trust is ever wound up either by sale of securities for cash and distribution of the cash, or alternatively by distribution of securities in specie to investors holding units in the Trust. (b) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Trust no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. Any such disposition will not involve any discretionary exercise of investment management powers. (c) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Trust by investors holding units in the Trust. It is expected that dispositions of securities to fund withdrawals will be likely on at most a weekly basis. It will be possible for the Trustee to satisfy a withdrawal request by distributing a basket of securities in specie. (d) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Trust that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. In respect of the events under subparagraphs (a) to (d), sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 14. A fee is payable to the Trustee of 0.07% per annum of the net assets of the Trust, calculated and accruing on a daily basis. A management fee is to be payable to the Manager of 0.95% per annum of the net assets of the Trust, calculated and accruing on a daily basis. No other general management fee will be levied, but it is contemplated that front-end promotion fees (entry fees) will be payable. 15. Any income on the held securities received by the Trustee in respect of the Fund is distributed, on an annual basis, to investors holding units in the Trust at that point in time. To the extent that the distribution can be fully imputed, an amount equal to taxable gross income is allocated to Unit Holders and reinvested, normally annually, by the Manager into new units on behalf of the Unit Holders. The Unit Holders, therefore, derive dividends for tax purposes. In addition, it is possible that the Trust may on occasions distribute cash amounts on account of taxable gross income. 16. The Trust will generally determine dates of allocation of entitlements and the distribution periods to which entitlements relate in terms of clauses 32 and 33 of the Trust Deed so that investors receive distributions just prior to the 31 March of each year. 17. Under clause 32 of the Deed, the Manager is required to allocate taxable gross income to Unit Holders, and reinvest those amounts into new units on behalf of the Unit Holders. To the extent that the distribution can be fully imputed, an amount equal to taxable gross income will be allocated to Unit Holders and reinvested, normally annually, by the Manager into new Units on behalf of the Unit Holders. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) Any departure from this practice can only occur if Unit Holders elect to have their entitlements distributed in cash pursuant to clause 33.4 of the Trust Deed. 18. Unit Holders are able to redeem their units at any time by giving notice, in the form of a repurchase request, to the Manager. Their units are redeemed at a price equal to the net assets of the Trust (adjusted to take into account the costs of selling the net assets of the Trust) at the time, divided by the number of units on issue. 19. It is possible for the Manager to purchase the units from the Unit Holders as an alternative to redemption. Where units are repurchased, the Manager pays the Unit Holder a price equal to the net assets of the Trust (adjusted to take into account the costs of selling the net assets of the Trust) at the time, divided by the number of units on issue. 20. The issuing of units and their redemption will be effected directly by the Trustee. No units are otherwise quoted on the official list of any “recognised exchange”, as defined in section OB 1. All units will be issued on terms that the reverse ordering rule applies. 21. Any cancellation of units will only be effected in order to allow Unit Holders to exit the Trust or decrease their holding in the Trust, unless an investor’s unit holding falls below a minimum value specified in the Trust Deed, in which case the Manager can require the Unit Holder to redeem their units. Units will also be cancelled in the event that the Trust is liquidated 22.Except in the event of liquidation of the Trust, any cancellation of units will be in response to the activities of a particular Unit Holder, and not all the Unit Holders of the Trust. All redemptions will be of whole units (including whole fractional units), not part units. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) Subject only to the second paragraph of this condition, the proportion of the Applicant’s assets to be held as the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the cash pool (as described in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Ruling), and will not in any event exceed 5% of the total assets of the Trust. This condition will not be regarded as being breached if, pending investment of contributions or disbursement of the redemption proceeds, the Trust is forced to hold cash in excess of 5% of the net asset value of the Trust. In any such case the excess will only be to the extent, and exist only for the time, that is strictly necessary in order to invest contributions or disburse redemption proceeds and the Trust will invest or disburse such cash, as soon as possible. b) The cash pool must not be used in order to increase the performance of the Trust or to enhance the Trust Fund’s value. To the extent that the operation of the cash pool seeks to obtain the maximum market rate of return on cash pool investments, any such maximisation will not of itself be taken to be a breach of this condition. c) The reason for changing the end of the quarter from the end of the relevant month (being March, June, September, and December) to the 15th of the relevant month (being, April, July, October and January) is purely administrative. It is to avoid the need to undertake the re-balancing and matters associated with the end of the financial year of the Trust at the same time, and also to avoid a flurry of activities in the market at that time because of the large number of “passive” index-linked funds that are in existence in the market and rebalance then. The purpose of this change is not to increase the performance of the Trust or enhance the value of the share capital in the Trust. (d) The Manager will not exercise its discretion under clauses 32 and 33 of the Deed to determine the dates of allocation of entitlements and the distribution periods to which entitlements relate to increase the performance of the Trust or to enhance the Trust Fund’s value. (e) The Manager will only depart from the requirement to reinvest taxable distributions for Unit Holders in further units upon a written request from Unit Holders to do so pursuant to clause 33.4 of the Deed. (f) The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. In circumstances where the Manager is using best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible, deviation from the Index may occur where it is not possible to exactly replicate the Index for one or more of the following reasons: (i) The time taken to buy equities; (ii) Difficulties in acquiring equities; (iii) Rounding errors; or (iv) Price fluctuations, 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) but in any such case, deviation from the Index will not exceed the following levels: (i) in the case of securities the Index weighting of which is 10% or greater of the total Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no larger than 1% of the Index; or (ii) in the case of securities whose Index weighting is less than 10% of the Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no greater than 10% of the relevant security’s weighting in the Index. g) Decisions by the Manager not to participate in dividend reinvestment plans will only be made to avoid an acquisition of equity securities that would lead to the Trust not tracking the Index. h) Dispositions resulting from changes to the Trust Deed, and the resultant inclusion of dual-listed securities and the inclusion of identical constituent securities will only occur once, and any disposition will not be to increase the performance of the Trust or to enhance the Trust Fund’s value or involve any discretionary exercise of investment management powers. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Except in relation to Unit Holders who are non-resident companies holding 20% or more of the units in the Trust, and subject in all respects to the conditions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Amounts paid from the Trust to Unit Holders on redemption of units do not constitute amounts paid in lieu of dividends for the purposes of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii). •Equity securities of the Trust constitute “capital assets” for the purposes of section CF 3 (7) and the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3 (14). •For the purposes of the definition of the term “excess return amount” in section CF 3 (14), gains realised on dispositions of equity securities by the Trust are capital gain amounts available for distribution to Unit Holders at the time of winding up of the Trust in the present circumstances where prior distributions of amounts to Unit Holders on redemption of units will be treated as falling outside the definition of the term “dividend”, as a result of the application of section CF 3 (1)(b) and the reverse ordering rule. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of March 2002. Martin SmithMartin Smith Martin SmithMartin Smith Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Sovereign Services (NZ) Limited. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of the following sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: •Income Tax Act 1994, sections BD 1, BD 2, EH 1- EH 10, HH 1(8), HH 3 to HH 8 and the definitions of “unit trust”, “beneficiary income”, “trustee income”, “core acquisition price”, “financial arrangement” and “unit holders” in section OB 1. •Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 3, 14 and 55(7) and the definition of “insurance” in section 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment, administration and carrying on of the Select Investor Service (“the Service”) by Sovereign Services (NZ) Limited (“SSNZL”). SSNZL is the agent of Investors in the Service and the Manager of the Service. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. SSNZL (formerly called Colonial Services (NZ) Limited) launched the Service \[previously known as “Navigator Select Investor Service”\] during August 1998, and for that purpose obtained Product Ruling BR Prd 98/71, and subsequently BR Prd 00/01. This Ruling replaces BR Prd 00/01 which expires on 31 March 2002. 2. The Service provides access for Investors to a range of investment products and fund managers with all reporting consolidated. It is open to all potential investors though at the option of SSNZL where the Service is promoted through a particular distribution channel or adviser it may be co-branded with the name of the distributor, though always retaining the word “Select”. 3. The Administrator of the Service is Aegis Limited (“Aegis”), a subsidiary in the Sovereign group of companies. This role may be assigned to another entity in the Sovereign group from time to time without affecting in any way the duties of the Administrator. This Ruling applies only to those activities of the Administrator that are carried on in relation to the Service and are described in this Arrangement. 4. The Custodian and bare trustee of the Service, and the Nominee of the Investors, is the Public Trustee acting at all times through its nominee and wholly owned subsidiary, Navigator Nominees Limited (“NNL”), who may also act as the trustee of any superannuation scheme made available through the Service. 5. Investors are able to switch between investment options and make lump sum or regular contributions and withdrawals. 6. Investors are offered the choice of investing in: (i) unit trusts (New Zealand, Australian and elsewhere); (ii)group investment funds (“GIFs”); and (iii) UK Investment Trusts. 7. Possibly in the future a master superannuation fund will be added. The superannuation fund will in turn offer a choice of investment in wholesale superannuation funds, GIFs and unit trusts. In addition, Investors may be offered the facility to invest in “direct” investment securities on a case by case basis including: participatory securities, interest bearing securities, and shares other than unit trusts, group investment funds and Investment Trusts. 8. The Manager will approve the various unit trusts, GIFs and the Investment Trusts selected by Jarden Morgan Investment Services Limited from time to time based on performance. Investors will be entitled to select their own “direct” investments if that option is offered to the Investors. 9. In addition to the various investment options, Investors may also elect to include supplementary insurance benefits such as life cover, total and permanent disablement, trauma cover and income cover. 10. Investors in the Service may be supplied with both life and non-life insurance cover through the Service. 11. Investors come to SSNZL to use the Service through their financial advisers. The Manager, the PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 02/04 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) Administrator and the Custodian of the Service act only as directed by Investors and do not give any investment advice or make any investment decisions under delegated authority from the Investors. Jarden Morgan Investment Services Limited under contract to SSNZL selects the product mix of the Service and makes the asset allocation decisions of the premixed selection options. 12. Reporting to Investors under the Service is purely to provide information to Investors on details of their investments and income from their investments as well as to deliver an annual statement for taxation purposes. The reports do not constitute what is regarded in the industry as “monitoring” nor do they contain investment advice. 13. The Investors’ agent and Manager of the Service is SSNZL. The Manager of the Service is appointed as the Investors’ agent pursuant to an investment authority given under the Investor Information Document (“the IID”) to instruct the Custodian to acquire, dispose of, and receive the income from investments on behalf of the Investor. 14. The Administrator is charged under the Administration Agreement primarily with making and withdrawing from investments on behalf of Investors as well as collecting and processing the cash flows that arise from them. As an adjunct to that activity it must carry out the consequential administration, reporting and record keeping activities that make up the Service. 15. Investors under the IID appoint the Custodian to act as bare trustee and nominee in subscribing for and holding investments in safe custody in its name on their behalf. Investors undertake to be bound by the terms of the Custodian Agreement, and authorise the Manager to delegate its powers (including those delegated to it by the Custodian) to the Administrator. 16. The Custodian also establishes a trust account under the Cash Holding Account Agreement to facilitate all the cash flows of the Service. The administration and management of that account is delegated to the Manager who in turn delegates it to the Administrator. 17. An Investor who wishes to use the Service will be handed an IID, which will: (i) Background the structure of the Service. (ii)Explain in general terms the operation of the pertinent Administration, Custodian, Delegation and Cash Holding Account Agreements (together with the IID described in this Ruling as “the Agreements”) by which the Service is implemented. (iii)Contain detachable application forms and an Investment Authority by which Investors can identify their investment selections. 18. An Investor wishing to use the Service will then make application and execute an Investment Authority under which the Investor will: (i) Provide a declaration pursuant to which Investors will: authorise the Manager and Custodian to act as their agent and bare trustee/nominee respectively, be bound by the Custodian Agreement, and consent to the delegation of services to the Administrator. (ii)Confirm the Investor’s receipt of investment statements for each option selected. 19. Investors in products other than the superannuation fund first pay their moneys into a Cash Holding Account of the Custodian run by the Administrator who records and identifies by Investor all deposits, investments, income, withdrawals, expenses, and tax information. From this account the Administrator as delegate of the Manager disperses funds into Investors’ various investment options. Interest and dividend income as well as sale proceeds and further investment moneys are all received into the Cash Holding Account which acts as a general clearing account for all funds received from or to be disbursed to Investors. Investors are required to maintain a minimum credit balance in this account. 20. Investors in the superannuation scheme (if made available) will become direct members of the scheme, and their investment choices are activated as members of the scheme. 21. Investors expressly acknowledge receipt of an investment statement (and at their option a prospectus) where one has been issued from their financial adviser for each product that they select, including the superannuation scheme (if made available). 22. The relevant documentation is: (i) The Administration Agreement, being an agreement between the Manager and the Administrator. (ii)The Custodian Agreement, being an agreement between the Manager and the Custodian. (iii)The Cash Holding Account Agreement between the Custodian and the Manager. (iv) The IID (and the Investment Authority given under the IID by the Investor) between the Manager, the Investor and the Investor’s financial adviser. 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) (v) The Delegation Agreement between the Manager and the Custodian. 23. The Investor undertakes in the IID to be bound by the three other agreements relevant to the Investor. 24. Title to investments is held by the Custodian, and the Cash Holding Account is also in the name of the Custodian. 25. The Administrator will operate the Cash Holding Account, record and trace all investments made by individual Investors, and report to them at regular intervals on the value of their investments, the income derived and any tax deductions made. 26. The Administrator under the Administration Agreement provides a means of recording each Investor’s interest in the underlying products. 27. The Custodian Agreement at paragraph 2.1(e) expressly describes the pooling as aggregation for “administrative convenience”. The pooling is subject to the proviso that adequate tracing be maintained at all times. 28. Taking into account the effect of delegations, the essence of the Agreements can be summarised as follows: (i) The Manager provides the entire facility and arranges for investments to be made, changed, or sold by instructing the Custodian as the Investor’s agent. (ii)The Custodian holds title to the investments and the Cash Holding Account as bare trustee for each Investor. (iii)The Administrator makes, changes or sells the investments, pays and collects the resulting cash flows and attends to all consequential administration, processing, record keeping and reporting requirements of the Service. 29. The services rendered in respect of each fee charged in relation to the Service are: (i) Investment/Contribution fee: •Processing applications by Investors. •Arranging the acquisition of investments. •Providing four switches per annum. •Providing documentation. (ii)Administration fee: •Keeping records of Investors and their portfolios. •Investor level transaction recording and tracing. •Maintaining a computer system that delivers the service requirements. •Allocating and processing distributions for Investors. •Reporting to Investors and preparation of Investor tax statements. •Executing proxies and voting rights of the Custodian. •Reporting to the Custodian. •Maintaining Investors’ Cash Holding Accounts. •Responding to Investor queries about the Service. (iii)Custodian fee: •Use of the Custodian’s name as security holder. (The tasks of subscribing, safe custody and withdrawing from the investments are delegated to the Administrator, leaving the Custodian merely lending his or her name as security holder for the investment.) (iv) Switching fee: •Processing investment switches. (v) Expense fee: •Printing and distributing Investor information documentation, investment statements and prospectuses, excluding establishment expenses of the Service. •Audit, accounting and legal compliance services, excluding establishment expenses of the Service. (vi) Regular withdrawal fee: •Direct crediting money to accounts for singular/regular withdrawals. (vii)Withdrawal fee: •Processing withdrawal applications. (viii)Adviser service fee: •Supplying financial planning and portfolio monitoring services. (ix)Fund manager fee: •On-going charging for management (investment and administration) of GIFs or unit trusts (where charged to the Investor by the Fund Manager or trustee) for: 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) - Annual management costs. - On-going monitoring of the investments. - Purchasing and selling investments. - Maintaining computer system to record investments. - Receiving and processing distributions. - Reporting to Investors. - Reporting to trustee. - Responding to customer queries. - Acting as trustee. - Use of the trustee/statutory supervisor’s name as security holder. (The tasks of subscribing, safe custody and withdrawing from the investments are delegated to the Manager, leaving the trustee/ statutory supervisor merely lending his or her name as security holder for the investment.) - Maintaining register of Investors. - Accounting and legal fees excluding establishment expenses of the fund. - Preparing and distributing cheques and statements. - Printing stationary. - Cost of holding investor meetings. - Any other miscellaneous cost incurred in managing the funds. - Issuing expenses. (x) Brokerage fee: •Brokerage paid to broker to arrange entry into listed trusts. •Brokerage paid to broker to arrange exit from listed trusts. (xi)Insurance cover: •The supply of life insurance cover. •The supply of non-life insurance cover. 30. The way in which each fee is calculated is set out in the Agreements. The rates and methods used to calculate such fees may be varied from time to time. However, any type of fee not described above, charged in the future, will not be subject to this Ruling. 31. The adviser service fee, the fund manager fee and the brokerage fee are not charged by the Manager, Custodian or the Administrator of the Service. Investors through the Service pay these fees for services supplied to them through the Service by their adviser, fund managers and brokers. This Ruling does not consider the goods and services tax treatment of the adviser services fee, the fund manager fee and the brokerage fee paid by Investors. 32. In respect of the fees charged by fund managers, a separate contribution fee is ordinarily charged for set up costs. Due to the size of the investment through the Service, the fund managers have waived this fee for Investors through the Service. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumption: a) The Investors are resident in New Zealand under section OE 1 or OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The final form of the Agreements will not differ materially from the draft Agreements received by Adjudication & Rulings on 16 March 1999 and 23 June 1999. The changes contained in the new schedule B to the Administration Agreement as a result of the assignment of the Agreement to Aegis, which was provided to Adjudication & Rulings on 27 November 2001, are not material to the Ruling. b) Where an Investor is under a legal disability, the Manager, Administrator and the Custodian will not have or exercise the receipt, control, or disposition of any income derived by that investor, but may act on the instructions of whomsoever the law gives the capacity to act on behalf of that Investor. No additional powers accrue to the Manager, Administrator or the Custodian because of a lack of capacity of an Investor beneficiary so as to change the nature of the bare trust relationship. c) Except for the non-life insurance cover supplied to Investors through the Service, the investments and facilities available through the Service are any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) referred to in section 3(1)(ka) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. d) The fees described in this Ruling are charged only for the services listed under each fee in the Arrangement. e) The fees charged by the Administrator to the Manager under the Administration Agreement will be negotiated on an arm’s length basis. f) The Manager, Custodian and the Administrator undertake no services that, either directly or indirectly through the selection of the product mix of the Service, involve planning an Investor’s portfolio or advising on an Investor’s portfolio or making investment decisions or recommendations for an Investor. g) Sovereign makes goods and services tax returns as a group under the provisions of section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. h) The only activities carried on by the Administrator in relation to the Service are as described in the Arrangement to this Ruling. i) The Manager will only disapprove investments in “direct” investment securities (if that option is offered to Investors) if, and only if, the purchase of a particular share or investment on behalf of the customer will, in the reasonable and bona fide view of the Manager: •Result in excessive costs to the Manager due to administrative complexity; or •Be unlawful or contrary to the Manager’s own interests; or •Expose the Manager to use its own funds with respect to uncalled or partly paid shares. j) Any fee that is charged in relation to the Service is on an arm’s length, stand alone commercial basis so as only to reflect the relevant services listed and will not be directly or indirectly related to or affected by any other services or fees. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The Service, to be launched to the public by SSNZL, as the Manager and the Investors’ agent, Aegis Limited as the Administrator, and NNL as the Custodian of the Service pursuant to a bare trust, is not a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1 and the Investors are not “unit holders” as also defined in section OB 1. •As a consequence of Investors having direct ownership of their investment choices, the income from investments made by the Investors through the Service and held by the Custodian, will be gross income of the relevant Investor under section BD 1, and not the Manager, the Administrator or the Custodian. •All the fees listed in the Arrangement that are paid by an Investor who is liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service, are deductible to that Investor under section BD 2, except to the extent that the fees (not being either contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” or non-contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” but exceeding 2% of the “core acquisition price” of a “financial arrangement” as those terms are defined in the qualified accrual rules) are incurred in gaining or producing exempt income or an amount that is excluded from being gross income. •The following fees are not deductible to an Investor who is not liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service: •The investment/contribution fee. •The withdrawal fee. •The brokerage fee. •The switching fee. •The adviser service fee to the extent that it relates to planning services. •The following fees paid by an Investor who is not liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service, are deductible to that Investor under section BD 2 except to the extent that the fees (not being either contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” or non-contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” but exceeding 2% of the “core acquisition price” of a “financial arrangement” as those terms are defined in the qualified accrual rules) are incurred in gaining or producing exempt income or an amount that is excluded from being gross income: •The administration fee. •The custodian fee. •The expense fee. •The regular withdrawal fee. 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) •The fund manager fee. •The adviser service fee to the extent that it relates to monitoring services. •The fees paid by the Manager in relation to the Service to the Administrator, or to any broker, agent, or associate of the Administrator, or to any independent research resource, are deductible under section BD 2 by the Manager. •GST is payable in respect of any fees charged for non-life insurance cover to Investors through the Service. •Except for any fees charged for non-life insurance cover to Investors through the Service, the fees listed in the Arrangement in this Ruling that are charged by the Manager, the Custodian and the Administrator in relation to the Service are exempt from GST by reason of the application of section 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. •The representative member of the Sovereign group is required to make a return of goods and services tax under section 55(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in respect of any fee charged for the Administrator’s services supplied in relation to the Service, where Investors are supplied with non-life insurance cover through the Service. •There is no requirement for the representative member of the Sovereign group to make a return of goods and services tax under section 55(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, in respect of the Administrator’s services supplied in relation to the Service, except where Investors are supplied with non-life insurance cover through the Service. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 2002 until 30 June 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28 th day of March 2002. Martin SmithMartin Smith Martin SmithMartin Smith Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) NEW LEGISLATION TAX PROVISIONS OF NEW ZEALAND STOCK EXCHANGE RESTRUCTURING ACT 2002 Introduction The New Zealand Stock Exchange Act was enacted on 22 February 2002. The purpose of the Act is to: •enable a qualifying member's ownership entitlement in the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE) to be determined; •provide a mechanism for the conversion of the NZSE into a company, if the NZSE members decide this course of action; •allow all the property, rights, and liabilities of the NZSE to vest on the restructuring day in the company that the NZSE becomes or a wholly owned subsidiary of that company; and •treat the company and the NZSE as the same person upon its conversion. The Act also contains tax provisions addressing specific tax issues related to the NZSE's conversion. Background The NZSE, a body corporate, was established by statute in 1981 to take over the rights and responsibilities of the previous four regional exchanges. This current corporate form does not allow the NZSE, a private organisation, to operate a modern and flexible corporate governance structure. The New Zealand Stock Exchange Restructuring Act 2002 provides a mechanism for the conversion of the NZSE into a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993, if its members so choose. The NZSE Board is required to prepare a restructuring proposal that, amongst other things, sets out a method for establishing, or a statement as to which qualifying members have a ownership entitlement and the extent of that ownership entitlement. Key features If the NZSE members approve the restructuring plan and the NZSE converts into a company, on the restructuring day the company must issue shares to the qualifying members in accordance with their ownership entitlements. Section 15(1) of the New Zealand Stock Exchange Restructuring Act provides that the issue of such shares is not a dutiable gift for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. “Restructuring day” means the day specified as the restructuring day by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Section 15(2) of the New Zealand Stock Exchange Restructuring Act provides for the purposes of Income Tax Act 1994 that: •qualifying members will acquire the shares issued for a cost equal to the value immediately before the restructuring day of member's ownership entitlement as determined under the method or statement referred to in the restructuring proposal; and •those members will have held shares and voting interest attributable to those shares at all times prior to the restructuring day. Application date The tax related provisions apply from the day of enactment, 23 February 2002. 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. MODULAR NYLON TILE CARPETS DRAFT GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION Please quote reference: DDG00057 We have been asked to review the basic economic depreciation rate applying to “Carpets” under the “Residential Rental Property Chattels”, “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars” and “Shops” industry categories and the “Building Fit-out” asset category as it applies to carpets constructed of modular nylon carpet tiles. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination which will insert a new asset class “Carpets (modular nylon tile construction)” into the “Residential Rental Property Chattels”, “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars” and “Shops” industry categories and the “Building Fit-out” asset category. It is also proposed to amend the description of the existing “Carpets” asset class to “Carpets (other than modular nylon tile construction)” in those same industry and asset categories. The “Carpets (modular nylon tile construction)” will have a depreciation rate of 12% DV (8% SL), based on an estimated useful life of 15.5 years while the depreciation rate for “Carpets (other than modular nylon tile construction)” of 33% DV (24% SL) based on an estimated useful life of five years, remains unchanged. The draft determination follows. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on the estimated useful life set out in the draft determination and a residual value of 13.5%. This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” acquired on or after the date this determination is made. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Deleting from the “Residential Rental Property Chattels”, “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars” and “Shops” industry categories and the “Building Fit-out” asset category, the general asset class, estimated useful life, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: General asset class DV banded depín rate (%) Estimated useful life (years) SL equivalent banded depín rate (%) 52433 Carpets 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) •Inserting into the “Residential Rental Property Chattels”, “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars” and “Shops” industry categories and the “Building Fit-out” asset category, the general asset classes, estimated useful lives, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: 3.

Keywords:Keywords: Keywords:Keywords: Keywords: Tax Avoidance, Evidence Exclusion Rule Facts Two dentists practising in partnership restructured their existing dental practice as two trading trusts. This decision concerns only one of the trading trusts and former partners. Decision The TRA decision is an interim decision, apparently as the TRA has requested further evidence to determine the 1996-year. A question arises as to whether the TRA is at liberty to act on any further evidence, because of S 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The TRA made the following findings: •The restructuring was an arrangement within S 99/76 and SS BB 9 and GB 1 of the 1994 Act. •The purpose of the arrangement was tax avoidance for 1995, but not for 1996. •For 1995, the effect of the arrangement in terms of tax saving is merely incidental. As noted above, Judge Barber indicated he has not come to a final decision, and has requested further evidence in respect of the effect of the arrangement in 1996. •On the evidence exclusion argument, the TRA found that any sensible consideration of the issues must cover what took place, which involves looking at whether a reduction in tax actually occurred or could occur. The TRA considered that while the statement of position did not specifically raise the change in balance date argument, the argument was merely a refinement of argument based on available evidence. He accepted a submission from the taxpayer that S 138G is not designed to close off avenues of argument from disclosed facts, it is only designed to stop a taxpayer from producing new documents and arguments at the last moment.

Leave to go to Privy Council Summary The applicants were unsuccessful in their application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Facts This case relates to certain participants of a well-known tax avoidance scheme developed by Mr J G Russell, an Auckland accountant. Mr Russell’s template has been held to be a tax avoidance arrangement (see the Privy Council in O’Neil v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051). 25 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) This case was an application for conditional leave to apply to the Privy Council against a judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 14 March 2002 ((2002) 20 NZTC 17,624). The Court of Appeal’s decision was an appeal and cross-appeal from a High Court decision of O’Regan J, delivered on 9 May 2001 ((2001) 20 NZTC 17,166). That decision was a judicial review application relating to two earlier Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) cases, Case U35 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,330 and Case U41 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,380. The Commissioner had attempted to have a number of cases stated, relating to Mr Russell’s template, heard in the High Court rather than the TRA. The taxpayers resisted this course of action. In Case U35 the TRA granted the Commissioner leave to file the cases stated in the TRA out of time. The taxpayers attempted to appeal Case U35 to the High Court. In Case U41 the TRA refused to allow an appeal of Case U35 and struck out the application. The taxpayers/applicants judicially reviewed the two TRA decisions. The applicants were largely successful before O’Regan J in the High Court (O’Regan J ordered Judge Barber to reconsider his decision in Case U35), but appealed certain points where they had been unsuccessful. The Commissioner cross-appealed on all points where he was unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeal and allowed the Commissioner’s cross-appeal. Effectively the TRA’s decision in Case U35 was upheld, as was the decision in Case U41. The applicants sought conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council from the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 14 March 2002. To obtain leave the applicants had to come within rule 2(a) or rule 2(b) of the Privy Council (Judicial Committee) Rules Notice 1973. Decision The Court of Appeal dismissed the application. Richardson P noted that “\[t\]he issues are essentially of a procedural and process nature and are not directed at the substantive tax liabilities of the applicants”. The President then addressed the four situations raised by the applicants. Case U35Case U35 Case U35Case U35 Case U35 – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) The applicants argued that their civil right (valued more than $5,000) was the right for a direction that their objections be allowed if the TRA was satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the Commissioner’s failure to file the cases stated on time. They relied on CIR v Vela Fishing Limited (2002) NZTC 17,448, where conditional leave was granted. However, the President distinguished Vela on the grounds that it turned on the validity of the assessment. Richardson P said: Vela is distinguishable. It turned on the validity of the assessment. ... There is no basis for concluding, even assuming that the reasonable grounds inquiry is confined to the restricted period for which Mr Judd contends, that the civil right has any particular value, let alone a value of at least $5,000. Case U35Case U35 Case U35Case U35 Case U35 – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) Richardson P rejected the applicant’s application under this limb. The applicants argued that the Court of Appeal had not properly addressed the scope of “reasonable grounds” in regulation 6(4) of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations. His Honour held that they had ample opportunity to raise the relevant arguments before the Court of Appeal and noted that the relevant procedural regulations were from a statutory scheme which has now been superseded. Case U41Case U41 Case U41Case U41 Case U41 – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) – rule 2(a) The applicants argued that the civil right was the right of general appeal to the High Court under section 26 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 against the decision of the TRA. They further submitted that the tax at stake, and therefore the value of the civil right, was over $5,000. The applicants argued that although the judicial review was unsuccessful, the right of appeal was still worth $5,000. However, Richardson J concluded that although the tests are different, in some circumstances they overlap to the extent that the same decision would have to be given whatever route is chosen. The application under rule 2(a) was dismissed. Case U41Case U41 Case U41Case U41 Case U41 – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) – rule 2(b) The Court of Appeal rejected the application under this heading noting that the merits of the case had been decided in relation to Case U35, so any appeal relating to Case U41 would be redundant. 26 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) The tax-rules for non-resident contractors, in New Zealand for short periods of time, were recently simplified. From 1 April 2002, non-resident contractors who are present in New Zealand for less than 62 days in total in any 12-month period and are exempt under a double tax agreement no longer have to apply for a certificate of exemption. Applying this initiative in practice We have received a number of queries on how this initiative would work in practice. The article 'Tax simplification – reducing compliance costs for non- resident contractors' in TIB Vol 14 No 3 (March 2002) outlined a number of scenarios in which the new rules would or would not apply. The two primary considerations are: (a)(a) (a)(a) (a) New Zealand presence of less than 62 days in anyNew Zealand presence of less than 62 days in any New Zealand presence of less than 62 days in anyNew Zealand presence of less than 62 days in any New Zealand presence of less than 62 days in any 12-month period12-month period 12-month period12-month period 12-month period The “presence” test requires a non-resident contractor to have been present in New Zealand for a total period of less than 62 days in any 12-month period. The test takes into account prior as well as current (or proposed) presence in New Zealand. For example, if a non-resident contractor who intends to be present in New Zealand for a period of 20 days starting on 1 June 2002, was also present for a period of 15 days in August 2001, the total time expected to be spent in New Zealand in the relevant 12-month period (from 21 June 2001 to 20 June 2002) would be 35 days. The non-resident contractor would, therefore, comply with the presence test under the new rules. On the other hand, if the non-resident contractor expected to be present in New Zealand for a longer period—say, from 1 June to 20 July 2002 (50 days)—then his or her total expected presence in New Zealand for the relevant 12-month period (from 21 July 2001 to 20 July 2002) will exceed the prescribed limit.

A full list of New Zealand's double tax agreements follows at the end of this article. While these agreements generally exempt short-term non-resident contract activities in the respective countries, specific exclusions apply. For example, if a non-resident contractor is deemed to have a permanent establishment or other fixed base in New Zealand for the purposes of conducting a contract activity, that activity is taxable in New Zealand. A “permanent establishment” is a defined term and means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried out. This can range from a branch or an office to a factory or other work-site. Some double tax agreements also deem a permanent establishment to exist where activities are carried out in connection with the exploration or exploitation of natural resources, or if substantial equipment is used in respect of a contract being undertaken here. Our double tax agreements with Australia and the United Kingdom, for example, have an exploration/ exploitation clause. The treaty with Australia also has a substantial equipment clause. Our double tax agreements with other countries, such as Japan and Canada to name a few, also have their own distinctive provisions. Most double tax agreements also allow New Zealand to tax “royalties” derived by non-resident contractors from New Zealand. Royalties are typically defined for purposes of double taxation agreements as including, for example, payments for the supply of commercial, industrial and scientific equipment and/or certain forms of knowledge. If the non-resident contact activity involves the supply of such equipment or information, that activity is likely to be taxable in New Zealand. Once again, not all double tax agreements are the same, and some will allow the taxation of services that would not normally be considered as royalties. For example, our double tax agreement with Canada extends to payments made in respect of the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial assistance, including the provision of management services. Other double tax agreements may only tax equipment rentals if they are based on production. While this is not usually referred to in the royalty article, it is contained in the agreement's “protocols”. OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF RULES FOR NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS 27 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 5 (May 2002) Obligations on non-resident contractors and their employers It is the responsibility of non-resident contractors and their employers, when applying this initiative, to take reasonable care ensuring that the New Zealand presence test is met and in determining whether the contract activity being undertaken is exempt under a double tax agreement. If reasonable care has not been taken, resulting in a breach of the legislation and/or default of tax, Inland Revenue may take the appropriate steps to recover any tax payable and may also impose penalties and interest. As the onus is on the payer—typically the employer— under the non-resident contractors' withholding tax rules to deduct tax where applicable, if there is a default, Inland Revenue will have to consider what penalties (and interest) should be imposed. Each case will be looked at on its merits when deciding whether reasonable care has been taken by a payer. Depending on the circumstances, Inland Revenue may have to consider if a taxpayer has displayed gross carelessness, made an unacceptable interpretation of the legislation, taken an abusive tax position, or committed evasion. Contact Inland Revenue if unsure about your obligations The application of New Zealand’s double tax agreements can be complex. Similarly, establishing the period of presence of a non-resident contractor in New Zealand may prove difficult. Circumstances may also arise which unexpectedly result in the qualification criteria being breached. If unsure of your obligations contact Inland Revenue on (04) 802-6056 (email: nr.contractors@ird.govt.nz) for further information on how this tax simplification change affects you.
