This is a request for an assessment of child support. Once we have completed the child support calculation we'll notify you of any amount you are entitled to receive. If you are receiving an unsupported child's benefit for any of the children, your payments will go to the government to help cover the cost of the benefit. Privacy Meeting your child support obligations means giving us accurate information so we can assess your liabilities and entitlements under the Child Support Act 1991. We may also exchange information about you with: • some government agencies • another country, if we have an information supply agreement with them • Statistics New Zealand (for statistical purposes only). If you ask for the personal information we hold about you, we will give it to you and correct any errors, unless we have a lawful reason not to. Call us on 0800 775 247 for more information. For full details of our privacy policy go to ird.govt.nz/privacy Notes to help you complete this form IRD numbers for children A child must have an IRD number for child support to be accepted. If a child does not have an IRD number then you will need to apply for one. You can do this by completing an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. Qualifying children To qualify for child support, a child must be: • under 18 years of age or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school, and • a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The child cannot be: • receiving a benefit or student allowance, or working 30 hours or more a week (on average), or • living with another person in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. Proof of date of birth The child’s IRD number is used for proof of their date of birth. Proof of parentage You will need to supply one of the following for proof of parentage: • the child’s full New Zealand birth certificate • the child’s full overseas birth certificate (with a certified English translation if necessary) • adoption order for the child • a paternity order for the child made by a New Zealand or overseas court • a document signed by the parent acknowledging they are the child’s parent • a copy of the Family Court’s declaration of step-parentage. Who is a parent for child support? A parent is a person who: • is the birth or legally adoptive parent of a child • was married to the other parent when the child was conceived or born • has acknowledged before a court, or in writing, that they are a parent of the child and a court has not overturned this • has been declared a legal step-parent by the Family Court • a court has made a paternity order against in respect of the child. When can Inland Revenue assess one-parent for child support? There are times when it is appropriate to complete a child support assessment against only one parent, for example: • a parent is deceased • a parent is unknown, or there is no proof they are a parent • a parent is not a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand • there are safety concerns for the child, or any carer of the child. Alias names You can ask to use an alias name when you need to protect your privacy. We will not accept a nickname. ird.govt.nz/childsupportChild Support Notes Withholding your name for safety reasons If you would like to apply for child support from a parent but you have concerns about your own or a child’s safety if we tell the parent you are the child’s carer we may be able to withhold your name from them. This means we do not name you when communicating with the parent. To support your safety concerns, remember to attach any relevant documents to this form. For example, a court order, police report, a letter from a social worker or Work & Income, or a letter from your doctor. Proof of parentage If the child's parents were married when the child was conceived or born then we do not require further proof of parentage. However we do still require proof of the child's date of birth. If there is no proof of parentage, we may tell the person that this application has been made naming them as a parent of the child/children. Recognised care The child support formula considers the costs of raising a child and shares these costs between the parents based on their income and the amount of care they have for a child. Care of a child is recognised for child support when: • a parent cares for the child at least 103 nights per year, or 2 nights per week (28% of the time) • a non-parent carer for example, a grandparent, has care of a child for at least 128 night per year, or 5 nights per fortnight (35% of the time). If a person provides more than 263 nights per year, or 5 nights a week on average of a child’s care, theirs is the only care we take into account in the child support formula calculation. Agreement or court order If you have an agreement or court order detailing the care arrangements for the child/children, we can use this to help work out the recognised care levels for a child. Paternity orders If the father is not named on the child’s birth certificate a paternity order may be sought. If you are aware a paternity order has been made, please send it to us. If we receive the order within two months of it being made we may be able to start child support from when this application is received. If you need more information about paternity orders, please go to the Ministry of Justice website www.justice.govt.nz (search keyword: paternity). Payment waiver A Non-parent carer can choose not to receive child support from one of the parents as long as they do not receive an unsupported child’s benefit for the child or a benefit at the sole parent rate. We must still assess the parent but we will tell them they do not need to make payments. If you choose to waive payment from a parent this includes any payments already owed to you by the parent for the children. A non-parent carer can cancel the waiver at any time by calling us or by cancelling in myIR. We will cancel a payment waiver if the non-parent carer starts to receive an unsupported child’s benefit for the child or a benefit paid at the sole parent rate. The parent will need to pay the child support from the date we cancel the waiver from. Child support from the Australian child support authorities We have an agreement with Australia for the assessment and collection of child support. The agreement allows both countries to enforce payments of child support owing in the other country, where payments are not being made. Only the country where the carer lives can make the assessment. If you have an assessment made in Australia but now live in New Zealand, contact the agency in Australia responsible for child support on 0800 440 953 to let them know. If you are a carer living in Australia you must apply for child support in Australia. Call us on 1800 504 042 if you live in Australia and you need any help.

If you need more help after you've read this guide, these guides provide detailed information: •Charitable organisations (IR255) •Education centres (IR253) •Provisional tax (IR289). Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must file a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this doesn't mean your income is exempt income. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure whether your club or society is required to file a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, call us on 0800 377 774 so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, please just fill in: •page 1 of the return, and •the declaration on page 4. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2018 to send in the return (unless you have been granted an extension of time). If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2019 to file. Contact your agent for more information. www.ird.govt.nz 5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its agent's postal address. The agent will let us know of any change of address when updating their client list. Question 6 Bank account number Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account eg, a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only two numbers, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, or it may be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 13 of this guide. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 6 Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. Question 10 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it's registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 10 is income from business transactions with people who aren't members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, providing it's not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non-members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Print the net profit from the business carried on with non-members in Box 10. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Question 11 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Question 12 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: •interest, dividends and rents •taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 8) •sponsorship and admission fees •advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society’s taxable income. Types of income for organisations - Q11 and Q12 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 11 or 12, and any dividends in Box 11A or 12A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 11 or 12. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business-related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate (IR15 or equivalent statement). Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet on page 8 before entering the gross amount at Question 11 or 12 of the return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 8 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 11 or 12 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue Include any interest paid by Inland Revenue as income in the year it is received, if you paid interest to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, it is allowed as a deduction in the tax year the interest is paid. If your overall interest is also a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 11B or 12B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution sends you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits so the distributions are not taxed twice. www.ird.govt.nz 9 What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: •the amount of the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable •the amount of Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: •taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 11B or 12B •Māori authority credits should be shown in "other tax credits" Box 18I. A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 11B or 12B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 18I - $175 Example Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member don't need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. Other income Print the net profit in Box 11C or 12C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 10 Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: •using the rates table available on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currencies) •contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 11A or 12A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 18C and include overseas tax credits at Question 18A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to www.ird.govt.nz/toii/fif/ Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand www.ird.govt.nz 11 has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2017, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. If you need assistance making a CFC disclosure please call 0800 377 774 to get the appropriate disclosure form. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from www.ird.govt.nz Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Taxable property sales If the club or society invested in residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within two years, any profit is taxable income, even if there was no intention to sell when it was purchased. Show the net profit as part of the income total in Box 11C or 12C. If there is a net loss it can only be offset against income from other property sales/disposals. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 12 Box 12E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: •the amount at Box 12D, or •$1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 10 and 11. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. Question 14 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with "donee organisation" status: •friendly societies •building societies •societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at www.ird.govt.nz State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools don't have to be approved to have donee organisation status. Note The deduction for donations can't be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction. •If the amount in Box 13 is a loss, print nil in Box 14. •If the donations made by the society exceed the amount in Box 13, copy the amount in Box 13 to Box 14. www.ird.govt.nz 13 •If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 13, print the donations in Box 14. Question 18 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: •are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and •may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 18. Unincorporated bodies: •are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and •may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 18. If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2018 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 +33.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 18A, 18C, 18G or 18I as appropriate. Box 18D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2017 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2018 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2017 income tax return was assessed. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 14 Print the amount in Box 18D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 18C and 18D and print the total in Box 18E. Box 18E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 18E are greater than the amount in Box 18B, the difference can't be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 18B and 18E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2019 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 18B and 18E must be carried forward to the 2019 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. Box 18GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 19 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: •transfer it to arrears that are being paid off •transfer all or part of it to your 2019 provisional tax www.ird.govt.nz 15 •have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account eg, a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2019 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Print the overpaid amount in Box 19A. Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $5 If your refund is less than $5 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward, please call us on 0800 377 774. Transfers If you'd like your refund ("the credit") transferred to another account or to arrears you're paying off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: •that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement •the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to •whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" •the tax type and period •the date you'd like the transfer to take place. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 16 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: •a company you're a shareholder-employee in •a partner in the same partnership •a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: •the amount you want transferred •the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer •the date you'd like it transferred. If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 3 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: •If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). •If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. www.ird.govt.nz 17 Question 20 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: •starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year, and •had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and •had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations aren't liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 20. Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: •29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year •16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year •8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 18 For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: •29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year •8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information refer to our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. Question 21 2019 provisional tax 2019 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2019 income year. It's payable in instalments. If the organisation's 2018 residual income tax (RIT) is: •$2,500 or less, it doesn't have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments •more than $2,500 but expected to be $2,500 or less for 2019, it may estimate 2019 provisional tax at nil •more than $2,500 and expected to be more than $2,500 for 2019, it must pay 2019 provisional tax using one of the payment options. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $2,500 for the 2019 year, read the notes on interest - see page 20. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose one of the following three options to work out their provisional tax: www.ird.govt.nz 19 Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 21 of the return and the amount of 2019 provisional tax in Box 21A. •For unincorporated organisations, 2019 provisional tax is the 2018 RIT plus 5%. If 2018 return has not been filed it will be 2017 RIT plus 10%. •For incorporated organisations, 2019 provisional tax is the 2018 RIT plus 5%. If 2018 return has not been filed it will be 2017 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2019 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2019 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2018 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 21 on the return and the amount of 2019 provisional tax in Box 21A. An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on page 20. Note Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% from 1 April 2011 (previously this was 30%). For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 13. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 20 Ratio option If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 21, you're electing to stop using this option. Note If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 21 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 21. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organistation's 2019 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2019 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it hasn't paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest (IR240). www.ird.govt.nz 21 Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2018 year if its RIT for that year is more than $2,500. If the 2018 RIT is $2,500 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2018. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2018. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2018 year, attach a note to the front of the 2018 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to www.ird.govt.nz CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 22 Payment dates 2019 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: •First instalment 28 August 2018 •Second instalment 15 January 2019 •Third instalment 7 May 2019 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are two exceptions: •An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January •An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. These dates will alter if: •the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is filed six-monthly, or •provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). 2018 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2019 to pay their tax. If you think this applies, contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, a club or society with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2019. A club or society with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the seventh day of the month before the following year's balance date. www.ird.govt.nz 23 How to make payments You can make payments: •electronically •by credit or debit card •by posting a cheque.

If you need more help after you've read this guide, these guides provide detailed information: •Charitable organisations (IR255) •Education centres (IR253) •Provisional tax (IR289). Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must file a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this doesn't mean your income is exempt income. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure whether your club or society is required to file a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, call us on 0800 377 774 so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, please just fill in: •page 1 of the return, and •the declaration on page 4. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2019 to send in the return (unless you have been granted an extension of time). If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2020 to file. Contact your agent for more information. www.ird.govt.nz 5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its agent's postal address. The agent will let us know of any change of address when updating their client list. Question 6 Bank account number Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account eg, a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only two numbers, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, or it may be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 13 of this guide. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 6 Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. Question 10 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it's registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 10 is income from business transactions with people who aren't members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, providing it's not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non-members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Print the net profit from the business carried on with non-members in Box 10. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Question 11 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Question 12 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: •interest, dividends and rents •taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 8) •sponsorship and admission fees •advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society’s taxable income. Types of income for organisations - Q11 and Q12 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 11 or 12, and any dividends in Box 11A or 12A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 11 or 12. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business-related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate (IR15 or equivalent statement). Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet on page 8 before entering the gross amount at Question 11 or 12 of the return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 8 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 11 or 12 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue Include any interest paid by Inland Revenue as income in the year it is received, if you paid interest to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, it is allowed as a deduction in the tax year the interest is paid. If your overall interest is also a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 11B or 12B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution sends you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits so the distributions are not taxed twice. www.ird.govt.nz 9 What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: •the amount of the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable •the amount of Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: •taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 11B or 12B •Māori authority credits should be shown in "other tax credits" Box 18I. A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 11B or 12B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 18I - $175 Example Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member don't need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. Other income Print the net profit in Box 11C or 12C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 10 Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: •using the rates table available on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currencies) •contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 11A or 12A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 18C and include overseas tax credits at Question 18A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to www.ird.govt.nz/toii/fif/ Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. www.ird.govt.nz 11 The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2019, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. If you need assistance making a CFC disclosure please call 0800 377 774 to get the appropriate disclosure form. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from www.ird.govt.nz Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Taxable property sales Under the bright-line test for the sale/disposal of property, if the club or society invested in residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within the bright- line period, any profit is taxable income, even if there was no intention to sell when it was purchased. The bright-line period for: •properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, is two years, •properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 is five years. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 12 Show the net profit as part of the income total in Box 11C or 12C. If there is a net loss it can only be offset against income from other property sales/disposals. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Box 12E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: •the amount at Box 12D, or •$1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 10 and 11. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. Question 14 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with "donee organisation" status: •friendly societies •building societies •societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at www.ird.govt.nz www.ird.govt.nz 13 State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools don't have to be approved to have donee organisation status. Note The deduction for donations can't be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction. •If the amount in Box 13 is a loss, print nil in Box 14. •If the donations made by the society exceed the amount in Box 13, copy the amount in Box 13 to Box 14. •If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 13, print the donations in Box 14. Question 18 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: •are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and •may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 19. Unincorporated bodies: •are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and •may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 19. If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2019 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 +33.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 18A, 18C, 18G or 18I as appropriate. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 14 Box 18D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2018 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2019 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2018 income tax return was assessed. Print the amount in Box 18D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 18C and 18D and print the total in Box 18E. Box 18E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 18E are greater than the amount in Box 18B, the difference can't be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 18B and 18E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2020 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 18B and 18E must be carried forward to the 2020 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. Box 18GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. www.ird.govt.nz 15 If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 19 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: •transfer it to arrears that are being paid off •transfer all or part of it to your 2020 provisional tax •have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account eg, a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2020 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Print the overpaid amount in Box 19A. Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $5 If your refund is less than $5 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward, please call us on 0800 377 774. Transfers If you'd like your refund ("the credit") transferred to another account or to arrears you're paying off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 16 If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: •that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement •the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to •whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" •the tax type and period •the date you'd like the transfer to take place. Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: •a company you're a shareholder-employee in •a partner in the same partnership •a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: •the amount you want transferred •the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer •the date you'd like it transferred. If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 3 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. www.ird.govt.nz 17 Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: •If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). •If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. Question 20 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: •starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year, and •had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and •had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations aren't liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 20. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 18 Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: •29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year •16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year •8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: •29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year •8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information refer to our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. www.ird.govt.nz 19 Question 21 2020 provisional tax 2020 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2020 income year. It's payable in instalments. If the organisation's 2019 residual income tax (RIT) is: •$2,500 or less, it doesn't have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments •more than $2,500 but expected to be $2,500 or less for 2020, it may estimate 2020 provisional tax at nil •more than $2,500 and expected to be more than $2,500 for 2020, it must pay 2020 provisional tax using one of the payment options. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $2,500 for the 2020 year, read the notes on interest - see page 21. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose one of the following three options to work out their provisional tax: Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 21 of the return and the amount of 2020 provisional tax in Box 21A. •For unincorporated organisations, 2020 provisional tax is the 2019 RIT plus 5%. If 2019 return has not been filed it will be 2018 RIT plus 10%. •For incorporated organisations, 2020 provisional tax is the 2019 RIT plus 5%. If 2019 return has not been filed it will be 2018 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2020 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2020 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2019 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 21 on the return and the amount of 2020 provisional tax in Box 21A. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 20 An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on pages 20 and 21. Note Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% from 1 April 2011 (previously this was 30%). For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 13. Ratio option If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 21, you're electing to stop using this option. Note If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 21 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 21. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organistation's 2020 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2020 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. www.ird.govt.nz 21 Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it hasn't paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest (IR240). Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year if its RIT for that year is more than $2,500. If the 2019 RIT is $2,500 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2019. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2019. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year, attach a note to the front of the 2019 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to www.ird.govt.nz CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE 22 Payment dates 2020 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: •First instalment 28 August 2019 •Second instalment 15 January 2020 •Third instalment 7 May 2020 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are two exceptions: •An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January •An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. These dates will alter if: •the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is filed six-monthly, or •provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). 2019 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2020 to pay their tax. If you think this applies, contact your agent for more information.

The changes include: • limits to the amount of deductions you can claim if your residential rental property makes a loss • inability to offset residential excess deductions/rental loss against other income. They are now generally carried forward and offset against future residential property income • what happens to excess deductions when disposing of residential property • limits on the amount of interest you can claim for an investment in an entity that rents out residential property. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. ird.govt.nz3 Contents Page Introduction 4 Who has to file a return 4 Return due date 4 Questions 5 Q 2 Club or society's name 5 Q 3 Postal address 5 Q 6 Bank account number 5 Q 8 Incorporation 5 Q 9 Has the club or society ceased? 6 Q 10 Income and expenditure from residential property 6 Q 11 Income from taxable sale/disposals of property 13 Q 12 Friendly societies 14 Q 13 Exempt income 15 Q 14 All other clubs and societies 15 Types of income for organisations - Q13 and Q14 15 Q 16 Donations 20 Q 18 Net losses 20 Q 20 Tax calculation 21 Q 21 Refunds and/or transfers 22 Q 22 Initial provisional tax liability 24 Q 23 2021 provisional tax 26 Not taking reasonable care penalty 27 Interest 28 Election to be a provisional tax payer 28 Change in balance date 28 Tax pooling 28 Payment dates 29 How to make payments 30 Late payment 30 Self-assessment by taxpayers 31 Services you may need 32 0800 self-service numbers 32 Need to speak with us? 32 Privacy 33 If you have a complaint about our service 33 CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE4 Introduction The questions in this guide follow the same numbering as in your return. If you need more help after you've read this guide, these guides provide detailed information: • Charitable organisations - IR255 • Education centres - IR253 • Provisional tax - IR289. Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must file a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this doesn't mean your income is exempt income. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure whether your club or society is required to file a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, call us on 0800 377 774 so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, please just fill in: • page 1 of the return, and • the declaration on page 4. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2020 to send in the return (unless you have been granted an extension of time). If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2021 to file. Contact your agent for more information. ird.govt.nz5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its agent's postal address. The agent will let us know of any change of address when updating their client list. Question 6 Bank account number Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account eg, a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only two numbers, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, or it may be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 21 of this guide. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Question 10 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn residential income, including properties held on revenue account. ird.govt.nz7 There are two levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • the main home; • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time); • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at the applicable box 12, 13C or 14C and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 11. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land; • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property, net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income box 10A. A taxable disposal net loss is shown at box 11. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Any rental net loss is shown at the applicable box 12, 13C or 14C. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any club or society that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. ird.govt.nz9 Completing Question 10 in your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use one of the following methods: • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property is calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • Combination - of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 10A to 10F using your chosen method. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Write the total residential income in Box 10A. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property; (b) all depreciation recovery income from the portfolio or individual property; (c) net income from the taxable disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property); and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Write the total eligible deductions for residential rental properties in the Residential rental deductions in Box 10B. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. These are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 10C. This box cannot be completed for the tax year ending 31 March 2020. ird.govt.nz11 Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total Residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 10D. This should equal Box 10B plus Box 10C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio shown in Box 10F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 10A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for all properties and write the total in Box 10E. Your total Net residential income in Box 10E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • excess deductions released as the result of the taxable disposal of the rental property or all properties in a portfolio or • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 10F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 10B minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 10D. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE12 NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least one of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any remaining excess deductions must be transferred to another property or portfolio and/or be carried forward to the next year you earn income from residential property including property held on revenue account. Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account (other than land that is acquired for purposes of business relating to land) where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property by the return filing date. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. ird.govt.nz13 Question 11 income from taxable sale/ disposals of property Include all income from land sales that are that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules (covered by question 10). Also include taxable sales of the main home or holiday homes taxed under the mixed-use asset rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if you: • are a builder and improved a property before selling it, • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period, any profit will be taxable, even if you didn’t intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/ disposed of within two years, and • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within five years. Net income from sales/disposals of most residential property is included in residential income in question 10 Box 10A. Show the total profit from other property in Box 11. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test and made a loss, any excess deductions can’t be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other residential property sales. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE14 For more information on property sales, refer to our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Question 12 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it’s registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 12 is income from business transactions with people who are not members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, if it’s not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non- members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Write the net profit from the business carried on with non- members in Box 12. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. ird.govt.nz15 Question 13 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. Question 14 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: • interest, dividends and rents (for residential rents read Question 10) • taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 16) • sponsorship and admission fees • advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society's taxable income. Types of income for organisations - Q13 and Q14 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 13 or 14, and any dividends in Box 13A or 14A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 13 or 14. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE16 If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate (IR15 or equivalent statement). Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet below before entering the gross amount at Question 13 or 14 of the return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 13 or 14 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue Include any interest paid by Inland Revenue as income in the year it is received, if you paid interest to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, it is allowed as a deduction in the tax year the interest is paid. If your overall interest is also a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 13B or 14B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution sends you a Māori authority distribution statement. ird.govt.nz17 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: • the amount of the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • the amount of Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: • taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 13B or 14B • Māori authority credits should be shown in "other tax credits" Box 20I. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to file an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 13B or 14B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 20I - $175 Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member don't need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE18 Other income Print the net profit in Box 13C or 14C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. If your organisation is carrying back a 2020 loss to 2019 enter the amount of the loss in Box 14C. Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 13A or 14A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 20C and include overseas tax credits at Question 20A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz/foreign-investment-funds ird.govt.nz19 Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2020, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. If you need assistance making a CFC disclosure please call 0800 377 774 to get the appropriate disclosure form. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from ird.govt.nz Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Box 14E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: • the amount at Box 14D, or • $1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 12 and 13. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE20 Question 16 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with "donee organisation" status: • friendly societies • building societies • societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at ird.govt.nz Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools don't have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations can't be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction. • If the amount in Box 15 is a loss, print nil in Box 16. • If the donations made by the society exceed the amount in Box 15, copy the amount in Box 15 to Box 16. • If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 15, print the donations in Box 16. Question 18 Net losses Loss carry-back Where on your return to claim loss carry-back You must let us know if the organisation is going to use the loss carry-back scheme. You can do this in the ‘I want to’ section of the organisations income tax account in myIR and selecting “Opt-in to carry-back loss”. Claiming a loss carry-back in 2019 from 2020 If the organisation has a 2020 loss it wants to carry back to 2019, enter the loss amount in Box 14C (Other income) in the 2020 income tax return. You will then need to amend the organisations 2019 income tax return (if already filed) to include the loss. In myIR choose amendment reason “loss carry-back”. Select income type “you are claiming net losses brought forward” and enter the amount of the loss carried-back in Box 16 (losses brought forward). ird.govt.nz21 Claiming a loss carry-back in 2020 from 2021 If the organisation is claiming a loss carry-back in 2020, based on an estimated loss in 2021, enter the amount of the estimated loss carry-back in Box 18 (net losses brought forward). Question 20 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: • are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and • may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 26. Unincorporated bodies: • are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and • may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 26. If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2020 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 +33.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 20A, 20C, 20G or 20I as appropriate. Box 20D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2019 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2020 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2019 income tax return was assessed. Print the amount in Box 20D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 20C and 20D and print the total in Box 20E. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE22 Box 20E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 20E are greater than the amount in Box 20B, the difference can't be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 20B and 20E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2021 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 20B and 20E must be carried forward to the 2021 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. Box 20GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 21 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: • transfer it to arrears that are being paid off • transfer all or part of it to your 2021 provisional tax • have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account eg, a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2021 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. ird.govt.nz23 Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $1.00 If your refund is less than $1.00 if will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset if against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. Transfers If you'd like your refund ("the credit") transferred to another account or to arrears you're paying off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: • that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement • the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to • whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" • the tax type and period • the date you'd like the transfer to take place. Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer • the date you'd like it transferred. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE24 If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 4 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. Question 22 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: • starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year, and • had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years, and • had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations aren't liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 22. ird.govt.nz25 Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: • 29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For further information refer to our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE26 Question 23 2021 provisional tax 2021 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2021 income year. It's payable in instalments. If the organisation's 2020 residual income tax (RIT) is: • $5,000 or less, it doesn’t have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2021, it may estimate 2021 provisional tax at nil • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000for 2021, it must pay 2021 provisional tax using one of the payment options. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2021 year, read the notes on interest - see page 28. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose one of the following three options to work out their provisional tax: Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 23 of the return and the amount of 2021 provisional tax in Box 23A. • For unincorporated organisations, 2021 provisional tax is the 2020 RIT plus 5%. If 2020 return has not been filed it will be 2019 RIT plus 10%. • For incorporated organisations, 2021 provisional tax is the 2020 RIT plus 5%. If 2020 return has not been filed it will be 2019 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2021 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2021 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2020 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 23 on the return and the amount of 2021 provisional tax in Box 23A. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on pages 27 and 28. ird.govt.nz27 Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% . For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 21. Ratio option Note If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 23, you're electing to stop using this option. If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 23 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 23. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organisation’s 2021 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2021 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE28 Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it hasn't paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2020 year if its RIT for that year is more than $2,500. If the 2020 RIT is $2,500 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2020. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2020. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2020 year, attach a note to the front of the 2020 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz ird.govt.nz29 Payment dates 2021 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2020 • Second instalment 15 January 2021 • Third instalment 7 May 2021 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are two exceptions: • An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January • An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. These dates will alter if: • the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is filed six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2020 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2021 to pay their tax. If you think this applies, contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, a club or society with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2021. A club or society with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the seventh day of the month before the following year's balance date.

If you need more help, read these guides: • Charitable organisations - IR255 • Education centres - IR253 • Provisional tax - IR289. Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must complete a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this does not mean your income is exempt income. Contact us if you’re not sure whether your club or society is required to complete a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, contact us so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, just fill in: • page 1 of the return, and • the declaration on page 4. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2021 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Contact us if you’re not sure of the filing date. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2022 to complete the return. Contact your agent for more information. ird.govt.nz5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its tax preparer’s postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 numbers, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. An organisation may also be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 17 of this guide. Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Question 10 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including properties held on revenue account. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • the main home • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it's usually only used on working days), or • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at the applicable box 12, 13C or 14C and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 11. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property, net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income box 10A. A taxable disposal net loss is shown at box 11. ird.govt.nz7 Any rental net loss is shown at the applicable box 12, 13C or 14C. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • when the rules apply • how to calculate your income • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any club or society that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings (a residential land-rich entity) and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 10 in your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property is calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • Combination - of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 10A to 10F using your chosen method. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE8 Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the total residential income in Box 10A. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property (b) all depreciation recovery income from the portfolio or individual property (c) net income from the taxable disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property), and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Write the total eligible deductions for residential rental properties in the Residential rental deductions in Box 10B. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. These are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 10C. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total Residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 10D. This should equal Box 10B plus Box 10C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio shown in Box 10F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 10A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for all properties and write the total in Box 10E. Your total Net residential income in Box 10E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. ird.govt.nz9 Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • excess deductions released as the result of either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by- property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 10F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 10B minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 10D. NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any remaining excess deductions must be transferred to another property or portfolio and/or be carried forward to the next year you earn income from residential property including property held on revenue account. Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account (other than land that is acquired for purposes of business relating to land) where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property by the return filing date. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Question 11 income from taxable sale/ disposals of property Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules (covered by question 10). Also include taxable sales of the main home or holiday homes taxed under the mixed-use asset rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if you: • are a builder and improved a property before selling it • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within 10 years of buying it. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period, any profit will be taxable, even if you did not intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/ disposed of within 2 years, and • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. Net income from sales/disposals of most residential property is included in residential income at question 10. Show the total profit from other property in Box 11. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test and made a loss, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other residential property sales. For more information on property sales, refer to our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Bright-line property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. ird.govt.nz11 You can download the form at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 12 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it's registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 12 is income from business transactions with people who are not members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, if it's not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non- members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Write the net profit from the business carried on with non- members in Box 12. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Question 13 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. Question 14 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: • interest, dividends and rents (for residential rents read Question 10) • taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 13) • sponsorship and admission fees, and • advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society's taxable income. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Types of income for organisations - Q13 and Q14 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 13 or 14, and any dividends in Box 13A or 14A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 13 or 14. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet below before entering the gross amount at Question 13 or 14 of the return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 13 or 14 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in the income year you received it. If you paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the income year the interest was paid. If your overall interest is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. ird.govt.nz13 Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 13B or 14B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • the amount of Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: • taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 13B or 14B • Māori authority credits should be shown in Other tax credits Box 21I. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 13B or 14B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 21I - $175 CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member do not need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. Other income Print the net profit in Box 13C or 14C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 13A or 14A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 21C and include overseas tax credits at Question 21A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz/fif ird.govt.nz15 Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2021, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Box 14E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: • the amount at Box 14D, or • $1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 12 and 13. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE16 Question 16 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with donee organisation status: • friendly societies • building societies, and • societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at ird.govt.nz/donee Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction: • If the amount in Box 15 is a loss, print nil in Box 16. • If the donations made by the society exceed the amount in Box 15, copy the amount in Box 15 to Box 16. • If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 15, print the donations in Box 16. Question 18 Net losses If you have a loss brought forward from a previous year, enter it in Box 18. Question 20 Loss carry back Enter the amount of any 2021 loss to carry back to 2020 in Box 20. You will need to amend your 2020 income tax return to include the amount of loss you carry back if you have not already. In your myIR income tax account, select the 2020 income tax period. Go to I want to...> Complete or amend return. Choose the amendment reason 'Loss carry back'. Select the income type 'You are claiming net loss brought forward' and enter the amount in 'Net losses claimed this year'. ird.govt.nz17 Question 21 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: • are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and • may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 21. Unincorporated bodies: • are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and • may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 21. If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2021 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 +33.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 21A, 21C, 21G or 21I as appropriate. Box 21D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2020 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2021 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2020 income tax return was assessed. Print the amount in Box 21D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 21C and 21D and print the total in Box 21E. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE18 Box 21E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 21E are greater than the amount in Box 21B, the difference cannot be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2022 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E must be carried forward to the 2022 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. Box 21GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: • transfer it to arrears that are being paid off • transfer all or part of it to your 2022 provisional tax, or • have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2022 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. ird.govt.nz19 Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $1.00 If your refund is less than $1.00 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We’ll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: • that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement • the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to • whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" • the tax type and period, and • the date you'd like the transfer to take place. Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership, or • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer, and • the date you'd like it transferred. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE20 If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 4 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. Question 23 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: • starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year • had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, and • had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations are not liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 23. ird.govt.nz21 Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: • 29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For more information read the Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Question 24 2022 provisional tax 2022 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2022 income year. It's payable in instalments. If the organisation's 2021 residual income tax (RIT) is: • $5,000 or less, it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2022, it may estimate 2022 provisional tax at nil, or • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2022, it must pay 2022 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE22 If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2022 year, read the notes on interest - see page 23. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose 1 of the following 3 options to work out their provisional tax: Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 24 of the return and the amount of 2022 provisional tax in Box 24A. • For unincorporated organisations, 2022 provisional tax is the 2021 RIT plus 5%. If 2021 return has not been completed it will be 2020 RIT plus 10%. • For incorporated organisations, 2022 provisional tax is the 2021 RIT plus 5%. If 2021 return has not been completed it will be 2020 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2022 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2022 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2021 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 24 on the return and the amount of 2022 provisional tax in Box 24A. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on page 23. Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% . For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 17. Ratio option Note If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 24, you're electing to stop using this option. If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. ird.govt.nz23 Only enter R at Box 24 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 24. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organisation's 2022 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2022 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it has not paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2021 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2021 RIT is $5,000 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2021. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2021. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2021 year, attach a note to the front of the 2021 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE24 Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2022 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2021 • Second instalment 15 January 2022 • Third instalment 7 May 2022 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions: • An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January. • An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. These dates will alter if: • the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is completed six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2021 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2022 to pay their tax. If this applies, contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, a club or society with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2022. A club or society with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the seventh day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz25 How to make payments You can make payments by: • direct debit in myIR • credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay • internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option.

If you need more help, read these guides: • Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 • Education centres - IR253 • Provisional tax - IR289. Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must complete a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this does not mean your income is exempt income. Contact us if you’re not sure whether your club or society is required to complete a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, contact us so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, just fill in: • page 1 of the return, and • the declaration on page 5. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2022 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Contact us if you’re not sure of the filing date. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2023 to complete the return. Contact your agent for more information. ird.govt.nz5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its tax preparer’s postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 numbers, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. An organisation may also be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 22 of this guide. Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Question 10 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that gives rise to net income from a bright-line sale, and property subject to the residential property deduction rules. Bright-line property rule for residential property The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 12 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. There are some different rules if you purchase “off the plan” in a new development, for example. ird.govt.nz7 You can use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/brightline Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 10A. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales both in New Zealand and overseas subject to the bright-line property rule or the other land sale rules. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE8 For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including properties held on revenue account. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • the main home • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it's usually only used on working days), or • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at the applicable box 13, 14C or 15C and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 12. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property, net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at box 10A. A taxable disposal net loss is shown at box 12. ird.govt.nz9 Any rental net loss is shown at the applicable box 13, 14C or 15C. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • when the rules apply • how to calculate your income • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to any club or society that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings (a residential land-rich entity) and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 10 in your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property is calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • Combination - of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 10A to 10F using your chosen method. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE10 Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the total residential income in Box 10A. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property (b) all depreciation recovery income from the portfolio or individual property (c) net income from the taxable disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property), and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Write the total eligible deductions for residential rental properties in Box 10B. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. These are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 10C. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total Residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 10D. This should equal Box 10B plus Box 10C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio shown in Box 10F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 10A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for all properties and write the total in Box 10E. Your total Net residential income in Box 10E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of ird.govt.nz11 either: • excess deductions released as the result of either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by- property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 10F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 10B minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 10D. NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any remaining excess deductions must be transferred to another property or portfolio and/or be carried forward to the next year you earn income from residential property including property held on revenue account. Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account (other than land that is acquired for purposes of business relating to land) where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property by the return filing date. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Question 11 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • Farmland • Hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • Rest homes and retirement villages • Hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2022 tax year, you can claim: • 100% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 • 75% of the interest incurred from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies ird.govt.nz13 to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. Completing Question 11 in your return Complete this question for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 9B, 13, 14C or 15C in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short- term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 11A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 11B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 11B, at Box 11C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company – The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE14 • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • employee accommodation • student accommodation. • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 or interest incurred before 1 October 2021 - Interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 is fully deductible. From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora) or to a registered community housing provider. • New build exemption - the exemption generally applies to new build residential properties for 20 years from the date a new build’s Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued under the Building Act 2004. A ‘new build’ includes a self-contained dwelling: • that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020. The dwelling can be made from new or existing materials and can be constructed onsite or relocated onto the land • acquired off the plans that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • created by converting an existing dwelling into 2 or more dwellings, that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 ird.govt.nz15 • converted from commercial premises that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • converted from a hotel or motel and building consent authority records show that the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020 • that has been removed from the earthquake prone buildings register on or after 27 March 2020, provided there is proof the remediation has been completed (either in the form of a CCC being issued, or local or building consent authority records showing the work has been completed and verified by a suitably qualified engineer) • that was remediated because of weathertightness issues, provided more than 75% of the dwelling has been re-clad and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020. • Development or land business exemption - The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or read our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE16 Question 12 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include the total net income or loss from land. Do not include net income or loss from a bright-line sale at Box 12. Bright-line sales are included under residential income at Question 10. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if you: • are a builder and improved a property before selling it • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Show the total profit or loss from other property in Box 12. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide subject to the bright- line property rule for residential land, or the land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 13 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it's registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 13 is income from business transactions with people who are not members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, if it's not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non- members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Write the net profit from the business carried on with non- members in Box 13. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. ird.govt.nz17 Question 14 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. Question 15 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: • interest, dividends and rents (for residential rents read Question 10) • taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 18) • sponsorship and admission fees, and • advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society's taxable income. Types of income for organisations - Q14 and Q15 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 14 or 15, and any dividends in Box 14A or 15A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 14 or 15. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet below before entering the gross amount at Question 14 or 15 of the return. In all other cases, the CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE18 negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 14 or 15 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in the income year you received it. If you paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the income year the interest was paid. If your overall interest is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 14B or 15B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • the amount of Māori authority credit. ird.govt.nz19 These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: • taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 14B or 15B • Māori authority credits should be shown in Other tax credits Box 21I. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 14B or 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 21I - $175 Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member do not need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. Other income Print the net profit in Box 14C or 15C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE20 statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 14A or 15A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 21C and include overseas tax credits at Question 21A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz/fif Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2022, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. ird.govt.nz21 These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Box 15E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: • the amount at Box 15D, or • $1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 13 and 14. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. Question 17 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with donee organisation status: • friendly societies • building societies, and • societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at ird.govt.nz/donee Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction: • If the amount in Box 16 is a loss, print nil in Box 17. • If the donations made by the society exceed the amount CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE22 in Box 16, copy the amount in Box 16 to Box 17. • If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 16, print the donations in Box 17. Question 19 Net losses If you have a loss brought forward from a previous year, enter it in Box 19. Question 21 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: • are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and • may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 27. Unincorporated bodies: • are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and • may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 27. If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2022 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 +39.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 21A, 21C, 21G or 21I as appropriate. ird.govt.nz23 Box 21D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2021 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2022 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2021 income tax return was assessed. Print the amount in Box 21D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 21C and 21D and print the total in Box 21E. Box 21E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 21E are greater than the amount in Box 21B, the difference cannot be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2023 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E must be carried forward to the 2023 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. Box 21GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE24 Question 22 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: • transfer it to arrears that are being paid off • transfer all or part of it to your 2023 provisional tax, or • have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2023 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $1.00 If your refund is less than $1.00 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We’ll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: • that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement • the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to • whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" • the tax type and period, and • the date you'd like the transfer to take place. ird.govt.nz25 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership, or • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer, and • the date you'd like it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 4 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE26 Question 23 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: • starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year • had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, and • had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations are not liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 23. Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: • 29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. ird.govt.nz27 There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For more information read the Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Question 24 2023 provisional tax 2023 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2023 income year. It's payable in instalments. If the organisation's 2022 residual income tax (RIT) is: • $5,000 or less, it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2023, it may estimate 2023 provisional tax at nil, or • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2023, it must pay 2023 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2023 year, read the notes on interest - see page 28. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose 1 of the following 3 options to work out their provisional tax: Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 24 of the return and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 24A. • For unincorporated organisations, 2023 provisional tax is the 2022 RIT plus 5%. If 2022 return has not been completed it will be 2021 RIT plus 10%. • For incorporated organisations, 2023 provisional tax is the 2022 RIT plus 5%. If 2022 return has not been completed it will be 2021 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2023 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2023 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2022 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 24 on the return and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 24A. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE28 Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on page 28. Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% . For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 22. Ratio option Note If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 24, you're electing to stop using this option. If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 24 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 24. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organisation's 2023 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2023 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it has not paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. ird.govt.nz29 Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2022 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2022 RIT is $5,000 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2022. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2022. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2022 year, attach a note to the front of the 2022 return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2023 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2022 • Second instalment 15 January 2023 • Third instalment 7 May 2023 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions: • An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January. • An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE30 These dates will alter if: • the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is completed six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2022 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2023 to pay their tax. If this applies, contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, a club or society with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2023. A club or society with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the seventh day of the month before the following year's balance date.

If you need more help, read these guides: • Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 • Education centres - IR253 • Provisional tax - IR289. Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must complete a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this does not mean your income is exempt income. Contact us if you’re not sure whether your club or society is required to complete a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, contact us so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, just fill in: • page 1 of the return, and • the declaration on page 5. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2023 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Contact us if you’re not sure of the filing date. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2024 to complete the return. Contact your agent for more information. ird.govt.nz5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its tax preparer’s postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 numbers, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. An organisation may also be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 22 of this guide. Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE6 Question 10 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that have: • income subject to the residential property deduction rules • net income from a bright-line sale • income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency • depreciation recovery income from disposed assets • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days), or • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at the applicable Box 13, 14C or 15C and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 12. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. ird.govt.nz7 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at the applicable Box 13, 14C or 15C and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 12. The residential property deduction rules also apply if you borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and you have interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • when the rules apply • how to calculate your income • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return You will use question 10 to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE8 You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 10A to 10I using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at Boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 10A. Box 10B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 12 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property (including an overseas property) within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. ird.govt.nz9 For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made in specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 10B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE10 • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 10C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 10C. This includes the total from the following amounts: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 12. ird.govt.nz11 Box 10D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 10D is the total amount of Box 10A, Box 10B and Box 10C. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L, include your share of that in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC in the following relevant boxes: • Gross residential rental income Box 10A • Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 10B • Other residential income Box 10C. The amount in Box 10D will then include the total of your attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L. Boxes 10E to 10I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 10E. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here at Box 10E. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 10E. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 10F. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE12 Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 10G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following: • Total combined residential income Box 10D • Residential rental deduction Box 10E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 10F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 10H should equal Total combined residential income Box 10D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 10G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 10I. Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any remaining excess deductions must be transferred to another property or portfolio and/or be carried forward to the next year you earn income from residential property including property held on revenue account. Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/ excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. ird.govt.nz13 Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account (other than land that is acquired for purposes of business relating to land) where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property by the return filing date. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Residential land-rich entities If you have an investment in a land rich entity, include: • interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 10E • interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 10G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 10I • a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return • the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property at the applicable Box 13, 14C or 15C. Question 11 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • farmland • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • rest homes and retirement villages • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE14 Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2023 tax year, you can claim 75% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2022to 31 March 2023. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/ property/renting-out-residential-property There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. What to show in your return Complete question 11 for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 10E, 13, 14C or 15C in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short-term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 11A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 11B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 11B, at Box ird.govt.nz15 11C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly- owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • employee accommodation • student accommodation. • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE16 • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. • New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential- property or our guide Rental income - IR264. • Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. • Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD. Existing build-to-rent land has until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements.

You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 12 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 10. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. ird.govt.nz17 The profits may also be taxable if the club or society: • is a builder and improved a property before selling it • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 12. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 10B. Only include in Box 12 the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 10, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright-line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 13 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it's registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 13 is income from business transactions with people who are not members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, if it's not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non- members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Write the net profit from the business carried on with non- members in Box 13. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Question 14 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE18 Question 15 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: • interest, dividends and rents (for residential rents read Question 10) • taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 18) • sponsorship and admission fees, and • advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society's taxable income. Types of income for organisations - Q14 and Q15 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 14 or 15, and any dividends in Box 14A or 15A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 14 or 15. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet below before entering the gross amount at Question 14 or 15 of the return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz19 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 14 or 15 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in the income year you received it. If you paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the income year the interest was paid. If your overall interest is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 14B or 15B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE20 What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • the amount of Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: • taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 14B or 15B • Māori authority credits should be shown in Other tax credits Box 21I. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 14B or 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 21I - $175 Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member do not need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. Other income Print the net profit in Box 14C or 15C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. ird.govt.nz21 Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 14A or 15A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 21C and include overseas tax credits at Question 21A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz/fif Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2023, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE22 Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Box 15E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: • the amount at Box 15D, or • $1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 13 and 14. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. Question 17 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with donee organisation status: • friendly societies • building societies, and • societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at ird.govt.nz/donee ird.govt.nz23 Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction: • If the amount in Box 16 is a loss, print nil in Box 17. • If the donations made by the society exceed the amount in Box 16, copy the amount in Box 16 to Box 17. • If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 16, print the donations in Box 17. Question 19 Net losses If you have a loss brought forward from a previous year, enter it in Box 19. Question 21 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: • are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and • may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 27. Unincorporated bodies: • are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and • may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 27. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE24 If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2022 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 +39.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 21A, 21C, 21G or 21I as appropriate. Box 21D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2022 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2023 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2022 income tax return was assessed. Print the amount in Box 21D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 21C and 21D and print the total in Box 21E. Box 21E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 21E are greater than the amount in Box 21B, the difference cannot be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2024 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E must be carried forward to the 2024 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. ird.govt.nz25 Box 21GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: • transfer it to arrears that are being paid off • transfer all or part of it to your 2024 provisional tax, or • have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2024 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $1.00 If your refund is less than $1.00 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We’ll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE26 If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: • that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement • the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to • whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" • the tax type and period, and • the date you'd like the transfer to take place. Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership, or • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer, and • the date you'd like it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 4 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. ird.govt.nz27 Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. Question 23 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: • starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year • had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, and • had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations are not liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 23. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE28 Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: • 29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For more information read the Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Question 24 2024 provisional tax 2024 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2024 income year. It's payable in instalments. If the organisation's 2023 residual income tax (RIT) is: • $5,000 or less, it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2024, it may estimate 2024 provisional tax at nil, or • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2024, it must pay 2024 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. ird.govt.nz29 If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2024 year, read the notes on interest - see page 28. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose 1 of the following 3 options to work out their provisional tax: Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 24 of the return and the amount of 2024 provisional tax in Box 24A. • For unincorporated organisations, 2024 provisional tax is the 2023 RIT plus 5%. If 2023 return has not been completed it will be 2022 RIT plus 10%. • For incorporated organisations, 2024 provisional tax is the 2023 RIT plus 5%. If 2023 return has not been completed it will be 2022 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2024 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2024 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2023 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 24 on the return and the amount of 2024 provisional tax in Box 24A. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on page 28. Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% . For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 22. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE30 Ratio option Note If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 24, you're electing to stop using this option. If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 24 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 24. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organisation's 2024 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2024 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it has not paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2023 RIT is $5,000 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2023. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2023. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year, attach a note to the front of the 2023 return. ird.govt.nz31 Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2024 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2023 • Second instalment 15 January 2024 • Third instalment 7 May 2024 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions: • An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January. • An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. These dates will alter if: • the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is completed six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2023 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2024 to pay their tax. If this applies, contact your agent for more information. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE32 Otherwise, a club or society with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2024. A club or society with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the seventh day of the month before the following year's balance date.

If you need more help, read these guides: • Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 • Education centres - IR253 • Provisional tax - IR289. Who has to file a return? All New Zealand clubs and societies must complete a tax return each year unless they derive only exempt income. If your organisation has a certificate of exemption from RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends this does not mean your income is exempt income. Contact us if you’re not sure whether your club or society is required to complete a tax return. If we've sent you a taxpack but your organisation is tax exempt, contact us so we can update our records. If your club or society's income is not exempt but the organisation did not have income that was liable for income tax during the tax year from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, just fill in: • page 1 of the return, and • the declaration on page 5. All other organisations must complete all parts of the return. Return due date If the club or society has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2024 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March the return date may be different. Contact us if you’re not sure of the filing date. If the club or society is the client of an agent, you may have until 31 March 2025 to complete the return. Contact your agent for more information. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE5 Questions Question 2 Club or society's name If the club or society has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the name change details so we can update our records. Question 3 Postal address If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby, if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. Leave this address panel blank if the club or society uses its tax preparer’s postal address. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your club or society's New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your club or society's bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 numbers, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 8 Incorporation An organisation can be incorporated under New Zealand legislation, such as the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, Companies Act 1993 or the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. An organisation may also be incorporated under foreign legislation. Make sure you complete this box as different tax rates apply for incorporated societies. See page 22 of this guide. Question 9 Has the club or society ceased? If the club or society has ceased, include a set of accounts (if accounts are required) to the date the organisation ceased. If the organisation is registered for GST, or as an employer, you will need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. ird.govt.nz6 Question 10 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that have: • income subject to the residential property deduction rules • net income from a bright-line sale • income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency • depreciation recovery income from disposed assets • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days), or • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at the applicable Box 13, 14C or 15C and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 12. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE7 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at the applicable Box 13, 14C or 15C and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 12. The residential property deduction rules also apply if you borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and you have interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • when the rules apply • how to calculate your income • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return You will use question 10 to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. ird.govt.nz8 You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 10A to 10I using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at Boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 10A. Box 10B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 12 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property (including an overseas property) within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE9 For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made in specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 10B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. ird.govt.nz10 • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 10C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 10C. This includes the total from the following amounts: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 12. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE11 Box 10D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 10D is the total amount of Box 10A, Box 10B and Box 10C. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L, include your share of that in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC in the following relevant boxes: • Gross residential rental income Box 10A • Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 10B • Other residential income Box 10C. The amount in Box 10D will then include the total of your attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L. Boxes 10E to 10I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 10E. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here at Box 10E. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 10E. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 10F. ird.govt.nz12 Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 10G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following: • Total combined residential income Box 10D • Residential rental deduction Box 10E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 10F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 10H should equal Total combined residential income Box 10D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 10G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 10I. Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any remaining excess deductions must be transferred to another property or portfolio and/or be carried forward to the next year you earn income from residential property including property held on revenue account. Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/ excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE13 Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account (other than land that is acquired for purposes of business relating to land) where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property by the return filing date. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Residential land-rich entities If you have an investment in a land rich entity, include: • interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 10E • interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 10G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 10I • a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return • the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property at the applicable Box 13, 14C or 15C. Question 11 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • farmland • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • rest homes and retirement villages • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent it is of a private or domestic nature. ird.govt.nz14 Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For property acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is limited to a percentage of the interest incurred. For the 2024 tax year, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. What to show in your return Complete question 11 for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 10E, 13, 14C or 15C in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short stays or long term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 11A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 11B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE15 If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 11B, at Box 11C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly- owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • employee accommodation • student accommodation. • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - When an exclusion or exemption does not apply you can claim 50% of the interest incurred for the following situations: • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed. ird.govt.nz16 • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased or contracted (directly or indirectly) to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. • New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential- property or our guide Rental income - IR264. • Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. • Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD. Existing build-to-rent land has until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements and to apply. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules or our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird. govt.nz/forms-guides Question 12 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 10. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE17 The profits may also be taxable if the club or society: • is a builder and improved a property before selling it • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 12. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 10B. Only include in Box 12 the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 10, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright-line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 13 Friendly societies An organisation is a friendly society if it's registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The net income to be shown in Box 13 is income from business transactions with people who are not members of the society, less all allowable expenses related to deriving the taxable income from non-members. Any interest from investments that a friendly society earns is exempt income, if it's not part of the income from a business the society runs. Where taxable activities cover both members and non- members, the income and expenses must be apportioned to calculate the taxable portion. Write the net profit from the business carried on with non- members in Box 13. If the figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Question 14 Exempt income The income of some types of club or society is exempt unless the funds can be used for the private benefit of any of the organisation's members. A list of these organisations is on the return. ird.govt.nz18 Question 15 All other clubs and societies A club or society's taxable income is based on its net profit or loss from revenue sources only, including: • interest, dividends and rents (for residential rents read Question 10) • taxable Māori authority distributions (see page 18) • sponsorship and admission fees, and • advertising revenue from club journals, magazines or other printed material. Any membership subscriptions or levies are not income for tax purposes. Certain transactions the club or society does with its members may be liable for income tax. This includes the purchase of trading stock and the supply of services. Deduct any costs incurred in earning income from taxable sources when you calculate the club or society's taxable income. Types of income for organisations - Q14 and Q15 Interest and dividends Show any gross net interest received in Box 14 or 15, and any dividends in Box 14A or 15A. Costs incurred in deriving the interest can be deducted before entering the amount in Box 14 or 15. This includes interest paid by Inland Revenue. Interest on broken term deposits If you have broken a term deposit during the year, there may be "negative interest" to account for. This is interest repaid on a term deposit. This may reduce the amount of interest to declare on the tax return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business- related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the RWT withholding certificate. Deduct the allowable negative interest component using the worksheet below before entering the gross amount at Question 14 or 15 of the return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE19 1 2 3 Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. Print any negative interest you have paid in Box 2. Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Question 14 or 15 of your tax return. Worksheet Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in the income year you received it. If you paid us interest, include it as a deduction in the income year the interest was paid. If your overall interest is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Taxable Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. You're only required to declare taxable Māori authority distributions made from gross income that Māori authorities earned during the 2004-05 income year or subsequent income years. Fill in Box 14B or 15B if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. ird.govt.nz20 What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows: • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • the amount of Māori authority credit. These amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, will need to be transferred to the following boxes: • taxable Māori authority distributions should be shown in either Box 14B or 15B • Māori authority credits should be shown in Other tax credits Box 21I. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. They pay tax of $1,750 on this profit (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distribute the entire profit to their 10 members, so each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR9 return would show the following information: Box 14B or 15B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Box 21I - $175 Non-taxable distributions Any other distributions received from a Māori authority, which are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member do not need to be included in the IR9 return. These amounts are classed as non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. Other income Print the net profit in Box 14C or 15C. The net income is the gross income less expenses related to earning the income, if it is a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. Overseas income You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates table available from ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE21 Australian dividends from non-foreign investment fund investments If you hold shares in an Australian company which has elected to maintain a New Zealand imputation account, you may see a "New Zealand imputation credit" on your dividend statement. It's possible for dividends to be paid with these credits attached. Show any Australian dividend income at Box 14A or 15A. Claim the New Zealand imputation credits in the dividend imputation credits box at Question 21C and include overseas tax credits at Question 21A. This does not mean Australian imputed or franking credits can now be claimed. Inland Revenue approval may be required for an exemption from income tax. Foreign-sourced dividends Under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, dividends received from overseas companies may no longer be separately taxable. Generally, clubs or societies would use the default FIF income calculation method, called the fair dividend rate (FDR), which does not tax dividends separately. However, the foreign tax deducted from the dividend can be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income. To learn more about FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz/fif Foreign rights If you're calculating controlled foreign company (CFC) or FIF income you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. The types of foreign investment that may not require an additional disclosure are investments in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2024, which have used the comparative value (CV) or FDR method. Full details of the disclosure requirements are available in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs). The disclosure forms are available from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Contact us if you need help to find the appropriate disclosure form. ird.govt.nz22 Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and attributed PIE income/loss Certain PIEs attribute their net income/loss, and tax credits they derive, across their investors. Clubs or societies that are investors include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement setting out the details of the income/loss attributed to the investor for the year. The statement also shows the various types of tax credits associated with the income attributed. These tax credits are subject to the tax credit limits calculated in relation to the tax on the attributed PIE income. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the club or society's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. Generally, PIEs will have a 31 March balance date. Box 15E Income deduction for non-profit bodies A non-profit body can claim a deduction of up to $1,000. This deduction is the smaller of: • the amount at Box 15D, or • $1,000. If the organisation's income is less than $1,000 before the deduction, it will have no taxable income. This deduction is not available to organisations covered by Questions 13 and 14. If your organisation has an exemption from RWT as a non- profit body, it does not necessarily mean it has non-profit status and is exempt for income tax purposes. Question 17 Donations The following societies can claim a deduction for donations made to organisations with donee organisation status: • friendly societies • building societies, and • societies that have been registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908, or the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. You can view the list of donee organisations at ird.govt.nz/donee CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE23 Note State-funded tertiary education institutions, state schools and state-integrated schools do not have to be approved to have donee organisation status. The deduction for donations cannot be more than the society's income after expenses (before the donation deduction is taken into account). Calculate the society's donation deduction: • If the amount in Box 16 is a loss, print nil in Box 17. • If the donations made by the society exceed the amount in Box 16, copy the amount in Box 16 to Box 17. • If the donations made by the society do not exceed the amount in Box 16, print the donations in Box 17. Question 19 Net losses If you have a loss brought forward from a previous year, enter it in Box 19. Question 21 Tax calculation Incorporated bodies: • are taxed at 28 cents in the dollar, and • may be provisional tax payers, and so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 27. Unincorporated bodies: • are assessed at individual tax rates but are not entitled to independent earner tax credits, and • may be provisional tax payers, so may have to make provisional tax payments - see page 27. ird.govt.nz24 If your organisation is an unincorporated body, calculate the tax on its taxable income using these rates. Income thresholdsIncome tax rates for the 2023 income year $0 - $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 +39.0% Claim any tax deducted from income paid to the organisation in Box 21A, 21C, 21G or 21I as appropriate. Box 21D Excess imputation credits brought forward If your organisation is unincorporated and had unused imputation credits in the 2023 return, they were unable to be refunded and must be brought forward and claimed against this year's tax payable. You can find the amount of excess imputation credits to be brought forward to 2024 in the "Loss/excess imputation credits carried forward" letter we sent you after your 2023 income tax return was assessed. Print the amount in Box 21D of your return. Add up your total imputation credits from Boxes 21C and 21D and print the total in Box 21E. Box 21E Imputation credits If the imputation credits at Box 21E are greater than the amount in Box 21B, the difference cannot be refunded. If the organisation is an incorporated body, the excess imputation credits must be converted to a loss and carried forward. To do this, divide the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E by 0.28. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of net loss carried forward to the 2025 return. If the organisation is an unincorporated body, the difference between Boxes 21B and 21E must be carried forward to the 2025 return and credited against the tax liability. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount of excess imputation credits carried forward. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE25 Box 21GG Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If the organisation is an "offshore RLWT person" and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The organisation should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The organisation can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the organisation and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Refunds and/or transfers If you're entitled to a refund you can: • transfer it to arrears that are being paid off • transfer all or part of it to your 2025 provisional tax, or • have any balance direct credited to your club or society's bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account shown at Question 6. If you've made payments towards your 2025 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Direct credit See page 5 for more information on how to have your refund direct credited to your bank account. Refunds of less than $1.00 If your refund is less than $1.00 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We’ll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. ird.govt.nz26 If the transfer is to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to include a note with your return authorising the transfer. Please state clearly: • that the transfer is to arrears currently under an instalment arrangement • the name and IRD number of the taxpayer the transfer should be made to • whether the taxpayer is an "associated taxpayer" • the tax type and period, and • the date you'd like the transfer to take place. Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership, or • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of an associated taxpayer, and • the date you'd like it transferred. If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. Requesting transfers on the return form Fill out the boxes on page 4 of your return if you'd like to transfer a credit to another account. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE27 Transfer date For credit transferred to your account or an associated person's account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted) it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax it's the day you overpaid it. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date. Include the account details you want the credit to be transferred to. If it's going to another person, tell us the transfer date. Question 23 Initial provisional tax liability An organisation has an initial provisional tax liability for a tax year if it: • starts to derive income from a taxable activity in the tax year • had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, and • had a residual income tax of $60,000 or more in the current year. Generally, organisations are not liable to pay provisional tax in their first year of operation. If you meet the criteria to have an initial provisional tax liability you may have to pay interest. The interest cost may be reduced by making voluntary provisional tax payments. Print the date the organisation started to derive income from taxable activity in Box 23. ird.govt.nz28 Interest rules for an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged if your club or society has an initial provisional tax liability. It may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date, which is determined by the business start date. For most organisations with a balance date of 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 30 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. For organisations with a balance date of 31 March, and registered for six-monthly GST filing, the start date for interest will be: • 29 October, if the taxable activity started before 30 September of the same year, or • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 30 September of the previous year. If the organisation has a balance date other than 31 March, the provisional tax payment dates will generally be the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months following the balance date. There are special rules about how interest is calculated when a club or society has an initial provisional tax liability and has changed its balance date. For more information read the Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Question 24 2025 provisional tax 2025 provisional tax is charged for income the organisation will earn in the 2025 income year. It’s payable in instalments. If the organisation’s 2024 residual income tax (RIT) is: • $5,000 or less, it does not have to pay provisional tax, but it can make voluntary payments • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2025, it may estimate 2025 provisional tax at nil, or • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2025, it must pay 2025 provisional tax using 1 of the payment options. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE29 If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2025 year, read the notes on interest - see page 28. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. All clubs or societies may choose 1 of the following 3 options to work out their provisional tax: Standard option If you use this option, write S in Box 24 of the return and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 24A. • For unincorporated organisations, 2025 provisional tax is the 2024 RIT plus 5%. If 2024 return has not been completed it will be 2023 RIT plus 10%. • For incorporated organisations, 2025 provisional tax is the 2024 RIT plus 5%. If 2024 return has not been completed it will be 2023 RIT plus 10%. Estimation option An organisation can estimate its 2025 provisional tax as many times as it wants to up to and including its final instalment date. If the 2025 RIT is expected to be lower than its 2024 RIT, estimating may stop it from paying more provisional tax than it has to. If the organisation estimates its provisional tax, write E in Box 24 on the return and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 24A. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to if you use the estimation option. Read the notes on the not taking reasonable care penalty and interest on page 28. Remember, when making your estimate, that incorporated and unincorporated bodies have different tax rates. Incorporated bodies use the tax rate of 28% . For unincorporated bodies, see the tax rates on page 22. ird.govt.nz30 Ratio option Note If you're using the ratio option and select E at Box 24, you're electing to stop using this option. If the club or society is GST registered, you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 24 if you've already elected to use the ratio option. You must apply in writing to use the ratio option before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 24. You'll find more information about the ratio option in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the organisation's 2025 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2025 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, the organisation may be liable for not taking reasonable care and a penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax will apply. Interest If the organisation has paid too much provisional tax, we pay interest, or if it has not paid enough provisional tax, we charge interest. Interest the organisation pays is tax deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties, read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Election to be a provisional tax payer A club or society is a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year if its RIT for that year is more than $5,000. If the 2024 RIT is $5,000 or less, but the club or society paid provisional tax for the year, it may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2024. This may affect the interest the organisation may be entitled to for 2024. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year, attach a note to the front of the 2024 return. CLUBS OR SOCIETIES TAX RETURN GUIDE31 Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. You'll find more information about these rules in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows provisional tax payers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, reducing possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling Payment dates 2025 provisional tax Generally, a club or society with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2024 • Second instalment 15 January 2025 • Third instalment 7 May 2025 A club or society with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. There are 2 exceptions: • An instalment due on 28 December will be due on 15 January. • An instalment due on 28 April will be due on 7 May. These dates will alter if: • the club or society is registered for GST and the GST is completed six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid through the ratio option. If one of these situations applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2024 end-of-year income tax Clubs or societies with an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2025 to pay their tax. If this applies, contact your agent for more information. ird.govt.nz32 Otherwise, a club or society with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2025. A club or society with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the seventh day of the month before the following year's balance date.

IR9XA April 2018 Tax agents' extension of time (EOT) agreement For filing period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 2 www.ird.govt.nz Contents Extension of time (EOT) arrangements for 2018 returns Introduction 3 Why have an EOT? 3 EOT filing guidelines and dates 3 Standard, E-File and late balance dates 3 Negotiated personal guidelines - genuine reasons 3 Linking and EOT 4 Two or more returns outstanding 4 Requesting information to file returns 4 Deferral of policing for clients with exceptional circumstances ("D status") 4 Late provision of information (L letter) 4 Request to withdraw a client's EOT 4 Request to reinstate a client's EOT 4 Filing performance as at 31 March 2019 5 Returns outstanding after 31 March 2019 5 Withdrawing a tax agent's EOT 5 Reinstating a tax agent's EOT 5 List of tax agents 5 Reports 6 Copy of the "L letter" 7 Legislation relating to EOT 8 Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 3 www.ird.govt.nz Extension of time (EOT) arrangements for 2018 returns Introduction Legislation extends the time tax agents have to file their clients' tax returns up to 31 March each year. The extension of time (EOT) agreement sets out the guidelines for the percentage of returns to be filed by certain dates throughout the year. It makes provisions for excluding clients from the 31 March target percentage if they're late providing you with the information necessary to file a return. It also allows for special arrangements where a client's return is affected by exceptional circumstances. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), previously NZICA and Inland Revenue annually negotiate the administrative details of applying an automatic EOT to agents. This agreement is applied by Inland Revenue to all tax agents, whether or not they're members of CA ANZ. Why have an EOT? Legislation requires income tax returns to be filed by 7 July each year. However, the Commissioner can give the clients of tax agents an extension of time to file income tax returns up to, but not beyond, 31 March of the following year. See page 7 for legal references. Realistically tax agents couldn't prepare all returns by 7 July, so the EOT agreement lets: •tax agents spread return filing over a year rather than in one peak period •Inland Revenue maintain an even flow of tax returns over a 12-month window and ensure no work is carried over to the next filing year. EOT filing guidelines and dates Interim dates are provided each year as a guideline to help you meet the requirement to file 100% of your clients' returns by 31 March. If some returns can't be filed by 31 March 2019 this agreement sets out how these will be managed. As well as a guide to file 100% of returns by 31 March, interim dates also help us manage the processing of the returns filed. The interim dates are negotiable and won't be monitored unless you fail to file 90% of returns as at 31 March. If this happens we'll issue a caution. Your EOT arrangement will then be supervised by your account manager for the following filing year. Standard, E-File and late balance dates If you haven't negotiated personal dates, the following interim dates apply as your guidelines: •40% of clients' returns filed by 14 September 2018 •60% of clients' returns filed by 9 November 2018 •80% of clients' returns filed by 8 February 2019. These dates are to help you meet the required: •100% of clients' returns filed by 31 March 2019. Negotiated personal guidelines - genuine reasons If you failed to file at least 90% of 2017 returns as at 31 March 2018 you would have received a caution and your account manager will be supervising your EOT arrangement for the filing of 2018 returns. This may include negotiating interim guidelines that better suit your business, but still with the requirement to file 100% by 31 March 2019. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 4 www.ird.govt.nz Linking and EOT When you link a new client you'll automatically be given an EOT unless the client has two or more returns outstanding. Two or more returns outstanding New clients with two or more returns unfiled at the time of linking (R EOT) won't be entitled to an automatic EOT for the current year. If you take on a client and find they have returns outstanding for two or more years, there are two alternatives: 1. If the returns identified aren't required to be filed, call the tax agents' line or advise your account manager. 2. You or the client may apply for an individual EOT arrangement under section 37(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Requesting information to file returns Inland Revenue and CA ANZ agreed on the following process to help tax agents obtain information so they're able to file a return for their client. Deferral of policing for clients with exceptional circumstances ("D status") We can't give an EOT beyond 31 March because we're constrained by legislation. However, in some circumstances clients can't file their returns by 31 March through no fault of their own. In these situations we'll change the client's EOT status to D (deferred) if they have: •Y (EOT granted), or •L (L letter requesting information) for the current year. After 31 March, these clients will automatically be restored to the agent's client list for filing their 2019 returns. Late provision of information (L letter) If a client has an EOT and is late providing you with all the necessary information to complete their returns, you can issue a reminder letter by calling our 0800 tax agents' self-service line (0800 456 678). The letter is issued in the name of Inland Revenue. It won't be attributed to you or your agency and can't be used for clients who don't have an EOT or an overseas address. It reminds clients they haven't provided their tax agent with enough information to file a return. A copy of the L letter is on page 6. Note The L letter is only available between August and the following February. Request to withdraw a client's EOT You can request the withdrawal of a particular client's EOT at any time by writing to your account manager or calling the tax agents' line. We won't reinstate your EOT for that client without your agreement. Request to reinstate a client's EOT The EOT may be reinstated for your client for the 2019 filing year if: •the 2018 return and current outstanding 2017 return are filed before a late filing penalty is imposed after 7 July, or •it's unrealistic to expect the client to file their 2018 return before a late filing penalty is applied. Approval for reinstatement of the client's EOT may be negotiated provided: - the reasons for not filing the 2017 return by 31 March 2018 have been reviewed, and - where possible remedied, and - the agent has given us a written undertaking that their 2018 return will be filed by 31 March 2019. Where a written guarantee can't be provided, an individual extension of time may be negotiated. Any reinstatement of your EOT is at the discretion of the account manager and will be based on your past and present filing performance. If you want to apply for reinstatement please contact us prior to any late filing penalty being imposed on the 2018 tax return. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 5 www.ird.govt.nz Filing performance as at 31 March 2019 If you've filed less than 100% of your client's returns by 31 March 2019 we'll take the following actions. Where your performance is: •98% or better, we'll send you a letter of achievement and encouragement towards the ultimate goal of 100% •less than 90%, we'll send you a caution and will supervise the EOT arrangement for your 2019-20 return filing year •less than 90% as at 31 March 2018 and less than 90% as at 31 March 2019, we'll consult with you and may withdraw your EOT. Returns outstanding after 31 March 2019 Returns outstanding after 31 March 2019 will be subject to enforcement action. We'll automatically withdraw your EOT for the client for the following year. To prevent any misunderstandings over actions we may take for overdue returns we'll maintain open communications with you. If you haven't filed 100% of your returns by 31 March, and we haven't heard from you, we'll contact the client direct to discuss their outstanding return. Withdrawing a tax agent's EOT If your performance was less than 90% as at 31 March 2018, we may withdraw your EOT if your filing is below 90% as at 31 March 2019. This won't be done without first issuing a notice in writing that we're considering withdrawing the EOT and inviting you to discuss your circumstances with your account manager or Inland Revenue manager. Reinstating a tax agent's EOT If your EOT is withdrawn it won't be reinstated before the end of the 2019-20 filing year. Any reinstatement of your EOT is at the discretion of the account manager and will be based on your past and present filing performance. An EOT can't be reinstated before the next filing year. List of tax agents We may remove you or your agency from our list if the Commissioner is satisfied that continuing to list you as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or you're not eligible to be a tax agent (after a thorough review).

The extension of time (EOT) agreement sets out the guidelines for the percentage of returns to be filed by certain dates throughout the year. It makes provisions for excluding clients from the 31 March target percentage if they're late providing you with the information necessary to file a return. It also allows for special arrangements where a client's return is affected by exceptional circumstances. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), and Inland Revenue annually negotiate the administrative details of applying an automatic EOT to agents. This agreement is applied by Inland Revenue to all tax agents, whether or not they're members of CA ANZ. Why have an EOT? Legislation requires income tax returns to be filed by 7 July each year. However, the Commissioner can give the clients of tax agents an extension of time to file income tax returns up to, but not beyond, 31 March of the following year. Refer to page 8 for legal references. Realistically tax agents couldn't prepare all returns by 7 July, so the EOT agreement lets: •tax agents spread return filing over a year rather than in one peak period •Inland Revenue maintain an even flow of tax returns over a 12-month window and ensure no work is carried over to the next filing year. EOT filing guidelines and dates Interim dates are provided each year as a guideline to help you meet the requirement to file 100% of your clients' returns by 31 March. If some returns can't be filed by 31 March 2020 this agreement sets out how these will be managed. As well as a guide to file 100% of returns by 31 March, interim dates also help us manage the processing of the returns filed. If you fail to file 90% of returns as at 31 March, we'll issue a caution. Your EOT arrangement may then be supervised by your account manager for the following filing year. Interim guideline dates If you haven't negotiated personal dates, the following interim dates apply as your guidelines: •40% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in September 2019 •60% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in November 2019 •80% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in February 2020. These dates are to help you meet the required: •100% of clients' returns filed by 31 March 2020. We’ll send you a letter to remind you of your filing requirements and your current filing % before each interim date. If you use myIR the letter will be sent as an electronic document to all Owner and Administrator web logons. Negotiated personal guidelines - genuine reasons If you failed to file at least 90% of 2018 returns as at 31 March 2019 you would have received a caution and your account manager may be supervising your EOT arrangement for the filing of 2019 returns. This may include negotiating interim guidelines that better suit your business, but still with the requirement to file 100% by 31 March 2020. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 4 www.ird.govt.nz Linking and EOT When you link a new client you'll automatically be given an EOT unless the client has two or more returns outstanding. Two or more returns outstanding New clients with two or more returns unfiled at the time of linking (Returns overdue EOT) won't be entitled to an automatic EOT for the current year. If you take on a client and find they have returns outstanding for two or more years, there are two alternatives: 1. If the returns identified aren't required to be filed, call the tax agents' line. 2. You or the client may apply for an individual EOT arrangement under section 37(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Requesting information to file returns Inland Revenue and CA ANZ agreed on the following process to help tax agents obtain information so they're able to file a return for their client. Deferred status for clients with exceptional circumstances We can't give an EOT beyond 31 March because we're constrained by legislation. However, in some circumstances clients can't file their returns by 31 March through no fault of their own. In these situations you can apply for deferred status in myIR (under the Tax preparer tab) and we'll change the client's EOT status to Deferred if they have an EOT status of: •Granted, or •Letter issued (L letter requesting information) for the current year. After 31 March, these clients will automatically be restored to the agent's client list for filing their 2020 returns. The deferred status request is only available in myIR between 1 August and 20 March the following year. It is not available to Restricted user web logons. Owner and Administrator web logons can apply for any client that meets the criteria, but Users must have the client’s income tax account in their workspace. Late provision of information (L letter) If a client has an EOT and is late providing you with all the necessary information to complete their returns, you can issue a reminder letter in myIR (under the Tax preparer tab) or by calling our 0800 tax agents' self-service line (0800 456 678). You can now issue an L letter for clients with an overseas address. The letter is issued in the name of Inland Revenue. It won't be attributed to you or your agency and can't be used for clients who don't have an EOT. It reminds clients they haven't provided their tax agent with enough information to file a return. A copy of the L letter is on page 7. Note The L letter is only available in myIR and on the tax agents’ self-service line between 1 August and 14 February the following year. Request to withdraw a client's EOT You can request the withdrawal of a particular client's EOT at any time by writing to your account manager or calling the tax agents' line. Returns outstanding after 31 March 2020 Any 2019 tax returns outstanding after 31 March 2020 will be subject to enforcement action. We'll automatically withdraw your EOT for the client's 2020 tax return. To prevent any misunderstandings over actions we may take for overdue returns we'll maintain open communications with you. If you haven't filed 100% of your returns by 31 March, and we haven't heard from you, we'll contact the client direct to discuss their outstanding return. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 5 www.ird.govt.nz Request to reinstate a client's withdrawn or returns overdue EOT A withdrawn or returns overdue EOT may be reinstated for your client for the 2020 filing year if: •the 2019 return and current outstanding 2018 return are filed before a late filing penalty is applied to the 2019 return, or •it's unrealistic to expect the client to file their 2019 return before a late filing penalty is applied. Approval for reinstatement of the client's EOT may be negotiated provided: - the reasons for not filing the 2018 return by 31 March 2019 have been reviewed, and - where possible remedied, and - the agent has given us a written undertaking that their client's 2019 return will be filed by 31 March 2020. Where a written guarantee can't be provided, an individual extension of time may be negotiated. If you want to apply for an EOT reinstatement please contact us before any late filing penalty is charged on the 2019 tax return. Filing performance as at 31 March 2020 If you've filed less than 100% of your client's returns by 31 March 2020 we'll take the following actions. Where your performance is: •98% or better, we'll send you a letter of achievement and encouragement towards the ultimate goal of 100% •less than 90%, we'll send you a caution and may supervise the EOT arrangement for your 2020-21 return filing year •less than 90% as at 31 March 2019 and less than 90% as at 31 March 2020, we'll consult with you and may withdraw your EOT. Withdrawing a tax agent's EOT If your performance was less than 90% as at 31 March 2019, we may withdraw your EOT if your filing is below 90% as at 31 March 2020. This won't be done without first issuing a notice in writing that we're considering withdrawing the EOT and inviting you to discuss your circumstances with your account manager or Inland Revenue manager. Reinstating a tax agent's EOT If your EOT is withdrawn it won't be reinstated before the end of the 2020-21 filing year. Any reinstatement of your EOT is at the discretion of the account manager and will be based on your past and present filing performance. An EOT can't be reinstated before the next filing year. List of tax agents We may remove you or your agency from our list if the Commissioner is satisfied that continuing to list you as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or you're not eligible to be a tax agent (after a thorough review).

Interim dates are provided each year to help tax agents keep track of their filing targets. This document explains the 2020-2021: •EOT agreement •interim guideline dates and expected filing percentages •performance monitoring using myIR and how to reach 100% filing percentages •reasons a client's or agent's EOT may have been withdrawn and how to have this reinstated. Th e EOT agreement makes provisions for excluding clients from the 31 March target percentage if they're late providing the information necessary to file a return. Th e agreement also allows for special arrangements where a client's return is affected by exceptional circumstances. This agreement is negotiated between Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) and us (Inland Revenue). The administrative details of applying an automatic EOT to tax agents are regularly reviewed. We apply the terms and conditions of this agreement to all tax agents, whether they're members of CA ANZ or not. Extension of time (EOT) arrangements for filing returns Why have an EOT? Legislation requires income tax returns to be filed by 7 July each year. Tax agents often have large numbers of clients so it would be unrealistic to expect them to fi le all returns by 7 July. The Commissioner can give clients of tax agents an EOT to file their income tax returns (to 31 March) and make their income tax payment (to 7 April) of the year after the assessment. By extending these timeframes it allows: •t ax agents to spread return filing over a year rather than having 1 peak period •us to maintain an even flow of processing tax returns over a 12-month window, and make sure no work is carried over to the next filing year. Refer to page 8 for legal references relating to EOTs. Who qualifies for an EOT Tax agents who meet most of their filing targets and clients with good filing history will generally qualify for an EOT. EOT Interim guideline dates EOT monitoring and stats now include any client with an active income tax account. The following interim dates and percentages apply as your tax return filing guidelines: •40% o f clients' returns filed by the second Friday in September 2020 •60% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in November 2020 •80% o f clients' returns filed by the second Friday in February 2021. Following these guidelines will help you achieve 100% of client returns filed, and automatic calculations for income tax confirmed, by 31 March 2021. We send you a letter to remind you of your filing requirements and current filing percentage for clients with an EOT before each interim date. This letter is sent electronically in myIR to all owner and administrator web logons. If you do not use myIR, the letter is sent by post. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 4 ird.govt.nz Filing performance as at 31 March We measure filing performance for those clients who have an EOT. This does not negate from the expectation that in utilising the EOT provisions, you'll aim to file 100% of your clients' returns. If you file 100% of client returns you'll get a letter of achievement confirming you've achieved the expected filing percentage. If you file 98% or above you'll get a letter of achievement, with encouragement towards the goal of 100% for the following year. If you achieve 90% up to 98% you'll also get a letter confirming your filing statistic results. Negotiated personal guidelines We'll send you a letter of caution if you file less than 90% of required returns. Your account manager will also supervise your filing performance for the following year. This may include negotiating interim guidelines that better suit your business, but will still include the requirement to file 100% of required returns by 31 March. Continued low filing performance If you file less than 90% of required returns 2 years in a row, we'll issue a written notice to advise we're considering withdrawing your EOT. Your account manager will then meet with you to discuss the circumstances that led to the failure. Following this meeting, we may continue, cancel or renegotiate the EOT arrangement. If you're not satisfied with our decision, or think you've been treated unfairly, you may ask us to reconsider the decision. Reinstating a tax agent's EOT If your EOT is withdrawn, it will not be reinstated before the end of the following filing year. Any reinstatement of your EOT is at the discretion of your account manager and will be based on your past and current filing performance. If you're not satisfied with our decision, or think you've been treated unfairly, you may ask us to reconsider the decision. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 5 ird.govt.nz Tools to help tax agents manage client filing EOT dashboard In myIR you can view: •your agency's filing performance •the performance breakdown for client lists •which clients have had an L letter issued or have Deferred status. Reports You can generate a variety of reports in myIR to help manage your return filing. These reports can be exported to excel. All reports indicate the: •period covered •date produced •agency's IRD number and name. A client list report is available in myIR to owners and administrators, and provides a high-level overview of client information (including clients who have an EOT). This report replaces many of the previous paper-based reports that were issued to tax agents on a regular basis. You can generate the client list report whenever required by the agency. More information can be found on the Top solutions for tax intermediaries section on our website, under the Resource Library. Go to ird.govt.nz and search for Top solutions. The agency activity report will show changes made to your clients' records (including changes to their EOT status). Late provision of information (L letter) If a client has not provided you with the information needed to complete their tax return, you can ask us to issue an L letter to remind the client to provide you the information. You can issue a reminder letter in myIR from the Tax preparer tab. L letters are available between 1 August and 14 February the following year. An example of the L letter is on page 7. Deferred status for clients with exceptional circumstances (D status) We cannot grant an EOT beyond 31 March due to legislative constraints. However, in some circumstances clients cannot file their returns by 31 March through no fault of their own. If this is the case, you can apply to change the client's EOT status to deferred (D status). You can only apply for D status if the client has either: •an existing EOT •received an L letter. D status can be applied for in myIR from the Tax preparer tab. If D status is granted, we'll delay asking for the client's outstanding return until after the new agreed date. You'll need to contact your account manager if circumstances continue to prevent the return being filed. After 31 March, these clients will automatically be restored to your client list for filing their following years' returns. D status applications are available between 1 August and 20 March the following year. Request to withdraw a client's EOT If you have a client who is not responding to requests for records, information or to sign off their accounts, you may want to remove their EOT. You need to contact us to request a client's EOT be withdrawn. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 6 ird.govt.nz Other EOT information Request to reinstate a client's withdrawn or returns overdue EOT A withdrawn or returns overdue EOT may be reinstated for a client for the following filing year if either: •all overdue returns are filed, and the current year return is filed before a late filing penalty is applied •due to circumstances, it's unrealistic to expect the client to file their current year return before a late filing penalty is applied. Approval for reinstatement of the client's EOT may be negotiated, as long as both: •the reasons for not filing earlier year returns by 31 March have been reviewed, and where possible remedied •you give us a written undertaking that your client's current year return will be filed by 31 March. Where a written guarantee cannot be provided, an individual EOT may be negotiated. If you want to apply for an EOT reinstatement, you need to contact us before any late filing penalty is charged. New clients and EOT When you link a new client who has 2 or more outstanding returns at the time of linking (returns overdue EOT), an EOT is not automatic. If you take on a client and find they have returns outstanding for 2 or more years, there are 2 options. 1. If the returns identified are not required to be filed, update the customer's income profile in myIR and contact us to have their return filing status updated. 2. You, or the client, can apply for an individual EOT arrangement, as long as the extended EOT timeframe has not expired. Returns outstanding after 31 March Any returns outstanding after 31 March will be subject to enforcement action. We'll maintain open communication with you to prevent any misunderstandings over actions that may be taken for overdue returns. A warning letter will be sent approximately 10 working days after the due date to advise the return has not been filed. If the return is filed within 30 days from the date of the warning letter, no late filing penalty will be applied and the EOT will not be withdrawn. If you have not filed 100% of your returns by 31 March and have not contacted us, we may contact your client directly to discuss their outstanding return. List of tax agents We keep a list of all organisations and people that have tax agent status. Inland Revenue account managers are responsible for maintaining this list. After a thorough review, we may remove a tax agent from the list of recognised tax agents if the Commissioner is satisfied that continuing to list the tax agent, or tax agency would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or the tax agent is no longer eligible to be a tax agent. Some examples where we'll consider removing a tax agent include: •poor compliance history including personal debt and outstanding returns •poor filing performance •found guilty of a dishonesty crime under the Crimes Act •found guilty of an offence or breach by their professional body •convicted of an offence under the Tax Administration Act.

However, the Commissioner can give clients of tax agents an extension of time to file their income tax returns (to 31 March) and make their income tax payment (to 7 April) of the year following assessment. It makes provisions for excluding clients from the 31 March target percentage if they're late providing tax agents with the information necessary to file a return. It also allows for special arrangements where a client's return is affected by exceptional circumstances. Refer to Appendix for legal references. EOT Interim guideline dates EOT monitoring and stats now include any client with an active Income tax account. To achieve 100% of client returns being filed and automatic calculations for income tax being confirmed by 31 March 2022, the following interim dates and percentages apply as a guideline for tax agents: •40% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in September 2021 •60% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in November 2021 •80% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in February 2022 Inland Revenue sends tax agents a letter to remind them of their filing requirements and their current filing percentage for clients with an extension of time before each interim date. This letter will be sent electronically in myIR to all owner and administrator web logons. If the tax agent does not use myIR, this will be sent via standard post. 1 Tax agent status – Inland Revenue keeps a list of current tax agents. This list keeps track of organisations and people that have tax agent status. Inland Revenue account managers are responsible for maintaining this list Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 4 Income Tax – More information requests These are a return of income for individual clients (excluding IR3 filers) and included in your filing stats. You must review this information and finalise within the required timeframe. •31 March if the client has an extension of time. •45 days after the date of issue if no extension of time. If we do not hear from you within the set timeframe, we’ll assume the information is correct and release the income tax assessment. Once finalised you will receive an income tax assessment. Find out more about Individual income tax for clients of tax agents at ird.govt.nz/income-tax-for-clients-of-agents Filing performance as at 31 March Inland Revenue measures filing performance for those clients who have an extension of time. This does not negate from the expectation that in utilising the extension of time provisions, tax agents will aim to file 100% of all their clients’ returns. Tax agents who file 100% of client returns will receive a letter of achievement confirming they have achieved the expected filing percentage. If the tax agent files 98% or above, Inland Revenue will send a letter of achievement, with encouragement towards the goal of 100% for the following year. Tax agents who achieve 90% up to 98% will also receive a letter confirming their filing statistic results. Negotiated personal guidelines Where a tax agent files less than 90% of required returns, a letter of caution will be sent and their account manager will supervise their filing performance for the following year. This may include negotiating interim guidelines that better suit the tax agent’s business but will still include the requirement to file 100% of required returns by 31 March. Impact of continued low filing performance If a tax agent files less than 90% of required returns for a second year in a row, Inland Revenue will issue a written notice to confirm they are considering withdrawing the tax agent’s EOT. The tax agent and account manager will then meet to discuss the circumstances that led to the failure (for example, the tax agent may have been impacted by an event outside their control, such as a significant illness or an adverse event). Following this meeting, Inland Revenue may continue, cancel or renegotiate the extension of time arrangement. If a tax agent is not satisfied with our decision, or thinks they’ve been treated unfairly, they may ask us to reconsider the decision. Reinstating a tax agent's EOT If a tax agent’s EOT is withdrawn it will not be reinstated before the end of the following filing year. Any reinstatement of a tax agent’s EOT is at the discretion of the account manager and will be based on the tax agent’s past and current filing performance. If a tax agent is not satisfied with our decision, or thinks they’ve been treated unfairly, they may ask us to reconsider the decision. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 5 Tools to help tax agents manage client filing 1. EOT dashboard In myIR tax agents can view: •the agency’s filing performance •performance breakdown for client lists •which clients have had an L letter issued or have Deferred status. For more information download our Extension of time (EOT) dashboard – IR1123 guide from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides 2. Reports Tax agents can generate a variety of reports in myIR to help manage their return filing. These are accessed in myIR and can be exported to excel. All reports indicate the: •period covered •date produced •agency’s IRD number and name A client list report is available to owners and administrators and provides a high-level overview of client information (including clients who have an EOT). This report replaces many of the previous paper-based reports that were issued to tax agents on a regular basis thus allowing the agent to create these reports when required by the agency. More information can be found on our website at ird.govt.nz/client-list-reports The agency activity report will show changes made to your client’s records (including changes to their EOT status). 3. Late provision of information (L letter) If a tax agent’s client has not provided the information needed to complete their tax return, the tax agent can request Inland Revenue issue an L letter which will remind the client to provide information to the tax agent. Tax agents can issue a reminder letter in myIR from the Tax preparer tab. 2 4. Deferred status for clients with exceptional circumstances (D status) Inland Revenue cannot give an EOT beyond 31 March due to legislative constraints. However, in some circumstances clients can't file their returns by 31 March through no fault of their own. If this is the case, on application, Inland Revenue will change the client’s EOT status to deferred (D status). However, D status can only be applied for if the client has an existing EOT or has received an L letter. D status can be requested in myIR from the Tax preparer tab. If D status is granted, Inland Revenue will delay asking for the outstanding return for that client until after the new agreed date. Tax agents will need to contact their account manager if circumstances continue to prevent the return being filed. After 31 March, these clients will automatically be restored to the tax agent's client list for filing their following years’ returns 3 . 5. Request to withdraw a client's EOT If a tax agent has clients who are not responding to their requests for records, information or to sign off their accounts, the tax agent may wish to remove the client’s EOT. They will need to contact Inland Revenue to action this request. 2 Example in Appendix 1. L letters are available between 1 August and 15 February the following year 3 D status applications are available between 1 August and 30 March the following year Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 6 Other EOT information Request to reinstate a client's withdrawn or returns overdue EOT A withdrawn or overdue returns EOT may be reinstated for a tax agent’s client for the following filing year if either: •all overdue returns are filed, and the current year return is filed before a late filing penalty is applied •due to circumstances, it's unrealistic to expect the client to file their current year return before a late filing penalty is applied. Approval for reinstatement of the client's EOT may be negotiated providing all the following apply: •the reasons for not filing earlier year returns by 31 March have been reviewed •where possible remedied •the tax agent gives Inland Revenue a written undertaking that their client’s current year return will be filed by 31 March. Where a written guarantee cannot be provided, an individual extension of time may be negotiated. If the tax agent wants to apply for an EOT reinstatement, they need to contact Inland Revenue before any late filing penalty is charged. New clients and EOT When a tax agent links a new client, who has 2 or more returns unfiled at the time of linking (returns overdue EOT), an extension of time is not automatic. If a tax agent takes on a client and finds they have returns outstanding for 2 or more years, there are 2 alternatives. 1. If the returns identified are not required to be filed, update the customer’s income profile in myIR and contact Inland Revenue to have their return filing status updated. 2. The tax agent or the client may apply for an individual EOT arrangement under section 37(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, providing the extended EOT timeframe has not expired. List of tax agents After a thorough review, Inland Revenue may remove a tax agent from the list of recognised tax agents if the Commissioner is satisfied that continuing to list the tax agent, or tax agency would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or the tax agent is no longer eligible to be a tax agent. Some examples where Inland Revenue will consider removing a tax agent include 4 : •poor compliance history including personal debt and outstanding returns •poor filing performance •found guilty of a dishonesty crime under the Crimes Act •found guilty of an offence or breach by their professional body •convicted of an offence under the Tax Administration Act. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 7 Returns outstanding after 31 March Any returns outstanding after 31 March will be subject to enforcement action. An income tax return reminder letter will be sent approximately 10 working days after the due date advising that the return has not been filed. If the return is not filed within 30 days from the date of the letter, Inland Revenue will automatically withdraw the client’s EOT for the following year and charge a late filing penalty. If a tax agent has not filed 100% of their returns by 31 March and they have not contacted Inland Revenue, Inland Revenue may contact the client directly to discuss their outstanding return. 4 More detailed information is located in the Tax Information Bulletin – Vol 20, No 3, April 2008 (Page 65) Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 8 Appendices Copy of the "L letter" www.ird.govt.nz IRD number Reference Issued Dear Income tax return for the year ending \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Your tax agent requires information to file this return Your income tax return for the year ending \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is due \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

EOT Interim guideline dates EOT monitoring and stats now include any client with an active Income tax account. To achieve 100% of client returns being filed and automatic calculations for income tax being confirmed by 31 March 2024, the following interim dates and percentages apply as a guideline for tax agents: •40% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in September 2023 •60% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in November 2023 •80% of clients' returns filed by the second Friday in February 2024 Inland Revenue sends tax agents a letter to remind them of their filing requirements and their current filing percentage for clients with an extension of time before each interim date. This letter will be sent electronically in myIR to all owner and administrator web logons. If the tax agent does not use myIR, this will be sent via standard post. 1 Tax agent status – Inland Revenue keeps a list of current tax agents. This list keeps track of organisations and people that have tax agent status. Inland Revenue account managers are responsible for maintaining this list Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 4 Income Tax – More information requests These are a return of income for individual clients (excluding IR3 filers) and included in your filing stats. You must review this information and finalise within the required timeframe. •31 March if the client has an extension of time. •45 days after the date of issue if no extension of time. If we do not hear from you within the set timeframe, we’ll assume the information is correct and release the income tax assessment. Once finalised you will receive an income tax assessment. Find out more about Individual income tax for clients of tax agents at ird.govt.nz/income-tax-for-clients-of-agents Filing performance as at 31 March Inland Revenue measures filing performance for those clients who have an extension of time. This does not negate from the expectation that in utilising the extension of time provisions, tax agents will aim to file 100% of all their clients’ returns. Tax agents who file 100% of client returns will receive a letter of achievement confirming they have achieved the expected filing percentage. If the tax agent files 98% or above, Inland Revenue will send a letter of achievement, with encouragement towards the goal of 100% for the following year. Tax agents who achieve 90% up to 98% will also receive a letter confirming their filing statistic results. Negotiated personal guidelines Where a tax agent files less than 90% of required returns, a letter of caution will be sent and their account manager will supervise their filing performance for the following year. This may include negotiating interim guidelines that better suit the tax agent’s business but will still include the requirement to file 100% of required returns by 31 March. Impact of continued low filing performance If a tax agent files less than 90% of required returns for a second year in a row, Inland Revenue will issue a written notice to confirm they are considering withdrawing the tax agent’s EOT. The tax agent and account manager will then meet to discuss the circumstances that led to the failure (for example, the tax agent may have been impacted by an event outside their control, such as a significant illness or an adverse event). Following this meeting, Inland Revenue may continue, withdraw or renegotiate the extension of time arrangement. If a tax agent is not satisfied with our decision, or thinks they’ve been treated unfairly, they may ask us to reconsider the decision. Reinstating a tax agent's EOT If a tax agent’s EOT is withdrawn it will not be reinstated before the end of the following filing year. Any reinstatement of a tax agent’s EOT is at the discretion of the account manager and will be based on the tax agent’s past and current filing performance. If a tax agent is not satisfied with our decision, or thinks they’ve been treated unfairly, they may ask us to reconsider the decision. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 5 Tools to help tax agents manage client filing 1. EOT dashboard In myIR tax agents can view: •the agency’s filing performance •performance breakdown for client lists •how many clients have had an L letter issued or have Deferred status. For more information download our Extension of time (EOT) dashboard – IR1123 guide from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides 2. Reports Tax agents can generate a variety of reports in myIR to help manage their return filing. These are accessed in myIR and can be exported to excel. All reports indicate the: •period covered •date produced •agency’s IRD number and name. A client list report is available to owners, administrators and restricted administrators, and provides a high-level overview of client information (including clients who have an EOT). More information can be found on our website at ird.govt.nz/client-list-reports The agency activity report will show changes made to your client’s records (including changes to their EOT status). An ‘unfiled returns’ report is now available in myIR in the Intermediary Centre. This is available to owners, administrators and restricted administrators, and provides details of: •Unfiled L letter and D status returns - and the deferred dates for D status returns. •Unfiled income tax returns. •Unfinalised auto-issued assessments with requests for more information. 3. Late provision of information (L letter) If a tax agent’s client has not provided the information needed to complete their tax return, the tax agent can request Inland Revenue issue an L letter which will remind the client to provide information to the tax agent. Tax agents can issue a reminder letter in myIR from the Intermediary Centre between 1 August and 15 February the following year. This date does not alter due to public holiday, weekend or adverse event. 4. Deferred status for clients with exceptional circumstances (D status) Inland Revenue cannot give an EOT beyond 31 March due to legislative constraints. However, in some circumstances clients can't file their returns by 31 March through no fault of their own. If this is the case, on application, Inland Revenue may change the client’s EOT status to deferred (D status). However, D status can only be applied for if the client has an existing EOT or has received an L letter. D status can be requested in myIR from the Intermediary Centre between 1 August and 30 March the following year. This date does not alter due to public holiday, weekend or adverse event. If D status is granted, Inland Revenue will delay asking for the outstanding return for that client until after the new agreed date. Tax agents will need to contact their account manager if circumstances continue to prevent the return being filed. Approved D status requests will be visible in myIR in the Intermediary Centre on the agency activity report and the unfiled returns report. If your D status request is declined we will notify you. After 31 March, these clients will automatically be restored to the tax agent's client list for filing their following years’ returns. 5. Request to withdraw a client's EOT If a tax agent has clients who are not responding to their requests for records, information or to sign off their accounts, the tax agent may wish to remove the client’s EOT. They will need to contact Inland Revenue to action this request. Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 6 Other EOT information Request to reinstate a client's withdrawn or returns overdue EOT A withdrawn or overdue returns EOT may be reinstated for a tax agent’s client for the following filing year if either: •all overdue returns are filed, and the current year return is filed before a late filing penalty is applied •due to circumstances, it's unrealistic to expect the client to file their current year return before a late filing penalty is applied. Approval for reinstatement of the client's EOT may be negotiated providing all the following apply: •the reasons for not filing earlier year returns by 31 March have been reviewed •where possible remedied •the tax agent gives Inland Revenue a written undertaking that their client’s current year return will be filed by 31 March. Where a written guarantee cannot be provided, an individual extension of time may be negotiated. If a tax agent wants to apply for an EOT reinstatement, they can do this at any time, however, if the late filing penalty has already been charged this will not be reversed. New clients and EOT When a tax agent links a new client, who has 2 or more returns unfiled at the time of linking (returns overdue EOT), an extension of time is not automatic. If a tax agent takes on a client and finds they have returns outstanding for 2 or more years, there are 2 alternatives. 1. If the returns identified are not required to be filed, update the customer’s income profile in myIR and contact Inland Revenue to have their return filing status updated. 2. The tax agent or the client may apply for an individual EOT arrangement under section 37(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, providing the extended EOT timeframe has not expired. List of tax agents After a thorough review, Inland Revenue may remove a tax agent from the list of recognised tax agents if the Commissioner is satisfied that continuing to list the tax agent, or tax agency would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or the tax agent is no longer eligible to be a tax agent. Some examples where Inland Revenue will consider removing a tax agent include 2 : •poor compliance history including personal debt and outstanding returns •poor filing performance •found guilty of a dishonesty crime under the Crimes Act •found guilty of an offence or breach by their professional body •convicted of an offence under the Tax Administration Act. 2 More detailed information is located in the Tax information Bulletin, Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). Tax agents’ extension of time (EOT) agreement 7 Returns outstanding after 31 March Any returns outstanding after 31 March will be subject to enforcement action. An income tax return reminder letter will be sent approximately 10 working days after the due date advising that the return has not been filed. If the return is not filed within 30 days from the date of the letter, Inland Revenue will automatically withdraw the client’s EOT for the following year and charge a late filing penalty. If a tax agent has not filed 100% of their returns by 31 March and they have not contacted Inland Revenue, Inland Revenue may contact the client directly to discuss their outstanding return.

Section 3 The definition in section 3(1) of the TAA sets out that a tax agent is a person who: •is eligible under section 124C(3) of the TAA to be a tax agent, and •is listed by the Commissioner as a tax agent, and •has not been removed from the list of tax agents. Section 124C Section 124C sets out the eligibility criteria to be a tax agent. A person is eligible to be listed as a tax agent if they prepare the returns of income required to be filed for 10 or more other persons and is: •a person carrying on a professional public practice, or •a person carrying on a business, occupation or employment in which annual returns of income are prepared and filed, or •a person employed by a company that is a member of a group of companies, and returns of income are prepared and filed by the company for the group •the Māori Trustee. Section 124C also: •requires the Commissioner to compile and maintain a list of tax agents, and •explains how to apply to be listed as a tax agent. Section 124E requires: •the Commissioner to collect the names of key people from tax agent organisations, and •a tax agent entity to provide certain information to the Commissioner. Section 124G: •allows the Commissioner to refuse to list someone as a tax agent, when listing the applicant as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or the applicant is not entitled to make the application •allows the Commissioner to remove someone from the list of tax agents, when continuing to list the applicant as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system and/or the applicant is not eligible to be a tax agent, and •requires the Commissioner to provide certain information before refusing to list a tax agent or removing them from the list. Section 37 Section 37(3) allows the Commissioner to give individual taxpayers an extension of time to file tax returns. This extension is decided on a case or class of cases basis to a date that the Commissioner thinks appropriate under the circumstances. Section 37(4) allows the Commissioner to "extend a tax agent's time for furnishing a return of income for any taxpayer to a date that the Commissioner thinks proper in the circumstance, if the Commissioner is satisfied that: a) the tax agent is unable to furnish the return of income on or before the date set by subsection (1), or b) it would be unreasonable, having regard to the circumstances of the tax agent preparing the return, to require the return to be furnished on or before the date set by subsection (1)." Sections 37(4B) and (5) allow the Commissioner to give tax agents' clients extensions of time to file income tax returns up to, but not beyond, 31 March of the following year.

Interim dates are provided each year to help tax agents keep track of their filing targets, with 100% to be filed by 31 March. This document explains the 2024-2025: •EOT agreement, •guideline dates and expected filing percentages, •how to monitor performance using myIR and reach 100% filing percentages, and •reasons a client's or agent's EOT may have been withdrawn and how to have this reinstated. This agreement, between Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), and Inland Revenue, is negotiated. It regularly reviews the administrative details of applying an automatic EOT to tax agents. The terms and conditions of this agreement are applied to all tax agents by Inland Revenue, whether they're members of CA ANZ or not 1 . Extension of time (EOT) arrangements for filing returns Why have an EOT? Tax agents often have large numbers of clients, and it would be unrealistic to expect them to file all returns by 7 July. The legislation referred to in this EOT agreement enables: •Tax agents to spread return filing over a year rather than 1 peak period. •Inland Revenue to maintain an even flow of tax returns over a 12-month window and ensure no work is carried over to the next filing year. Who qualifies for an EOT Legislation requires income tax returns to be filed by 7 July each year. However, the Commissioner can give clients of tax agents an extension of time to file their income tax returns (to 31 March) and make their income tax payment (to 7 April) of the year following assessment. It makes provisions for excluding clients from the 31 March target percentage if they're late providing tax agents with the information necessary to file a return. It also allows for special arrangements where a client's return is affected by exceptional circumstances. Refer to Appendix for legal references.

IP3151 Valuation Of Ostriches and Emus For Income Tax Purposes Date of Ruling: 1996. Ostriches and emus are livestock within definition of "non-specified livestock" — Value of non-specified livestock at option of taxpayer — Options either market price, replacement price, standard value or cost price— Income Tax Act 1994, ss EL 9(1), OB 1. Inland Revenue intends to draft and issue a public binding ruling or an interpretation statement on the valuation of ostriches and emus for income tax purposes. Ostriches and emus are livestock and come within the definition of "Non-specified livestock" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the Act"). Section EL 9(1) of the Act provides that the value of any non- specified livestock to be taken into account at the end of the income year, shall be at the option of the taxpayer: • Its cost price; or • Its market price; or • The price at which it can be replaced; or • With the concurrence of the Commissioner, its standard value. Summary of discussion document The attached document discusses each of the four valuation options. Market price, replacement price, and standard values are straightforward and are discussed briefly. The document focuses on the cost price valuation option and contains a proposed method for valuing ostriches and emus on hand at the end of the income year. The process of arriving at a cost price for ostriches and emus is similar to the self-assessed cost method used by farmers of specified livestock, e.g. sheep, cattle, and deer. However, modifications are made to this method because of the unique nature of farming birds. The system is designed to use figures that farmers or their accountants would normally arrive at in the preparation of farm accounts. Some additional work will be required in the initial stages to determine the apportionment of some costs between ostrich, emu, and other enterprises on the property. Once these figures have been established they will probably remain constant from year to year, unless there are shifts in the overall mix of activities on the farm. We suggest that for an overview of the method, readers should turn to the summary on page 5 and compare this with the example on page 8 which shows how the cost price is established in practice. The information and draft method contained in this report were prepared in consultation with John King, Senior Analyst (Primary Sector), MAF Policy, Rural Resources Unit, MAF. INVENTORY VALUATION OPTIONS AND METHODS FOR OSTRICHES AND EMUS 1.0 Ostrich industry The ostrich industry has emerged as a commercial industry in the 1994–1996 period in New Zealand. Breeding stock have been imported at high cost, and farms have been set up in a number of locations including Waikato, Hawke's Bay and Canterbury. The imported costs of mature birds have exceeded $60,000 per head, with lower costs for immature birds and fertilised eggs. The NZ Ostrich Association estimated that at 31 March 1996 there were 2,700 live birds in the country. The breeding life of birds (bred in pairs or trios which include one male) ranges up to forty years. They breed prolifically, with an annual potential of 60 or more live chicks reared from artificially incubated eggs. These 1 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. factors suggest that industry expansion in terms of bird numbers is likely to be very rapid (compared with the deer industry for example). 2.0 Emu industry The emu industry is also an emerging commercial industry in New Zealand, having commenced about two years earlier than ostrich enterprises. It started on a much smaller scale and at lower cost than ostriches. Emus have long breeding lives (20 years plus), and also require a high ratio of male to female birds (40%– 60%). Eggs are artificially incubated, and annual live chick production ranges up to 20 per year. While being an overall lower valued industry (in terms of current bird and product values), the emu and ostrich industries are sufficiently similar to be grouped together for the purpose of valuing the birds at the end of the income year. 3.0 Valuation options Ostriches and emus are livestock and come within the definition of "non-specified livestock" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the Act"). Section EL 9(1) of the Act provides that the value of any non- specified livestock to be taken into account at the end of the income year, shall be at the option of the taxpayer:   • Its cost price; or   • Its market price; or   • The price at which it can be replaced; or   • With the concurrence of the Commissioner, its standard value. 3.1 Standard value The Commissioner has not approved a standard value for ostriches or emus. In recognition of the emerging nature of these industries, and the probable reduction in values over the medium term (4–5 years), it is unwise to approve a standard value at this stage because this value would need to be constantly changed. 3.2 Market value and replacement price The valuation options of market value and replacement price are sufficiently similar in nature to be discussed together. It appears that either option will be suitable for ostrich and emu valuation, and is likely to be the preferred option for those purchasing high valued breeding stock which are likely to reduce in value over time (as a result of both bird ageing and industry expansion). As values decrease over time, the use of the market value or replacement price option will allow the decreasing value of birds on hand to be treated as a tax deduction. Off-farm investors are one specific group of potential bird owners who are likely to adopt the market value option for breeding birds. 3.3 Cost (of production) The cost (of production) option is an alternative which is likely to be preferred by those breeding their own young birds for either breeder replacement or sale purposes, and for those in the business of purchasing immature stock for growing on to maturity. In both instances, the cost of breeding and rearing, or cost of purchase is likely to be lower than the market value of those growing birds at the end of an income year (at least in the foreseeable future). The use of the cost option will usually overcome the problem of taxing unearned income if valuation was based on market values at the end of an income year for homebred birds. 4.0 Inventory groupings Birds generally reach physical maturity (and slaughter age) by the end of their second year. Therefore, it is proposed that there be two main inventory groupings for birds on hand at balance date in any financial year (similar to that for most specified livestock). 2 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. In addition, a separate inventory group will be required for fertilised eggs which were purchased or imported and are on hand at balance date. 4.1 Departure from inventory groupings The high valued nature of these industries in the short term is causing virtually all birds (particularly breeding stock) to be individually numbered and catalogued. Under such circumstances, the individual cost or market value of each bird can be easily recorded and is likely to be recorded for insurance and stud purposes. This would create an inventory group separate from the normal mainstream inventory grouping of (usually homebred) birds valued under the FIFO (first in first out) or Average Inventory System (which also applies to specified livestock). It is suggested that all birds in any inventory age grouping should be valued using the same valuation option. Therefore, birds can only be valued at specific cost if the rest of the birds in that inventory (age) grouping are also valued at cost. It is noted that because of the longevity of the birds (particularly ostriches), the rate of replacement will be very low on farms with stable breeding numbers (maybe less then 5% p.a.). Therefore, the change in the two year and over mature inventory group will be small on a year to year basis and owners may wish to individually record the cost/value of all breeding birds separately in preference to FIFO or average inventory systems. 5.0 End of year valuation of eggs A unique factor of these industries is that there are going to be artificially incubated eggs on hand at the end of an income year. The problem arises as to how these eggs should be valued. The specified livestock valuation regime does not separately value a foetus, except in as much as the value of Herd Scheme livestock struck on 30 April each year reflects the state of pregnancy and hence value of livestock with foetus at that date. "Trading stock" is defined in section OB 1 as including "anything produced or manufactured". We suggest that eggs are "anything produced" and therefore are trading stock. The question arises as to how eggs should be valued for tax and accounting purposes. Section EE 1(3) provides that the value of the trading stock of any taxpayer to be taken into account at the end of any income year shall be, at the option of the taxpayer its cost price, its market price or the price at which it can be replaced. There is some doubt about how eggs should be valued and whether eggs bred by the owner have a cost price (given that the costs of incubation will not be accrued against the end of year value of the egg, but instead will accrue to the live chicks reared in that year). However, where an egg is purchased or imported, the purchase price or costs of importation (which the taxpayer will have claimed a deduction for) represent the cost of the egg. To accurately measure a taxpayer's assessable income the expenditure incurred on purchasing or importing the egg must be matched against the income arising from that expenditure, i.e. the egg. The value of the egg will simply offset the deduction received for the purchase or importation of the egg. Therefore, as a practical solution it is suggested that fertilised eggs be valued as follows: 3 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered.   • Eggs bred by the owner and on hand at balance date should be valued using either cost, market price, or replacement price. The Commissioner suggests that where eggs are bred by the owner the "cost price" of the eggs is nil.   • Eggs purchased or imported which have not hatched at balance date should be valued under either cost, market value, or replacement price. Purchased or imported eggs will be valued per egg on hand (at the discretion of the taxpayer) at either the average cost of eggs purchased in the six weeks prior to balance date (the normal egg incubation period for an ostrich or emu), or at market value or replacement cost. If the cost option is used, the costs of incubation will not be accrued against the end of year value of the egg. Instead they will accrue to the live chicks reared in that year. 6.0 Suggested guidelines for using cost (of production as a valuation option This section outlines a proposed method for a (self-assessed) cost valuation for ostriches and emus on hand at the end of an income year. The system is based on the self-assessed cost method for specified livestock detailed in the Appendix to Inland Revenue's Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Four, No. 7, (March 1993). Certain departures from this method occur due to the unique nature of farming birds, and these are fully documented in the appropriate sections. The cost of production option discussed in this paper covers both ostriches and emus. Where both types of bird are farmed on the same property, the two types should be treated as separate enterprises and the costs allocated between them on the best possible (fair and reasonable) basis. The process of costing described in the following pages should not pose any problems where there are two types of birds being farmed. 6.1 Summary of cost of production guidelines This subsection provides a summary of the proposed self-assessed cost system for valuing ostriches and emus. The summary is followed by an example showing the calculation of the cost of production for an ostrich enterprise. It is emphasised that these are guidelines only. Taxpayers can deviate from the guidelines if they have sufficient detail/data to improve the costing estimates. All costs involved are GST exclusive. Note that each step is discussed in more detail at pages 16 to 24. Steps one to three identify the direct costs relating to the production of ostriches and emus ("bird enterprise costs" or "BEC"). Bird enterprise costs which relate specifically to the rising one year inventory group are assigned to that group. Bird enterprise costs which relate specifically to the rising two year and older inventory group are assigned to that group. Step one: List all deductible costs incurred in the running of the farm. Step two: Identify the direct costs relating to the ostriches and emus (the bird enterprise costs) including purchase costs of birds and eggs which have hatched at balance date. Step three: Assign the bird enterprise costs (in step two) to the rising one or rising two year inventory groups. Step four identifies the bird enterprise costs which have not been assigned to the rising one or rising two year inventory group, or to any other farm enterprise ("the remaining bird enterprise costs"). Steps five, six, and seven apportion the remaining bird enterprise costs between the bird enterprise and any other farm enterprise being carried on and between the rising one and rising two year inventory groups. Step four: Identify the bird enterprise costs which have not been assigned to the rising one or rising two year inventory groups or to any other farm enterprise. Step five: Calculate the total area used in producing ostriches and emus, and convert this to a proportion of the total farm holding. Step six: Apportion the remaining bird enterprise costs based on the proportional area calculation in step five above or any other fair and reasonable basis, including invoice documentation, a payment recording system, or best estimate. 4 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. Step seven: Apportion the remaining bird enterprise costs from step six between the rising one year, and rising two year and older groupings on the basis of the area used by each inventory group as follows:   • To the rising one year group, the percentage of the total ostrich or emu area used by the breeding stock, their offspring, and purchased birds which would be valued as rising one year of age if they were still on hand at the end of the income year.   • To the rising two year and older group, the percentage of the total ostrich or emu area used by the birds which were classified as rising one year stock, together with all birds which were purchased and which would be valued as rising two years or older if they were still on hand at the end of the income year. Steps eight and nine describe how to use the costs calculated above to value the ostriches and emus at the end of the income year. Step eight: Calculate the average cost per head. The average cost per head is calculated by dividing the remaining bird enterprise costs plus costs of bird (and egg) purchases allocated to each inventory grouping (plus the opening inventory value in the case of rising two year and older group) by the total number of birds in each grouping passing through the enterprise in that year calculated as:   • For the rising one year group, the closing number of birds on hand in that group plus all sales of birds which would have been valued as rising one year of age if still on hand at the end of the income year, plus 5% of the number of fertilised eggs sold during the income year. (Note: A small proportion of overall costs must be assigned to eggs which have been laid and sold during the income year. The figure of 5% is simply an estimate to reflect the costs of these eggs.)   • For the rising two year and older group, the number of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the preceding income year plus all purchases of birds which would be valued in the rising two year and older class if still on hand at the end of an income year. Step nine: The average costs will be applied to the new intake of birds, in each inventory grouping, which are on hand at the end of the income year. The average costs of all eggs purchased or imported during the income year will be applied to those eggs which have not hatched at balance date. Step ten discusses the use of an inventory system for the rising two year and older group. Step ten: For the rising two year and older grouping, an inventory system for multi-aged bird groups will be required unless individual recording and tracing is undertaken. This may be accomplished using the FIFO or Average Cost Inventory System currently used for specified livestock. Example of ostrich costing Calculation of average cost This example sets out how to calculate the cost of production for an ostrich enterprise. This analysis is for example purposes only, and does not reflect the financial viability of the current or future ostrich industry, or the actual valuation at cost of birds in any real enterprise. Table one provides the necessary physical information about the farm. It considers a small farm of 60 hectares, of which only 9 hectares are used for ostrich farming. The ostrich enterprise is increasing numbers over the year as well as selling both young and older stock. Eggs are also purchased and sold. Table two calculates the bird enterprise costs (other than bird and egg purchases) for each inventory grouping. The costs incurred in running the farm are identified. The bird enterprise costs are identified and assigned to the bird inventory groups and other farm enterprises. The remaining bird enterprise costs are shared on either an area related basis or a fair and reasonable estimate. 5 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. In this example, the allocation between the bird enterprise and the rest of the farm is mainly made on an area basis (of 15% or 0.15 allocated to the birds), but a fair and reasonable basis has been used in the case of the ‘Animal Health General’ category. (However, we note that taxpayers may be able to identify actual costs.) Table three summarises the calculation of average costs per head. The average cost per head for the rising one year group is $3,504. The average cost per head for the rising two year and older group is $19,317. In the case of the rising two and older group, the large difference in value (from the rising one year olds) occurs because of the much higher opening value of rising one year olds ($12,000 per head), and the purchase of rising two year and older birds at an average cost of $40,000 per head. The inventory systems applying to birds on hand of the income year are discussed on pages 600,511 to 600,513. Table one — ostrich and emu cost of production model for income tax purposes Farming policy Part of a larger farm breeding own replacements, selling some chicks at 4 months, and rearing the rest for sale at 18 months or breeding number increases. This operation is in its second year after initial purchase of the birds.

Table three — calculation of average cost per head for a year's intake of ostriches Rising one year average cost per head (Closing number of rising one year birds on hand + birds purchased which would be in the rising one year group if on hand at the end of this income year + 5% of fertilised eggs sold.) Thus: average cost of rising one year birds Rising two year and older average cost per head 8 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. (Opening number of rising one year birds on hand + birds purchased which would be in the rising two year group if on hand at the end of this income year.) Thus: average cost of rising two year & older birds Any purchased or imported eggs on hand will be valued at the average purchase costs of eggs during the six weeks prior to balance date. End of year inventory valuation (all relevant data in table one) The end of year valuation of birds on hand will use the average costs calculated for each year. In the case of rising one year birds the inventory value would change as follows: This results in a reduction (tax deductible) of the value of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the income year of approximately $220,000, despite an increase in numbers of 33%. This arises as a result of much lower homebreeding costs compared to initial purchase costs in the previous year. The rising two year and older valuation also changes significantly. On the basis that four of the breeding ostriches are sold, and an increase in total numbers over the year from 16 to 22 occurs, the following inventory adjustments could occur:   (a)Individual tracing On the basis that the four birds sold were all hens, their sale would reduce the book value by $240,000, and their replacement and increase (numbering ten) which were purchased at $40,000 per head would increase the value of birds on hand by $400,000. In summary form: 9 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered.   (b)FIFO inventory Using an FIFO inventory system, the outgoing birds would be valued at their average opening value of $55,000. The intake for the year (ten in number) would come in at their average cost for the year of $19,317. In summary: Under the FIFO system, the sale of mature birds in subsequent years would continue to reduce book values by the average $55,000 per head until all original 16 birds are disposed of. The next sales would be accounted for at $19,317 until they are also disposed of, after which the next oldest cost would apply.   (c)Average inventory system Using an average inventory system, the four sold would go out of the books at last year's average value (cost) of $55,000. The incoming ten would enter at their average value for the year ($19,317), and a new average for the 22 birds of rising two years and older ($38,780 per head). In the following income year, mature birds disposed of would exit the accounts at the average value of $38,780, and a new average per head calculated for the end of the year. The average inventory system is summarised below: It is noted that this change in book value is the same as under the FIFO system. However, in subsequent income years it will not be, as the FIFO system will reduce book value at the rate of $55,000 per bird sold (until all of the original 16 are disposed of), and the average inventory system will reduce next year's breeding bird sales by the average opening cost of $38,780 (and probably lower average values in subsequent income years).   (d)Choice of inventory system As seen, the choice of inventory system may have significant income tax implications. The inventory system can be changed without notice, but it is essential, if the ‘cost of production’ 10 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. valuation option is to be adopted, that advice is taken at the outset of developing an ostrich or emu enterprise. 7.0 Detailed guidelines for using cost (of production) as a valuation option 7.1 Bird enterprise costs and specific assignment 7.1.1 Bird enterprise costs Step one: List all deductible costs incurred in the running of the farm. Step two: Identify the direct costs relating to the ostriches and emus (the bird enterprise costs), including purchase costs of birds and eggs which have hatched at balance date. Defining the costs to be included in the costing of birds on hand at the end of an income year is important. Taxpayers can include all deductible costs incurred at their discretion, but may exclude certain categories of cost which relate to the running of the business or enterprises other than (in this case) the production of ostriches or emus. Bird enterprise costs calculated by excluding the expenses below can be classified as direct production costs, since they do not include the overhead costs of operating a farm business. This net cost represents the minimum costs which must be accounted for in determining the cost of production of ostriches or emus. The following costs may be excluded from the total deductible farm costs in any income year to determine the bird enterprise costs relating to the ostriches and emus:   • All direct costs relating to any enterprise other than ostrich and emu production where these costs can be identified (or estimates made on a fair and reasonable basis).   • All costs of harvesting any products in any way, e.g. feathers from ostriches as these are not associated with producing and growing immature birds.   • Repairs, maintenance, and depreciation of all farm buildings except those specifically used by the ostrich or emu enterprises (which would include ostrich and emu related paddock sheds, quarantine facilities, and hatcheries).   • Repairs, maintenance, and depreciation on plant and equipment used in producing secondary (dual) livestock products or non-livestock enterprises, e.g. cropping.   • All outward freight from the farm, and all inward freight of livestock other than ostriches or emus, or inward freight relating to non-livestock enterprises.   • Deductible share of car expenses.   • Accounting and legal fees, consultancy fees, rates, and general farm (non-livestock) insurance.   • Interest, rent, and bailment fees. Note that the cost of leasing livestock, including ostriches and emus, but not the bailment of livestock, is included in bird enterprise costs.   • All livestock purchase costs including ostriches and emus and eggs are treated separately within the cost of production formulae.   • Imputed costs of labour or livestock depreciation (the latter being specifically disallowed as a cost for ostriches and emus).   • The livestock owner may apportion the cost of wages, salary, or management fees paid (which are tax deductible) over all enterprises/activities in the farming operation on a fair and reasonable basis. This applies regardless of whether the payment was made to an individual, a partner, a shareholder-employee, or anyone else. These expenses could be apportioned on the following activities:   — Activities excluded from bird enterprise costs, such as accounting and administration.   — Other farm enterprises, such as forestry and cropping.   — Specified livestock production.   — Non-specified livestock production, e.g. ostriches or emus. In some instances payment for services may be made at the outset of a contract for a period spanning more than one year, e.g. a three-year management contract to manage birds for an investor. In such cases the cost must be annualised for the purposes of calculating the cost of production for end of year valuation purposes. 11 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. 7.1.2 Specific assignment of bird enterprise costs Step three: Assign the bird enterprise costs (in step two) to the rising one year or rising two year inventory groups. Under step two the total deductible farm costs have been reduced by the allowable exclusions in order to determine the bird enterprise costs relating to the ostriches and emus. The next step in the costing process is to assign those costs which specifically relate to a bird type or inventory age grouping. Specific cost allocations between age groups are suggested below. Allocations on the basis of a fair and reasonable estimate will be allowed.   (a) Rising one year grouping:   • Repairs and maintenance and depreciation on paddock buildings, incubators and hatcheries, and any other buildings or plant and equipment specifically used in the production of rising one year birds.   • Specific costs of incubation and early rearing facilities (or contracts to outside organisations for these activities).   • Inward freight of eggs and live birds which would be valued (if on hand) at the end of the income year in the rising one year grouping.   • All identifiable costs associated with breeding birds including vet and bird health, and all feedstuffs (including freight) other than that fed to non-breeding rising two year olds and older.   • Fencing associated with breeding areas.   (b) Rising two year and older grouping:   • Inward freight of live birds classified in this group.   • Any direct costs including feedstuffs (plus freight), and vet and animal health costs identifiable as being incurred by this group or which are the residual of total costs after allocation to the rising one year bird group — not including elements of costs which belong to other enterprises on the farm.   • Bird fencing not associated with (a) above. 7.2 Allocation of remaining bird enterprise costs between enterprises So far we have: Total farm tax deductible costs — minus Exclusions from costs = bird enterprise costs (paragraph 7.1.1) — minus Costs specifically assigned (paragraph 7.1.2) — equals Remaining bird enterprise costs. Step four: Identify the bird enterprise costs not yet assigned to the rising one or rising two year inventory groups or to any other farm enterprise. The remaining bird enterprise costs are now to be divided between the bird enterprises and other enterprises on the farm, e.g. sheep and cattle. The remaining bird enterprise costs will be allocated between enterprises on either a fair and reasonable basis and/or an area related basis. The area related approach assumes that the remaining bird enterprise costs are averaged over the total farm area. In respect of the allocation between enterprises, only certain cost categories will be involved. Such costs will include non-specific animal health, fertiliser, wages paid, and repairs and maintenance of a general nature, e.g. fences and water supply, which are shared with other livestock enterprises. Step five: Calculate the total area involved in producing ostriches and emus, and convert this to a proportion of the total farm holding. 12 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. Step six: Apportion the remaining bird enterprise costs based on the proportional area calculation in step five above or on any other fair and reasonable basis including invoice documentation, a payment recording system, or best estimate. Where   BEC = remaining BEC.   a = the area of the bird enterprise.   d = total farm area. This calculation determines the share of remaining bird enterprise costs which should be allocated to the bird enterprise. 7.3 Allocation of remaining bird enterprise costs between inventory groupings Step seven: Apportion the remaining bird enterprise costs from step six between the rising one year, and rising two year and older groupings. The remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the bird enterprise are then shared between the inventory age groupings, also on an area basis which reflects the grazing demand of the age groupings and breeding stock. The bird related remaining bird enterprise costs will usually be allocated on an area related basis as follows:   (a) Allocation to the rising one year group: Where   BEC = remaining bird enterprise costs relating to the bird enterprise.   b = the ostrich or emu area used by the breeding stock, their offspring, and purchased birds which would be valued as rising one year of age if they were still on hand at the end of the income year.   a = the area of the bird enterprise.   (b) Allocation to the rising two year and older group: Where   BEC = remaining bird enterprise costs relating to the bird enterprise.   c = the ostrich or emu area used by the birds which were classified as rising one year stock at the end of the preceding income year, together with all birds which were purchased and which would be valued as rising two years or older if they were still on hand at the end of the income year.   a = the area of the bird enterprise. Note that where ostriches and emus are being run on the same farm, this calculation would be based on four inventory groupings, two inventories for each bird type. 7.4 Dual product multipliers 13 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. Dual product multipliers are used in preparing costs of production for specified livestock. These multipliers remove a portion of the bird enterprise costs allocated to a livestock group to account for the cost of producing secondary or dual products. For example, the dual product multiplier for sheep is 0.8, thus removing 20% of the costs associated with wool production rather than growing livestock. It is not proposed to include a dual product multiplier for ostriches or emus. The dual product is feathers which generally are harvested at slaughter. Even if harvested on an annual basis from the breeding stock, the weight of feathers is small compared with the weight of growing multiple offspring, and the costs of humane plucking is likely to outweigh the value of the feathers (at 1996 prices). 7.5 Average cost per head calculation Step eight: Calculate the average cost per head. Using the data calculated in subsections 7.1 to 7.4, the final step is to calculate the average cost per head of the rising one and two year groupings for the income year. The average cost per head is calculated by dividing the bird enterprise costs plus costs of bird (and egg) purchases allocated to each inventory grouping (plus the opening inventory value in the case of rising two year and older group) by the total number of birds in each grouping passing through the enterprise in that year. A separate calculation is made for each age grouping.   (a)Rising one year age group Average cost is calculated by dividing all costs including purchase cost allocated to this group by the number of rising one year stock which passed through the enterprise during the year, plus an allowance for eggs sold to which a portion of the cost of production is assigned. This is represented by the following formula: Where   BEC = the share of the remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the rising one year group as calculated in paragraph 7.3.   f = specific costs allocated to this group (paragraph 7.1.2).   g = the total purchase costs of birds purchased where the birds would be valued in the rising one year group if still on hand at the end of the income year.   w = total closing cost of fertilised eggs on hand (if any) at the end of the preceding income year.   y = total cost of eggs purchased during the year which have hatched by the end of the income year.   h = the closing number of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the income year.   j = the total number of birds purchased which would be valued in the rising one year group if still on hand at the end of the income year.   k = 5% of the number of fertilised eggs sold during income year.   (b)Rising two years and older group This average cost increases the average valuation of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the previous income year by the average costs allocated to the rising two year and older age 14 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. grouping (including purchase costs) during the income year. This is achieved through the following formula: Where   BEC = the share of the remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the rising one year group as calculated in paragraph 7.3.   m = total closing value (cost) of the rising one year birds on hand at the end of the preceding income year.   n = specific costs allocated to this group (paragraph 7.1.2).   o = the total purchase costs of birds purchased which would be valued in the rising two year and older group if still on hand at the end of the income year.   p = the closing number of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the preceding income year.   q = the total number of birds purchased which would be valued in the rising two year and older group if still on hand at the end of the income year. The average cost for each inventory group so calculated is applied to the new intake of birds on hand at the end of the income year. If all birds in either inventory group are purchased during the year, i.e. none homebred or on hand as rising one year birds at opening, these are simply valued at their average purchase cost with no requirement to make the calculations as above. This will usually only occur in the start-up year. 7.6 Application of average cost per head to end of year numbers on hand Step nine: The average costs will be applied to the new intake of birds, in each inventory grouping, on hand at the end of the income year. The average cost per head for the rising one year group is simply applied to all rising one year birds on hand at the end of the income year. Any change between the opening and closing valuation in the income year is assessable for income tax purposes. Step ten: For the rising two year and older grouping, an inventory system for multi-aged bird groups will be required, unless individual recording and tracing is undertaken. This may be accomplished using the FIFO or Average Cost Inventory System currently used for specified livestock. For the rising two year and older group, the allocation of average cost is a little more difficult. This is because this group will contain birds of various ages, possibly over a range from 2 to 30 years. Each will have an associated historical cost relating to the year in which it reached maturity. If individual bird recording is practised, then no complexities will arise. New birds will enter with current year average cost, and any deaths or sales of older birds will have a deduction from the total book value of birds on hand at their historical cost. Any net change between the opening and closing values for the income year will be assessable for income tax purposes. If individual bird recording is not practised for the mature group, an inventory system of some description will be needed. The FIFO system is the most likely to be used as it will allow a faster phasing out (larger deduction) for the very high cost birds originally purchased as these are progressively replaced by lower costing stock (either at purchase or homebred as the industry expands). The Average Cost Inventory System is an alternative system, and is the method most commonly used for specified livestock enterprises. This method allows sales and deaths to reduce book values at last year's average cost, and the new intake of birds, e.g. replacements, to be brought in at this year's calculated cost 15 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. per head. A new average over all the closing birds on hand is then calculated for the year. Details of this system, together with examples are contained in the Appendix to Inland Revenue's Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Four, No 7, (March 1993) for specified livestock. Under either of these inventory systems, any difference in the total opening and closing values for the income year is assessable for income tax purposes. 8.0 Other issues 8.1 Movement between options As industry and individual bird farming situations change, it is likely that some movement between valuation options will occur, e.g. an initial purchaser of breeding stock who progressively breeds replacement stock and moves from market values to cost for the end of year inventory valuation. The rules for movement between options should generally be those applying to other industries, i.e. free movement between the cost scheme to the market value or replacement price schemes. Either of the (complete) inventory groupings can be valued at market value or replacement price without notice to Inland Revenue if this involves a change from the cost option of valuation used in the previous year. When a change to the cost option occurs, the values of birds on hand at the end of the preceding year will be deemed to be cost for the purposes of calculating current income year average costs per head. 8.2 High priced scheme The valuation of specified livestock includes a high priced scheme which incorporates a straight-line depreciation rate over the expected breeding life of the animal. "High-priced livestock" is defined in section OB 1 of the Act. As non-specified livestock is not high-priced livestock, ostriches and emus cannot be depreciated. The high-priced livestock scheme is not considered appropriate for the emerging ostrich and emu industries. Market value or replacement options will achieve the same result as a 40-year breeding life (probably more quickly), which would only yield a 2.5% depreciation rate annually and would require a (moving) end of productive life value to be determined. 9.0 Special departures Because of the unique nature of ostrich and emu farming, some departures from the strict cost regime detailed may be considered. These are listed below. 9.1 Fencing costs The cost of ostrich farm fencing is high. Birds are run in pairs or trios in separate paddocks of about 0.25 hectares. Fences are similar to deer fences, and represent a high cost at the time of farm set-up, or enterprise expansion. For example, a 10 hectare block subdivided for breeding (80 ostriches on a pair basis) would require more than 6 km of fence, excluding access ways. If all fencing costs are incurred in one income year, they will be loaded on to the cost of the ostriches produced in that income year. To avoid this it is suggested that the cost of fencing should be able to be spread over a number of years for the purposes of calculating the cost of ostriches on hand. 9.2 Entities which cannot use cost of production as an option Certain taxpayers are not allowed to use (self-assessed) cost as a valuation option for valuing specified livestock. These are:   • Owners of bailed stock (bailors).   • Owners of leased stock (lessors).   • Non-farming parties to a sharefarming agreement unless, as part of the sharefarming agreement, it is agreed that the cost option is calculated by the farm owner as if no sharefarming agreement existed. 16 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only. Taxation officers, taxpayers or practitioners may not rely on issues papers. Only finalised public statements represent Inland Revenue’s authoritative view on the issues covered. Such taxpayers are not allowed to use cost as a valuation method because they do not incur any costs, e.g. a bailor does not incur any costs, the costs are incurred by the bailee of the livestock. For the same reasons, we suggest that the above taxpayers should not be allowed to use cost to value ostriches and emus. In addition, in partnerships where partners own the individual birds put to the use of the partnership, partners must value their birds under an option common to the whole partnership, i.e. cost, or market value or replacement price, for all birds controlled by the partnership. 17 Issues papers produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the Inland Revenue’s initial views only.

is in subpart MX of the Act. The R &D loss tax credit is a refundable credit available to eligible companies that have a tax loss arising from their eligible research or development expenditure. 2.General information about the R&D loss tax credit is on the Inland Revenue website (r esearch and development loss tax credit) and in an article on the introduction of t he regime (Tax Information Bulletin V ol 28, No 3 (April 2016):19). 3.This interpretation statement is intended to be read alongside the general information and addresses areas of uncertainty. Background 4.The R&D loss tax credit was introduced from the 2016 income year to encourage bus iness innovation. C ompanies engaged in intensive R&D tend to have high up-fron t c osts and losses in their early yea rs. 5.The aim of the R&D loss tax credit is to assist the cashflow of companies involved in i ntensive R&D by allowing an eligible company to cash-out its tax losses in a relevant year. This means the company can receive a payment instead of carrying forward the tax loss to use against income derived in a later year. 6.Only companies are eligible to claim the R&D loss tax credit. This is because losses i ncurred by partnerships, limited partnerships, look-through companies and sol e t raders pass through to the underlying owners, which can often be offset against their other income. 7.The R&D loss tax credit operates on an annual basis. A company chooses whether to apply for the particular year if requirements are met. This means a company can apply in some years and not others. Strict filing timeframes apply. 8.Once a company has claimed an R&D loss tax credit it has additional obligations. The R &D loss tax credit was designed to operate like an interest-free loan, which means t he a mount of the tax credit will usually be required to be repaid. It is generally treated as repaid by the company paying tax on income it derives in later years once t he c ompany is in profit. H owever, the company may be required to repay the tax credi t earl ier if an early repayment event occurs. There are also implications for the c ompany’s loss balances and imputation credit accounts. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 5 of 43 Relationship with the research and development tax incentive 9.The R&D loss tax credit is different from the research and development tax incentive ( RDTI) that was introduced from the 2020 tax year. 10.The loss tax credit and the tax incentive are two different regimes with different criteria that must be satisfied. Companies may be eligible for one regime or both. 11.This interpretation statement does not consider the application of the RDTI. However, information about the RDTI can be found on the Inland Revenue website (Researc h and development tax incentive) and on the Callahan Innovation RDTI hub. About this statement 12.Part One of this statement considers when a company will be eligible to claim an R&D loss tax credit (the eligibility criteria). This includes considering the type of company that is eligible, the expenses that are relevant for particular calculations, and the qualifying types of R&D activity. 13.Areas of uncertainty that have arisen with applying the eligibility criteria include: what “ research” and “development” means for the R&D loss tax credit (from \[22\]) how the eligibility criteria apply to R&D groups (from \[ 42\]) what is included in the wage intensity calculation (from \[56\]) and what qualifies as R&D expenditure (from \[85\]) . 14.Part Two of this statement considers a company’s obligations once it is eligible to receive the R&D loss tax credit, including: extinguishing losses and carrying forward excess losses (from \[131\]) when an early repayment of the credit is required (from \[138\]) imputation credits (from \[160\]) ; and record keeping requirements (from \[165\]). IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 6 of 43 Part One: Eligibility for the R&D loss tax credit 15.This part first summarises the eligibility criteria that must be met in each income year that the R&D loss tax credit is claimed. It then discusses particular areas of uncertainty. Summary of eligibility criteria 16.A company chooses whether to apply for an R&D loss tax credit in an income year. The c ompany must: be New Zealand resident (s MX 2(a) and (b)); not be a: ocompany established under or subject to the Education and Training Ac t 20 20, Pae Ora (Healthy Futures) Act 2022 or Crown Entities Act 2004 (s MX 2(c)); ocompany where 50% or more of its shares are owned by a public authority, a local authority, a Crown Research Institute or a State enterprise (s MX 2(d)); or olisted company or listed on a recognised exchange (s MX 2(e)); have a net loss in the relevant tax year (s MX 1(1)(c)) ; 1 satisfy the wage intensity calculation (s s MX 1(1)(f) and MX 3); incur R&D expenditure in the income year (s MX 1(1)(e)); and own, solely or jointly, the intellectual property and know-how resulting from t he R &D (s MX 1(1)(g)). 17.Where the company is part of an R&D group, additional rules need to be met. The combined R&D group must have a net loss for the tax year and satisfy the wage intensity calculation. 18.Some of the above eligibility criteria have given rise to uncertainty. The areas of unc ertainty are: whether requirements must be satisfied for a full income year; the meaning of research and development for the R&D loss tax credit; when an R&D group exists and the consequences of grouping; what is included in the wage intensity calculation (including where there is a n R &D group); 1 That is, its annual total deductions are greater than its annual total income. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 7 of 43 requirements for R&D expenditure; and whether the results of the R&D (that is, the intellectual property and know-how) vest in the company. 19.These issues are addressed in the following paragraphs. Criteria must be satisfied for the full income year 20.A company must meet the eligibility criteria for an income year (s MX 1). This requirement means: If a company is incorporated during an income year, it must meet the criteria for the part of the year that it exists (s MX 2). If a company that exists for a full income year is eligible for part of that income year only, it has not met the criteria for the income year and cannot claim t he R &D loss tax credit for that income year. If a company has a non-standard balance date it must meet the criteria for its income year (for example, from 1 July to 30 June). 2 21.Example | Tauira 1 demonstrates a company that is not eligible to claim an R&D loss tax credit because it does not meet the requirements for the full income year. Example | Tauira 1: Not eligible for full income year A company with a standard balance date meets the eligibility requirements under ss MX 1 and MX 2 on 1 April 2022 (the beginning of its 2023 income year). However, it lists on the NZX during that year. This means the company no longer satisfies the requirements of s MX 2(e). As the company does not meet the eligibility requirements for the full income year, it cannot claim an R&D loss tax credit for the 2023 income year. Meaning of “research” and “development” 22.Central to the R&D loss tax credit are the concepts of “research” and “development”. For instance, the R&D loss tax credit is available to eligible companies who: incur expenditure on certain research or development activities (R&D expenditure); and 2 A non-standard balance date is a balance date other than 31 March. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 8 of 43 satisfy the wage intensity calculation, which is based on an employee’s involvement in research or development (R&D material). 23.The R&D loss tax credit rules adopt the definitions of “research” and “development” in Ne w Zealand equivalent to international accounting standard 38 intangible assets (NZ IAS 38). Although the R&D loss tax credit rules adopt these definitions, a company does not need to report under the New Zealand equivalent to international financial reporting standard (NZ IFRS) or have adopted NZ IAS 38 to be eligible to claim an R&D loss tax credit. However, whether a company applies NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting purposes may impact its ability to deduct expenditure on researc h a nd development and therefore the amount of any net loss and ability to include t he expenditure as R&D expenditure (the meaning of R&D expenditure is discussed from \[86\]). 24.These definitions of research and development are not the same as the meaning of “research and development activity” used for the RDTI. The relevant definitions for t he R DTI are in s LY 2 and are relevant to that regime only. Research 25.“Research” is defined in NZ IAS 38 at \[8\] as: original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. 26.While only the definition is relevant for these purposes, NZ IAS 38 lists examples of research activities at \[56\] as: 3 activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge; the search for, evaluation of and final selection of, applications of research f indings or other knowledge; the search for alternatives for materials, devices, products, processes, system s o r services; and the formulation, design, evaluation and final selection of possible alternatives for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems o r s ervices. 27.The definition of research (and listed examples) focuses on original investigation and activities that contribute knowledge and understanding. 3 F or completeness, this is subject to the discussion at \[28\] and \[29\] that the research work must be original. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 9 of 43 28.The work must be original. This term is relevantly defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online edition) a s: 1.a. That is the origin or source of something; from which something springs, proceeds, o r is derived; primary. 2.a. Belonging to the beginning or earliest stage of something; existing at or from the first; earliest, first in time. 5.a. Created, composed, or done by a person directly; produced first-hand; not imitated or copied from another. 6.a. Having the quality of that which proceeds directly from oneself; such as has not been done or produced before; novel or fresh in character or style. 29.The ordinary meaning of “original” refers to something being created and novel, not imitated or copied. This meaning suggests there must be a level of innovation or creativity. Development 30.D evelopment is defined in NZ IAS 38 at \[8\] a s: the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use. 31.While only the definition is relevant for these purposes, NZ IAS 38 lists examples of development activities at \[59\] as the: design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models; design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology; design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scal e e conomically feasible for commercial production; and design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services. 32.The definition refers to the concept of applying research findings or other knowledge to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use. 33.The use of the phrase “or other knowledge” widens the scope of development to include activities other than research that produce something new or improved. That is, development includes activities drawing on existing knowledge gained from IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 10 of 43 research or experience. In addition, development does not consist of ordinary or routine activities based on well-established competence or understanding. Meaning of “substantially improved” 34.Development activities are those that produce something new or “substantially improved” for the relevant person rather than their business-as-usual activities. 35.The word “substantially” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online edition) as: substantially, adv. Fully, amply; to a great extent or degree; considerably, significantly, much. 36.Th is definition means the development or improvement must be considerable or significant. Whether the development activities are to create substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services always depends on t he p articular fact s. Be fore the start of commercial production 37.A question that arises is when a company will have started commercial production (such that an activity is no longer considered to be in development). This question is generally fact dependent and depends on the particular company and its relevant products, processes, systems and so on, that the development work relates to. Examples of when a company has reached the start of commercial production include: demonstrations of commercial viability, market research and promotion; tooling up for commercial production, planning the production process and commissioning new equipment; and developing quality control systems. 38.Guidance on the RTDI refers to R&D performed “in the course of” commercial p roduction, which is a different timing to “before the start of” commercial production. 4 H owever, that guidance refers to a commercial production environment as including R&D performed on a production line that is producing products for sale, and R&D performed as part of the process of designing, developing or building something where there is a contract in place for the result, or it is for sale. In situations where t he c ompany would have started commercial production, the activity will not qualify as being development activity for the purpose of the R&D loss tax credit. 4 Research and Development Tax Incentive: Guidance (IR 1240, April 2023) at 66. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 11 of 43 39.However, it is important to note that some activities that occur before the start of commercial production (so would be included as “development” activities) ar e i neligible under schedule 22. Schedule 22 proscribed activities 40.To keep the R&D loss tax credit targeted, certain activities listed in schedule 22 are not eligible as research or development expenditure for the R&D loss tax credit. Schedule 22 is relevant to both “R&D expenditure” and “R&D material” for the wag e i ntensity calculation. The types of activities listed in the schedule are those that take place in a post-development phase, are related to routine work, have an indeterminat e r elationship with economic growth, or are expected to take place when the company is less likely to be cashflow-constrained. 5 In summary, schedule 22 includes activities that a re: not performed in New Zealand; related to the acquisition or disposal of land, intangible property, intellectua l pr operty or core technology; related to certain industries (prospecting, exploring or drilling, or research i n s ocial sciences, arts and humanities); occurring outside core research and development work (for example, activities in the post-development phase or related to routine work) including: omarket research, testing and promotion; oquality control and routine testing; ocosmetic alterations; oroutine collection of information; ovarious legal, commercial, administrative or compliance activities; oreproducing a product or process from existing information; and opre-production activities. 41.Example | Tauira 2 demonstrates research and development activity that would not be el igible as either R&D expenditure or R&D material for the wage intensity calculation. Example | Tauira 2: Overseas activity not eligible for R&D loss tax credit A Co sends an employee to the United States to supervise the testing of an early prototype in a research facility. The test equipment in the research facility is 5 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 3 (April 2016): 19 at 20. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 12 of 43 state of the art, and far exceeds any equipment available to A Co in New Zealand. Although this activity is related to an R&D project being carried on in New Zealand, the activity (the testing of the early prototype) is being performed outside New Zealand. A Co determines that the expenditure it incurs on the activity outside of New Zealand comprises: the amount paid to the owner of the research facility in the United States a portion of the salary and wages paid to A Co’s employee (based on the time spent by them supervising the testing of the early prototype in the United States) the cost of sending the employee to the United States. These amounts cannot be included in the amount of R&D expenditure, and the salary components do not qualify as total R&D labour expenditure for the wage intensity calculation, because they relate to activities performed outside New Zealand. R&D groups 42.If a company is a member of an R&D group, this can affect its eligibility to claim an R&D loss tax credit and the amount of the credit. In particular, if there is an R&D group, the: wage intensity calculation must be satisfied for the R&D group; and R&D group must have a net loss. 43.Accordingly, it is important for a company to determine whether it is a member of an R&D group and who the other members of that group are. An R&D group is a group of companies 44.An R&D group is a concept that only applies for the purposes of the R&D loss tax credit. T he concept is broad and applies where a group of companies exists. A company does not elect to be in or out of the R&D group rules – if a company is in a g roup of companies, then it is a member of an R&D group. The R&D group also includes other entities such as a look through company and limited partnership that must satisfy the same common voting interest thresholds (treated as if it were a company for that purpose). IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 13 of 43 45.Section IC 3 defines a group of companies as two or more companies (none of which is a multi-rate portfolio investment entity or a listed portfolio investment entity) in relation to which a group of persons holds: common voting interests that add up to at least 66%; and if a market value circumstance exists for a company that is part of a group of companies, common market value interests that add up to at least 66%. 46.A person’s common voting interest in the relevant companies at a particular time is the per centage of their voting interests in each of the companies at the time. For further information about how to measure ownership interests see IS 22/07 Company losses – ownership continuity, sharing and measurement from 32. 47.For example, all the companies from Example | Tauira 3 below are part of a group of companies so are an R&D group (for the purposes of the R&D loss tax credit) e ven t hough only one company undertakes any R&D activities: 48.Where an entity applying for an R&D loss tax credit is part of an R&D group, its annual application for an R&D loss tax credit must indicate that it is a member of an R&D group. 49.For completeness, where a company is part of a consolidated tax group, the companies in such a group are treated as a single company for tax purposes (s FM 2) and would have a single net loss. 50.A consolidated tax group may be a member of an R&D group. Nothing in the R&D loss tax credit rules suggests a consolidated tax group cannot be eligible for the credit as long as it satisfies the criteria. However, foreign companies cannot be members of a consolidated tax group. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 14 of 43 Example | Tauira 3: R&D group has combined net loss R&D Co carries out R&D and is determining its eligibility for an R&D loss tax credit. R&D Co is a member of an R&D group that includes Profit Co, Loss Co and Hold Co. All entities are New Zealand resident. Because R&D Co is a member of an R&D group, the net loss requirement needs to be satisfied by both R&D Co and the combined R&D group. R&D Co has a net loss ($100,000). In the relevant income year, t he R&D group has a combined net loss of: ($100,000) + ($1,500,000) – $1,000,000 = ($600,000). This means R&D Co meets the net loss requirement. Non-resident members of R&D group 51.One issue that arises is whether a non-resident company can be a member of an R&D group, f or example, if in Example | Tauira 3 Hold Co was a foreign company. 52.A foreign company can be a member of an R&D group, but only a New Zealand resident company can claim an R&D loss tax credit. This means the foreign company must be included in the calculations for whether the R&D group has a net loss an d m eets the wage intensity calculation. 53.For the purpose of calculating a foreign company’s net income or net loss, that c ompany’s New Zealand tax obligations (if any) are what is relevant. Its overseas tax obligations are not included in the calculation of the R&D group’s net loss. This is because a net loss is a defined term. 54.A net loss arises where, in a tax year, a person’s annual total deduction is more than t heir annual total income (s BC 4(3)). A person’s annual total income reflects their “assessable income” which is the total amount of their income that is not (among other things) non-resident foreign-sourced income. Similarly, a deduction is allowed only where there is a nexus with assessable income. Accordingly, it is only the foreig n IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 15 of 43 company's New Zealand sourced income and deductions that are included as its net income or net loss under the Act. This means only its New Zealand net income or net loss is included in the R&D group’s calculation (and not its overseas income or loss amounts). 55.Therefore, if Hold Co in the above example was a foreign company, only its New Zealand net loss or net income would be included in the R&D group calculation. The wage intensity calculation 56.To claim an R&D loss tax credit, an eligible company must satisfy the wage intensity calculation. 57.This requires 20% of a company’s total labour expenditure to be on R&D labour (s MX 3)). This requirement ensures companies have a comparatively high level of expenditure on research or development. For companies that are part of an R&D group, the R&D group combined must also calculate their wage intensity. 58.The wage intensity calculation is only relevant for determining eligibility to claim the R&D loss tax credit. The required wage intensity is that at least 20% of t he c ompany’s total labour expenditure must be on R&D labour expenditure, based on t he f ollowing formula (s MX 3(2)): total R&D labour expenditure / total labour expenditure 59.The deductibility (or otherwise) of the labour expenditure is not relevant for the pur pose of this calculation. For example, where these amounts are for capital expenditure or are funded by a government grant, that expenditure is still included i n t his calculation. 60.Uncertainty exists about what is included in or excluded from this calculation and how it affects other calculations (such as R&D expenditure). These uncertainties ar e a ddressed in the following paragraphs. Meaning of total R&D labour expenditure 61.“Total R&D labour expenditure” is defined in s MX 3(3)(a). The focus of the definition is on amounts the company pays to certain persons for providing R&D material. 62.The amounts that must be included in total R&D labour expenditure are: salary and wages paid to employees for providing R&D material; amounts paid to shareholder employees for providing R&D material (t he c ompany cannot use a notional amount representing the market value of services that have been provided); and IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 16 of 43 the total amount of contractor R&D consideration multiplied by 0.66. 63.A company can also opt to include as total R&D labour expenditure for each employee w ho provides R&D material: the employer’s superannuation cash contributions for its employee (that are not salary and wages) and the employer’s tax on such contributions; an d fr inge benefits provided by the company and attributed to its employee and the employer’s fringe benefit tax liability on those fringe benefits. 64.The amount to be included is the same proportion of the employee’s salary and wages that is paid to the employee for providing R&D material. 65.A company might opt to include the amounts described above where a significant portion of the employee’s remuneration is made up of fringe benefits or superannuation contributions. Including these optional amounts might enable t he c ompany to meet the 20% wage intensity. 66.Importantly, if the optional amounts are included in the amount of total R&D labour expenditure then they must also be included in the amount of total labour expenditure. 67.For a detailed example of this calculation, including the optional amounts, see Tax Information Bulletin V ol 28, No 3 (April 2016):19 at 23. R&D material 68.To be included in total R&D labour expenditure the amount must be paid to the em ployee, shareholder employee or contractor for providing “R&D material”. 69.R&D material refers to goods or services provided to the person to the extent to which: the goods or services are provided as part of a service of research or d evelopment; the intellectual property and know-how resulting from the research or development vests in the person, solely or jointly; and the goods and services are not used by the person: ofor a proscribed activity listed in schedule 22; or oto provide a service of research or development or to further another person’s research or development activities. 70.If the company uses the goods or services for these qualifying activities as well as other activities, the amount paid to the employee, shareholder employee or contractor must be apportioned. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 17 of 43 71.In some cases, an e mployee, shareholder employee or contractor will provide services other than the provision of R&D material, f or example: an employee who carries on research or development on eligible activities, a s w ell as other activities that are proscribed by schedule 22; and a shareholder employee who spends a portion of their time undertaking research or development on eligible activities and the rest of their time carrying out the day-to-day tasks of running the business. 72.Where this occurs, the company must apportion the amounts paid to the employee, shareholder employee or contractor between amounts paid for providing “R&D material” and amounts paid for providing other goods or services. There are no rules for how an apportionment must be applied, although the apportionment method needs to be fair and reasonable and supported by documentation showing how it was reached. For example, the simplest way to work out an apportionment of a person’s time would involve the employee accounting for their time on each activity in som e w ay. However, other methods can be used provided the method is fair and reasonable. 73.Proscribed activity was discussed at \[40\], and whether the intellectual property an d k now-how vests in the company is discussed at \[ 114\]). Contractor R&D consideration 74.“Contractor R&D consideration” is the GST-exclusive amount a company pays to a contractor as consideration for providing R&D material to the company. The purpose o f including only 66% of the total contractor R&D consideration is to exclude the profit margin and non-wage cost components of the contract price on outsourced researc h o r development. 75.Contractor R&D consideration does not include an amount the company pays to a contractor who is, at the time: an employee of the company; a member of an R&D group (that the company is a member of); or an employee of a member of the R&D group that the company is a member of. 76.Issues can arise where, for part of the year, a contractor had been a member (or an em ployee of a member) of an R&D group that the company is also a member of. I n t his situation, an amount paid by a company to the contractor is excluded from being contractor R&D consideration if the company and the contractor were in an R&D group at the time the services to which the payment relates were provided. If t he company and contractor were not in the same R&D group at that time, the amount can still qualify as contractor R&D consideration. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 18 of 43 Meaning of total labour expenditure 77.“Total labour expenditure” is also defined (s MX 3(3)(b)), and means the total expenditure that the company incurred in the income year for: salary and wages paid to all employees; contractor R&D consideration (multiplied by 0.66); the amount paid to all shareholder employees; and the optional amount of expenditure for each employee (that is, for fring e benef its or employer superannuation contributions), if the company has chos en to include these amounts in its total R&D labour expenditure. 78.Example | Tauira 4 and Example | Tauira 5 e xplain how to apply the calculations. Example | Tauira 4: Simple wage intensity calculation B Co pays $200,000 in salary and wages to two full-time staff who are providing R&D material in an income year. B Co’s total labour expenditure (salary and wages and shareholder salaries) for all staff (including the two full-time staff providing R&D material) is $1,000,000 in that year. Wage intensity = total R&D labour expenditure / total labour expenditure $200,000 / $1,000,000 = 0.2 20% of B Co’s total labour expenditure is R&D labour expenditure, so B Co meets the wage intensity requirement. E xample | Tauira 5: Wage intensity calculation including certain expenditure In the 2023 income year C Co pays: $200,000 in salary and wages to two full-time staff for providing R&D material in relation to Project X ($100,000 of this is funded by a government grant); $100,000 salary to Tim, a shareholder-employee; and total labour expenditure (salary and wages and shareholder salary) for all staff of $1,100,000 IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 19 of 43 Tim carries out development work on Project Y as well as general business duties. Tim separately records his development work on Project Y in a special time sheet code for that project. C Co determines that: 50% of Tim’s time relates to his provision of R&D material for Project Y, and 50% to other duties; and all the expenditure it incurs on Project Y in the 2023 income year is non- deductible for tax purposes. When calculating the wage intensity, it is not relevant that part of Tim’s salary (relating to the work on Project Y) is non-deductible, or that some of the R&D labour salary is funded by a government grant. However, it is relevant that only half Tim’s time (and salary) is spent on R&D work. C Co’s wage intensity is: total R&D labour expenditure / total labour expenditure ($200,000 + ($100,000 \* 0.5)) / $1,100,000 = 0.227 As 22.7% of C Co’s total labour expenditure is R&D labour expenditure, it meets the requirement. As is explained in Example | Tauira 10 and Example | Tauira 11, the non-deductibility of part of the salary costs and the government grant funding has consequences for other calculations. Calculating wage intensity for an R&D group 79.If the company is part of an R&D group, the R&D group must meet the wage intensity calculation in aggregate. This means the total R&D labour expenditure and total labour expenditure are the combined amounts of all the members of the group. 80.The R&D group’s total R&D labour expenditure includes payments of salary and wages to each group member’s employees or shareholder employees for the provision of R&D material to that relevant group member. Contractor R&D consideration is only for payments made to contractors outside the R&D group. 81.The relevant amounts must be for providing R&D material, which, as previously explained, is only for goods and services provided to the particular company and does not include amounts paid to further another person’s R&D activities. There is no allowance in the definition of R&D material for furthering the R&D activities of another group member. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 6. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 20 of 43 Example | Tauira 6: Wage intensity for an R&D group Op Co and Management Co are owned by the same shareholder, John. Therefore, they are members of an R&D group. John is the sole employee of Management Co and receives a salary of $200,000. John manages the day-to-day operations of Op Co and Management Co and provides R&D material to Op Co in relation to Project Z. Op Co carries on eligible R&D activities in relation to Project Z. Op Co incurs salary and wage expenditure of $400,000 in relation to R&D material provided by its employees working on Project Z, and other salary and wage expenditure of $900,000. Management Co charges Op Co a service fee of $160,000 for John’s provision of R&D material in relation to Project Z. Op Co wage intensity calculation Op Co’s total R&D labour expenditure includes only the salary and wages paid to its employees for providing R&D material ($400,000). Op Co cannot include the amount paid to Management Co for John’s services because the payment is not: salary or wages of an employee or shareholder employee of Op Co; or contractor R&D consideration as this excludes amounts paid to a member of an R&D group that the company (Op Co) is a member of. Op Co’s wage intensity calculation is: total R&D labour expenditure / total labour expenditure $400,000 / ($400,000 + $900,000) = 0.307 This means 30.7% of Op Co’s total labour expenditure is R&D labour expenditure, and Op Co has sufficient wage intensity. R&D Group wage intensity calculation For the group, the total R&D labour expenditure includes the salary and wages paid to employees and shareholder employees of both Op Co and Management Co for providing R&D material. R&D material does not include an employee’s services provided to another entity, even within a group. This means the service fee paid for John’s R&D contribution is not included in the group aggregate amount, because John did not provide R&D material to Management Co. The R&D Group’s calculation is: total R&D labour expenditure / total labour expenditure IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 21 of 43 $400,000 / ($400,000 + $900,000 + $200,000) = 0.266 This means 26.6% of the R&D group’s total labour is R&D labour expenditure. The R&D group also has sufficient wage intensity (despite John’s service fee not being included). 82.If a member of an R&D group is a foreign company, any salary and wages paid to that company’s employees are included in the wage intensity calculation. 83.Where a foreign company’s employees are performing R&D activities outside New Zealand, then salary and wages paid to those employees are not included in the total R&D labour expenditure of the group. This is because R&D material does not includ e a ctivities subject to schedule 2, which includes activities performed outside New Zealand. 84.However, there is no similar exclusion in total labour expenditure. Therefore, all salary and wages paid to all employees (including foreign employees) must be included as total labour expenditure. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 7. Example | Tauira 7: Wage intensity calculation with non-resident group member NZ Co is a wholly owned subsidiary of US Co. US Co employs three R&D employees who are paid the equivalent of NZ$100,000 each and 10 other employees who are paid the equivalent of NZ$1,500,000 combined. NZ Co employs two R&D employees who are each paid $100,000 for full time R&D work, and another two employees who are each paid $8 0,000 for administrative work. NZ Co is working on an R&D project based in New Zealand. NZ Co’s wage intensity calculation Wage intensity = total R&D labour expenditure / total labour expenditure $2 00,000 (2 x $100,000) / $360,000 ((2 x $100,000) + (2 x $80,000)) = 0.55 At 55%, NZ Co has sufficient wage intensity. R&D group’s wage intensity calculation Only R&D work undertaken in New Zealand qualifies as total R&D labour expenditure. Therefore, the salary paid to US Co’s R&D employees does not qualify. However, the amounts paid to all of US Co’s employees must be included in the R&D group’s total labour expenditure: IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 22 of 43 = $200,000 + 0 / $360,000 + ((3 x $100,000) + 1,500,000)) = $200,000/ $2,160,000 = 0.09 At 9%, the R&D group does not have sufficient wage intensity. Therefore, NZ Co is not eligible for an R&D loss tax credit. R&D expenditure 85.The above analysis dealt with issues that arise when determining whether a company is eligible to claim an R&D loss tax credit. The next issue is whether it is incurring eligible R&D expenditure. For eligibility purposes no particular amount of R&D expenditure is required, although the amount is relevant for determining the amount of credit that is available. 86.R&D expenditure is expenditure the company incurs on goods and services to the extent it relates to research or development. Also, the intellectual property and know- how resulting from the research or development must vest in the company (solely or jointly). R&D expenditure excludes expenditure that: relates to an activity described in schedule 22 (proscribed activities); is on goods and services used to provide a service of research or development to another person, or that furthers another person’s R&D activities; is not deductible in the income year; is for or under a financial arrangement (such as interest); or is for the acquisition or transfer of intangible property, core technology, intellectual property or know-how. 87.The meaning of R&D, and the schedule 22 proscribed activities, were considered earlier from \[22\] to \[40\]. It is also relevant that the R&D work must be undertaken for the company. Expenditure is not eligible where a company undertakes R&D for another person (including another person within an R&D group). Expenditure that “relates to” research or development 88.A question that arises concerns what goods or services acquired by a business could be said to “relate to” eligible research or development. 89.The words “relate to” mean the expenditure must be “connected to” the research or development activities, and the connection must be more than tenuous. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 23 of 43 90.In some cases, a company may incur expenditure for goods and services that relate in pa rt to eligible activities and in part to other activities. For example, salary (and other) costs for R&D staff who also work on ineligible activities, costs of materials or depreciable property used in both R&D work and other work, and some overheads. 91.The cost of the goods and services must have some relationship with the R&D activity to be said to “relate to” that activity (and must not relate to proscribed activities suc h a s routine work under schedule 22). Where expenditure has the relevant relationship, the company must apportion the expenditure between the eligible and ineligibl e a ctivities. Only the portion that relates to eligible activity counts as R&D expenditure. 92.No specific rules relate to apportionment, but it must be fair and reasonable and able t o be quantified in some way. Examples of apportioning overhead costs include: Salary or wages paid to staff who provide services to R&D staff as well as other staff could be apportioned based on time sheet codes, or on a percentage of R&D staff compared with non R&D staff (if that is fair and reasonable). Electricity, insurance and maintenance costs for a building that is used in part for eligible R&D activity and in part for other activity could be apportioned based on the percentage of the area used for R&D compared with other activity. 93.Overheads that do not relate to the R&D work cannot be included in an a pportionment. For example, a company’s general accounting costs (whether in-hous e o r external accounting costs) would not relate to R&D work undertaken (even if they include expenses incurred in claiming an R&D loss tax credit, those expenses do not r elate to the R&D work itself). However, a company can have accounting or financ e c osts that “relate to” eligible research or development. For example, costs to create budgets for R&D activities/projects. 94.Apportioning an employee’s time and overheads are illustrated in Example | Tauira 8 and Example | Tauira 9. Example | Tauira 8: R&D expenditure – apportionment of an employee’s time ABC Co is a manufacturing company that launched its first product (Product A) in the 2021 income year and is starting to see a steady increase in customers. The company is developing an innovative new product (Product B) as an R&D project. Jo is employed by the company in the information technology team, and works part- time on the development of Product B. Jo uses a timesheet to record her hours worked and uses a special code for time spent on the R&D project. Over the course of the income year, Jo’s time on the R&D project has averaged 35% of her recorded time. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 24 of 43 ABC Co includes 35% of Jo’s salary as R&D labour expenditure when calculating wage intensity. ABC Co concludes the expenditure on Jo’s salary relating to the R&D project satisfies the requirements to be R&D expenditure. Therefore, ABC Co also includes that amount as part of its eligible R&D expenditure. E xample | Tauira 9: R&D expenditure – expenditure related to R&D X Co employs two full time R&D employees (who undertake eligible R&D work) and 18 other employees. Bob carries out administrative services on a part time basis. Bob is paid $45,000 for the relevant income year. He undertakes specific administrative services for the R&D employees, as well as general administrative services for other employees. He does not record his time. Aroha carries out various management and accounting services. Aroha is paid $70,000 for the relevant income year. She is involved in filing tax returns and making the relevant R&D loss tax credit claims. X Co apportions Bob’s time spent on services to R&D staff based on the number of R&D employees in X Co (two) as a proportion of the total number of employees (20). X Co calculates that $4,500 (2/20 x $45,000) can be included as R&D expenditure (and decides the expenditure meets all the other requirements of the R&D expenditure definition). However, as Bob is not providing R&D material, this amount is not included in the total R&D labour expenditure calculation for wage intensity. Aroha’s time (including filing R&D loss tax credit claims) is not sufficiently related to R&D work. Accordingly, no part of her salary can be included as R&D expenditure or total R&D labour expenditure. X Co incurs other costs including electricity, insurance and ongoing maintenance of its premises that are used partly for its R&D work. X Co has a separate area for the R&D activities undertaken by the two R&D employees and calculates that to be 15% of the total floor spaces of the premises. Therefore, 15% of these overheads can be included as R&D expenditure. Expenditure must be tax deductible in the year it is incurred 95.Importantly, expenditure only qualifies as R&D expenditure if a deduction is available f or the expenditure in the income year. The company must incur the relevant expenditure in the income year in which it claims a credit (s MX 4(1)(h)). Under t he IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 25 of 43 definition of R&D expenditure the deduction must also be available in that income year. 96.Sometimes the deduction for expenditure on R&D is allocated to a different income y ear under s EJ 23. Expenditure for which a deduction is available (but allocated to a different income year) can qualify as R&D expenditure in the income year it is incurre d ( subject to satisfying the other requirements of R&D expenditure discussed at \[86\]). However, such expenditure does not qualify as R&D expenditure in the income year it is deducted as only expenditure incurred in the income year qualifies as R&D expenditure. 97.A deduction could be available for research or development expenditure under: a specific provision such as s DB 33 or s DB 34 (research or development) or the general deductibility provision in s DA 1. 98.Uncertainty arose because s DB 34 uses the definitions of “research” and “development” in NZ IAS 38 that are also relevant to the R&D loss tax credit. However, the deduction does not have to be available under that provision. Deductibility under ss DB 33 and DB 34 99.Section DB 33 provides that a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with scientific research that they carry on for the purpose of deriving their assessable income. However, it does not apply to expenditure incurred on a n a sset that is not created from the scientific research and where they are allowed a deduction for depreciation loss. “Scientific research” is not defined for these purposes. 100.Section DB 34 applies to a person who applies NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting purposes. Broadly, under s DB 34, a deduction is allowed for research or development expenditure if the person has recognised the expenditure as an expense under NZ IAS 38. The definitions of research and development for these purposes are t he s ame as those discussed earlier. 101.Section DB 34 effectively applies accounting concepts to determine whether a deduction is available in the income year. If an expense is recognised for accounting purposes (and otherwise satisfies the section) then a deduction is allowed. This differs to general deductibility treatment where accounting treatment is not determinative of deductibility. For further information on the application of s DB 34 see IG 23/01: Deductibility of software as a service (SaaS) configuration and customisation costs. 102.Expenditure that is deductible under these provisions must still meet the other requirements previously discussed to be R&D expenditure. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 26 of 43 Deductibility under s DA 1 – general permission 103.The other way in which a deduction is available is under general principles. Under s DA 1 a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to t he ex tent they incur it in deriving their income, or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. This is known as the general permission. 104.The expenditure or loss must be incurred in the course of carrying on a business. A s ufficient relationship must exist between the expenditure and the business that is being carried on (CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). The type of expenditure and its relevance to t he in come-earning process are relevant for deciding whether that relationship exists. This includes looking at how the company earns its income and the factual situation at t he t ime the expenditure is incurred. 105.Even where a deduction is allowed under s DA 1, it may be disallowed under the lim itations to deductibility. The most likely limitation that can apply to research or development expenditure is for capital expenditure in s DA 2(1). Whether expenditur e i s of a capital nature is a factual question that needs to be considered in each case. 106.When considering deductibility under general principles, the accounting treatment is of limited relevance. This differs to the position under s DB 34 where companies tha t a pply NZ IAS 38 can generally follow their accounting treatment. Non-deductibility of expenses is illustrated in Example | Tauira 10. Example | Tauira 10: R&D expenditure – non-deductible expenses C Co from Example | Tauira 5 is now calculating the amount of R&D expenditure it incurred in the 2023 income year. C Co paid $200,000 in salary and wages to two staff and 50% (that is, $50,000) of Tim’s salary for providing R&D material. C Co does not apply NZ IAS 38. C Co had determined that the amount paid to Tim for his work on Project Y was non- deductible expenditure because it related to a capital project. Tim’s R&D portion of salary ($50,000) was included in C Co’s total R&D labour expenditure for the purpose of determining whether it satisfied the wage intensity calculation. However, R&D expenditure excludes expenditure for which no deduction is available in the income year. As the $50,000 shareholder-salary paid to Tim for providing R&D material is not deductible, it cannot be included in C Co’s R&D expenditure. C Co determined that the $200,000 salary and wages paid to the two full-time staff for providing R&D material was deductible. However, see Example | Tauira 11 about the treatment of amounts funded by a government grant. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 27 of 43 Government grant funding 107.If a company receives certain types of government grant funding for research or development, and the government grant provisions in ss CX 47 and DF 1 apply, t he a mount of the grant is not taxable income, but the expense funded by the grant is non-deductible. This means R&D expenditure cannot include any expenditure to t he ex tent it is funded by such a grant. 108.The government grant provisions only apply in certain situations. The grant must be pr ovided by certain types of government agencies, and it must be provided for (otherwise) deductible expenditure. For further information on when the government grant provisions apply see IS 23/06: Income tax – Government payments to businesses (grants and subsidies). 109.Where the grant funding is less than the relevant expenses, the part of the expense not funded by the grant may still be deductible. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 11. Example | Tauira 11: R&D expenditure – government grant funding C Co (from Example | Tauira 5 and Example | Tauira 10) received a government grant of $100,000 for Project X . The grant was aimed at attracting more R&D staff so required the funds be used for R&D salaries. C Co funded half of its $200,000 R&D salary costs with this grant. Government grant funding does not affect the wage intensity calculation. C Co’s total R&D labour expenditure still includes the $100,000 of staff salaries funded by the grant. However, when calculating its R&D expenditure, C Co cannot include expenditure that is not deductible. While C Co had determined the salaries were ordinarily deductible, this particular grant satisfied s DF 1. That means the expenses funded by the grant become non-deductible. C Co can only treat the $100,000 salary not funded by the grant as “ R&D expenditure”. C Co cannot assume the total R&D labour expenditure is eligible R&D expenditure. 110.Where an R&D project is co-funded, the costs of the project not funded by the g overnment grant may still be deductible. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 12. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 28 of 43 Example | Tauira 12: R&D expenditure – co-funding arrangement B Co receives a government grant of $100,000 towards a $200,000 R&D project on the basis that B Co’s investors will provide the other $100,000 funding. B Co determines that the government grant provisions in ss CX 47 and DF 1 apply to the $100,000 government grant. When calculating its R&D expenditure, B Co cannot include expenditure that is not deductible. The R&D project expenses funded by the government grant are non-deductible. B Co determines that the R&D project expenses co-funded by investors are deductible. Accordingly, these expenses can be included as R&D expenditure provided the other requirements for expenditure to be R&D expenditure are met. Interaction between wage intensity calculation and “R&D expenditure” 111.An area of uncertainty has been the relationship between the wage intensity calculation and the company’s R&D expenditure. In short, there is no relationshi p bet ween these amounts. 112.Where expenses are excluded from the wage intensity, they may be included in R&D expenditure (and vice versa). Also, neither amount affects the calculation of t he c ompany’s net loss for tax purposes. These amounts are only relevant as separat e in dicators of eligibility for the R&D loss tax credit. 113.The maximum amount of credit that can be claimed is discussed in part two of this statement. This includes amounts relating to: the total R&D labour expenditure (part of the wage intensity calculation); and the amount of R&D expenditure incurred. The company must own the results of the R&D 114.A company can only claim an R&D loss tax credit for R&D activities if the results of those activities (the intellectual property and know-how) vest in the company solely or jointly with another person. The word “vests” in this context means the company owns or has a present legal right to that property. 115.This requirement is included both in relation to the company’s eligibility to claim a credit and in the definition of R&D expenditure. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 29 of 43 116.The requirement is designed to ensure the person making a claim to cash-out the R&D tax losses is the person who invested in the research or development. However, i n r ecognition that parties may jointly undertake R&D activities, the requirement is satisfied if the intellectual property and know-how vests in the company jointly. For example, two or more companies may agree to carry out R&D activities together an d to share ownership of the results. 117.Whether the intellectual property and know-how vests in a person depends on the f acts. Usually, the intellectual property and know-how from R&D activities vest in t he per son carrying out the activity, the creator of the invention or knowledge. However, this might not be the case if, for example, the person is carrying out the activity: in the course of their employment (the intellectual property will usually vest in the employer); or for another person. 118.A company must have sufficient rights in the results of the R&D activities to meet the r equirement that the intellectual property and know-how vests in the person. A company will usually satisfy that requirement if it: carries out research or development activities for itself; owns the results of research or development carried out by a contractor on t he c ompany’s behalf; or has a contractual arrangement with another party to share the results of th e r esearch or development. 119.Some R&D groups may structure their operations so that the intellectual property is owned by a separate group company from the company undertaking the research or development. In that case, each company needs to be considered on its own to determine if it meets this requirement. The company undertaking R&D will not qualify for the credit if it is undertaking that work for another person (that is, the person who owns the results of the R&D). Similarly, the company that owns the intellectua l pr operty will need to be undertaking enough of its own R&D work to qualify. 120.This requirement differs from the RDTI which applies where the person can use the r esults from the R&D activity (such as the intellectual property created) for no consideration, or where the results are owned by another company within the sam e g roup of companies, or a member of a joint venture that the person is a member of (s LY 3(1)(c) ). 121.The ownership of the intellectual property and know-how vesting with a different company to the company undertaking the R&D is illustrated in Example | Tauira 13. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 30 of 43 Example | Tauira 13: Intellectual property owned within an R&D group R&D Co and Op Co are each wholly owned by Hold Co. R&D Co is a research and development company carrying out eligible R&D activities on behalf of Op Co in the 2022 income year. Op Co owns the intellectual property and know-how generated from the R&D carried out by R&D Co. R&D Co invoices Op Co for R&D work it is undertaking. R&D Co cannot claim an R&D loss tax credit for the 2022 income year as it is undertaking its R&D work for another company, and also because it does not own the results of its R&D activities. This is the case even though R&D Co and Op Co are members of the same R&D group. Summary 122.The above analysis considered common issues that have arisen in determining a company’s eligibility for the R&D loss tax credit. In brief, an eligible company is o ne th at: chooses in an income year to apply for an R&D loss tax credit; is N ew Zealand resident and not an ineligible type of company; has a net loss in the tax year; satisfies the wage intensity calculation; incurs eligible R&D expenditure; owns the results of the R&D; and notifies Inland Revenue when it is in an R&D group and in that event the R&D group must: ohave a combined net loss in the tax year; and osatisfy the wage intensity calculation. 123.Having considered it meets all the criteria as explained in this part of this statement, an e ligible company is entitled to claim an R&D loss tax credit. Part two of this statemen t d iscusses the ongoing obligations of such a company. Part Two: Obligations and repayments 124.Having determined that a company is eligible for the R&D loss tax credit, this part sets out obligations the company must meet. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 31 of 43 Applications 125.The Inland Revenue website provides guidelines on the information needed to support an application for an R&D loss tax credit (Apply for the R&D loss tax credit). 126.The time for filing an R&D statement is provided for in s 70C(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). For the 2023 and later tax years, the R&D statemen t m ust be filed no later than 30 days after the last day for filing the company’s incom e t ax return for the relevant income year. 6 The last day for filing a company’s income tax return is the date provided for in s 37 of the TAA. If a company does not file the R&D statement by the due date it is not entitled to claim an R&D loss tax credit for tha t y ear. The due date for filing the R&D statement is illustrated in Example | Tauira 14. Example | Tauira 14: Due date for R&D statement Newco is undertaking R&D in the 2023 income year and has registered for the R&D loss tax credit. Newco does not have a tax agent and has a standard balance date of 31 March. Newco’s income tax return for the 2023 income year is due on 7 July 2023. If Newco wants to claim an R&D loss tax credit for the 2023 income year it must file its R&D statement no later than 6 August 2023. If it files the R&D statement on 7 August 2023, it will not be eligible to claim a credit. If Newco has a tax agent, then it will get an extension of time for filing its income tax return. The last day for filing Newco’s income tax return for the 2023 income year will be 31 March 2024, and Newco will need to file an R&D statement no later than 30 April 2024. Calculation of credit 127.The amount of the R&D loss tax credit is calculated under s MX 4. The amount of the a vailable tax credit is the lowest of: for the 2021 and subsequent income years, $560,000; the company’s net loss for the tax year x the basic tax rate for a company ( 28%); the company’s total R&D expenditure for the income year x 28%; and 1.5 x the company’s total R&D labour expenditure in the income year x 28%. 6 N ote different timeframes applied for earlier years. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 32 of 43 128.Many of these terms were explained in Part One: A net loss arises where the company’s total amount of deductions for the tax year exceeds its total income for the tax year. This amount includes a ll de ductions and all income and is not restricted to R&D (see \[54\]). A company’s total R&D expenditure is the cost of all goods and services that relate to eligible R&D activities in the income year and for which a deduction is available in that year (see \[86\]). The total R&D labour expenditure is the same amount as determined under t he w age intensity calculation (see \[61\]). 129.A company needs to do all these calculations to determine which amount applies. See t he example in the article in Tax Information Bulletin V ol 28, No 3 (April 2016):19 at 24. If the company tax rate changes, further calculations may be required under s MX 6. This is also explained at page 24 of the above article. 130.When calculating these amounts, some expenses excluded from some calculations are included in others. The differences between the calculations are summarised in Table | Tūtohi 1 and Example | Tauira 15. Table | Tūtohi 1: Expenses included in the different calculations Expense type Total R&D labour expenditure Deductible expenditure (R&D expenditure & net loss) External contractor payments for eligible R&D Only 66% included Full amount included (unless capital) Employees/contractors work on capital R&D projects Included Not included (unless s DB 33 or s DB 34 allows) Payments to member of group or employee of member of group for R&D Not included Included (unless capital) R&D salary/wages funded by government grant (s DF 1) Included Not included to the extent funded by grant E xample | Tauira 15: R&D expenditure compared with total R&D labour expenditure Op Co and Management Co from Example | Tauira 6 are members of an R&D group. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 33 of 43 Op Co is carrying on eligible R&D activities (Project Z). It incurs salary and wage expenditure of $400,000 for the team working on Project Z. Op Co had also incurred expenditure of $160,000 for R&D services provided by Management Co (through shareholder employee John). Op Co excluded the amount paid for the services John provided from its R&D labour expenditure for calculating wage intensity. However, for calculating its R&D expenditure, Op Co determined that the payment to Management Co is deductible, and it meets all the requirements to be R&D expenditure. Unlike the wage intensity calculation, the R&D expenditure calculation does not limit the contractor payment to 66%. The full amount is included. Treatment of losses 131.Once the available amount of credit is calculated, the company will have some or all of its net loss extinguished (s MX 5). The loss is extinguished because it has been cashed out by the company claiming the credit. 132.The amount of loss extinguished is: the amount of the R&D loss tax credit / the basic tax rate for a company (28%) 133.If the amount of loss extinguished is less than the company’s available net tax loss, the r emaining losses for that year may be carried forward to the next tax year. For further details about the requirements for carrying forward company losses see IS 22/07. 134.If losses are carried forward the company cannot then cash-out those losses in a later year, but it can offset them against income or they can be carried forward to future years. 135.The extinguishment of losses is illustrated in Example | Tauira 16. Example | Tauira 16: Calculation of R&D loss tax credit and losses extinguished Research Co is carrying on an R&D project in the 2022 income year and has: a net loss of $700,000; total R&D expenditure of $525,000; and total R&D labour expenditure of $450,000. The amount of R&D loss tax credit available is the lowest of: IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 34 of 43 $560,000; net loss ($700,000) x 28% = $196,000; total R&D expenditure ($525,000) x 28% = $147,000; and 1.5 x R&D labour expenditure ($675,000) x 28% = $189,000. The amount available as the R&D loss tax credit is $147,000. Th e amount of tax loss extinguished under s MX 5 is: $147,000 / 28% = $525,000. Research Co meets the requirements to carry forward its remaining losses and carries forward those tax losses to the next tax year. This is calculated as: net loss for the year - losses extinguished = losses carried forward $700,000 - $525,000 = $175,000 Research Co cannot claim the tax losses carried forward ($175,000) as R&D loss tax credits in any subsequent tax year. Repayment obligations 136.A company that has an R&D loss tax credit has obligations regarding the repayment of the tax credit. This is important for companies to realise, as subsequent events ca n t rigger a requirement to repay the credits that were previously cashed out. Imposing repayment tax is not intended to deter a company from claiming an R&D loss tax credit but reflects that in some circumstances it is appropriate for the R&D loss tax credit to be repaid. 137.The general repayment obligation is that as the company pays tax on income, this is treated as a repayment of the R&D loss tax credit. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 17. Example | Tauira 17: Repay R&D loss tax credit by payments of income tax R&D Co claims an R&D loss tax credit for the 2020 income year of $79,800. This results in the extinguishment of all its 2020 net loss of $285,000. R&D Co has no losses carried forward from prior years. In the 2021 income year R&D Co has taxable income of $100,000. R&D Co has no losses available to offset against its income as its previous losses were cashed IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 35 of 43 out and extinguished. Accordingly, R&D Co has tax to pay of $28,000 ($100,000 x 28%). In the following income year R&D Co has taxable income of $200,000. R&D Co has no losses available and has tax to pay of $56,000 ($200,000 x 28%). At the end of the 2022 income year R&D Co has repaid the R&D loss tax credit claimed ($ 79,800) through the payment of income tax of an equal amount $79,800 ($28,000 + $51,800). R&D Co has fully repaid the R&D loss tax credits. Early repayment events – “loss recovery events” 138.In certain situations the company is required to make an early repayment of a pr eviously claimed R&D loss tax credit. These situations are referred to as “lo ss r ecovery events”. If a loss recovery event occurs the company will have a liability for an amount of R&D repayment tax. The amount of R&D repayment tax depends on t he t ype of event that has occurred. 139.The types of loss recovery events are when: the company disposes of or transfers intangible property, core technology, intellectual property or know-how for less than market value, and/or where t he a mount is not assessable income of the company; the company is no longer N ew Zealand resident; a liquidator is appointed; or there is a loss of the required shareholder continuity. 140.For detailed discussion of the repayment events see the article in Tax Information Bulletin V ol 28, No 3 (April 2016):19 at 25 to 28. Each loss recovery event has a formula for calculating the amount of R&D repayment tax. A component of each calculation is the total amount of R&D loss tax credits that the company has ever claimed (s s M X 7( 2)(a), MX 7(4)(a) and s MX 7(6)). 141.Because the R&D repayment tax is calculated from the first year for which the c ompany has claimed an R&D loss tax credit, a company needs to ensure it keeps records to support the calculations that will be required. This means a company needs to keep a record of any repayments it has made (including by paying tax). A company must file an R&D statement in relation to R&D repayment tax that they must pay for a tax year. 142.A company also should keep in mind that, from the first year in which it claims the R&D loss tax credit, the credit may need to be repaid early. As noted below, this means it is best practice to determine the value of any property created by the R&D IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 36 of 43 and the company’s shares, on an ongoing basis, in the event that a repayment event occurs. Disposal of property, core technology, intellectual property or know-how 143.The first loss recovery event is when a company disposes of or transfers intangible pr operty, core technology, intellectual property or know-how. However, a lo ss r ecovery event does not arise if the disposal or transfer is: to an amalgamated company as part of an amalgamation; or at market value or above and t he consideration received is assessable incom e o f the company. 144.The market value of property is a factual question that depends on the circumstances of each case. A company that has claimed an R&D loss tax credit may want to give some thought to how to value the property it is creating. This means that if t he r elevant property is sold, the company will have the information to be able to establis h t he market value at that time. The relevant market for determining market value is a n o pen market, and not the value to the particular company. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 18. Example | Tauira 18: Intellectual Property disposal at market value not a loss recovery event Startup Co is incorporated in June 2019 to undertake R&D work for an innovative new manufacturing process, with a plan of selling the intellectual property created. However, its R&D project failed, and Startup Co was in the process of winding up its activity. Startup Co had routinely considered what the intellectual property generated was worth, and sold the intellectual property for open market value to its founder. The amount received is assessable income. As the intellectual property was sold at market value and was assessable income, no loss recovery event occurs. However, depending on how the company winds up, other events could arise. Determining market value can be difficult. It is important to realise that the market value is the value on the open market, and not the value to the company that is winding up. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 37 of 43 Migration of company 145.The second loss recovery event is when a company fails to meet a corporate eligibility requirement in s MX 2(a) or (b). A company will fail this requirement if it ceases to be a New Zealand resident company or is treated as a resident of a foreign country or territory under a double tax agreement. Appointment of a liquidator 146.The third loss recovery event occurs if the company has a liquidator appointed. 7 A l iquidator can be appointed by special resolution of the company’s shareholders, t he b oard of the company, or a court order. 147.The appointment of a liquidator is not the same as the removal of a company from the c ompanies register. A company can be wound up in different ways. This event is only triggered on the appointment of a liquidator. Loss of shareholder continuity 148.The fourth loss recovery event occurs if the company breaches the shareholder continuity requirements set out in s MX 7(1)(b). 149.Shareholding continuity will not be breached if at least 10% of the voting interests in t he company are held by the same group of persons throughout the relevant period. For further information on calculating voting interests see IS 22/07. 150.A company that has claimed an R&D loss tax credit must track shareholding changes in the company from the first credit year ( that is, from the first year in respect of whic h t hey have claimed an R&D loss tax credit) until the R&D loss tax credits ha ve been r epaid in full. This enables the company to determine whether a shareholding continuity breach has occurred. 151.For this event, the value of the company’s shares is relevant to the calculation of the a mount of R&D repayment tax (refer to Table | Tūtohi 2). As already noted, “market value” is a factual question. A company that has claimed an R&D loss tax credit may want to consider how it will determine the market value of its shares, if there is a breach of the required shareholder continuity. 152.If a holding company is interposed between the original shareholders and the R&D company, that holding company is looked through to the ultimate shareholders 7 In Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Officials’ report on the Bill (Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue, 2015) p 18, Officials commented that it was anticipated that a number of companies will be liquidated because they cannot meet their debts and the Commissioner will be an unsecured creditor. The unrecoverable nature of much of this debt was included in the estimated fiscal cost of the policy. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 38 of 43 (s YC 4). There will not be a breach of the shareholder continuity requirement in that event. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 19. Example | Tauira 19: Shareholding continuity – interposed holding company R&D Co has been carrying on a business of developing widgets since the 2020 income year. R&D Co claimed an R&D loss tax credit for the 2020 income year (the earliest credit year). Since incorporation, the shares in R&D Co have been owned by Jason (50%) and Devendra (50%). Jason and Devendra set up a holding company with each holding 50% of the shares in Hold Co. In the 2022 income year Jason and Devendra sell their shares in R&D Co to Hold Co. Although the shares in R&D Co have been sold to Hold Co, the required shareholding continuity has not been breached. Jason and Devendra each hold 50% of the shares in Hold Co and, under s YC 4, are treated as holding 50% in R&D Co throughout the relevant period. The sale of the shares to Hold Co does not trigger a loss recovery event. R&D repayment tax 153.The amount of R&D repayment tax is set out in Table | Tūtohi 2 (including which c alculation to apply if there are multiple events). IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 39 of 43 Table | Tūtohi 2: Amount of R&D repayment tax by loss recovery event Loss recovery event How much is repaid? Which calculation? 1 Disposal of property Lesser of: •balance of unrepaid R&D loss tax credits; or •market value of property disposed of x 0.28. This applies only if loss r ecovery event 2 or 3 does not apply. 2 Breach of corporate eligibility Balance of unrepaid R&D loss tax credits This calculation applies over others. 3 Liquidator appointed 4 Loss of shareholder continuity Lesser of: •balance of unrepaid R&D loss tax credits; or •market value of shares disposed of x 0.28. This applies only if loss r ecovery event 2 or 3 does not apply. R&D repayment tax – filing obligations 154.A company must file an R&D statement in relation to R&D loss tax credits they claim for a tax year and/or R&D repayment tax they must pay for a tax year. The R&D statement must be filed by the date provided in s 70C(2) of the TAA. 155.There is a place on the R&D statement to notify the Commissioner that a loss recovery event has occurred and the amount of R&D repayment tax that is to be paid for a tax year (s 70C of the TAA). The R&D statement must also show any other repayments of the R&D loss tax credit that have been made in the year, for example, a payment o f i ncome tax will reduce the balance of the R&D loss tax credits required to be repaid. R&D repayment tax – due date for payment 156.The due date for paying the R&D repayment tax is the terminal tax date for the relevant tax year (s 70C(3) of the TAA). The terminal tax date for the company w ill d epend on the company’s balance date and whether the company’s return of income is linked to a tax agent. IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 40 of 43 Deduction for repayment tax – s DV 26 157.If a company has an obligation for R&D repayment tax, the company is allowed a de duction for that amount in the same income year under s DV 26. 158.Effectively, the amount of loss that was claimed (and that has to be repaid) is reinstated by th e amount of the deduction. This operates to put the company back into the same position it was in before claiming the credits (that is, the loss that was extinguished when credits were claimed). The deduction is allocated to the year in which t he c ompany incurs the expenditure on the R&D repayment tax. The company incurs this expenditure in the income year in which the event that gives rise to the R&D repayment tax (the loss recovery event) occurs. This is illustrated in Example | Tauir a 20 . 159.The amount of the deduction is: amount of R&D repayment tax / basic tax rate for a company (28%). Example | Tauira 20: reinstatement of tax losses R&D Co’s ultimate shareholders (Jason and Devendra) from Example | Tauira 19, sold all their shares in January 2021. This means R&D Co has breached shareholder continuity in the 2021 income year. The obligation for the R&D repayment tax arises immediately after the breach in shareholder continuity occurs. R&D Co calculates the amount of R&D repayment tax payable for that year as $735,000. R&D Co is allowed a deduction for the amount of R&D repayment tax, and this deduction arises in the same income year. The amount of deduction is calculated under s MX 7(7) as follows: R&D repayment tax /28% $735,000/0.28 = $2,625,000 R&D Co has a deduction of $2,625,000. Imputation credit accounts 160.Imputation credits are credits of tax a company pays on its income and that ca n be a ttached to a dividend received by a shareholder. Imputation ensures a shareholder is not effectively taxed twice on the same amount (once when the company earns profit, and again when the shareholder receives a distribution of that profit). IS 23/09 | 27 October 2023 Page 41 of 43 161.Most New Zealand resident companies are required to establish and maintain an i mputation credit account (ICA). Under s OB 4, the ICA company will have a n i mputation credit in their account for an amount of income tax paid. 162.Where an ICA company has claimed an R&D loss tax credit and has not had to pay R&D repayment tax, the company will have an imputation debit for the year calculate d und er s OB 47B. The amount of the imputation debit is the lesser of: the imputation credit that the company has for the year (that is, for amounts of tax paid); and the company’s total R&D loss tax credits less the imputation debits under s OB 47B for previous income years 163.Because the amount of imputation debit is limited to the amount of tax paid during the year, the ICA company will not end up with a closing debit ICA balance due to t he R &D loss tax credit. 164.The effect of this calculation means the company will not be able to attach imputation credits to dividends until it has repaid the R&D loss tax credit amounts in full (whether through paying income tax or R&D repayment tax). For an example, see the article in Tax Information Bulletin V ol 28, No 3 (April 2016):19 at 28. Record keeping for the R&D loss tax credit 165.A company’s record keeping requirements are set out in s 22 of the TAA. For guidance o n record keeping for the R&D loss tax credit, see the Inland Revenue website (Record keeping for the research and development loss tax credit). 166.A company making a claim for R&D loss tax credits has additional matters to consider from the first credit year until the R&D loss tax credits are fully repaid..

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, Interpretation Statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an Interpretation Statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.

It is recognised that not all readers require this level of detail. To assist, the statement has been broken into parts with summaries and examples. In particular, the following may be helpful: • The summary of general principles at paragraphs 1 to 27. • The flowchart at paragraph 35, setting out how to approach resolving issues of deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. • “Key points” summaries at paragraphs 97 (identifying the asset being worked on), 175 (identifying the nature and extent of the work done) and 232 (other considerations from the repairs and maintenance cases). • Examples illustrating the practical application of the principles discussed in each part. The examples immediately follow paragraph 49 (nexus) and each of the “key points” summaries at paragraphs 97, 175 and 232. 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Summary This Interpretation Statement considers the deductibility of costs incurred by a taxpayer to repair or maintain their property. The focus of this statement is on tangible property including real property. Expenditure incurred to make repairs or alterations or to maintain assets is commonly referred to as “repairs and maintenance expenditure”. For ease of reference, this Interpretation Statement also uses this expression. However, in any individual situation within this statement the expression’s use should not be taken as an indication that the Commissioner considers the costs to be of a revenue nature and deductible. This Interpretation Statement restates the Commissioner’s view of the general principles relating to the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. It updates and replaces the Commissioner’s earlier statement on repairs and maintenance expenditure published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 9 (February 1994). It also updates and replaces the following items that were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 6 (December 1995): “Rental property – deducting maintenance expenses while property vacant”; “Rental property – deductibility of renovation costs”; and “Rental property – deductibility of interior redecorations”. The Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure has not changed in any substantial way since the 1994 statement. A deduction for repairs and maintenance expenditure is allowed if the expenditure is deductible under the general permission in s DA 1(1), and if that expenditure is not excluded from deductibility by any of the general limitations in s DA 2. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). The other general limitations (eg, the private limitation) are beyond the scope of this statement. This statement also does not consider any specific deduction provisions in Part D that override the application of the capital limitation for certain types of expenditure. To qualify for a deduction under the general permission in s DA 1(1), the repairs and maintenance expenditure must be incurred in deriving assessable income and/or excluded income, or be incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income and/or excluded income. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) denies a deduction for repairs and maintenance expenditure that satisfies the general permission but is capital in nature. Capital expenditure is not deductible but will be subject to the normal depreciation rules in subpart EE. If those rules are satisfied, a depreciation loss will be available. Since the 2011-2012 income year, certain buildings and any improvements to those buildings have a 0% depreciation rate. The availability or otherwise of a depreciation loss is outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement. The courts have developed a two-stage approach for determining whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature: • The first stage is to identify the relevant asset that is being repaired or worked on. 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • The second stage is to consider the nature and extent of the work done to that asset (Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,702 (PC)). However in adopting this two-stage approach, the courts are clear that in any particular situation determining whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is capital or revenue in nature depends on the specific facts. The courts favour the approach of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1966\] AC 224 at page 264. That is care must be used in applying the capital/revenue tests, and also in applying case authorities to different circumstances (Auckland Gas (PC)). First stage – identifying the relevant asset As a matter of common sense, in deciding whether the capital limitation applies to any repairs and maintenance expenditure, the asset being worked on must be identified. This is important so an assessment can be made as to whether the work undertaken is of a capital or revenue nature in the context of the asset identified. Identifying the relevant asset is always a question of fact, degree and impression. This is not about finding a profit- earning structure or entity but rather focuses on what the courts have coined the “entirety test” – “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” (Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377, CIR v Auckland Gas Co Ltd (1999) 19 NZTC 15,011 (CA)). When considering whether something is an entirety, guidance may be taken from whether it is an entirety by itself and not a subsidiary part of anything else, and whether the thing is separately identifiable as a principal item of capital equipment. Identifying whether something is itself a separate physical thing or simply a component of a wider asset includes considering whether it is physically and functionally distinct. However, a single asset may be made up of interdependent parts. There is a danger of distortion if too large or too small a subject matter is identified (Poverty Bay Electric v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA)). When considering whether something is a distinct asset it may be helpful to determine whether the thing can be separately identified by physical factors, for example, its location or size (Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 392 (Full Ct HCA), Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 (HC), O’Grady (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Bullcroft Main Collieries Ltd (1932) 17 TC 93 (KB), Samuel Jones & Co (Devondale) Ltd v CIR (1951) 32 TC 513 (IH (1 Div)), Margrett (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Lowestoft Water and Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 (KB)). Something that is physically divisible and distinct from other things might suggest that it is a single asset (Case F67 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,897, O’Grady, Samuel Jones, Margrett). Also, a physical connection between component parts will often be relevant to finding a single asset (Auckland Gas (CA)). Subsidiary parts of an integrated system should be considered part of that system rather than assets in their own right (Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power). Similarly, determining something’s function may also be helpful when identifying the relevant asset being worked on (Auckland Gas (CA), Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power, Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052). A smaller thing that is integral to a larger asset’s ability to physically function is not likely to be the relevant asset (Hawkes Bay Power), while something that is physically capable of separate operation by itself is more likely to be the relevant asset in a repairs and maintenance context (Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power). 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Relationship with the depreciation rules The principles that the courts have developed to identify the relevant asset for repairs and maintenance purposes are the same principles that apply when identifying an item of tangible property for depreciation purposes. This being the case, when it comes to repairs and maintenance expenditure relating to an item of tangible property that is depreciable, the asset for repairs and maintenance purposes will be generally the same item. In the Commissioner’s view, the analysis on how to identify an item of depreciable property in a residential rental property context in IS 10/01: “Residential rental properties – Depreciation of items of depreciable property” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010) is consistent with the analysis in this Interpretation Statement on identifying the relevant asset being repaired or worked on. IS 10/01 provides a three-step test for identifying the item of depreciable property in a residential rental property context. Any asset in a residential rental property identified for depreciation purposes by applying the three-step test in IS 10/01 will be treated by the Commissioner as the relevant asset for repairs and maintenance purposes. As was noted in IS 10/01, similar principles apply when identifying the asset being worked on in a commercial property context. However, the depreciation rules for commercial buildings were amended in 2010 (after IS 10/01 was released) with the intention that items of commercial fit-out be treated as separate items of depreciable property, distinct from the buildings themselves (see the definitions of “building”, “commercial building” and “commercial fit-out” in s YA 1). This means that in the context of commercial fit-out the asset used for depreciation purposes may in some cases be different from the asset identified for repairs and maintenance purposes. It is anticipated that a legislation change will be made to ensure that in the context of commercial fit-out the relevant asset that is used for depreciation purposes will be similarly treated as the asset for repairs and maintenance purposes. It is anticipated that this change will apply retrospectively from the 2011-12 income year. Second stage – nature and extent of work done The second stage, when determining whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is deductible, is to consider whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature in the context of the asset identified as the entirety (Auckland Gas (PC), Lindsay). This is achieved by considering the nature and extent of the work done to the asset. Repairs and maintenance problems affecting assets can be resolved in different ways. For example, an asset may be repaired and restored to an “as new” condition, or substantial parts of an asset may be replaced or an asset may be reconstructed using new and sometimes different materials. For income tax purposes, the deductibility of the expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance depends on a consideration of the nature and extent of the work done to the asset. If the work done to the asset results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, the cost of that work will be capital expenditure (Auckland Gas (PC), Auckland Trotting Club v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 193 (SC), Lurcott v Wakely and Wheeler \[1911\] 1 KB 905). Whether there has been such a substantial reconstruction, replacement or renewal will always be a matter of fact and degree. Expenditure incurred to repair or maintain the asset, over and above making good wear and tear, that has the effect of changing the character of the 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] asset will also be capital expenditure. Expenditure incurred to repair or maintain the asset without replacing, reconstructing or renewing the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, or without changing its character is on revenue account, and is (subject to any other limitations applying) deductible (Auckland Gas (PC)). When determining whether the work done is capital in nature, relevant factors to consider are the nature and the scale of the work done to the asset (Auckland Gas (PC)). Changes to an asset’s value, its earning capacity, its useful life, function or operating capacity, whether or not a goal of the work done, cannot be relied on in isolation to establish the nature of the work done to the asset (Poverty Bay Electric, Highland Railway Co v Balderston (Surveyor of Taxes) (1889) 2 TC 485 (IH (1 Div)), Auckland Gas (PC and CA)). Determining the scale of the work done includes a consideration of the extent of the work done, the importance of the work done to the asset and the business, as well as the cost of the work done (Auckland Gas (PC), Case L68 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,398, Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd ( 1952) 86 CLR 102, Case N8, Hawkes Bay Power). The deferral of repairs will not in itself change the character of repair costs from being deductible expenditure to capital expenditure (Ounsworth (Surveyor of Taxes) v Vickers Ltd \[1915\] 3 KB 267, Rhodesia Railways Ltd v Collector of Income Tax, Bechuanaland Protectorate \[1933\] AC 368 (PC)). Repairs and maintenance work that forms part of one overall project to reconstruct, replace or renew an asset, or substantially the whole of an asset, or to change that asset’s character will likely take its nature from that project. This is regardless of whether that project concerns work done on a single asset or a group of assets (Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 (CA), Hawkes Bay Power, Case X26 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,315). Where repairs and maintenance expenditure is incurred on an ad hoc basis and not as part of one overall plan, the expenditure should take its character from the effect that the work done has on the asset (Sherlaw v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,290 (HC)). It is appropriate and possible in some situations to apportion expenditure between deductible repair costs and non-deductible capital works (Poverty Bay Electric). There is no deduction for a notional amount that might have been spent on repairs had the work been carried out differently (Poverty Bay Electric). No deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred to bring a newly acquired asset up to the condition necessary for it to be used in the taxpayer’s business. Such expenditure forms part of the capital cost of acquiring the asset (Law Shipping Co Ltd v IR Commrs (1930) 12 TC 621 (IH (1 Div))). A deduction may still be allowed for expenditure on repairs to a newly acquired asset if the purchase price of the asset was not affected by the fact that the asset was in a state of disrepair, and when the asset was acquired it could be used as intended despite its state of disrepair (Odeon Associated Theatres Ltd v Jones \[1973\] Ch 288 (CA)). The nature of the expenditure does not change if the repairs are carried out as a result of a significant event, for example fire, flood or earthquake. The same principles must be applied to repairs arising as a result of a significant event as are applied to repairs arising for other reasons (Case F67). The focus is on the work done. 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction Since the Commissioner’s 1994 statement on repairs and maintenance expenditure the courts have heard some significant cases (eg, Auckland Gas), significant events have occurred ( eg , the Christchurch 2010 and 2011 earthquakes) and there has been legislative changes to the depreciation rules. In the Commissioner’s view, all these developments warrant a review of the general principles relating to repairs and maintenance expenditure in New Zealand and the publication of this updated Interpretation Statement. Approach to deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure This Interpretation Statement sets out the Commissioner’s views on the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. Usually this type of expenditure will arise when some work is done to an item of tangible property which may be depreciable property. The structure of the analysis in this Interpretation Statement is based on the general provisions, the traditional capital/revenue cases and the repairs and maintenance case law. The Interpretation Statement begins by establishing that first, for a deduction for repairs and maintenance expenditure to be allowed, the expenditure must be deductible under the general permission. The statement then considers how to determine whether a deduction will be denied by the application of the capital limitation. The statement explains how to identify the asset that is being worked on. Then, once the asset is identified, the statement looks at the principles developed by case law for deciding whether the cost of the work done to that particular asset is capital or revenue in nature. If the work done to the asset has resulted in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, it will be capital expenditure. If the work done to the asset falls short of being a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, then depending on the nature of the work done the expenditure will be either capital or revenue in nature. Generally, work done that goes beyond repairs and changes the character of the asset will be capital, and work done that does not change the character of the asset (and is not a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset) will be revenue. There are some exceptions, for example where the work forms part of one overall project that is capital in nature or the work done relates to the pre- acquisition condition of the asset. If the expenditure is found to be capital in nature a deduction for that expenditure will be denied (assuming no other specific provisions allow for a deduction). If the expenditure is found to be revenue in nature, a deduction for the expenditure will be allowed subject to satisfying any other legislative requirements. 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Flowchart - approach to analysis The following flowchart shows the approach the analysis in this Interpretation Statement takes: As noted earlier, other limitations to the general permission might deny a deduction for repairs and maintenance expenditure (eg, the private limitation in s DA 2(2)). However, this Interpretation Statement is concerned only with the application of the capital limitation to expenditure on repairs and maintenance. Capital expenditure is not deductible but will be subject to the normal depreciation rules in subpart EE. If those rules are satisfied, a depreciation loss will be available. Since the 2011-2012 income year, certain buildings and any improvements to those buildings have a 0% depreciation rate. The availability or otherwise of a depreciation loss is outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement. It is also important to remember when considering the capital/revenue distinction that the answer will always be a matter of fact and degree (BP Australia). Care must be used in applying the capital/revenue tests and also in applying case authorities to different circumstances (Auckland Gas (PC)). 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Relevance of case law decided under previous legislation Until the 1993/94 income year, s 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 governed the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. Section 108 specifically provided for the deduction of amounts spent on repairs and alterations. An extensive body of case law addresses the deductibility (or otherwise) of repairs and maintenance expenditure under this legislation. Since the repeal of s 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976, the deductibility of expenditure on repairs and maintenance has been tested under the general deductibility provisions. The general permission in s DA 1 and the general limitations in s DA 2 apply. However, as said in the Commissioner’s 1994 statement, the body of repairs and maintenance case law that existed before the repeal of s 108 is still relevant. In the Commissioner’s view, in practice what was deductible under the old s 108 and what will be deductible under the general provisions of the ITA 2007 is essentially the same. (The most important difference is that under s 108 expenditure on work done to repair or alter an asset that did not increase the value of that asset was deductible (see the second proviso in s 108). Whereas now under the general provisions expenditure on work done to repair or alter an asset will be deductible only to the extent that the expenditure is not capital in nature.) In the Commissioner’s view, t he cases continue to be relevant to the extent they provide guidance on identifying the particular asset being worked on. This is because identifying the asset continues to be the starting point when approaching the deductibility of any repairs and maintenance expenditure. In addition, many of the well-known repairs and maintenance cases apply the general capital/revenue tests in one form or another. For this reason, in the Commissioner’s view, t he principles established in these cases over the years remain useful in establishing the deductibility of such expenditure, particularly for the analogies they offer and for the distinctions they make between capital and revenue expenditure in repairs and maintenance circumstances. Therefore, in summary, the Commissioner considers that both the general capital/revenue cases (ie, the cases not about repairs and maintenance) and the cases that specifically address repairs and maintenance expenditure, even if decided under repealed legislation, are relevant when determining whether a deduction for repairs and maintenance expenditure is prohibited by the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). Analysis Is the expenditure deductible under the general permission? The first issue to be considered when determining whether expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance is an allowable deduction is whether the expenditure satisfies the general permission for deductions in s DA 1(1). Under the general permission, a deduction is allowed for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred by the taxpayer: • in deriving their assessable income or excluded income or a combination of both (s DA 1(1)(a)); or 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their assessable income or excluded income or a combination of both (s DA 1(1)(b)). Nexus with income The essential feature of s DA 1(1) is the requirement of a nexus between the expenditure and the deriving of assessable income or the carrying on of a business by the taxpayer for the purpose of deriving assessable income. This is referred to as the statutory nexus. The leading cases on deductibility under earlier income tax legislation are CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA). In both cases, the Court of Appeal highlighted the requirement for a statutory nexus to exist between the expenditure incurred and the assessable income or carrying on of a business of the taxpayer in order for the expenditure to be deductible. The Commissioner considers these decisions remain relevant to the interpretation of s DA 1(1). Earlier statutory provisions that correspond to s DA 1(1)(b) referred to “expenditure necessarily incurred in carrying on a business”. Section DA 1 preserves that requirement for nexus, notwithstanding that the word “necessarily” is no longer included. It is the Commissioner’s view that the word “necessarily” did no more than indicate a requirement that there be a sufficient degree of connection between the expenditure and the business. To determine whether the required nexus exists, the true character of the expenditure and its relevance to the taxpayer’s income-earning process must be considered. The factual situation must be considered at the time the expenditure is incurred. The expenditure must be connected to a continuous income-earning process. The continuance of an income-earning process will always be a matter of fact and degree. This means that the longer an asset is not used in an income-producing activity the more difficult it is to demonstrate that there is a sufficient nexus between expenditure on that asset and income from the activity or business (Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer (Surveyor of Taxes) (1910) 5 TC 529, Rhodesia Railways, Case X26). Paragraph (b) of s DA 1, which applies only to taxpayers who are carrying on a business, permits a wider approach than para (a). In contrast to the requirement under para (a), expenditure under para (b) may still be deductible even where that expenditure “... cannot be directly linked to the derivation of assessable income in some positive way, but \[is\] ... made to ... keep the enterprise on foot or reduce expenditure” (Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 (HC) at 9,168). That is, para (b) permits a deduction for expenditure incurred to protect or advance a business or to avoid or reduce expenditure. Paragraph (b) also permits longer-term objectives to be considered (see also Thornton Estates Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,230 (HC)). Examples – nexus with income Example 1 – temporary break in rental activity (sufficient nexus established) Jack owns a rental property. Jack’s tenant has just moved out. Although Jack advertised the property he is experiencing difficulty finding a new tenant. He concludes that the reason he cannot find a new tenant is that the property is too run down. Jack decides to tidy up the property to make it more attractive to potential tenants. The property is temporarily unavailable for rental while Jack arranges to have the property repaired, cleaned, and painted. Once this work has been done 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Jack will look for a new tenant. The expenditure that Jack incurs will have a sufficient nexus to Jack deriving assessable income from his rental activity. Example 2 – repairs made after rental activity ceased (sufficient nexus not established) Tina owned a residential rental property for several years. Two years ago she decided to move into the house and use it as her home. This year she has undertaken repairs on the property and had it fully repainted. Tina seeks to claim a deduction for the cost of the repairs to her house on the basis they related to damage sustained when the house was tenanted. However, the repair costs are not deductible because the rental activity has ceased and the house is no longer being used to derive assessable income. At the time the expenditure was incurred it did not have the necessary nexus to Tina’s assessable income. Does the capital limitation deny a deduction for the expenditure? Having concluded a deduction is available for repairs and maintenance expenditure under the general permission, the next step is to determine whether the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) applies to deny a deduction for the expenditure to the extent to which the expenditure is of a capital nature. If an amount of expenditure is found to be capital in nature, it will not be deductible. The courts have formulated various tests for determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. However, before applying those tests, it is important to consider the approach to be taken when applying those capital/revenue tests in the context of repairs and maintenance expenditure. The courts have used a two-stage approach when determining whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is capital or revenue in nature: • The first stage is to identify the asset that has been worked on . • The second stage is to consider the nature and extent of the work done to that asset. If the work done to the asset indicates that the expenditure is capital in nature, the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) will deny a deduction for that expenditure. This Interpretation Statement now looks in more detail at these two stages. What is the asset being worked on? To establish whether expenditure on repairs or maintenance work is of a capital or revenue nature the first step, as Lord Nicholls stated in Auckland Gas (PC) at 15,706, “is to identify the object to which the test of repair or replacement is being applied”. This is important because then an assessment can be made as to whether the work undertaken is of a capital or revenue nature in the context of the asset identified. Frequently, as Lord Nicholls explains at 15,706, “this is a straightforward exercise and the answer is obvious”. This is demonstrated in cases such as Colonial Motor, Sherlaw and Case X26. In Colonial Motor significant repair work was carried out to an eight-storey warehouse, including earthquake- strengthening and the addition of a storey. The relevant asset in that case was the warehouse. In Sherlaw the taxpayers re-piled and carried out other repair work on a boat-shed. The relevant asset was the boat-shed. Similarly in Case X26, where the taxpayers earthquake-strengthened a heritage building, the relevant asset was the building. However, there will 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] be situations where the answer is not so obvious. In this regard there are several cases where the courts have provided guidance on how to identify what the asset is that is being worked on in a repairs and maintenance context. In Auckland Gas (PC) the taxpayer had major problems with its low-pressure gas-distribution system. The cast iron and steel pipes had leaking joints, corrosion and fracture issues causing significant gas leakage and water entry. By the 1980s, the taxpayer’s system was in a poor state of repair, unreliable and expensive to maintain using a “find and fix” system of repairs as each problem was identified. To rectify these issues the taxpayer introduced a programme of inserting polyethylene piping into its existing cast iron and steel gas pipes. The polyethylene pipes allowed the gas to be transmitted at a higher pressure and were less likely to leak. The only remaining function of the old cast iron and steel pipes was to act as a support conduit for the polyethylene pipes. The issue before the court was whether the expenditure on the insertion of the polyethylene pipes was deductible as repairs. The Privy Council, in identifying the object to which the test of repair or replacement was being applied, found the relevant asset to be the “assemblage of linked pipes whose function was to carry gas from one place to another” that made up Auckland’s gas-distribution system. The asset was not an abstract concept of the gas-distribution system as a functional entity separate from its physical components. The Privy Council went on to hold that, by inserting new pipes, the character of the existing system was changed as the old pipes no longer discharged their original function of carrying gas, and a significant portion of the system was upgraded. As the character of the identified asset (Auckland’s gas-distribution system) had changed substantially, it was found to be capital expenditure. The Privy Council’s reference to “an assemblage of linked pipes” suggests that having a degree of physical connection between component parts is relevant to finding a single asset. Consideration also needs to be given to what the asset’s function is and what items or components are necessary to carry out that function. The “entirety test” – “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” In the Court of Appeal decision in Auckland Gas (which the Privy Council upheld), Blanchard J rejected the “profit-earning entity test” used to identify the asset being worked on by Williams J in the High Court decision (Auckland Gas Company Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,408). Blanchard J noted that this test which concentrated on the relationship of the work to the taxpayer’s income earning activity had been rejected in Auckland Trotting (CA). Instead, the Court of Appeal in Auckland Trotting favoured Kitto J’s approach in the Australian High Court case Li ndsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 of looking for “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. Blanchard J, adopting the words used by the Court of Appeal in the Poverty Bay Electric case (when applying Kitto J’s approach in Lindsay), stated that the correct way to identify the asset being worked on was by inquiry into the totality or entirety of the physical asset in question, pointing out the distortion that can result from misidentification. In Lindsay, Kitto J considered that a slipway ought to be considered an entirety by itself and not a subsidiary part of anything else – the slipway being a physical thing that satisfies a “particular notion” – namely a physical thing that is used for landing (and subsequent launching) of boats and ships 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] for the purpose of repairing them. In reaching his conclusion, Kitto J stated at 384: But where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and for the purpose of deciding that question one asks what is the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit-earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion. \[Emphasis added\] Kitto J also noted it was necessary to consider whether the asset or property is an “entirety by itself” or whether it is a “subsidiary part of anything else” and concluded at 385: I am of opinion that the No. 1 slipway ought to be considered, for the purposes of the question I have to decide, as an entirety by itself, and not as a subsidiary part of anything else. It is separately identifiable as a principal, and indeed the principal, item of capital equipment, so that in a discussion as to whether work done in relation to it constitutes a repair or a renewal in the opposed senses abovementioned, the subject matter in relation to which the choice of description is to be made is the slipway itself, and not any larger thing or aggregation of things of which it may be suggested to form part. \[Emphasis added\] Kitto J considered it was relevant when concluding that the slipway was “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” that the slipway was: • an “entirety by itself” and not a “subsidiary part of something else”; • separately identifiable as a principal item of capital equipment. The first factor, that the slipway was an “entirety by itself”, suggests the slipway was whole or complete in itself rather than being a component part of a larger asset or aggregation of things forming an asset. The second factor is a little less clear. The fact the slipway was “separately identifiable” as a principal item of capital equipment suggests it was important enough to be considered as an asset in its own right and could be distinguished in some way from other items. It is not clear from the judgment what characteristics led the court to its conclusion. A principal item of capital equipment is presumably an asset that is important or fundamental to the taxpayer’s business (that being the ordinary meaning of “principal”). However, several possible characteristics could make such an item “separately identifiable”. For example, an item of equipment could be separately identifiable because it is a functioning unit in its own right. Alternatively, it could be separately identifiable because of physical characteristics, such as not being physically attached to other items or having physical characteristics that differ from those of other items. It may be that all of these are relevant aspects to be taken into account. Later cases discuss this factor (or similar factors) in more detail. Lindsay was appealed to the Full High Court ((1961) 106 CLR 392) who agreed with the decision of Kitto J, stating at 393: The entirety, it is said, consisted, either, of the whole of the partnership’s premises on which its business was conducted and in connexion with which the slipway was used or, alternatively, of a number of what were called components and which together were said to constitute the slipway. These components are identified as the slip, the cradle employed upon it, the hauling machine by which the cradle is moved and the dolphins and warping winches by means of which vessels are manoeuvred onto the cradle. This method of approach to the problem was rejected by the learned judge of first instance and we have no doubt that he was right. It would be artificial in the extreme to approach the problem in either of the suggested ways for the slipway was, in itself, a very substantial erection and the real question for decision was whether the work which was done was done in the execution of repairs to it. As 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] we see the problem the answer to this question could not be affected by the fact that there were other buildings or erections on the appellant’s premises or by the fact that, on the premises, there were appurtenances, such as those described, for use in connexion with the slipway. \[Emphasis added\] The above quotation suggests the High Court was influenced in its decision by the fact the slipway was a substantial structure in its own right. Applying the “entirety test” The taxpayer in Auckland Trotting (CA) claimed expenditure on the demolition of a trotting track and the construction of a replacement track on the same site as repairs or alterations to the “premises” of the club under s 113(1) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. The taxpayer contended that the “premises” of the club subject to the repairs and alterations was the whole of the club’s complex of buildings and improvements and not just the trotting track. The Court of Appeal disagreed and, applying the “entirety test” from Li ndsay, found that the “premises” of the club on which the repair work was to be evaluated was just the track. It is noted that the court in Auckland Trotting (CA) considered how the repairs and alterations undertaken by the club applied to “premises”. However, in doing so, the court still had to work out a means of determining what the “entirety” was before it could evaluate whether the work carried out on that “entirety” was repair work to premises. Therefore, in that regard, the finding of the court in Auckland Trotting (CA) is considered still relevant in a repairs and maintenance context under the current legislation. The Court of Appeal in Poverty Bay Electric considered whether expenditure incurred in replacing overhead electricity lines with underground cables was expenditure on “repairs or alterations”. T he court discussed the importance of correctly identifying the subject matter of the expenditure and noted the implications of incorrectly identifying the asset (in the context of repairs and maintenance). The court then discussed the relevant asset in the case at hand. In doing so the court warned of the danger of distortion if too large or too small a subject matter was identified, stating at 15,006: If a subsidiary part of an asset is regarded as the subject matter and that part has been replaced, there might be a tendency to classify what has occurred as a matter of capital. That could lead to an absurd result, for example, treating the replacement of a car tyre or a spark plug as a capital improvement when, if the subject matter is correctly seen as the whole of the motor vehicle, the work is obviously a repair involving a replacement of a mere component, even a vital component and even if an improved or modified version of that component is substituted. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court’s finding that the relevant asset was the Gisborne urban reticulation system (rather than the wider Poverty Bay reticulation system) (Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,779 (HC)). However, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court’s suggestion that each separate section of the line could also be viewed as a separate asset. This was because each separate section of line was part of an integrated system and incapable of separate operation. This strongly suggests it is relevant to the entirety test whether an asset can function by itself (ie, it includes all the parts that are necessary for it to function). Similarly, it is relevant whether subsidiary parts of an “integrated system” should be considered part of that system rather than assets in their own right. 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, the Court of Appeal also warned against taking this inquiry too far where a “substantial capital work by an individual electricity supply authority might be made to appear so relatively minor as to be thought a matter of repair only” (at 15,007). In other words, if the subject matter is seen as being too broad, then substantial capital work that forms part of the total subject matter could be seen as merely a repair to the whole. Conversely, if a subsidiary part of an asset is regarded as the subject matter and that part has been replaced, there might be a tendency to classify what has occurred as a matter of capital. That could lead to an absurd result. A replacement of a mere component, even a vital component, may still be correctly classified as a repair. In concluding that the relevant asset was the Gisborne urban reticulation system, the Court of Appeal considered it relevant that the system was clearly distinguishable in engineering terms from the rest of the Poverty Bay network, in that “\[i\]t could be switched (or isolated by electrical means) from the rest of the Poverty Bay network” (at 15,007). In Hawkes Bay Power the court considered the issue of whether expenditure incurred in replacing overhead electricity lines with underground cables was expenditure on “repairs or alterations”. Goddard J, no ting that the starting point is identifying the “nature of the relevant asset”, applied the “entirety test” from Lindsay (at 13,700–13,701). Goddard J, in applying the analysis from Lindsay, determined that the urban residential distribution system constituted the relevant asset by finding it was: • a physical thing that satisfied a particular notion, • an entirety by itself and not a subsidiary part of anything else, and • a separately identified principal item of capital equipment. The “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” was the network of transformers and distributors that supplied electricity to domestic consumers in a certain area. This suggests that the inquiry is focused on a physical thing (ie, the electricity network) that carries out a particular function (ie, the supply of electricity). Further, a particular part of the network (the urban residential distribution system) was found to be the relevant asset because it was “physically capable of being separately and independently installed underground without recourse to or effect upon the other areas which the distribution system satisfies” (at 13,701). Consequently, it was found to be an entirety by itself and not merely a subsidiary part of a larger distribution system. Goddard J found this to be the case even though the urban residential distribution system “could not operate as an independent entity” (if disconnected from the national grid) and was “not an entire profit-earning structure” (at 13,701). It is clear from this that in defining an asset, it is not necessary that everything required to earn a profit from it is included. Regarding the “separately identifiable as a principal item” inquiry, Goddard J noted that the urban residential distribution system was separately identified by customer type and area and that its separateness was further identified by the fact most of it was underground. In this regard, customer area and type distinguished “urban residential” from “urban industrial” and “rural” customers. It appears Goddard J was primarily concerned with physical factors, such as location, when determining whether two items were separately identifiable. 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] With regard to whether the “distribution system” was a principal item of capital equipment in itself, Goddard J noted that the sheer scale of the cost involved in putting the network underground, the comparative cost with overhead lines, and the extent of the system that had been put underground led “to the irrefutable conclusion” that the system was “a principal item of capital equipment” (at 13,701). Goddard J also found that the distribution transformers that were replaced during the course of the conversion to underground lines were a part of the distribution system (the relevant asset in the case). This was because they were an integral part of the distribution system as a whole. The transformers were necessary for the network to reticulate. This suggests items that are integral to an asset’s ability to fulfil its physical function (in this case the supply of electricity) tend to be a subsidiary part of the asset. In Case F67 the taxpayers carried on business as hotel proprietors. Part of the hotel’s business was a two-storey ed rental building adjoining the hotel. The lower floor of the building was divided into two shops and the upper floor into two flats. The building was on one title and the taxpayers insured and administered the property as one building. The shops were leased out as a pizza parlour and a knick-knack shop. The upstairs flats were leased as residential flats to the respective shop lessees. The taxpayers carried out significant repair work after a fire extensively damaged the building. The taxpayers claimed a deduction against their income for the portion of the repairs that insurance did not cover. Judge Barber disallowed the deduction on the basis that it was capital expenditure. In reaching his decision, Judge Barber identified that the building was the relevant asset rather than the individual shops and flats within the building. This was because the taxpayers jointly owned the land and building on one title and insured and administered the property as one building. The fact the building was internally partitioned did not change Judge Barber’s finding that the building as a whole was the relevant asset. Case N8 is an example of a situation where the court had to consider whether an aggregation of things made up a single asset. The taxpayer was a substantial manufacturer and supplier of ready-mixed concrete. The case concerned quite substantial works undertaken in relation to a ready-mixed concrete “batching plant”. The taxpayer contended that the whole entity was the batching plant (which comprised the ground storage bins; the conveyor and a square-shaped tower; the associated water and electrical equipment and supply; and the dispatch office, control room and dispatch facilities) and that each item of expenditure was for repairs or maintenance in relation to that whole. (The plant was situated on premises that consisted of several acres of land, an office and administrative building, a laboratory, a control and supervisor’s office, yards, a truck parking and washing area, and used equipment and storage yards, in addition to the batching plant.) The Commissioner argued the plant should not be seen as one entity, but rather that each individual element should be addressed to consider whether there had been a repair, renewal or replacement. It was further contended that if the plant was a single entity, then the work was of such an extent, size and amount that the expenditure was of a capital nature. Having comprehensively reviewed the nature of the taxpayer’s business and the various items of expenditure, Judge Bathgate turned to consider what was the relevant asset or entity against which to consider the nature of the expenditure, noting at 3,070: 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] I find there were two entities involved in the work. The first and obvious is that which stores, conveys, mixes and produces the materials making up and contained in the final ready mixed concrete as supplied by the objector. That entity is physically attached or joined, or so far as the materials are concerned, it is continuously involved in the one process of manufacturing ready mixed concrete. To identify any one part and single it out for separate treatment as an individual item would be unrealistic in this context. It is a composite whole. If a motor car has a new spark plug installed in the place of an existing spark plug, so far as the motorist is concerned that is work undertaken in the course of repair or maintenance of the motor car, and is not a renewal of the spark plug as a capital item. It is a question of fact, degree and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity for present purposes. The entity in the example given is the motor car. If the gearbox was replaced, that may be a repair, but if the engine were replaced, that would seem more like a capital item. I consider the supervisor's office, the dispatch office and the control room, which were all housed in a separate and detached building from the ground bins, elevators and tower, to be a separate and distinct entity from the ground bins, elevators and tower plus its contents. The only connection between the two were the electrical wiring connections and the less tangible connections of electrical controls, administration and supervision from one to the other. \[Emphasis added\] Judge Bathgate identified two separate entities as being the relevant assets. The first entity being the things attached to each other that stored, conveyed, mixed and produced the materials making up and contained in the ready-mixed concrete. The other entity being the separately housed control room and the dispatch and supervisor’s offices. Even though the two entities were connected, Judge Bathgate placed importance on the fact they were physically and functionally distinct from each other. Judge Bathgate continued at 3,071: Different functions, although associated functions, were carried out in the two entities. The first was the entity handling the raw materials that were manufactured into ready mixed concrete. The second was more in the nature of an administrative office which controlled and supervised the functions of the first entity. Overseas authorities The New Zealand courts have taken guidance from overseas authorities when identifying the asset being worked on in a repair and maintenance context. Three cases often referred to are O’Grady, Samuel Jones and Margrett. In O'Grady the taxpayer built a replacement chimney stack. The chimney was constructed to do the work of the old chimney, which was to carry away smoke and fumes from the furnaces that raise steam and power for colliery purposes. Rowlatt J found the chimney stack to be the relevant asset. Consequently, the expenditure on building the chimney stack was found to be capital. Rowlatt J (referring to Lurcott) said at 101: As regards the chimney, I think it is really very clear. Of course every repair is a replacement. You repair a roof by putting on new slates instead of old ones, which you throw away. There is no doubt about that. But the critical matter is ... what is the entirety? The slate is not the entirety in the roof. You are repairing the roof by putting in new slates. What is the entirety? If you replace in entirety, it is having a new one and it is not repairing an old one. I think it is very largely a question of degree. ... This was a factory chimney to which the gases and fumes, and so on, were led by flues and then went up the chimney. It was unsafe and would not do any more. What they did was simply this: They built a new chimney at a little distance away in another place; they put flues to that chimney and then, when it was finished, they switched the gases from the old flues into the new flues and so up 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the new chimney. I do not think it is possible to regard that as repairing a subsidiary part of the factory. I think it is simply having a new one. And they had them both. Perhaps they pulled down the old one; perhaps they kept it, because they thought it was an artistic thing to look at. There is no accounting for tastes in manufacturing circles. Anyhow, they simply built a new chimney and started to use that one instead of the old one. I think the chimney is the entirety here and they simply renewed it. \[Emphasis added\] Rowlatt J f ound as a matter of fact that the chimney was not a subsidiary part of the colliery. That Rowlatt J noted the chimney was built a little distance away at another place could suggest that the new chimney was physically separate from the rest of the factory and that this influenced his decision. The later decision Samuel Jones, also concerned the building of a replacement chimney stack. In this case, the taxpayer processed paper using a large group of buildings with the power being supplied by a steam plant that discharged into a chimney. The chimney was in a dangerous state of repair and was replaced by a new chimney. The new chimney was erected close to the existing chimney, which was demolished once the new chimney could take over the old chimney’s function. Both the old and new chimneys were part of the structure of the main factory block. The Court of Session found the chimney to be an inseparable and necessary part of a larger entity, the factory. This meant the factory rather than the chimney stack was the relevant asset to which the test of repair or replacement could be applied. T he court found the expenditure on the chimney to be of a revenue nature. The court also noted it was influenced in its decision by the fact the expense incurred in taking down the old chimney and building the substitute was only 2% of the value of the factory. Lord President Cooper stated at 518): ...but so far as this case is concerned the facts seem to me to demonstrate beyond a doubt that the chimney with which we are concerned is physically, commercially and functionally an inseparable part of an “entirety”, which is the factory. It is quite impossible to describe this chimney as being in the words of Rowlatt, J, the “entirety” with which we are concerned. It is doubtless an indispensable part of the factory, doubtless an integral part; but none the less a subsidiary part, and one of many subsidiary parts, of a single industrial profit-earning undertaking. \[Emphasis added\] It is considered that his Lordship’s reference to the chimney being “commercially ... inseparable” does not suggest his Lordship considered that an item must be an entire profit-making structure to be the relevant asset. Rather his Lordship’s reference to “commercially ... inseparable” was intended to refer to what a person in business would regard as necessary for the factory to be considered as complete. Even if his Lordship was suggesting this, the New Zealand courts (as seen in Auckland Trotting (SC and CA) and Hawkes Bay Power) have clearly rejected a profit-earning structure test as a means of identifying the asset in a repairs and maintenance context. The decision of the court in Samuel Jones contrasts with that in O’Grady where the chimney was found to be the relevant asset. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue in Samuel Jones argued they were unable to distinguish the facts in that case from those in O’Grady. In considering this point, Lord President Cooper referred to the comment made by Rowlatt J in O’Grady that “the critical matter is ... what is the entirety? ... I think it is very largely a question of degree” (see above at paragraph \[ 88\] of this statement). His Lordship found at 518 that “it \[was not\] part of our duty to review the decision of Rowlatt J, as applied to the facts in the O’Grady case, but so far as this case is concerned the facts seem to demonstrate ... the chimney ... is 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ... part of an entirety”. In this regard, h is Lordship demonstrates that identifying the relevant asset in any given case will always involve consideration of the specific facts of that case at hand. Although not clearly stated by his Lordship, t he distinguishing fact between the cases seems to be that in Samuel Jones the chimney was physically connected to the main factory building, while in O’Grady t he chimney built was larger, situated a little distance away at another place and was not physically connected to any other structure. Whether assets were separately identifiable because of physical characteristics also appears to have been a deciding factor i n Margrett. In Margrett, the taxpayer company owned an old reservoir that was built in 1856 and had deteriorated to such an extent that it was not worth repairing. A new reservoir (which was twice the capacity of and a significant improvement on the old reservoir) was constructed in 1931 on a site away from the old reservoir. The court had to decide whether the expenditure on building the new reservoir was capital expenditure or money “expended for repairs of premises occupied”. The court examined the physical nature and physical distinctiveness of the reservoir to decide whether it was a separate asset or part of a larger asset (the water tower). Finlay J stated at 488: Now here the subject matter under discussion seems to me to be the reservoir, and I cannot think that it is material, though it is undoubtedly the fact, that the reservoir is part only of the Respondents’ whole physical undertaking. It is a part perfectly clearly divisible from the rest, and it is the part with which we are dealing here. If authority were needed for that I should find it in the decision of Mr. Justice Rowlatt, to which I referred a moment ago, of O’Grady v. Bullcroft Main Collieries, Ltd, because the reservoir here is more clearly a separate and distinct thing than was the chimney in O’Grady v. Bullcroft Main Collieries, Ltd. \[Emphasis added\] Therefore, when determining whether assets are physically distinct, a practical and visual inquiry can be an appropriate consideration. Key points on identifying the asset being worked on The Commissioner takes the following key points from the cases on identifying the asset being worked on: • The “first step is to identify the object to which the test of repair or replacement is being applied”. In other words, what is the asset that it is relevant to consider? (Auckland Gas (PC)) • Identifying the asset is not about identifying the profit-earning structure or entity; rather it is about identifying a “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. The fact a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other things or business systems does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset. (Lindsay (HCA), Hawkes Bay Power, Auckland Gas (CA)) • A single asset may be made up of interdependent parts. There is a danger of distortion if too large or too small a subject matter is identified. For example, if a subsidiary part of an asset is regarded as the subject matter and that part has been replaced, there might be a tendency to classify what has occurred as a matter of capital. If the subject matter is too broad then every replacement of a single unit 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] that forms part of the total subject matter could be seen as merely a repair to the whole. (Poverty Bay Electric) • It is always a question of fact, degree and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset. However, the focus remains on the “entirety test” – “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” (Lindsay (HCA), Auckland Trotting (CA), Hawkes Bay Power, Case N8). When considering whether something is “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” the courts are guided by whether the thing would be: - an entirety by itself and not a part of an asset or aggregation of things forming an asset; - separately identifiable as a principal item of capital equipment. • Identifying whether a part of a wider asset is itself a separate physical thing or simply a component of a wider asset includes considering whether the item is physically and functionally distinct (Case N8). It may be helpful to see whether something can be separately identified by physical factors, for example its location or size (Lindsay (Full Ct HCA), Hawkes Bay Power, O’Grady, Samuel Jones, Margrett). Something that is physically divisible and distinct from other things may suggest that it is a single asset (Case F67, O’Grady, Samuel Jones, Margrett). A physical connection between component parts will often be relevant to finding a single asset (Auckland Gas (CA)). Subsidiary parts of an integrated system should be considered as part of that system rather than assets in their own right (Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power). • Looking to see what the asset’s function is and what parts or components are necessary for the asset to carry out that function may be helpful when identifying the relevant asset (Auckland Gas (CA), Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power, Case N8). Something that is integral to a larger asset’s ability to physically function is not likely to be the relevant asset (Hawkes Bay Power). Alternatively something that is physically capable of separate operation by itself is more likely to be the relevant asset in a repairs and maintenance context (Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power). Examples – identifying the asset being worked on Example 3 – reconditioned car engine (subsidiary part of a larger asset) Frank is an owner-operator taxi driver. He has driven the same taxi for the past 5 years. Until recently the taxi has been reliable and overall is in good condition. Frank has had his taxi serviced regularly but his mechanic has advised him that the engine is now seriously worn. The mechanic recommends that the worn engine be replaced with a reconditioned engine. The asset in this case is the taxi. The engine is a subsidiary part of that asset, and is physically and functionally connected to that larger asset. The engine is integral to the taxi. Example 4 – loan trailer (asset as entirety) Hedgy Landscape Supplies owns trailers that it makes available for its customers to use. Sometimes the company also uses the trailers for making deliveries. The deck of one trailer needs repairing. The trailer is the asset being repaired. It is the entirety and not a subsidiary part of something else. The trailer has all the necessary parts to function and is a composite whole. 20 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Relationship with depreciation rules The principles that the courts have developed to identify the relevant asset for repairs and maintenance purposes are the same principles that apply when identifying an item of tangible property for depreciation purposes. This being the case, when it comes to repairs and maintenance expenditure relating to an item of tangible property that is depreciable, the asset for repairs and maintenance purposes will be generally the same item. In 2010 the Commissioner published an Interpretation Statement IS 10/01 “Residential rental properties – Depreciation of items of depreciable property”. IS 10/01 sets out how to determine whether an item in a residential rental property is a separate item of depreciable property or is part of the residential building. In the Commissioner’s view, the analysis in IS 10/01 on how to identify an item of depreciable property in a residential rental property context is consistent with the analysis in this statement on identifying the relevant asset being worked on or repaired. IS 10/01 concluded that if an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and it meets the definition of “depreciable property”, it may be separately depreciated. If an item is found to be part of the building, it cannot be separately depreciated. In its analysis, IS 10/01 relied on the same repairs and maintenance cases as those relied on by this statement. IS 10/01 also provides specific guidance in the form of a three- step test on how to determine whether a particular thing is a separate item of depreciable property or is part of the residential rental property. The Commissioner considers that any outcomes reached by applying the three- step test in IS 10/01 will be consistent with the outcomes reached by applying this Interpretation Statement. Any asset in a residential rental property identified for depreciation purposes by applying the three-step test in IS 10/01 will be accepted by the Commissioner as the relevant asset when considering the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. As was noted in IS 10/01, similar principles apply when identifying the asset being worked on in a commercial property context. However, the depreciation rules for commercial buildings were amended in 2010 (after IS 10/01 was released) with the intention that commercial fit-outs be treated as separate items of depreciable property, distinct from the buildings themselves (see the definitions of “building”, “commercial building” and “commercial fit-out” in s YA 1). This means that in the context of commercial fit-out the asset used for depreciation purposes may in some cases be different from the asset identified for repairs and maintenance purposes. It is anticipated that a legislation change will be made to ensure that in the context of commercial fit-out the relevant asset that is used for depreciation purposes will be similarly treated as the asset for repairs and maintenance purposes. It is anticipated that this change will apply retrospectively from the 2011-12 income year. What is the nature and extent of the work done to the asset? Once the relevant asset being worked on has been identified, the second stage in the enquiry as to whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is deductible is to consider the nature and extent of the work done to the particular asset. If the nature and extent of the work done to the asset indicates the expenditure is capital in nature the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) will deny a deduction for that expenditure. The general capital/revenue cases and the more specific repairs and maintenance cases provide guidance in this second stage of the enquiry. 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] General capital/revenue cases The accepted approach for determining whether any outgoing is of a capital or revenue nature is outlined in BP Australia Ltd v FCT. The BP Australia approach was confirmed as being the preferred approach in New Zealand in the leading decision of CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5, 233 (CA). While not addressing the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure, McKenzies provides guidance on the factors the courts take into account when deciding whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. In McKenzies the Court of Appeal said at 5,236: In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp 264-265: “The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: ‘depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process.’ per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in a particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken.” Amongst the factors weighed by the judicial committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. The Court of Appeal in McKenzies noted the Privy Council decision in BP Australia had been recognised in New Zealand in CIR v LD Nathan and Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209 (CA) and in Buckley & Young. Gallen J in Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206 (HC) adopted the principles from BP Australia, which Richardson J summarised in McKenzies. From these leading New Zealand cases seven tests have been identified to assist in determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. The courts have considered some of these tests to be more relevant than others. In addition, the tests may point in different directions when applied. As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in Auckland Gas ( PC) comments at 15,707, the tests need to be applied so as to enable the dominant features which guide to a reasoned conclusion to be identified. The tests are: 22 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • The need or occasion that calls for the expenditure: This test focuses on the principal reason or need for incurring the expenditure. In the context of this test the object of the expenditure is determined by looking not at the actual thing achieved, but at the reason or need for making the expenditure. Clear and accurate application of this test is important because it will often form the basis for applying the other capital/revenue tests. The Commissioner considers this test to be important in the context of repairs and maintenance expenditure; the focus is on why this work was done in this way at this time. • Whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature: This test involves a consideration of whether the expenditure is recurrent or a once and for all payment. If the expenditure is recurrent and made to meet a continuous demand, this suggests the payment is part of the cost of ordinary business operations and will be a revenue outlay; capital expenditure is more likely to be spent once and for all. To some extent this test holds true for repairs and maintenance purposes. However, the Commissioner considers the usefulness of the once and for all test is limited as a capital indicator in some repair circumstances. This is because frequently repair work, by its nature, might be unplanned or the result of unexpected damage. Repairs and maintenance work that is undertaken regularly on a recurring basis is likely to be revenue expenditure. • Whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital: This test focuses on whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital, rather than whether the payment affects the fixed or circulating capital of the business in question. This test is not as useful as other tests in determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature because of the ease with which a taxpayer can choose between financing an asset from circulating capital or financing it from fixed capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset financed. This test has been questioned judicially (Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 (HC), CIR v Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,834 (HC)). In the context of repairs and maintenance expenditure, the test has less relevance because how work is funded is not a reliable indicator of its nature. • Whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset: This test indicates that expenditure will be on capital account where an asset of a capital nature has been acquired by the expenditure, or where money is spent on improving an asset or making it more advantageous. Work done to an asset will sometimes result in a new identifiable asset, for example where the work done results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset or substantially the whole of the asset. Similarly, where the work done involves the alteration or extension of an asset the identifiable asset test may be satisfied. • Whether the expenditure is a once and for all payment producing assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit: Under this test, expenditure will be regarded as capital where it brings into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business. This test is one of the more relevant and persuasive tests for deciding whether expenditure is on capital or revenue account. However, in the context of repairs and maintenance expenditure, it is often a difficult test to apply, as nearly every repair done to an asset will result in some form of enduring benefit. T he Commissioner considers that the more relevant enquiry is the one developed in the 23 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] repairs and maintenance line of cases as to whether the work done has resulted in a change in the character of the asset being worked on. If a change of character has occurred, then in most situations that will also result in an advantage of an enduring benefit being produced. This “change of character” test is discussed in more detail later. • Whether the expenditure is on the business structure or business process: This test focuses on the distinction between expenditure on the business structure set up for the earning of profit, and expenditure on the process by which such a business operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay. This test is also one of the more relevant and persuasive tests used to determine whether expenditure is on capital or revenue account. In a repairs and maintenance expenditure context, the deductibility enquiry usually focuses more on the asset being worked on than the business overall. However, in the Commissioner’s view the business structure test may still be a relevant indicator of capital expenditure, particularly in circumstances where the asset being worked on is an integral part of the business and the loss or enhancement of that asset would affect the business structure. • What the treatment of the expenditure is according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting: The test of applying ordinary principles of commercial accounting to the expenditure, although of some assistance, is not usually determinative. It needs to be remembered that tax and accounting have different aims, and the treatment for one may differ from the treatment for the other. While this test is often used to support an approach that the other tests have come to, it is not a sufficiently conclusive test by itself to determine the issue of whether the expenditure is on capital or revenue account. The Commissioner acknowledges that for some businesses the accounting treatment required for repairs and maintenance expenditure can be quite different from the tax treatment required for that same expenditure. This makes it even more difficult to rely on accounting treatment as an indicator of the appropriate tax treatment of repairs and maintenance expenditure. Therefore, in the context of repairs and maintenance expenditure, some of these general capital/revenue tests will usually be of greater relevance than others. For example, when considering the deductibility of costs to earthquake-strengthen a building, Judge Barber in Case X26 relied on the identifiable asset test, the enduring benefit test and the business structure test to decide whether the costs were capital or revenue in nature. At \[16\] Judge Barber stated: I agree ... that the disputant’s expenditure is clearly on capital account and was to bring into existence advantages of a lasting character which improved an identifiable asset, ie the property, as part of the disputant’s partnership’s income earning structure (as distinct from income earning process). Case X26, which was decided in 2006 in the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority, is the first and only reported decision to address the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure since the relevant legislative changes in 1994. Although of limited precedential value given the level of jurisdiction, the Commissioner considers the correct approach to the application of the capital/revenue tests was adopted in this decision. Repairs and maintenance cases While the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure is solely a question of whether the costs are capital or revenue in nature, the 24 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Commissioner considers it remains appropriate to supplement the general capital/revenue tests with the body of cases that specifically address the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. The repairs and maintenance cases can help taxpayers decide whether expenditure incurred on work done to an asset is capital or revenue in nature. This is despite most of the repairs and maintenance cases being decided under different legislation or in different jurisdictions. It is also despite it sometimes being difficult to extract precise principles from the repairs and maintenance cases where the courts have applied a combination of the traditional capital/revenue tests together with repairs and maintenance concepts to individual fact situations. Nonetheless, when considering the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure, t he Commissioner considers that, when applied carefully, the specific repairs and maintenance cases frequently offer the best guidance on the boundaries between deductible repairs and maintenance expenditure and repairs and maintenance expenditure of a capital nature. Analysis of case law Has the work done resulted in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset? As a starting point when deciding whether the cost of work done to an identified asset is deductible as revenue expenditure, the first consideration is whether the work done has resulted in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset. If it has, then the work done will be capital in nature. This is consistent with the “identifiable asset test” in BP Australia - where the work done results in the creation of a new identifiable asset the expenditure incurred is capital expenditure. One of the earliest authorities used to support this repairs and maintenance principle is Lurcott. While this case was not an income tax case, and therefore it does not address the capital or revenue nature of work done, it does support the principle that the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of an asset, or substantially the whole of an asset is capital expenditure. The case considered the recovery of the cost of replacing a wall that formed part of a building. The whole building was identified as the asset, and the work done to that building by replacing a wall was considered only to be a repair and not a renewal of the building. As a result, under the lessee’s covenant to repair, the cost of the work done to the building was found to be recoverable from the tenant. Lord Buckley commented on the difference between a repair and a renewal at 923: “Repair” and “renew” are not words expressive of a clear contrast. Repair always involves renewal; renewal of a part; of a subordinate part. A skylight leaks; repair is effected by hacking out the putties, putting in new ones, and renewing the paint. A roof falls out of repair; the necessary work is to replace the decayed timbers by sound wood; to substitute sound tiles or slates for those which are cracked, broken, or missing; to make good the flashings, and the like. Part of a garden wall tumbles down; repair is effected by building it up again with new mortar, and, so far as necessary, new bricks or stone. Repair is restoration by renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole. Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole but substantially the whole subject-matter under discussion. \[Emphasis added\] This principle from Lurcott has been applied by the New Zealand courts in deciding whether expenditure has been incurred on the replacement or repair of an asset, and therefore whether the expenditure was capital or 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] revenue. The Court of Appeal in Auckland Trotting upheld Moller J’s decision in the Supreme Court that the construction of a new track in place of an old track was not a repair and therefore the cost of the work done was capital expenditure. Moller J in Auckland Trotting Club v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1968\] NZLR 193 (SC) at 205 held: Having reached this decision \[that the track was the asset\] I revert back to the work done in respect of it, and find, on all the evidence available, that the amount sought to be deducted by the club was incurred not by way of "repair" or "alteration", but by the construction of what was substantially a new track in place of what was, substantially, the whole of the 1960 track. In the Court of Appeal Richmond J supported Moller J’s finding and held at 980 that: In the result, the appellant has failed in my opinion to show that the work of replacing the original shell track by a new track of greater depth and constructed substantially of new materials is either a repair or alteration of premises. In Hawkes Bay Power Goddard J was satisfied the work Hawkes Bay Power did to its urban residential distribution system, although carried out on a job by job basis over many years, was a total reconstruction project that resulted in the creation of a new asset. At 13,707, she concluded as point seven in her summary that: The result in the present case is that substantially the whole of the urban residential distribution system has been placed underground. It follows therefore that the urban residential system is a new and different distribution system; not a repaired system. Thus, Hawkes Bay Power has acquired by its expenditure a “new” underground urban residential distribution system. As noted in Auckland Trotting (SC) and Hawkes Bay Power, c apital expenditure does not only arise when an asset is completely reconstructed, replaced or renewed. Capital expenditure may also arise when substantially the whole of the asset is reconstructed, replaced or renewed. This point is further illustrated by the decision in Case J92 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,518. This case concerned repairs and maintenance work done to a farm homestead. Some structural parts of the house were retained but there was substantial replacement of framework, linings, interior joinery, plumbing and wiring as well as re-piling and extensive exterior cladding. The taxpayer argued there had not been a complete replacement of the original ho mestead and that much of the original structure remained. This distinguished it from the new track in Auckland Trotting (SC and CA). However, Judge Barber found the building work done was so extensive it could not be regarded as repairs. The work involved the complete reconstruction of the homestead. At 1,522 Barber J stated: After a careful analysis and consideration of the evidence I find the building work undertaken by the objector on the homestead was so extensive that it cannot be regarded as “repairs or alterations”. The work involved the complete reconstruction of the homestead and, in my view, the expenditure was of a capital nature and was incurred in the improvement of the premises from a capital point of view. The work done to the asset must be looked at in its totality to decide whether the work done is so substantial that the whole, or substantially the whole of the asset is reconstructed, replaced or renewed. This can include looking at the work done over more than one income year as was the case in Auckland Gas, Poverty Bay Electric and Hawkes Bay Power. Blanchard J noted at 15,024 of Auckland Gas (CA): 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The work done in a particular year is properly to be seen in its overall context, which was of an ongoing programme to replace all the low-pressure system as a conveyor of gas. The question is: what was being achieved? A taxpayer cannot by artificially treating as separate works portions of an overall programme done in separate income years deny the reality or minimise the extent of what is being effected. A decision as to whether the work done to the asset is so substantial that the whole, or substantially the whole, of the asset is reconstructed, replaced or renewed may not always be easy. However, it is a judgement that needs to be made, especially when components of an asset are renewed instead of simply being kept in a serviceable condition. Some of the factors the courts have taken into account when making such judgements are set out later in this Interpretation Statement at paragraph \[ 160\] under the heading “Scale of the work done”. These factors include indicators such as the extent of the work done to the asset, the size and importance of the replacement parts to the asset and the cost of the work done. This enquiry will always be a matter of fact and degree. However, when determining whether expenditure for work done to an asset is capital or revenue in nature, it is not enough only to determine whether the work done to an asset has reconstructed, replaced or renewed the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset. The cost of the work done will still be capital expenditure if it has the effect of changing the character of the asset. This issue is discussed next. Has the work done changed the character of the asset? Where repair work done to an asset falls short of being a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the identified asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, then further analysis on the effect of the work done on the character of the asset is required to determine whether the costs are capital or revenue in nature. By character of the asset, what is being referred to is the asset’s distinct nature. In Auckland Gas (PC) Lord Nicholls clarified that it is not right to presume that the cost of work done to an asset is deductible as “repairs” where that work falls short of resulting in a reconstruction, renewal or replacement of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset. Simply put, Lord Nicholls acknowledged that sometimes the work done may well be repairs or maintenance and deductible, but that will not necessarily be the case in every situation. He considered that sometimes repair work can be capital in nature. Lord Nicholls noted that authority on the distinction between “repair” and “ replacement” is only of limited assistance and that some objects do not lend themselves easily to this “exercise in characterisation”. He commented at 15 ,706: Authority on the question of repair or replacement is of limited assistance. The physical objects to which the test of repair has to be applied vary widely. So does the nature of the work done. Judicial dicta applicable to one set of circumstances may be unhelpful or misleading when applied in different circumstances. This is true even of the celebrated observation of Buckley LJ in Lurcott v Wakely & Wheeler \[1911\] 1 KB 905 at p 294 .... His Lordship considered that in cases where the work done to an asset falls short of being a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, the important consideration for determining the nature of the expenditure is “ the effect of the work on the character of the object”. Lord Nicholls stated at 15,706: ... sometimes repair may not be the appropriate description of work even though it falls far short of being a replacement of substantially the whole of the relevant 27 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] subject-matter. The effect of the work on the character of the object is also an important consideration. If the work done to an asset has the effect of changing its character it will be capital expenditure. If the work done to the asset does not have the effect of changing the character of the asset the cost of the work done will be revenue in nature and deductible. Lord Nicholls went on to identify two factors as being relevant when deciding whether the work done to an asset has the effect of changing the character of the asset: the nature and the scale of the work done. His Lordship stated at 15,707: If a significant portion of this series of linked pipes is effectively abandoned and replaced wholesale with new pipes, the work may readily go beyond what would normally be regarded as repair of the existing system. This is especially so if the new pipes are made from materials which perform differently from the old ones. The work may be of such a nature and scale as to change the character of the existing system. This is to be contrasted with replacing or making good specific leaking pipes or joints. The latter would be repair, the former would do more than repair what was damaged. \[Emphasis added\] In Auckland Gas (PC) it was found that as a result of the scale of the work done and the materials used by the gas company the character of the existing gas network had been changed. A significant portion of the network had effectively been abandoned and replaced. It was also found that the function of the old pipes had changed so that they no longer carried gas, but instead had become housing for the polyethylene pipes that now carried the gas. Lord Nicholls stated at 15,708: Far from restoring the gas distribution system to its original state, the work changed the character of the existing gas distribution system: a significant portion of it had been upgraded. Substantial portions of the cast-iron mains and steel services were superseded by polyethylene pipes having the differences and advantages mentioned above. This Interpretation Statement now considers the two factors for determining the effect of the work done on the character of an asset: • the nature of the work done, and • the scale of the work done. Nature of the work done Lord Nicholls in Auckland Gas (PC) referred to several decisions that formed the basis for his finding that the nature of the work done to the asset, including the choice of materials used, might change the character of the asset. Lord Nicholls stated at 15,706-15,707: ... sometimes repair may not be the appropriate description of work even though it falls far short of being a replacement of substantially the whole of the relevant subject-matter. The effect of the work on the character of the object is also an important consideration. This is explicit, or implicit, in several decided cases. In W Thomas & Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1965) 115 CLR 58 at p 72, Windeyer J observed that repair “involves a restoration of a thing to a condition it formerly had without changing its character” (emphasis added). In Highland Railway Co v Balderston (Surveyor of Taxes) (1889) 2 TC 485 parts of the main railway track were re-laid, not after their existing fashion, but with steel rails and heavier chairs. The Court of Session held this substitution was a material alteration and great improvement, and contrasted this with taking away any worn rails and renewing them along the line: that “would not alter the character of the line” (see the 28 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Lord President, Lord Inglis, at p488). The Judicial Committee applied this dictum in Rhodesia Railways Ltd v Collector of Income Tax, Bechuanaland Protectorate \[1933\] AC 368 where the cost of relaying a railway line so as to restore it to its former condition was held to be a legitimate charge against income. Consistently with this, in Mitchell v BW Noble Ltd \[1927\] 1 KB 719 at p 729, Rowlatt J observed that replacement of a railing which perpetually falls down or needs painting with a brick wall would be capital expenditure. In FC of T v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd (1952) 86 CLR 102 a dangerous ceiling in a cinema was replaced with a new and better ceiling. Kitto J regarded the work as different in degree and kind from the type of repairs properly allowed for in the working expenses of a theatre business. \[Emphasis added\] If the nature and scale of the work done to an asset indicates that the work has gone beyond repairs, and has changed the character of the asset, the cost of that work is capital expenditure. Usually the character of an asset will be changed when the work done improves or enhances the asset in some way or makes it more advantageous. However, an improvement to the asset will not always be determinative of capital expenditure. This is because almost any repair work to an asset will result in some degree of improvement to that asset. To be capital in nature the work done must go beyond ordinary restoration and change the character of the asset. One decision that Lord Nicholls relied on was the well-known Scottish decision of Highland Railway, which the Privy Council also applied in Rhodesia Railways. These two railway cases are often compared to demonstrate the effect the work done can have on the character of an asset. In Highland Railway the court decided that alterations made to the company’s main railway line changed its character so that the expenditure incurred was capital in nature. The court held at 488: Then when we come to the question of the alteration of the main line itself, it must be kept in view that this is not a mere relaying of the line after the old fashion; it is not taking away rails that are worn out or partially worn out, and renewing them in whole or in part along with the whole line. That would not alter the character of the line; it would not affect the nature of the heritable property possessed by the Company. But what has been done is to substitute one kind of rail for another, steel rails for iron rails. Now that is a material alteration and a very great improvement on the corpus of the heritable estate belonging to the Company, and so stated is surely a charge against capital. \[Emphasis added\] In contrast, the Privy Council in Rhodesia Railways distinguished Highland Railway and held that expenditure on repairs to the railway line did not have the effect of changing the character of the line. Instead, the expenditure was found to be an ordinary incident of railway administration. Lord Macmillan stated at 374: The periodical renewal by sections of the rails and sleepers of a railway line as they wear out by use is in no sense a reconstruction of the whole railway and is an ordinary incident of railway administration. The fact that the wear although continuous is not and cannot be made good annually does not render the work of renewal when it comes to be effected necessarily a capital charge. The expenditure here in question was incurred in consequence of the rails having been worn out in earning the income of previous years on which tax had been paid without deduction in respect of such wear, and represented the cost of restoring them to a state in which they could continue to earn income. It did not result in the creation of any new asset; it was incurred to maintain the appellants' existing line in a state to earn revenue. 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Lord Macmillan commented on the differences between the situations in Highland Railway and Rhodesia Railways at 376: The contrast between the cost of relaying the line so as to restore it to its original condition and the cost of relaying the line so as to improve it is well brought out in the passage just quoted \[ie, the passage quoted at paragraph \[134\] of this statement\], and while the former is recognised as a legitimate charge against income the extra cost incurred in the latter case in the improvement of the line is equally recognized as a proper charge against capital. In the present instance the renewals effected constituted no improvement; they merely made good the line so as to restore it to its original state. Lord Nicholls in Auckland Gas ( PC) also referred to FCT v Western Suburbs Cinemas. That case is often considered with Conn (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Robins Bros Ltd ( 1966) 43 TC 266 (Ch). Both cases involved significant work done to repair buildings, but the court in each case reached a different outcome. Looked at together, the two cases illustrate the effect the nature of the work done can have on the character of an asset. They also demonstrate how the particular materials used can affect the nature of the work done. The assessment of the work done will always be a question of fact. In Western Suburbs Cinemas a damaged ceiling was replaced because an architect considered it was impractical to repair. The court decided the cost of replacing the ceiling was expenditure on capital account. The ceiling was replaced with a new ceiling constructed from more suitable modern materials than those materials previously used, even though equivalent materials were available. The court held that the work done did much more than meet a need for restoration. The resulting ceiling was new and better and had considerable advantages. It was held that the repair work done was different, in degree and in kind, from the usual allowable working expenses of a theatre business. Kitto J stated at page 105: To decide whether a particular item of expenditure on business premises ought to be charged to capital or revenue account is apt to be a matter of difficulty, though the difference between the two accounts is clear enough as a matter of general statement (Sun Newspapers Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation). In this case the work done consisted of the replacement of the entire ceiling, a major and important part of the structure of the theatre, with a new and better ceiling. The operation seems to me different, not only in degree, but in kind, from the type of repairs which are properly allowed for in the working expenses of a theatre business. It did much more than meet a need for restoration; it provided a ceiling having considerable advantages over the old one, including the advantage that it reduced the likelihood of repair bills in the future. The case resembles one of the illustrations given by Rowlatt J. in Mitchell v. B. W. Noble Ltd \[1927\] 1 KB 719, at p 729. As his Lordship there observed, if you say, “I will not have a railing which perpetually falls down or wants repainting; I will abolish it and I will build a brick wall which will not fall down or will not want painting”, that is a capital expenditure. The truth is, I think, that the new ceiling was an improvement to a fixed capital asset and that its cost was a capital charge. \[Emphasis added\] Robins Bros involved extensive repairs to leased retail premises. T he building was over 400 years old and for the most part was original, but a great part of it was rotten. The building was protected and any work done to it could be for preservation purposes only. The work done included renewing some of the roof timbers and replacing the slate roof with corrugated asbestos. Some walls on the lower floor were removed, so steel girders had to be inserted to support the upper storeys. The rotten timber ground floor was re-formed in concrete. In contrast to the decision in Western Suburbs Cinema, t he court in Robins Bros held that although there 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] was extensive replacement of the existing asset, the expenditure was on revenue account. Buckley J’s reasoning at 274 was that: ... this was expenditure incurred by the Company with a view to enabling it to continue to earn profits from its business, not by acquiring some asset for that purpose but by putting the Company’s existing asset into a state of repair which would enable it to continue to use that asset. No doubt in the course of carrying out these works certain structural alterations were made, as one would expect with any extensive repair of a building over 400 years old, when repairs were being carried out at a time when building techniques have completely altered. But the fact that there were alterations in the structural details of the building does not seem to me to be a good ground for proceeding upon the basis that the work produced something new. On the contrary, I think it is implicit in the Commissioners’ finding that the result of this work was not to produce something new but to repair something which had previously existed. Upon that basis it seems to me that there is no ground for regarding this expenditure as a capital expenditure. It was expenditure incurred for the purpose of enabling the Company to continue to earn its profits, and was therefore in my judgment expenditure which would properly be chargeable to income. \[E mphasis added\] While the decisions in Western Suburbs Cinemas and Robins Bros might seem contradictory, the Commissioner considers the two cases demonstrate the subtle factual differences that make decisions in this area so difficult. It is not wise simply to view the cases as irreconcilable or that the approach in one case is to be preferred over the other. What is clear from these two cases is that when major components of an asset are replaced instead of simply being repaired to a serviceable condition, a judgement has to be made as to the nature of the work done to the asset. In Western Suburbs Cinemas the court focused on the improvement the taxpayer made by choosing to replace the damaged ceiling with a new ceiling constructed from a superior modern product when other equivalent products were available. The inference is that if the ceiling had been repaired using the equivalent materials then the work would have been more likely to be a deductible repair. In Robins Bros, the company took a different approach to maintaining the building (much of which was 400 years old and protected), and viewed the replacement of major components as a natural part of the repair process, using materials that were appropriate for construction at the time the work was done. Arguably, in Robins Bros the company did not seek to improve the building but only to maintain the building’s inherent utility. The building remained the same size and in the same location. The building was not completely reconstructed, replaced or renewed, nor was substantially the whole of the building reconstructed, replaced or renewed. The court found in Robins Bros that, based on its particular facts, while the building was improved as a result of being repaired, the work done to the building did not go beyond repairs. In contrast, the work done to the ceiling in Western Suburbs Cinemas, while necessary, went beyond restoration and changed the character of the building. It is also interesting to consider the decision in Robins Bros in the light of Lord Nicholl’s observations in Auckland Gas (PC) regarding Lurcott. Lord Nicholls makes it clear that work done to an asset will be capital expenditure where that work results in the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, being reconstructed, replaced or renewed. As seen, Lord Nicholls also makes it clear that work done to an asset will be capital expenditure where that work changes the character of the asset. Buckley J appeared to be influenced by the lower court finding of fact that the work done was repairs. It could be suggested that if similar facts as in Robins Bros arose under the ITA 2007, the expenditure would be found to be capital in nature on the 31 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] basis that the character of the building had changed, or the work amounted to a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of substantially the whole of the asset, or both. Use of more modern materials The decision in Western Suburbs Cinemas illustrates how the materials used to make repairs can have an important bearing on the nature of the work done. In Western Suburbs Cinemas the ceiling of the theatre was predominantly made from sheets of an imported product called “Ten Test”. Over time the Ten Test material had become dry, buckled and brittle. Many of the pins affixing the sheets to the ceiling joists had drawn through. An architect concluded that it was practically impossible to repair the ceiling. The product Ten Test was not available, although two equivalent products were available - celotex and caneite. However, the architect would not use any product of this type as he considered them to be unsatisfactory for this purpose. Instead he replaced the ceiling with fibrous plaster, attached to new battens that were attached to new ceiling joists. The plaster had a longer life, was harder, better suited to decorative treatment and could be moulded. Even though the architect had advised against repair, the cinema company still got a price for repairs to the ceiling using equivalent materials. The company considered both options (ie, repair or replacement of the ceiling) and chose not to repair but to replace the whole ceiling. Kitto J concluded at 106 that the result of the work done was a “new and better” ceiling that provided considerable advantages over the old one. He found that “the new ceiling was an improvement to a fixed capital asset” and therefore capital expenditure. These same principles were applied by Judge Barber in the Taxation Review Authority decision, Case F78 (1984) 6 NZTC 59,951. Judge Barber decided the replacement of a cracked fibrolite roof of a rental property with a new type of tiled roof did not restore the asset to its original character but altered it. The roof could have been repaired by the replacement of the damaged sheets of fibrolite but instead the owners chose to replace the entire roof with a “better” type of tiled roof. This meant the work was capital in nature. In Auckland Gas (PC) Lord Nicholls also discussed the use of new materials in repairs and maintenance work. He noted that the use of newer and better technology may not in itself change the character of the asset. At 15,706 he states: It often happens that, with improvements in technology, a replacement part is better than the original and will last longer or function better. That does not, of itself, change the character of the larger object or, hence, the appropriate description of the work. However, while the use of new materials may not in itself change the character of an asset, Lord Nicholls went on and found in Auckland Gas (PC) that when new materials were used extensively and performed differently, then their use did result in a change of character of the asset. He held that the fact that a significant portion of the gas network had been replaced with new polyethylene pipes, together with the fact that the new pipes were made of materials which performed differently from the old pipes, meant that the nature and scale of the work was such that the character of the existing gas system was changed (at 15,708). 32 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] With regard to the nature of the work done, the use of new materials in completing the work does not necessarily mean that the asset is improved. However, where different materials are used and as a result the asset is more advantageous or performs or functions better or differently than it did previously, that may indicate a change in the character of the asset. Where a decision is made to use better materials instead of the same or equivalent materials a change in the character of the asset will result and the cost of the work done will be capital expenditure. However, regardless of the choice of materials, as seen above, where new materials are used extensively so that the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, is reconstructed, replaced or renewed, the expenditure will be capital in nature. Other factors potentially affecting the nature of the work done From time to time the courts have been asked to take into account other factors when deciding whether the work done to an asset is capital or revenue in nature. The types of factors that the courts sometimes consider include the effect of the work done on: • the value of the asset; • the income-earning capacity of the asset; • the useful life of the asset; • the function of the asset; • the operating capacity of the asset. The cases show that these factors are rarely determinative of the nature of the work done. The courts instead consider the overall effect of the work done on the asset when determining whether the character of the asset has changed. For example, an increase in value by itself has not been considered a reliable indicator of work being of a capital nature. In Poverty Bay Electric Blanchard J commented at 15,008: It is worth observing also that it is hard to see the adding of value as an essential element in capital expenditure when restoration or repair work usually adds value to the object which is restored or repaired. Similarly, the income-earning capacity of an asset does not need to increase for the work done to the asset to be capital in nature. The changes made to the railway line in Highland Railway were found to be a “permanent improvement” even though the company “derived no additional revenue from the outlay”. Therefore, a comparison of the income-earning capacity of the asset alone cannot always accurately determine whether the work done has changed the character of the asset. This conclusion was also reached by Judge Barber in Case X26 in response to an argument that the work done to the building did not result in any increase in the rental income the building was capable of generating, and therefore the cost could not be capital expenditure. It is sometimes suggested that the extension of an asset’s useful life may indicate the work done to an asset is of a capital nature. C orrespondingly, if there is no increase in an asset’s useful life that may indicate revenue expenditure. However, the Court of Appeal in Auckland Gas noted at 15,022 that if the old gas network had been repaired by merely replacing the joints and corroded sections of pipe the network would have been capable of giving more service and the benefits would have been long lasting. Further, 33 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the Court of Appeal observed that where the work done creates a new asset it is not essential that the life of the original asset be extended for the work done to be capital in nature. This means that the effect of the work done on an asset’s useful life is not always a reliable indicator of the capital or revenue nature of work done to an asset. Every fact situation is different. In Auckland Gas (PC), Lord Nicholls also noted that a comparison of the functional position of an asset before and after the work is done is not a reliable guide by itself as to whether the work done is capital or revenue in nature. He explained at 15,708 that this was because a maintenance problem can be solved in more than one way: The Court of Appeal held, and their Lordships agree, that Williams J \[in the High Court\] reached a conclusion which did not reflect the reality of the work done. In particular, his comparison of the functional position before and after was made at a level of abstraction which paid insufficient regard to the nature and extent of the operation carried out by Auckland Gas. A maintenance problem such as existed here may be capable of being solved in more than one way. It may be solved by work which would be regarded as a repair of the existing structure. Or it may be solved by scrapping all or much of the existing structure and providing a new one. In overall functional terms the result may be much the same in the two cases, but that is not by itself a reliable guide. If the latter alternative is chosen, the expenditure may well be of a capital nature. \[Emphasis added\] Lord Nicholls then said at 15,709 that: ... the desire to solve a maintenance problem is not inconsistent with carrying out work of a capital nature. The nature and extent of the work carried out to the physical asset are what is determinative of the character of the work. \[Emphasis added\] A further point to note is that sometimes work done to an asset may result in unsought benefits. For example, in Auckland Gas the insertion of the replacement pipes meant that the new pipes, although smaller in diameter, would be able to carry gas at a higher pressure than the old pipes. This meant the overall capacity of the network was increased. While this outcome was not a goal in itself, as the existing system already had enough additional capacity for future growth, it was found to be an improvement brought about by the work done, and as such indicated a change in the character of the network. This suggests that where the work done to an asset results in an unsought benefit, the fact that obtaining the advantage was not a goal of the work done does not prevent a finding that the character of the asset has been changed. In summary, factors such as changes to an asset’s value, earning capacity, useful life, function or operating capacity, whether or not a goal of the work done, cannot be relied on in isolation to establish the nature of the work done to the asset. However, in some cases the courts have tended to use such factors to support an overall assessment of whether the character of an asset has changed. Scale of the work done Another important consideration when determining whether the work done to an asset has changed the character of the asset is the scale of the work done. This is also an important consideration when determining whether the work done has resulted in the asset or substantially the whole of the asset being reconstructed, replaced or renewed. 34 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] When considering the scale of the work done the courts may take into account the extent of the work done, the importance of the work done to the asset and the business, and the cost of work done in the context of the asset. As seen in Auckland Gas ( PC) Lord Nicholls confirmed that repairs and maintenance expenditure is on capital account when the work done to the asset is so substantial that it is a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the identified asset or substantially the whole of the asset. Under general capital/revenue principles, one-off expenditure that results in the creation of a new asset, or the production of an advantage of an enduring benefit, may indicate that expenditure is of a capital nature. The courts have also indicated that even where the work done to an asset falls short of being the renewal of substantially the whole of the asset, the more substantial the work is in relation to the asset, the more likely it is that the work will have had the effect of changing the character of the asset and will be of a capital nature. For example, in Auckland Gas polyethylene pipes were inserted into 380 km of the network’s cast-iron mains and into 150 km of the network’s steel services, amounting to 23% of the entire network and 32% of the steel services respectively. The courts found that these were substantial portions of the gas distribution system. In Case L68 (which concerned work done to two fishing boats – the first had its motor replaced and the second was refitted), Judge Keane considered the scale of work done to refit the second boat indicated the expenditure was capital in nature. He held at 1,401: Whether expenditure is for “repairs or alterations”, or is more substantial and capital in nature, appears to depend on the scale and significance of the work done, when related to the asset to which it occurs. The larger and more significant the work, relative to the whole, the more probable it is that capital expenditure is involved. ... The refitting of the “S” seems much more to me than an accumulation of repairs. The sheer scale of what was done tells against the possibility that it was routine. It was an extraordinary event in the life of the vessel. There was nothing piecemeal about what was done. The whole capital entity was affected. Entire aspects of the fabric were replaced. The vessel was restored in the fullest sense, in some respects with more modern materials, to a new and much extended life. The expenditure seems to me to have been capital in nature. \[Emphasis added\] It also follows that the bigger, more significant or more integral the part of the asset being worked on or replaced is, relative to the asset as a whole, the more likely the expenditure will be of a capital nature. For example, in Western Suburbs Cinemas Kitto J referred to the fact the ceiling was a “major and important part of the structure of the theatre” when reaching his conclusion that the expenditure was capital. In Case N8 (which concerned the deductibility of repair costs to a cement manufacturing plant), Judge Bathgate found it significant in his analysis of the work done to the plant that the mixer was replaced. The mixer was central to the operation of the plant and was housed in the tower of the central working core of the batching plant. The contents of the tower were replaced to a significant degree. At 3,074 his Honour commented: Altogether, item by item by item there was a significant replacement and renewal of the central core parts in the concrete making process. There were also significant replacements by renewal of many stationary parts. When they 35 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] are together considered with the renewal, replacements and improvements to the structural parts housing or supporting the plant and equipment, the entire entity, as a composite whole had such a quantity and value of work that I think, fairly obviously, it was capital and not revenue in character. Therefore, when the scale of the work done is being considered, the importance of the parts being worked on to the asset and to the business as a whole forms part of that consideration. Judge Bathgate also considered that the cost of the work done relative to the value of the asset can be an indicator as to the nature of the expenditure. In keeping with general capital/revenue principles he suggested an amount incurred regularly and that is small, relative to the whole value of the asset, is more likely to be revenue in nature. On the other hand, one-off expenditure that is substantial in relation to the value of the asset before the work is done is more likely to be capital in nature. He stated at 3,073: The expenditure would generally be deductible also if the expense is for an amount that is regularly incurred by reason of ordinary wear and tear, or the expense is small and subordinate in nature in relation to the whole value of the asset involved. On the other hand work resulting in a significant increase in value of the asset, a change in its character or kind, of an amount not regularly incurred, or substantial in amount in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work, may be more likely to be capital expenditure of the nature not allowed as a deduction under sec 108(1). \[E mphasis added\] Judge Bathgate’s decision provides one example of how cost can be taken into account in the assessment of the nature and scale of the work done – in that case comparing the cost of the work with the value of the asset. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the courts do not provide any consistent authority as to how best to make such cost comparisons, nor the importance of them. The courts tend to focus more widely on the scale of the work done to the asset, of which cost is only one factor. In Hawkes Bay Power, when considering the effect of the work done Goddard J said at 13,706: The evidence from the valuation experts ... was extremely interesting, although varied. In the end, however, it did not assist in determining the key issues. ...the fact of the matter is that the degree of expenditure invested by Hawkes Bay Power in its underground conversion programme can only be regarded as capital in nature. In summary Goddard J noted at 13,707 that “the scale and degree of the work involved in the total project and the money expended on it leads to only one conclusion; that is, that the expenditure in question is capital in nature”. In the Commissioner’s view, cost on its own is not always a reliable indicator of the nature of expenditure. Sometimes the cost of repair work can be very high, for example, if the replacement parts are expensive or the repair work is difficult. This does not mean the nature of the work done has changed from being revenue to capital. Similarly, in some circumstances it may be less expensive to replace an asset than to repair it – but that saving does not change the character of the work done from being capital. That said, the Commissioner considers that as a general proposition the more significant the costs incurred, the more likely the expenditure will be capital in nature. Overall, the courts consider the scale of the work done, including the extent and cost of work done, when deciding whether work done is of a capital or 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] revenue nature. T he more important the asset is to the business, or the more integral the replacement parts are to the asset then arguably the scale of work done increases and the more likely the expenditure will be capital in nature. When both the nature and the scale of the work done are considered, a decision can be made as to the character of the work done – that is, whether it is capital or revenue in nature. Key points on the nature and extent of the work done to the asset The Commissioner takes the following key points from the analysis of the cases on the nature and extent of the work done: • If the work done results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset or substantially the whole of the asset the cost of that work will be capital expenditure. (Auckland Gas (PC), Auckland Trotting (SC and CA), Lurcott) • Expenditure incurred to repair or maintain the asset, over and above making good wear and tear, that has the effect of changing the character of the asset will also be capital expenditure. Expenditure incurred to repair or maintain the asset without changing its character will be on revenue account. (Auckland Gas (PC)) • When determining whether the work done is capital in nature, relevant factors to consider are the nature and the scale of the work done to the asset (Auckland Gas (PC)). • With regard to the nature of the work done, the use of new materials in completing the work does not necessarily mean that the asset is improved. However, where different materials are used and as a result the asset is more advantageous or performs or functions better or differently than it did previously, that may indicate a change in the character of the asset. Where a decision is made to use better materials instead of the same or equivalent materials a change in the character of the asset will result and the cost of the work done will be capital expenditure. Where new materials are used extensively so that the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, is reconstructed, replaced or renewed, the cost of the work done will be capital expenditure regardless of the choice of materials. (Auckland Gas (PC), Western Suburbs Cinemas, Case F78) • Changes to an asset’s value, its earning capacity, its useful life, function or operating capacity, whether or not a goal of the work done, cannot be relied on in isolation to establish the nature of the work done to the asset. Instead in some cases the courts have tended to use such factors to support an overall assessment of whether the character of an asset has changed. (Poverty Bay Electric, Highland Railway, Auckland Gas (PC and CA)) • Determining the scale of the work done includes a consideration of the extent of the work done, the importance of the work done to the asset and the business, as well as the cost of the work done. The greater the extent of the work done, the greater the importance of the work done to the asset and the business, and the more significant the costs incurred, the more likely the expenditure will be capital. (Auckland Gas (PC), Case L68, Western Suburbs Cinemas, Case N8, Hawkes Bay Power) 37 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Examples – nature and extent of the work done to the asset Example 5– taxi driver replaces engine (no change in character or substantial renewal) Frank is an owner-operator taxi driver. He has driven the same taxi for the past 5 years. Until recently the taxi has been reliable and overall is in good condition. Frank has had his taxi serviced regularly but his mechanic has advised him that the engine is now seriously worn. Frank arranges for his mechanic to replace his taxi’s worn engine with a reconditioned engine that is comparable to the worn one. The cost of the replacement engine and its installation is revenue in nature. This is because the work done does not go beyond repairs to change the c haracter of the taxi. T he work done also does not result in a renewal of substantially the whole of the asset (ie, the taxi). Example 6 – taxi driver upgrades engine ( change in character) Frank decides that if he needs to install a reconditioned engine in his taxi, rather than replacing the worn engine with a comparable engine he would prefer to upgrade to a more powerful one so that he can tow a luggage trailer. The ability to carry additional luggage will expand his business. Therefore, he asks his mechanic about sourcing and installing a compatible but more powerful engine. In this case the cost of the replacement engine and its installation will be capital expenditure. This is because the work done goes beyond repairs and has changed the character of the taxi. Example 7 – refurbishment of item of industrial plant (substantial replacement and renewal) Best Processors Limited owns a large item of specialised industrial plant that is central to its business. Due to wear and tear on the plant, and despite regular maintenance, the company is concerned that the quality of its products is declining. To ensure the company preserves its quality standards the company resolves to refurbish the item of plant. Extensive work is undertaken. The plant casing is repaired. The core processor unit is replaced, along with the drive mechanisms, motors and conveyors. Repairs on related parts are also undertaken. As a result of the work done to the plant, improved production quality is achieved. There have been negligible gains in the operating capacity of the plant. The cost of the work done was significant. The costs incurred by Best Processors Limited will be capital expenditure. Although the plant may not be functionally different after the work, overall, a replacement and renewal of substantially the whole of the plant has occurred. The nature and scale of the work done supports this conclusion. Example 8 – replacement of rotary platform in a dairy shed (substantial replacement and renewal) Loamsdown Farms needs to replace the rotary platform in its rotary dairy shed. The existing platform drive mechanism and motor will be retained. The new platform will have no greater capacity than the old platform. The rotary platform, together with its associated drive mechanism and motor, makes up the rotary platform asset. The replacement of the platform will involve the replacement and renewal of substantially the whole of the rotary platform asset. The platform is a significant and distinct part of the entire rotary system in terms of both its size and value. The cost of replacing the rotary platform will be capital expenditure. An increase in the capacity of the platform is not necessary to establish capital expenditure, if the replacement is so significant that it amounts to the replacement or renewal of substantially the whole of the asset. (This example is based on findings made in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS0025 “Dairy Farming – Deductibility of certain expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000).) 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 9 – insulation top-up ( no change in character or substantial replacement or renewal) Peter and Alice own a residential rental property in Wellington that was built 30 years ago. After a cold snap, their tenants complain that the insulation in the house has deteriorated and is no longer effective. Peter and Alice arrange for new insulation to be inserted into the house. The cost of the insulation is revenue in nature on the basis that it is a repair to the property and does not change the character of the asset. Nor does it result in a replacement or renewal of substantially the whole of the house. The work done only restores the property to its former condition. Example 10 – new insulation (improvement that changes character) Ralph and Bridget own a residential rental property that has never been insulated. Their tenants have been asking for years for the walls and floors to be insulated. Finally, Ralph and Bridget agree and insulation is installed. The cost of this new insulation is capital expenditure. It is not a repair to the rental property. The addition of insulation to the house improves the house and changes its character. Example 11 – replacement of garage roof using equivalent materials ( no change in character or substantial reconstruction, replacement or renewal) Natalie and Albert own a residential rental property. The rental property has a lean- to garage attached to it which has an asbestos roof. The roof has recently cracked and started leaking. It is no longer appropriate to use asbestos as a roofing material, so the roof of the lean-to is replaced with a comparable pre-painted steel roofing product. The cost of replacing the garage roof is revenue in nature. In this case the work done does not change the character of the asset. This is even though a newer, more modern material was used. The roofing material selected reflects current building practices, was an equivalent product and did not improve the lean-to beyond restoring it to its original condition. Nor did the work result in a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of substantially the whole of the house. Example 12 – leaky home repairs (no change in character or substantial reconstruction, replacement or renewal) Cath and Simon own a residential rental property. A few years ago they added a two room extension to the property. The extension has been leaking. The timber framing within the extension is rotten and needs replacing. To make the repairs the cladding and windows need to be removed from the extension and refitted. The cost of the repairs is revenue in nature. The work done to the house does not amount to a reconstruction, replacement or renewal of substantially the whole of the house. Nor do the repairs change the character of the house. Example 13 – leaky home improvements (change in character) Cath and Simon are unlucky and have discovered that another of the rental properties they own is a “leaky home”. In this case the solution is not as straightforward as in Example 12 above and the remedial work required is extensive. Cath and Simon decide to re-clad all the house’s exterior walls using a superior concrete block construction system rather than the equivalent substitute cladding system. While the concrete block construction system is more expensive, it should be more durable, and require less maintenance. The cost of repairs will be capital expenditure. The work done goes beyond repairing the house and the character of the house is changed. This is the outcome in this case regardless of whether the work done results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the house or substantially the whole of the house. Example 14 – major repairs to leaky building (substantial reconstruction) Stuart owns a stand-alone single-storey commercial building in Onehunga that he leases to a small manufacturing business. The building has been leaking badly and the walls and timber framing are extensively damaged. To rectify the damage and prevent it recurring, extensive work is undertaken. All the exterior wall cladding is removed and replaced with an equivalent recommended product. Large sections of 39 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the building’s framing are replaced with treated timber. Also, damaged sections of the floor are replaced. New flashings are installed around the windows, and portions of the interior walls are relined. The cost of the work done to the building is significant. The cost is capital expenditure. This is because the remedial work done is so extensive it has resulted in the reconstruction of substantially the whole of the building. Example 15 – repair to land improvement (no change of character or substantial reconstruction, replacement or renewal) Andrea owns a rental property. The house is built on a steep slope, and rests on a terrace that has been cut into the hillside. The hillside is supported by a large retaining wall. The retaining wall is deteriorating in some places and needs to be repaired. The asset in this case is the retaining wall (a land improvement). The expenditure on the work done to repair the retaining wall is revenue in nature. The work done is not extensive enough to amount to a reconstruction of substantially the whole of the retaining wall. The work done also does not change the character of the wall. Other considerations from the repairs and maintenance cases Over the years the courts have considered many different situations relating to the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. To deal with some of these situations the courts have developed a number of principles that can provide assistance when deciding whether repairs and maintenance expenditure in these types of situations is deductible. This Interpretation Statement will now consider some of these situations along with the principles that have been developed by the courts: • What if repairs are deferred and then completed all at once? • What happens when the repair work forms part of one overall project? • What are notional repairs? • Is a deduction available for expenditure incurred to repair a newly acquired but dilapidated asset? • Does the nature of the expenditure change if damage is repaired as a result of a significant event? What if r epairs are deferred and then completed all at once? Where the work done is the result of accumulated repairs the expenditure may be deductible. The timing of repairs can vary. Some businesses undertake repairs and maintenance of their business assets on a regular basis. Other businesses may undertake repairs as and when they become necessary. Some businesses may choose to defer their repairs and maintenance work and carry them out infrequently at a time that is convenient to the business. Other businesses may undertake regular maintenance but from time to time they may also be required to perform a major overhaul of an asset. Where repairs are deferred, then accumulated and completed all at once, the resulting scale of work done can be substantial. Similarly, where significant overhaul costs are incurred occasionally in addition to regular repairs costs, the issue can arise as to whether the work done, through its scale and because it occurs irregularly, is capital expenditure. The courts have considered issues relating to the timing of repairs and whether the deferral of repairs can result in the cost of those repairs being capital expenditure. 40 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Ounsworth considered the deductibility of costs incurred by a ship-building company to regain access to the sea. The previous shipping channel available to the company had silted up through neglect. A local railway company was responsible for keeping the channel clear but it had not carried out dredging for several years. Rowlatt J commented that the cost of dredging the existing shipping channel would have been revenue expenditure to the railway company if the channel had been dredged year by year, or even if it had only been dredged as and when seriously required. However, in this case he held that the cost incurred by the ship-building company in regaining access to the sea by dredging some of the channel itself and constructing a deep-water berth was capital expenditure. The company had effectively abandoned its old means of access and constructed a new means of access to the sea. However, the obiter comments Rowlatt J made in Ounsworth demonstrate that deductibility of expenditure on repairs and maintenance is not limited to expenditure incurred regularly year by year. Expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance as and when required can also be deductible. Rowlatt J said at 273 that “the real test is between expenditure which is made to meet a continuous demand, as opposed to an expenditure which is made once \[and\] for all”. The Privy Council’s decision in Rhodesia Railways supports the view that the deferral of repairs should not change the character of those repairs from being revenue expenditure to capital expenditure. Lord Macmillan stated at 374: The periodical renewal by sections of the rails and sleepers of a railway line as they wear out by use is in no sense a reconstruction of the whole railway and is an ordinary incident of railway administration. The fact that the wear although continuous is not and cannot be made good annually does not render the work of renewal when it comes to be effected necessarily a capital charge. \[Emphasis added\] Sometimes repairs can take a lengthy period to complete. Again, the courts have held that this does not determine whether the expenditure incurred is revenue or capital in nature. Lord Nicholls commented at 15,708 of the Privy Council’s decision in Auckland Gas that “the speed or slowness with which the work was carried out cannot affect its nature or, hence, its proper characterisation”. The Commissioner notes however, that if the repairs become so extensive that they amount to the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset or substantially the whole of the asset, the cost of that work will be capital expenditure. Similarly, if the deferred repairs form part of one overall project that is capital in nature, then those repairs will take their character from the project. The cases show that different taxation outcomes can result depending on what the particular taxpayer did and when. This will always be a question of fact and degree in the particular circumstances. What happens when the repair work forms part of one overall project? Whe n repair work forms part of one overall project the courts have suggested that it is not appropriate to separate out the different costs of the project for tax purposes where that project is of a capital nature. This is the case whether the project concerns work done on a single asset or work done on a group of assets. In Colonial Motor the Court of Appeal considered whether the work done to convert a building from a warehouse to an office building, including seismic 41 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] strengthening, was one project or whether the work done on the seismic strengthening could be considered separately from other work done on the building. The local city council considered the building to be an earthquake risk and without the strengthening work the building would have been demolished. The work done involved the construction of new concrete walls, the removal of a mezzanine floor, the addition of a penthouse, and general refurbishment and seismic strengthening. T he taxpayer divided the expenditure incurred into three categories: revenue, seismic strengthening and capital. The Commissioner and the taxpayer agreed on the deductibility status of the expenditure, with the exception of the expenditure on seismic strengthening. The taxpayer argued it was deductible being repairs and alterations that did not increase the capital value of the building in terms of the proviso to s 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Court of Appeal suggested that if the work undertaken is all part of one overall project then the work must be evaluated holistically to determine whether the work did no more than repair or alter the asset in question. This was despite the fact that the dispute only concerned the expenditure on the seismic strengthening and not the expenditure that the Commissioner and the taxpayer had already agreed was either revenue and deductible or capital and non-deductible. Richardson J stated that the mere accounting allocation of the total expenditure did not change the character of the work done. Looking at the total work carried out and the magnitude of the work involved, Richardson J found that the work was not the subject of two independent unrelated projects. It was a single project that converted the eight storey warehouse destined for demolition into a nine storey office block. His Honour stated at 11,366: That statutory inquiry relates to the work that was actually done. If there was one overall construction project, it is the total work involved in relation to the particular premises which has to constitute “repairs or alterations of any such asset” so as to come within the proviso. In such a case it begs the question to say that the taxpayer could have confined itself to certain specific parts of the work done in which case that limited work would have constituted alterations. The allocation of the total expenditure to different categories of work does not change the character of the work that was done. On the facts of this case it is essential to consider the total work carried out. It was not and could not sensibly have been the subject of two independent unrelated contractual projects, one for strengthening the building and the other for new and repair work. It was a single project which converted the eight storey warehouse-type structure otherwise destined for demolition into a nine storey office block with a 50 year revenue earning life. ...The magnitude of the work involved is reflected in the total expenditure of $5.7 million of which the great bulk was in new work ($3.47 m illion) and the major part of the strengthening ($1.28m) was the construction of two new concrete walls. That was an entirely new structural addition. ...While strengthening alone or capital and repairs alone might have added little if anything to the value, it was their combined effect that was so significant. \[Emphasis added\] The Commissioner recognises that the decision in Colonial Motor was addressing whether the work done was “repairs or alterations” for the purposes of s 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the principle Richardson J put forward in Colonial Motor continues to be relevant when considering whether expenditure incurred on work carried out as part of a larger project is capital or revenue in nature. Where repair work is done as part of one overall project to reconstruct, renew or replace an asset, or substantially the whole of an asset, or to change its character, the nature of the expenditure on the repair 42 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] work is taken from the character of the overall project, and the repair work is not looked at in isolation. Colonial Motor is often compared with Sherlaw. In Sherlaw a boat-shed needed re-piling. However, the re-piling work caused the roof and floor of the boat-shed to be substantially damaged. As a result the taxpayer was required to replace a substantial part of the damaged roof that was unable to be repaired. Also, because of the changes in the roof, the floor was relocated to a slightly higher level. In carrying out the repairs the taxpayer used materials that were second-hand or salvaged from the original boat- shed. The building was the same dimensions before and after the work. The Commissioner, relying on Auckland Trotting (SC and CA) and Colonial Motor, contended that the work done on the boat-shed in Sherlaw was a reconstruction of substantially the whole of the boat-shed. Therefore, all the work done was non-deductible being capital in nature. Doogue J disagreed. His Honour found that the taxpayer carried out nothing more than necessary maintenance of the piles. The course adopted (of doing, wherever possible, work by himself and with friends with second-hand and salvaged materials) indicated this was not an endeavour to improve the structure of the building but simply to ensure that necessary maintenance was carried out to it. Doogue J distinguished Colonial Motor on the grounds that the building in Colonial Motor was transformed and strengthened with a completely new layout and refurbishment. In Sherlaw the boat-shed layout and size were not altered, and substantial parts of the boat-shed remained unchanged. No overall construction project to change the character of the boat-shed existed, and neither did a project to reconstruct, renew, or replace the boat- shed or substantially the whole of the boat-shed. While the scale of the work done was extensive, Doogue J attributed that to the amount of maintenance that had been deferred rather than to any decision by the taxpayer to reconstruct most of the premises. Doogue J stated at \[22\]: In this case the taxpayer sought to repair the piles to the building. That was his objective. That was what he tried to do. The consequences of those necessary repairs resulted in other work being required to be done. Unlike the cases to which the Commissioner referred me, this is not one overall construction project in the manner submitted for the Commissioner. In this case once the essential work was commenced other work became necessary. Upon the evidence it may indeed be doubtful whether the taxpayer would necessarily have incurred all the work and expense that he ultimately was involved in if he had known of the extent of it at the beginning. It is true that he undertook it all once he was committed, because that was the practical way for him to deal with the problems which faced him after he had been committed. This is not a case, however, of the kind referred to me where there was one overall construction project resulting in the complete reconstruction of the boat-shed or of a project for the deliberate improvement of the boat- shed. Here the taxpayer chose to repair the boat-shed and, as a result of that decision, he was faced with consequential repair work and upgrading becoming necessary. \[Emphasis added\] In the Commissioner’s view, Sherlaw highlights a situation where repairs are undertaken and those repairs have a flow-on effect, causing further repairs to be required. The repairs when looked at in totality, might be extensive. However, they were not undertaken as one overall plan to reconstruct, replace or renew an asset, or substantially the whole of an asset or to change its character. Doogue J noted the Commissioner had not sought to categorise separately any of the work additional to the original re-piling and floor work as capital work. Doogue J then went on to say that if the Commissioner had submitted 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] that certain aspects of the works carried out were of a capital nature there may have been a point to the submission. This suggests that as the work done on the boat-shed was not part of one overall project to substantially reconstruct or renew, or to change its character, different aspects of the work could be identified as being either capital or revenue in nature depending on the effect that the work had on the boat-shed. Both Colonial Motor and Sherlaw were considered by Goddard J in Hawkes Bay Power. In Hawkes Bay Power the taxpayer contended that it did not have one overall objective to replace the overhead system in its urban residential areas with an underground system. Hawkes Bay Power contended that each conversion job was simply carried out on an ad hoc basis according to the particular reason for the job. Goddard J, basing her reasons on the documentary evidence before her and Hawkes Bay Power’s own acknowledgement of its long standing policy to convert those areas to an underground system, disagreed. On that evidence Goddard J found the work done by Hawkes Bay Power to replace its overhead wires with underground cables was done with an overall objective to replace the entire overhead system in its urban residential areas with an underground system. Goddard J concluded that given the scale and degree of the work involved in the total project and the money expended on it, the expenditure in question was capital in nature. Hawkes Bay Power, relying on Sherlaw, had separately classified expenditure on work done to replace the overhead wires with an underground cable system into capital and non-capital items. For example the expenditure on the replacement of the worn out overhead wires with underground replacements was treated as revenue while the expenditure on the distribution transformers was capitalised. On this point Goddard J held at 13,707: In the context of the total project and the extent to which it has been achieved to date, it is artificial to dissect the work into capital and revenue categories, or to further dissect the “purported” revenue category into capital and non-capital items. As Kitto J said in FC of T v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd (1952) 86 CLR 102 at p 108: “...the capital or income character of expenditure actually incurred depends upon the nature of the purpose for which it was incurred. If a total expenditure is of a capital nature, so is every part of it; you cannot take a portion of the work done such as the erection of a scaffolding and, closing your eyes to the purpose for which it was in fact erected, attribute to the cost of that portion an income nature for no better reason than that the same scaffolding, would have been erected in order to serve a purpose which, if it had existed, would have made the total expenditure an income charge. ” And as Richardson J said in Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 at p 11,366: “That statutory enquiry relates to the work that was actually done. If there was one overall construction project, it is the total work involved in relation to the particular premises which has to constitute ‘repairs or alterations of any such asset’ so as to come within the proviso. In such a case it begs the question to say that the taxpayer could have confined itself to certain specific parts of the work done in which case that limited work would have constituted alterations. The allocation of the total expenditure to different categories of work does not change the character of the work that was done. On the facts of this case it is essential to consider the total work carried out. It was not and could not sensibly have been the subject of two 44 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] independent unrelated contractual projects, one for strengthening the building and the other for new and repair work. It was a single project which converted the eight storey warehouse-type structure otherwise destined for demolition into a nine storey office block with a 50 year revenue earning life. ” The case of Sherlaw v CIR ( 1994) 16 NZTC 11,290 on which Hawkes Bay Power sought to rely as authority for separate classification of expenditure into capital and non-capital items falls into a different category to the present case on the issues of both scale and degree. On the facts in Sherlaw Doogue J found there was not one overall construction project resulting in a complete reconstruction or that the expenditure was so disproportionate as to indicate that it was of a capital nature. \[Emphasis added\] Hawkes Bay Power makes it clear that where work forms part of one overall project of capital work, then that work will take its character from the character of that overall project. In such a case, i t is artificial to dissect the work forming part of that project into capital or revenue categories. This is because work done in every part of that project is calculated to achieve the same objective from both a practical and business point of view. Goddard J in Hawkes Bay Power also observed that the taxpayer had treated all expenditure on repairing or replacing existing overhead lines with new overhead lines as being revenue in nature. Goddard J accepted that this expenditure was not part of the overall plan to put in underground cables. Goddard J found that the nature of this expenditure had to be determined on its own facts as to the extent and scale of the work done. Goddard J noted that even if the overall plan was not viewed as a total project in terms of the conversion of the entire urban residential distribution system but rather in terms of the individual conversion of individual streets serviced by a distribution transformer, her finding would not have changed. Her Honour observed at 13,700: Alternatively, even if the "final objective" were not to be viewed as a ‘total project’ but in terms of the individual conversion jobs undertaken on a year by year basis in respect of individual streets containing groups of consumers serviced by a distribution transformer, that would not alter the picture. All of those jobs were undertaken pursuant to the one "firm policy" instituted by the old Board in 1969 and continued by Hawkes Bay Power after incorporation in 1987. On this basis all have resulted in the creation of a new asset. Each individual conversion project completed and each individual distributor installed underground would constitute a new asset, whatever the particular reason that motivated Hawkes Bay Power to effect each conversion project and each underground installation. This suggests that where there is one overall capital project involving a group of assets, the nature of the expenditure on any repair work done on those assets is taken from the character of that one overall project, and the repair work is not looked at in isolation. Case X26 considered the deductibility of earthquake-strengthening costs incurred as part of one overall project. It followed the decision in Colonial Motor, and Judge Barber found that costs incurred to earthquake-strengthen a building were capital costs. In reaching that decision Judge Barber applied the general capital/revenue principles, together with the Colonial Motor decision, and found at \[39\] that: In Colonial Motor Co Ltd v C of IR, as in the present case, from a practical and business point of view, the total work undertaken was to transform an unsound building with a potentially very limited or, possibly, non-existent revenue- earning capacity into a sound building capable of being used to earn income. 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Judge Barber found at \[43\] that the earthquake-strengthening work was done as a consequence of a single plan, rather than as an ad hoc response to issues arising when undertaking other work. On this basis, h e distinguished the decision in Sherlaw. Judge Barber noted that, while the work done in Case X26 was less extensive than that done in Colonial Motor, it was of the same character. At \[43\]: Of course, in the present case the work undertaken was not as extensive as that in Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR, but the same result must follow. There was work undertaken to improve the building’s earning-capacity by making it earthquake code compliant and thus avoiding the sterilisation of the asset. While the work in this case was to make the building earthquake-code compliant, it ensured the continued availability of the asset as part of the income-earning structure of the taxpayer’s partnership. That structure is a concept of capital. The process of earning income is revenue in concept. \[Emphasis in original\] In the Commissioner’s view, expenditure on repairs forming part of one overall project should take its character from that project. However, the Commissioner agrees that in some situations apportionment may be appropriate. For example, as was the case in Hawkes Bay Power, a taxpayer may do work on an asset while at the same time undertaking an overall project. If it can be demonstrated that the work done is not part of that project the nature of the work must be determined on its own facts. Consequently, if that work does not reconstruct, renew or replace an asset or substantially the whole of an asset or change its character the expenditure on that work is likely to be revenue in nature and deductible. To determine if apportionment is appropriate in any particular situation, it is necessary to consider the work done from a practical and business point of view. For example, in the Commissioner’s view, apportionment of expenditure between capital and revenue will be appropriate where the work done is a repair, but at the same time some upgrading of a capital nature can be identified (Sherlaw). In contrast, where repairs and maintenance work forms part of one overall project, where the objective of that project is to reconstruct, replace or renew the asset or substantially the whole of the asset or to change the asset’s character, then apportionment will not be appropriate and all the expenditure incurred as part of that project will take its nature from the overall project (Colonial Motor, Hawkes Bay Power and Case X26). In the Court o f Appeal’s decision in Poverty Bay Electric Blanchard J also acknowledged that an apportionment of costs between deductible repair costs and non-deductible capital costs is possible and appropriate in some situations, but that apportionment was not appropriate in every case. Blanchard J made this acknowledgement in response to the taxpayer’s alternative submission that having capitalised a portion of the expenditure to recognise the improvements in the work done it was then entitled to claim a deduction for the balance of the expenditure. Blanchard J commented at 15,008: In particular situations an apportionment of an amount of expenditure is possible and appropriate — where a part of the money spent has been applied to work which is truly a repair and at the same time some upgrading of a capital nature has been done. It is often possible to distinguish which is which. But this is not such a case. 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Blanchard J, relying on Auckland Trotting (CA) and Western Suburbs Cinema, found on the facts of the case that, as a new asset had been created, no repair work had in fact been carried out by the taxpayer. His Honour concluded that the taxpayer was not entitled to a deduction on the basis that none of the work done by the taxpayer consisted of repairs. What are notional repairs? Where capital expenditure is incurred the courts have held that no deduction can be claimed for an amount that might have been spent on repairs had the work been carried out differently. As stated a bove Blanchard J made this clear in Poverty Bay Electric where he discussed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Auckland Trotting. At 15,008: In Auckland Trotting Club (Inc) v C of IR \[1968\] NZLR 967 at p 980 Richmond J said that no part of the money spent on constructing the new trotting track was, in fact, spent on repairs and it was not possible to treat part of it as notionally spent on repairs when that is not what happened. North P and Turner J expressed their agreement (p 977). The Court adopted the reasons of Finlay J in Margrett (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Lowestoft Water and Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 at pp 488–489 and of Kitto J in FC of T v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd (1952) 86 CLR 102 at pp 107–109. At p 107 Kitto J said: ... when a taxpayer has two courses open to him, one involving an expenditure which will be an allowable deduction for income tax and the other involving an expenditure which will not be an allowable deduction, and for his own reasons he chooses the second course, he cannot have his income tax assessed as if he had exercised his choice in the opposite way. Section 53 is concerned with expenditure which was in fact incurred, not with expenditure which could have been incurred but was not. ... To similar effect is the judgment of this Court in Colonial Motor Co Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361. We agree that it is not possible to claim as expenditure on a repair a payment which has not actually been expended for that purpose. There cannot be a dissection of what is spent upon a capital work because part of it might otherwise have been laid out on repairs, but was not. \[Emphasis added\] Where a taxpayer could have done the work differently but chose not to, a deduction cannot be claimed for a notional amount of expenditure on repairs. A taxpayer cannot deduct expenditure for work they have not done. Is a deduction available for expenditure incurred to repair a newly acquired but dilapidated asset? Where expenditure i s incurred on repairs and maintenance soon after an asset has been acquired, that expenditure is likely to be considered part of the capital cost of acquiring the asset. Law Shipping addressed the special situation of deductions for repairs to a recently acquired asset. Law Shipping concerned a company that purchased a ship in a poor state of repair for £97,000. The company used the vessel while in the poor state of repair for one voyage and then carried out repairs to the value of £51,558. The court held that the cost of the repairs was not deductible but was part of the capital cost of acquiring the ship. That decision was followed in Collector of Inland Revenue, Cook Islands v AB 47 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Donald Ltd \[1965\] NZLR 679 (SC), which also addressed the deductibility of repairs to a recently acquired ship. The court in W Thomas & Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1965) 115 CLR 58 endorsed AB Donald Ltd. In W Thomas the taxpayer company acquired a building that required work to be done to it, some of which was necessary to make the building suitable for use in the company’s business. Windeyer J held that the repairs done to the building to make it suitable for use were not deductible. The cost of getting the building ready to be used by the taxpayer company formed part of the acquisition cost of that asset, so was a capital cost. Windeyer J observed at 72: Expenditure upon repairs is properly attributed to revenue account when the repairs are for the maintenance of an income-producing capital asset. Maintenance involves the periodic repair of defects that are the result of normal wear and tear in operation. It is an expense of a revenue nature when it is to repair defects arising from the operations of the person who incurs it. But if when a thing is bought for use as a capital asset in the buyer's business it is not in good order and suitable for use in the way intended, the cost of putting it in order suitable for use is part of the cost of its acquisition, not a cost of its maintenance. \[Emphasis added\] It is well settled by the courts that expenditure incurred to repair a newly acquired asset so that it is in good order and suitable for use in the way intended by a taxpayer is a capital cost and forms part of the acquisition cost of that asset. The limits of the principle in Law Shipping are demonstrated in Odeon Associated Theatres. The English Court of Appeal found that expenditure on deferred repairs to a movie theatre acquired in a dilapidated condition was deductible. In that case the taxpayer acquired a fully operational but run down movie theatre in 1945. The theatre had not been repaired for a number of years. The taxpayer repaired the theatre gradually over seven years. Salmon LJ distinguished Law Shipping on the following grounds at 296: There seem to me to be many important distinctions between that case \[Law Shipping\] and the present case. (1) In the Law Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, 12 T.C. 621 the purchase price was substantially less than it would have been had the vessel been in a fit state of repair ... and that they made good this defect at the first opportunity. ... . In the present case, the purchase price paid by the taxpayers was in no way affected by the fact that the cinema was in disrepair at the date of its acquisition. The sellers could not lawfully have executed the repairs prior to the acquisition since no licence to execute such work was then obtainable. (2) In the Law Shipping case the vessel was not in a state to pass survey at the time of purchase.... In the present case, the cinema was a profit-earning asset at the date of its acquisition in spite of its state of disrepair. It remained so, although no money was spent on deferred repairs for a number of years after its acquisition. (3) In the Law Shipping case there was no evidence that on established principles of sound commercial accounting the £39,558 could properly be charged by the taxpayer as revenue expenditure. .... In the present case, however, the commissioners held, on ample evidence, that it was in accordance with the established principles of sound commercial accounting to charge the disputed items to revenue expenditure, and these principles in no way conflict with any statute. 48 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Even though t he expenditure was to repair an asset acquired in a dilapidated state, the expenditure was still found to be deductible. Significantly, the purchase price paid by the taxpayer had not been discounted to take account of the condition of the theatre, as all theatres at that time were in a similar condition due to restrictions imposed by the war. Further, the theatre was immediately profitable, despite its run-down condition. Does the nature of the expenditure change if damage is repaired as a result of a significant event? The Commissioner considers that the nature of the expenditure does not change if the damage to be repaired occurs as a result of a significant event such as an earthquake, a fire or a storm. Consequently, the same issues as considered in this statement need to be addressed to determine whether any expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance is capital or revenue expenditure. If the repair work is on revenue account, the expenditure will be deductible; if it is on capital account, it will not be deductible. This is because the deductibility of the repair costs is determined more by the effect that the work has on the asset, rather than when the work was done or what caused the damage to the asset. This is demonstrated in Case F67 where the taxpayers’ building was extensively damaged by fire. The taxpayers leased the lower floor of the building as two shops ( a pizza parlour and a knick-knack shop). The taxpayers leased the upstairs part of the building to the respective shop lessees as residential flats. The fire significantly damaged the wall linings of the knick-knack shop. The pizza parlour also suffered considerable water and smoke damage. To bring the shops back into working condition the lining of the knick-knack shop was replaced, while in the pizza parlour some of the lining was cleaned and re- plastered. Both shops were redecorated. The electrical wiring was replaced and substantial plumbing repairs were undertaken. The upstairs portion of the building was gutted. The roof structure was replaced and the parts of the iron roofing destroyed by fire were also replaced. However, the upstairs flats were left gutted. The builder who undertook the work stated that at the conclusion of the repairs the overall structure was probably in a far worse condition than it was before the fire. This was mainly because the upstairs flats, the larger of which had recently been refurbished before the fire, had been left gutted. The downstairs shops were restored to their pre-fire condition with no improvement. The taxpayers claimed a deduction for the portion of the repairs that the insurance payment did not cover. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the basis it was capital expenditure. Judge Barber identified the building as the asset that was the subject of the work rather than the individual shops. He found the building work undertaken was so extensive in relation to the building that it amounted to the replacement, reconstruction or renewal of a substantial part of a capital asset that went beyond the normal concept of repair. Judge Barber did accept the building was not totally destroyed and a major portion of the basic building structure remained intact after the fire. However, he concluded that as the expenditure by the taxpayers was not to repair the building but to rebuild it, it was capital and not deductible. The Federal Court of Appeal of Canada has also considered the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure after a significant event (Bowland v R 2001 FCA 160, \[2001\] 3 CTC 109). In Bowland the taxpayer’s rental 49 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] property was damaged by fire. Before the fire the building was valued at $80,000 of which $5,000 was attributable to the land. The taxpayer claimed that after the fire he spent $66,472 on repairing the property. The court concluded the renovations were so extensive in nature that the house was virtually rebuilt and resulted in a new capital asset. Consequently, the court concluded the cost of the work was not deductible because it was capital in nature. In both Case F67 and Bowland the courts looked at the nature and scale of the work undertaken and the effect that work had on the asset when determining whether the expenditure was on capital or revenue account. In making its decision neither court focused on when the work was done or what caused the damage to the asset. In the Commissioner’s view, where the work done is to repair damage caused by a significant event, and the work done results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, or the character of the asset is changed, the expenditure will be capital in nature. However, where some necessary repair work must be done to an asset as a result of a significant event and further repair work comes about as a consequence of the necessary repairs, then the repair costs, while extensive, may be deductible (Sherlaw). This will always be a question of fact and degree. Significant events and dilapidated assets As found in Case F67 and Bowland, the deductibility of repair costs is determined by the nature and scale of the work undertaken and the effect it has on the asset. The deferral of repairs, before a significant event, should not in itself change the character of whether expenditure on repairs is deductible. The Canadian Tax Court demonstrated this in Martinello v R 2010 TCC 432, 2010 DTC 1300. In Martinello the taxpayer owned a house that she rented out. In October 2004 a substantial hurricane-strength storm significantly damaged the property, making it uninhabitable for a time. The winds had lifted the house off its foundation causing the main wooden beam to give way. Dampness over the years had weakened the sills and joists, which caused much of the rest of the floor to fall in. In addition, the storm waters rushed underneath the house leaving much of the floor and parts of the sidewalls sitting in mud. The storm also blew down an old chimney that was no longer used. The property had also suffered some tenant wear and tear and damage. Eight years before the storm, the taxpayer had replaced the house’s windows and doors and updated the plumbing and wiring. Other than this, and painting and cleaning between tenants, the taxpayer had not undertaken other work on the house. The taxpayer paid to have the house repaired. Much of the expenditure related to the floor that was damaged when the house was lifted up off its foundations. The work included straightening the footings and reinforcing them with more cement, removing silt and debris, and putting in new sills, joists and, where necessary, new floor boards. The footing of the walls was also replaced. Once the house was back on its foundations the existing plumbing and electrical supply had to be reconnected. The house’s wiring was replaced. The fallen chimney was removed, the roof and walls were patched, and half the roof was re-shingled. The old aluminium siding was reused in the gable ends of the house and a new vinyl siding was used to clad the bottom of the house. The inside of the house was repainted where 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] needed. A small, attached wooden mud room (for removal of outdoor footwear) at the back entrance and modest wooden deck had to be replaced. The house was repaired to its original rentable condition. The court found that all the damage that had occurred was the result of tenant damage, normal wear or tear, depreciation over the time it was rented out, or storm damage while it was rented out. The repairs did not improve the house beyond its original condition in any manner. Therefore, the costs of the repairs and maintenance, although all done at once, were properly deductible as current expenses and were not required to be capitalised. The Commissioner considers that the court reached this conclusion because, while the work the taxpayer undertook was extensive, the storm damage was largely as a result of deferred repairs – from tenant damage, normal wear and tear, and depreciation (eg, the weakened floor joists and sills). Therefore, while the significant event (the storm) did create damage that required repairing, the nature of the work undertaken after the storm was repairs that had accumulated over the period that the house was tenanted. Implicit in this is that the court in Martinello considered the work done by the taxpayer did not reconstruct, replace or renew the house, or substantially the whole of the house or, change its character. Key points relating to other considerations from the repairs and maintenance cases The Commissioner takes the following key points from the analysis relating to other considerations from the repairs and maintenance cases: • The timing of repairs is not a critical factor when deciding whether the expenditure incurred is deductible – repairs can be deferred and completed as and when required without necessarily giving rise to capital expenditure (Ounsworth). • The deductibility of repair costs is determined more by the nature of the work carried out and the effect that it has on the asset, rather than on when the work is carried out (Rhodesia Railways). • The speed or slowness with which the work is done is not usually relevant to deciding whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature (Auckland Gas (PC)). • Where deferred repairs become so extensive that they amount to the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset or substantially the whole of the asset or where deferred repairs form part of one overall project that is capital in nature then those repairs will be capital in nature. This will always be a question of fact and degree in the particular circumstances (Auckland Gas (PC)). • Repairs and maintenance work that forms part of one overall project to reconstruct, replace or renew an asset or substantially the whole of an asset or to change that asset’s character will take its nature from that project. This is regardless of whether that project concerns work done on a single asset or work on a group of assets (Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (CA), Hawkes Bay Power, Case X26). • Where repairs and maintenance expenditure is incurred on an ad hoc basis and not as part of one overall plan, the expenditure should take its character from the effect that the work done has on the asset (Sherlaw). 51 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • It is appropriate and possible in some situations to apportion an amount of expenditure between deductible repair costs and non- deductible capital works (Poverty Bay Electric). • No deductions are available for a notional amount of expenditure for repairs. A taxpayer cannot deduct expenditure for work they have not done (Western Suburbs, Auckland Trotting (CA), Poverty Bay Electric). • Expenditure incurred to repair a newly acquired asset so that it is in good order and suitable for use in the way intended by the taxpayer is a capital cost and forms part of the acquisition cost of that asset (Law Shipping, W Thomas). • Depending on the circumstances, a deduction may still be allowed for expenditure on repairs to a newly acquired asset if the purchase price was not affected by the asset’s state of disrepair and, when the asset was acquired, it could be used as intended despite its state of disrepair (Odeon Associated Theatres). • Where an asset is damaged as a result of a significant event, the deductibility of expenditure to repair the asset depends on the nature and scale of the work undertaken and the effect that work has on the asset and not on the occasion that caused the work to be done (Case F67, Bowland). • If an asset damaged as a result of a significant event was dilapidated before the event, the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure continues to depend on the nature and scale of the work undertaken and the effect that work has on the asset. This may mean that, although extensive work is undertaken all at once, the cost of that work could still be considered to be revenue in nature (Martinello). Examples – other considerations from the repairs and maintenance cases Example 16 – repairs to rental property (deferred repairs done all at once) Phil owns a rental property. A long period has passed since repairs were last made to the property but the tenants have recently vacated and Phil is taking the opportunity to restore the property to a good condition before letting it again. He has to incur significant expenditure on the property. The work done includes extensive cleaning, repainting, easing windows (ie, repairing windows to enable them to open and shut smoothly) and replacing cracked panes, sanding and re-varnishing the floors, replacing the kitchen bench top, fitting a new hand basin to replace a cracked one, and having a plumber check and repair all the taps. Phil does not replace, reconstruct or renew the property or substantially the whole of the property. The work done also does not change the character of the property. Although the costs incurred by Phil are significant, they arose from repairs that had been allowed to accumulate and are revenue in nature. Example 17 – project to refurbish and strengthen building (one overall project to change character) Lot Developments Limited has owned an older commercial building for 10 years. The building is looking shabby and the company has recently been informed that earthquake-strengthening work needs to be done if it is to comply with council requirements for that type of building. The company decides the building would benefit from a complete refurbishment, including structural changes that will extend the floor plan and enhance the common areas as well as earthquake-strengthen the building. All the expenditure incurred will be capital expenditure as it forms part of one overall project to change the character of the building. No deduction is allowed for the cost of any repairs that are included within the project. 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 18 – repair to building that led to more repairs (repair; no overall project of substantial reconstruction, replacement or renewal or change in character) As a result of ground subsidence, Northern Roasters Limited set about repairing the uneven floor of the small factory premises that it owns. This involved minor foundation work. As a result of the foundation work, several windows and walls cracked. These had to be repaired, and the walls then had to be re-plastered and painted. Although the work done to the factory was costly, the repairs were completed on an ad hoc basis. The work done was not done as part of one overall plan to reconstruct, replace or renew the premises, or substantially the whole of the premises, or to change the character of the premises. Further, the actual scale and nature of the work done did not have this effect. Therefore, the repair costs are revenue in nature. Example 19 – double glazing (one overall project to change character with no apportionment available) Erica has a restaurant in an old villa that she owns. The villa is used exclusively for the restaurant. The villa is located near a very busy thoroughfare. To keep noise levels down inside the restaurant Erica has decided to install double glazing. While installing the double glazing the builder discovers that two window frames on the south side of the villa are rotten. The windows are repaired to enable the installation of the double glazing. Erica’s objective in this case was to install double glazing in her villa. The work done has changed the character of the villa. The work done to repair the windows formed part of Erica’s objective to double glaze the villa and therefore is part of one overall project to change its character. Consequently, all the expenditure incurred by Erica is capital in nature. Example 20 – house painting and extension (one overall project to change character along with maintenance work where apportionment is available) George owns a rental property. George decides that by adding on two new bedrooms and another bathroom to the property he will be able to get a much higher rental. George employs a builder to build the new extension. George also thinks the property is looking tired and needs a new coat of paint so he employs a painter to paint the property. The painter also paints the new extension. George’s objective in this case was to add on the two bedroom extension. The work done to extend the house changed the character of the property and so is of a capital nature. The painting of the new extension is part of George’s project to change the character of his rental property and is also capital in nature. However, George can establish from a practical and business point of view that re-painting the remainder of the house was not part of his project to change the character of his property. Re-p ainting the remainder of the house is maintenance work. Therefore, George can treat the portion of the painting expenditure that relates to painting the house but not the extension as being revenue in nature. Example 21 – newly acquired but damaged rental property (part of capital cost) Anne and Jane bought a property at a discounted rate because of earthquake damage. The roof of the property has partially collapsed and a corner of the house has been damaged. Anne and Jane want to rent the property out, so spend money fixing the roof and the damaged part of the house to put it in a tenantable state. The expenditure on the repairs is capital in nature. Anne and Jane’s costs in getting the property to a tenantable state are treated as part of the property’s acquisition cost. Example 22 – damaged and dilapidated commercial building (repairs; not substantial reconstruction, replacement or renewal or change in character) David and Angus own a commercial building that was superficially damaged in an earthquake. David and Angus have owned the property for a long time. When David and Angus purchased the property it was in excellent condition. Over time it has become dilapidated, so when the earthquake occurred the poor state of the roof led 53 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to more repairs then being necessary. The tenants are unhappy and request that the building be fixed. David and Angus spend money on the building: inside the building the interior walls are re-plastered and repainted and the stairwells are repaired; outside the building the roof is repaired, cracked and broken windows are replaced, and the exterior walls are repainted. The work done brings the building back to the standard it was when David and Angus bought it . The work done does not reconstruct, replace or renew the building or substantially the whole of the building. The work also does not change the building’s character. The expenditure undertaken by David and Angus is for accumulated repairs and is revenue in nature. Example 23 –reconstruction of damaged rental property ( substantial reconstruction, replacement and renewal) Jennifer and Peter own a residential rental property that was significantly damaged in an earthquake. Before the earthquake the property was in a good state of repair. After the earthquake, to get the property in a tenantable state, Jennifer and Peter replace the property’s severely damaged foundations, reconstruct the floors, rebuild three of the property’s collapsed external walls and replace the badly damaged roof. Jennifer and Peter also demolish the property’s partially collapsed chimney, which is a hazard. In this case, the cost of the work Jennifer and Peter have done is capital expenditure and not deductible. Where work is so extensive that it results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the asset, or substantially the whole of the asset, the cost of that work will be capital expenditure. 54 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] References Subject references Capital/revenue Deductions Income tax Repairs and maintenance Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss DA 1 and DA 2 Income Tax Act 1976, s 108 Related rulings/statements IS0025 “Dairy Farming – Deductibility of certain expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000) IS10/01 “Residential rental properties – Depreciation of items of depreciable property” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010) Case references Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,408 (HC); (1999) 19 NZTC 15,011 (CA); (2000) 19 NZTC 15,702 (PC) Auckland Trotting Club (Inc) v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 193 (SC); \[1968\] NZLR 967 (CA) Bowland v R 2001 FCA 160, \[2001\] 3 CTC 109 CA BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1966\] AC 224 (PC) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Case F67 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,897 Case F78 (1984) 6 NZTC 59,951 Case J92 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,518 Case L68 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,398 Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052 Case X26 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,315 Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206 (HC) CIR v Auckland Gas Co Ltd \[1999\] 2 NZLR 418 (CA) CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) CIR v Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,834 (HC) CIR v LD Nathan and Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209 (CA) CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 (CA) Collector of Inland Revenue, Cook Islands v AB Donald Ltd \[1965\] NZLR 679 (SC) Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 (CA) Conn (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Robins Bros Ltd (1966) 43 TC 266 (Ch) Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 (HC) FCT v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd ( 1952) 86 CLR 102 Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 (HC) Highland Railway Co v Balderston (Surveyor of Taxes) (1889) 2 TC 485 (IH (1 Div)) Law Shipping Co Ltd v IR Commrs \[ 1924\] 12 TC 621 (IH (1 Div)) Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 (HCA); (1961) 106 CLR 392 (Full Ct HCA) Lurcott v Wakely and Wheeler \[1911\] 1 KB 905 Margrett (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Lowestoft Water and Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 (KB) Martinello v R 2010 TCC 432, 2010 DTC 1300 Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR ( 2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 (HC) Odeon Associated Theatres Ltd v Jones \[1973\] Ch 288 (CA) O'Grady (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Bullcroft Main Collieries Ltd (1932) 17 TC 93 (KB) Ounsworth (Surveyor of Taxes) v Vickers Ltd \[1915\] 3 KB 267 Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,779 (HC); \[1999\] 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA) Rhodesia Railways Ltd v Collector of Income Tax, Bechuanaland Protectorate \[1933\] AC 368 (PC) Thornton Estates Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,230 (HC) Samuel Jones & Co (Devondale) Ltd v CIR (1951) 32 TC 513 (IH (1 Div)) Sherlaw v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,290 (HC) Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer (Surveyor of Taxes) (1910) 5 TC 529 W Thomas & Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1965\] 115 CLR 58 55 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Appendix: Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 1.
