The Government’s objective is for the revenue system to be as fair and efficient as possible. For Inland Revenue customers, the revenue system should be simple to comply with, making obligations and entitlements easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. This discussion document explores some proposals for improving the way social policy entitlements and obligations are administered by Inland Revenue. These entitlement and obligation payments are: • Working for Families Tax Credits; • child support; • student loan repayments; and • KiwiSaver. The focus here is not on changing the fundamental policy settings. Rather, this document focuses on improving the way those social policies are administered by Inland Revenue, taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems. Improving the administration of social policy payments will mean more customers will receive the right amount at the right time. It will bring Inland Revenue closer to giving customers confidence that payments they receive are full and correct and will not have to be repaid, therefore reducing the possibility of debt to Inland Revenue. Payments will be able to reflect and quickly respond to changes in customers’ income. This can be achieved through basing payments on recent actual income over shorter periods than the current annual assessment, and making more frequent and manageable payments during the year. Customers will find it easier and simpler to provide Inland Revenue with the information required to apply for, receive or make their payments, or to update their family circumstances. Key definitions will be aligned and there will be greater flexibility for Inland Revenue to address unusual circumstances. CHAPTER 1 OVERVIEW 6 The changes proposed in this document, and covered in previous consultation documents, build on better information and administrative improvements to the way customers interact with Inland Revenue as a result of the modernisation of the revenue system. The changes will enable and encourage customers to manage their obligations and entitlements with speed and certainty using modern technology. A GOVERNMENT PROGRAMME OF ADMINISTRATIVE IMPROVEMENT Building on the 2015 Green Paper A good social policy system can be thought of as having good policy supported by good administration. The starting point for the 2015 Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) is that New Zealand has a good tax and social policy system. The opportunity before Government is to make it even better. The Green Paper reflected on how the social policies administered by Inland Revenue had been incrementally changed over many years. Those policies were grafted into an existing tax administration system – a system which was primarily designed to support tax policy. The Green Paper outlined some early high-level thoughts on how to improve Inland Revenue’s administration of social policies, by designing policies and processes that would be customer-focused and "fit for purpose". Focusing on the customer is a key feature of the changes being made to Inland Revenue – making it easier for customers to get their obligations and entitlements right from the start, difficult to get wrong and making it easier to correct any errors or update any changes in circumstances. Social policy payments should be calculated on a more responsive basis, provide more certainty for individuals and families, and result in less debt. There would be a shift towards using existing information to help customers get the right payment at the right time. Information sharing and Better Public Services The proposals are part of a wider public sector programme of change. Inland Revenue is also involved in information sharing and cross-agency work to improve public services, such as SmartStart.¹ Information sharing has the potential to improve the information used to administer social policies in Inland Revenue and the administration of social policies by other Government agencies. Some of these proposals are covered in the Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act discussion document, and also in the consultation on the Approved Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development. Inland Revenue works with other agencies to deliver social policy. In particular, it works with the Ministry of Social Development on the delivery of Working for Families Tax Credits to beneficiaries and applications for child support, and with StudyLink on the transfer of student loans. ¹SmartStart is a website that provides step-by-step information and support to help parents access the right information and services for them and their baby. See more information at https://smartstart.services.govt.nz 7 These arrangements are expected to continue. The social policy proposals follow on from previous consultation documents This document is the ninth in the Making Tax Simpler series, which began in March 2015. The Green Paper proposed that changes would be considered and introduced in sequential stages. The social policy proposals take into account earlier changes to digital technology, GST, PAYE, investment income, business tax and individuals’ end-of-year tax obligations. Ultimately, the Making Tax Simpler proposals seek to make it easier for customers to get their payments and entitlements right from the start. Although each previous consultation document focused on a particular area, those proposals will impact on the administration of social policy as well. The Better digital services discussion document identified the major role of digital technology in making tax and social policy simpler for New Zealanders. The PAYE system collects information and payments from employees’ salary and wages for tax and social policy purposes, such as student loan deductions and child support payments. The Better administration of PAYE and GST discussion document explored possible changes to simplify the KiwiSaver enrolment process and how integrating the provision of PAYE information into the payroll process would reduce compliance and administrative costs. It proposed providing more frequent employment information, which could improve several processes, including calculating social policy payments. These proposals are included in a Bill currently before Parliament.² These changes will contribute to the proposals outlined in this document to shorten the period of assessment for social policies.

It also considered proposals to better use existing and new information to make it easier for customers to interact, to update their tax codes promptly and address issues with secondary tax. A similar approach would also be used for social policy information. The proposals in this discussion document provide the opportunity to: • ensure customers receive their correct entitlements or fully meet their obligations by making the rules and processes easier to understand; • provide greater certainty around payments; • make payments more accurate and improve the access to and timing of payments; and • improve agility while maintaining the coherence and integrity of the system. A core principle underpinning these proposals is that people should not be entitled to any less government support than they are currently entitled to receive. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS The Government is interested in your feedback on the proposals in this discussion document as summarised on the following pages. The Better business tax officials’ issues paper discussed alternatives to current provisional tax methods. Subsequent legislative amendments include the new Accounting Income Method (AIM), which uses provisional information provided by businesses more frequently, resulting in provisional tax payments that better reflect the income patterns of businesses. AIM will be available from 1 April 2018. Information provided under AIM could also be used for improving the accuracy of social policy payments. The amendments also removed the 1% incremental late payment penalty on Working for Families Tax Credit debt. The Investment income information discussion document explored providing more investment income information (in some cases more frequently) and also looked at how the quality of the information provided could be improved. These proposals are also included in a Bill currently before Parliament. Again, this information means the Government can consider shorter periods of assessment for social policies. The discussion documents Towards a new Tax Administration Act and Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act examined some of the core concepts in the Tax Administration Act, focusing on the roles of the Commissioner, taxpayers, intermediaries and information. This included discussion and proposals about the collection of information, and better use of information sharing, including in the social policy context. 9 year to better estimate income and make instalment payments, with an end-of-year square-up to confirm actual income. These options would be supported by an end-of-year check to ensure that families had not missed out on any of their annual entitlement owing to changing income. Child support There are four options: • Retain the past income annual assessment but shift the start of the child support year so that it is after income tax obligations are completed. This would mean more recent annual income can be used to determine payments. • With observable income – look at recent income over a shorter fixed period and current family circumstances to determine the entitlement for the current period. • With observable income – use income information as it is provided to Inland Revenue to calculate an annualised figure and adjust ongoing payments accordingly, with a reassessment whenever new information is reported. • With non-observable income – use information provided through the year to estimate income and make instalment payments, with an end-of-year square-up to confirm actual income. Chapter 4: Better payment options • Child support liable parents who have employment income would Chapter 3: Making payments certain, accurate and timely • Assessments would continue to be based on current family circumstances, such as residence, employment or benefit status, and care of children. • If the customer’s income is already known to Inland Revenue during the year (observable income), Working for Families Tax Credits or child support amounts would be based on recent actual income information provided throughout the year. • If a customer’s income is not known to Inland Revenue during the year or not confirmed during the year (non-observable income), Working for Families Tax Credits or child support amounts would be based on estimates of income or recent income information from previous years. Working for Families Tax Credits There are three options: • With observable income – look at recent income over a fixed period and current family circumstances to determine the entitlement for the current period. • With observable income – use income information as it is reported to Inland Revenue to calculate an annualised figure and adjust ongoing payments accordingly, with a reassessment whenever new income information is reported. • With non-observable income – use information provided through the 10 • A small balance write-off would apply consistently across the social policies. • A range of options would be available for most customers to manage an overpayment or missed payment. • Penalties and/or interest would not apply while overpayments or missed payments are being actively managed. • Inland Revenue would be able to set a due date and impose penalties and/or interest when the debt is not being managed, there is fraud or the customer has a history of non-compliance. Chapter 6: Aligning and updating key definitions • Align the wording of key definitions when they relate to the same concept across different social policies. • Align the rules for shared care of a dependent child at a minimum of 35 percent of ongoing care with reference to any care orders, and a default measure of number of nights in care for the period of the shared arrangement or what is most appropriate in the circumstances. • Align the maximum age of a child to be at the end of the calendar year they turn 18. • Change the definition of "financially independent" to refer to a set dollar amount rather than 30 hours of work a week, and ensure the benefit reference is to being on a benefit or receiving a full-rate student allowance. have compulsory deductions from salary and wages or schedular payments. • Child support liable parents who do not have compulsory deductions would have to pay more frequently and earlier than currently. • Child support obligations could be met through payments made directly to third parties that are of direct benefit to the child, subject to conditions. • Child support payments could be available for receiving carers as soon as they are received (or deemed to be received) by Inland Revenue. • Receiving carers would have options for how frequently they receive payments, including at the same time as they receive Working for Families Tax Credits. • Student loan borrowers with adjusted net income such as schedular, casual agricultural or election-day income would be required to use the SL tax code to make student loan repayments. • Student loan borrowers with other forms of adjusted net income would be required to make more regular payments throughout the year. Chapter 5: Managing missed payments and overpayments better • Overpayments and missed payments of Working for Families Tax Credits and student loans would be addressed promptly rather than waiting until a 7 February due date. 11 Appendix 2 shows a comparison of the different definitions of income. INVITATION TO COMMENT You are invited to make a submission on whether the proposed changes in this discussion document would improve the administration of social policy for customers and what impact you think they would have. Questions in Chapters 3 to 6 offer specific points for you to consider and comment on.

Collects repayments from student loan borrowers. Working for Families Tax Credits Administers Working for Families Tax Credits jointly with the Ministry of Social Development. Comprises five tax credits: • family tax credit; • in-work tax credit; • parental tax credit; • child tax credit (closed to new customers); and • minimum family tax credit. Kiwisaver Collects contributions and transfers them to KiwiSaver providers for investment. Pays the member tax credit. Current spend and recipients³ • $1.2 billion student loan repayments collected. • 730,000 total borrowers. • 105,000 borrowers with an overdue student loan debt. • $2.4 billion Working for Families Tax Credits paid. • $5 billion KiwiSaver funds passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers. • 2.6 million people enrolled. CHAPTER 2 WHY THE NEED TO CHANGE? ³The figures in this table have come from Inland Revenue’s 2016 Annual Report. 14 Child support Collects child support payments from liable parents and distributes these payments to carers and the Crown. Paid parental leave Makes payments (on behalf of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment) to parents who take leave from their employment to care for a baby. • $474 million child support payments from 170,000 liable parents. • $280 million paid to carers, the balance was retained by the Government to offset against the cost of benefits paid. • $217 million paid parental leave distributed to parents. • 26,300 parents a year. Working for Families Tax Credits assist families with children with the cost of living and help improve the returns from working. Child support helps ensure that parents are contributing to the cost of caring for their children. Student loans help with the cost of higher education, and for domestic borrowers is repaid according to their income. KiwiSaver helps customers to save for retirement. Further information on these social policies can be found on Inland Revenue’s website. Paid parental leave is not covered in this discussion document. CHALLENGES WITH DELIVERING SOCIAL POLICIES WITHIN A TAX ADMINISTRATION An effective social policy system requires both good policy and good administration. Without good administration, the policy will not achieve the outcomes that Government and customers want. The tax administration system has some advantages for delivering income-based social policies, such as strong links to income information and a wide customer base. It also has characteristics that mean it is not fully "fit for purpose". These characteristics include the annual April to March tax-year cycle, the extension of time for filing, and the focus on making the customer get their income details right, backed by strong penalty rules. The outcome of a tax administration approach to social policy raises questions about the timeliness and accuracy of payments, including whether the approach is responsive to the changing needs of customers. Delays and the complexity of the rules can impact on customers’ decisions to enter work or study, especially when savings are limited and income 15 is tight. Uncertainty over the level and timing of payments, as well as whether they are correct, can affect the decisions customers make. For example, some families will choose to wait and only apply for tax credits at the end of the tax year to avoid the risk of being overpaid during the year and incurring debt. Inland Revenue was assigned administration of the different social policies over several decades, with some transferred from other agencies and some specifically designed for Inland Revenue. The result is customers are now faced with different rules and processes for their various payments. It is complex and confusing, making it difficult for customers to understand their obligations or claim their correct entitlements. If customers do not know what the rules are, they are less likely to comply, more likely to get it wrong or give up trying. The modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at the administrative rules and processes for the social policies Inland Revenue administers. Better administration of the social policy payments will go some way towards making them less complex and easier to understand. The new systems are also intended to have better agility so any changes Governments make to the complexity of the policy settings can be implemented more efficiently. FOUR OBJECTIVES GUIDING THE SOCIAL POLICY PROPOSALS Four main objectives were used to guide improvements to the administration of social policy: • Focus on the customer to ensure they get correct entitlements – take-up rates should be high and customers should receive all their entitlements available under the law when they are needed. This will help to ensure the policy objectives are achieved. Similarly, everyone should fully meet payment obligations for child support or student loans. Payments should be easy to get right and hard to get wrong. To do this the administration would need to be: Ĕeasier to understand – customers are more likely to take up entitlements and meet their obligations if they know what the rules are – if the rules are intuitive and fit in with the key events in their lives; and Ĕeasier to access – the level of customer effort should be low and information should be easy to update (especially changes in circumstances) and reused across different social policy payments. • Provide certainty and predictability so customers can budget and make decisions about their future with less risk or stress. They will know what changes will mean for their future social policy payments. Ideally, when customers receive payments they should have confidence to spend the money and not worry that Inland Revenue will ask for any of it back. 16 THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS DISCUSSION DOCUMENT The main focus of the proposals in this discussion document is on the family-based Working for Families Tax Credits and child support payments. However, some of the proposals can also be applied to the repayment of student loans for domestic borrowers who earn income other than salary and wages. Following on from the Green Paper discussion document reflecting the four objectives, this discussion document looks at proposals to: • improve the accuracy, certainty and timeliness of payments for Working for Families Tax Credits, child support and student loan repayments (in Chapters 3 and 4); • prevent debt being incurred from customers missing payments to Inland Revenue or from being overpaid entitlements (in Chapters 4 and 5); • align and update common definitions (in Chapter 6); and • work with people who have unusual or exceptional circumstances differently to achieve better outcomes (in Chapter 7). • Provide for timely and accurate payments – payments need to adjust quickly to reflect changes in customers’ lives, such as new relationships or moving into work. A process that responds quickly to deliver the right amount at the right time based on current circumstances is ideal. • Provide for an agile system that can easily and quickly change to reflect the Government’s policies and priorities or changes in customer expectations while maintaining coherence and integrity. This will build trust in the payments, the system as a whole and Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver. The challenge is that these objectives can sometimes conflict. For example, some people will prefer the certainty of constant payments even if the payments do not accurately reflect their current situation. Others will prefer more accurate payments that quickly adjust with changes in circumstances. Please bear in mind these objectives and consider which objectives are more important to you when commenting on specific proposals. Also consider concerns about equity and fairness between customers, and efficiency and effectiveness for delivering the right outcomes. In addition to meeting these objectives, it is a core principle of the proposals that people should not be entitled to any less government support than they are currently entitled to receive. 17 Working for Families Tax Credits There are three options: • With observable income – look at recent income over a fixed period and current family circumstances to determine the entitlement for the current period. • With observable income – use income information as it is reported to Inland Revenue to calculate an annualised figure and adjust ongoing payments accordingly, with a reassessment whenever new income information is reported. • With non-observable income – use information provided through the year to better estimate income and make instalment payments, with an end-of-year square-up to confirm actual income. Child support There are four options: • Retain the past income annual assessment but shift the start of the child support year so that it is after income tax obligations are completed. This would mean more recent annual income can be used to determine payments. This chapter discusses proposed changes to: • Working for Families Tax Credits; and • child support. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS IN THIS CHAPTER • Assessments would continue to be based on current family circumstances, such as residence, employment or benefit status, and care of children. • If a customer’s income is already known to Inland Revenue during the year (observable income), Working for Families Tax Credits or child support amounts would be based on recent actual income information provided throughout the year. • If a customer’s income is not known to Inland Revenue during the year or not confirmed during the year (non-observable income), Working for Families Tax Credits or child support amounts would be based on estimates of income or past income information from previous years. CHAPTER 3 MAKING PAYMENTS CERTAIN, ACCURATE AND TIMELY 18 • With observable income – look at recent income over a shorter fixed period and current family circumstances to determine the entitlement for the current period. • With observable income – use income information as it is provided to Inland Revenue to calculate an annualised figure and adjust ongoing payments accordingly, with a reassessment whenever new information is reported. • With non-observable income – use information provided through the year to estimate income and make instalment payments, with an end-of -year square-up to confirm actual income. DETERMINING ENTITLEMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS Generally, two elements are used to determine entitlements and obligations for income-targeted social policies. First, does the person or their family meet the entry criteria for the social policy? Second, how much income do they have? The first determines if they qualify for that social policy, while the second determines the amount of the obligation or entitlement. The Government proposes several options for improving how Working for Families Tax Credits are administered. Each has an emphasis on different objectives of timeliness, accuracy and consistency. The Government is interested in which of these options customers most prefer and why. Family or individual circumstances Whether a person or their family meets the entry criteria for a social policy depends on their circumstances. For example, the family tax credit depends on the recipient having children in their care, and the in-work tax credit also requires that a single person works 20 hours or more a week and does not receive a main benefit.⁴ Payments are expected to continue to reflect current family or individual circumstances, such as whether the person is currently caring for a child or residing in New Zealand. This is important to ensure policy objectives are met. The onus will continue to be on the customer to keep Inland Revenue informed of any changes in their family or individual circumstances that affect their entitlements or obligations. Amount of income Most social policies administered by Inland Revenue use an annual income assessment – often using the same annual period as income tax (1 April to 31 March). This is modified in various ways to create weekly, fortnightly, monthly or annual payments but these are still based on an annual income assessment. This reflects that for tax purposes income is determined on an annual basis and social policy payments are administered within the tax system. For Working for Families Tax Credits, customers look forward and estimate their annual family income for the tax year. Instalment payments are then based on those estimates. Alternatively, the family can wait until QUESTIONS FOR READERS 3.1 Which is the least important to you of these three objectives? • Certainty – what you get paid is correct. • Timeliness – payments adjust quickly to changes in your income. • Consistency – payments are constant over time and don’t change from month to month. ⁴Main benefits include Jobseeker Support, Sole Parent Support and Supported Living Payment. 3.2 Which is the most important to you of these three objectives? • Certainty – what you get paid is correct. • Timeliness – payments adjust quickly to changes in your income. • Consistency – payments are constant over time and don’t change from month to month. 19 OPPORTUNITY FOR A NEW APPROACH TO HOW INCOME IS ASSESSED the end of the tax year, report income actually earned in that tax year and receive a lump sum payment. Child support takes the approach of using past annual income information, from either the previous calendar year or two tax years back. However, if the customer has a significant drop in income, they can estimate their income for the remainder of the current child support year.⁵ A square- up at the end of the year determines how close the estimate was to actual income. The square-up only applies to the part of the year the estimate was for. Student loan domestic borrowers with wages or salary automatically repay their loans through deductions from their employment income, with repayments reflecting the length of their pay period. Borrowers with adjusted net income⁶ make repayments at the end of the year and sometimes in the following year based on adjusted net income received in the past year. Observable income = income information that is provided to Inland Revenue by a third party such as an employer during the year and includes child support payments made through Inland Revenue. Non-observable income = income information that is not reported from a third party during the year and is provided directly by the customer. ⁵The child support year is the same as a tax year – 1 April to 31 March. ⁶"Adjusted net income" is a defined term in the student loan legislation and covers a wide range of sources of income. It generally means income other than wages or salary. 20 If the income is not observable (for example, overseas income or distributions of trust income), another approach is required. In some cases Inland Revenue and the customer will only know at the end of the year what their income is – for this group an annual assessment will have to remain. In other cases new information might allow for better estimates and payments during the year. The new Accounting Income Method (AIM) for calculating and paying provisional tax will give Inland Revenue a clearer picture of the income being earned by some small business owners during the tax year. Having different assessments based on whether the income information is observable or non-observable From 1 April 2019, Inland Revenue expects to receive employment income information shortly after each payday. From 1 April 2020, financial institutions will provide information on interest earned and dividends paid every month. This means that Inland Revenue will know, and be able to observe, most of the income of most social policy customers from these sources as it is paid during the year. If the customer’s income is observable during the year, the Government proposes that Inland Revenue would be able to assess Working for Families Tax Credits or child support amounts based on recent actual income information provided throughout the year, as it does now for student loan repayments. EMPLOYERS BANKS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Customer must provide information about other income Non-observable income Observable income SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS (AIM) OBSERVABLE VS NON-OBSERVABLE INCOME 21 Total families (number) 1,850 152,382 87,646 58,023 65,307 365,208 Total families (%) 0.5% 41.7% 24.0% 15.9% 17.9% 100.0% Paid during the year by Inland Revenue Exactly correct⁷ Underpayment Overpayment Lump sum paid after the end of year No square-up⁸ Total The estimates approach means payments are almost always wrong A summary of how Working for Families Tax Credits are currently determined is set out in Appendix 1. Families that get paid Working for Families Tax Credits during the year are required to estimate their income for the year ahead and have a "square- up" of the estimate with their actual income at the end of the year. The result is often that families end up being overpaid and at risk of penalties and interest, or underpaid and not receiving the full support when it is needed. Some families prefer to avoid the risk of debt by seeking a lump sum payment only at the end of the year. For the 2015 tax year, as at the beginning of June 2016, there were nearly 300,000 families who had a square-up. is similar to proposals in the Better administration of individuals’ income tax discussion document. That document proposes that income tax filing obligations be based on whether income has been reported during the year. The Better administration of individuals’ income tax discussion document also discusses how Working for Families Tax Credits customers with only reportable types of income would no longer need to file end-of- year tax returns solely because they are social policy customers, as Inland Revenue would already hold all the required income information. Working for Families Tax Credits The proposals would apply to the family tax credit, the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit but would not apply to the minimum family tax credit as it is calculated as a top-up payment rather than an abated credit. ⁷Exactly correct in this context means the total Working for Families Tax Credits paid during the year were within $1 of the annual entitlement. ⁸The vast majority of those with no square-up were beneficiaries paid by the Ministry of Social Development and are assumed to be paid correctly. The rest have not yet filed for the 2015 tax year. 22 QUESTIONS FOR READERS 3.3 Do you like the approach where you don’t have to tell Inland Revenue about changes in employment income or interest and dividends, with Inland Revenue adjusting payments automatically as information is received from employers, banks or companies? 3.4 For Working for Families Tax Credits, do you see value in moving away from estimating annual income with an end-of-year square- up and towards using recent actual income information? Customers will be encouraged to regularly update their circumstances, and non-observable income estimates, and Inland Revenue will use information it receives during the year to pro-actively encourage this. Some customers may be required to re-estimate their income quarterly – such as seasonal workers or part-year workers. However, administrative improvements, supported by legislative changes,¹⁰ will not address all issues with the annual assessment approach, in particular when an increase in income later in the year means earlier payments of Working for Families Tax Credits have to be repaid. Nor will it fully address the problems with over and underpayments that arise from using an estimate of income and the uncertainty this causes. It is proposed that the option of a lump sum payment after the end of the year would still be available. Using more recent income information and a fixed shorter assessment period By using observable income information received during the year, the Government proposes an option that looks at recent past income information and uses this to calculate Working for Families Tax Credits. The entitlement would be based on a period shorter than a year. The length of the shorter period of time is a question the Government is interested in hearing views on and is discussed later in this chapter. The examples use four weeks or a month, but it could also be quarterly periods or a number of weeks to match pay periods. Under this option, at the end of each When a customer has been overpaid Working for Families Tax Credits, they have until 7 February to repay the amount. If the amount is not repaid it becomes debt and is subject to the interest and penalty rules. Of the families that were overpaid for the 2015 tax year: • 46.1 percent fully repaid the overpayment before the due date; • 53.9 percent did not repay the overpayment before the due date; and of these: Ĕ18.8 percent have now fully repaid the overpayment and any interest and penalties; and Ĕ35.1 percent remain in debt. For a majority of those who are overpaid or underpaid during the year the difference between their annual entitlement and instalments is within 20 percent of their entitlement, so the estimate is relatively close, but for a third of customers the difference is greater than 20 percent.⁹ The annual period of assessment can also lead to inconsistencies. Customers who are on a main benefit are assessed monthly, whereas families who have similarly low incomes in a month, but are not receiving a main benefit, are assessed on an annual basis. Improving the estimation of annual income The extensive changes being made to modernise Inland Revenue’s systems mean administrative improvements would be made to the current estimation of annual income (both observable and non-observable). ⁹See page 47 of the 2016 Annual Report for Inland Revenue. ¹⁰For example, schedule 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which automatically adjusts customers’ income estimates upwards, would be removed. 23 period the income details for that period would be checked and used to calculate tax credits to be paid in the next period. As it takes time for Inland Revenue to process it, the payment period will always lag slightly behind the income period. For example, the May entitlement could be based on income information received for March. This information would be received by Inland Revenue in April and used to calculate May entitlements. This option reduces much of the inaccuracy that currently occurs from trying to estimate income. March income information collected May payments based on March income MARAPRMAY JUN JULAUG April income information collected June payments based on April income May income information collected July payments based on May income There would be no requirement for customers to update annual income estimates during the year or undergo a square-up calculation at the end of the year. There would be no under or overpayments as a result of income changes as actual income is being used. Working for Families Tax Credits debt would be greatly reduced as a result. Families would know that whatever they receive they keep, as long as their family circumstances are correct.

These will change on 1 April 2018. Murray and Amy have a four-year- old daughter Kate. Amy stays at home and looks after Kate while Murray works. Under the current annual system they estimate their family income will be $60,500 for the year. Their Working for Families payments are $60 each week ($3,120 over the year). The nature of Murray’s job means there are periods of high earnings and times when there is limited work available so it is difficult for them to estimate exactly. At the end of the year their income is confirmed as $62,578 and their actual annual entitlement is calculated as $2,690.70. This means they have been overpaid by nearly $430. If they are unable to repay this by the due date they will be charged penalties and interest. Under the shorter periods of assessment proposal, their Working for Families Tax Credits would be based on actual income received in a previous period, removing the need to estimate. MUR R AY AND AMY 25 QUESTIONS FOR READERS 3.5 How important is it that payments react quickly to a change in income, compared to remaining mostly constant? 3.6 How quickly should payments change in response to income changes? What is the appropriate period to consider past income information? For example, daily, each pay period, four-weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually? Why do you prefer that period of time? to the current annual system, could be different – they could receive more or receive less. The difference would depend on a number of factors, including: • the length of the period of assessment (a shorter period of assessment would create greater differences); and • the amount of income they receive in a period compared to the abatement threshold and the point at which payments are fully abated. If a family has income that is below the abatement threshold for some periods and income that is above the abatement threshold in other periods, they would receive less in 12 months compared to the current annual system. This is most likely to affect families whose income is near $36,350 (that is, the abatement threshold). It is proposed that these families would receive a catch-up payment to make sure they received their full annual entitlement based on their end-of- year income. A family with income in some periods above the full abatement threshold and some periods below would receive more than under the current annual system. A further example of the potential impact of this proposal is shown on the following pages. Under this approach, payments of Working for Families Tax Credits would automatically adjust during the year as income varies rather than staying mostly constant. This could impact on a family's ability to budget and plan ahead. Customers would be notified of each period’s entitlement, and online calculators would help customers see the impact an income change has on payments. Depending on how their income fluctuates during the year, a family would receive different amounts of entitlement at different times compared to the current annual assessment basis. The payments would more closely match variations in income, with more paid after low periods of income and less paid after high periods of income. There are two exceptions. First, if a family’s income remains under the abatement threshold,¹¹ a change in income between periods would have no effect – they would continue to receive the maximum payment. Second, if a family’s income remains above the point of full abatement, they would continue to receive no payment. The impact is mainly for those who earn over the abatement threshold and below the point of full abatement – that is, they are entitled to an abated payment. Payments would more closely match their income in recent periods and there would not be the risk of over or underpayments. However, total payments over time would also potentially change due to the shorter assessment period. For some families the entitlements they receive over 12 monthly periods or 13 four-weekly periods, compared ¹¹The annual abatement threshold as at 1 April 2017 is $36,350. An equivalent monthly abatement threshold would be around $3,030. 26 Working for Families Tax Credits payments 4 week periods Employment Shorter Annual period based on income periods estimates 1 $3,231 $563.08 $396 2 $3,923 $407.38 $396 3 $3,969 $397.03 $396 4 $6,492 $0.00 $396 5 $6,492 $0.00 $396 6 $4,615 $251.68 $227 7 $4,577 $260.23 $227 8 $4,538 $269.01 $227 9 $4,654 $242.91 $227 10 $4,692 $234.36 $227 11 $3,615 $476.68 $277 12 $2,546 $660.92 $316 13 $2,615 $660.62 $316 Total $55,959 $4,424.22 $3,974 Entitlement based on actual income $4,424.22 $4,179.98 End-of-year payment $0 $ 205.98 Note: Numbers are based on current Working for Families Tax Credits settings. These will change on 1 April 2018. Jack and Ann have a nine-year-old son Lynn. The family estimate at the start of the year that they will earn $51,500. The nature of Jack’s job means the family’s income fluctuates, and they try their best to update their income estimate. After a period of high earnings they increase their estimate in September to $57,500. In February after a period of low earnings they change their estimate again to $56,000. Under the shorter periods of assessment proposal, Jack and Ann would not need to tell us about these income changes. At the end of the year they confirm their income is $55,959 and their actual annual entitlement is calculated at $4,179.98. This means even though they tried their best to estimate their income correctly they have been underpaid by $205.98. Under the shorter periods of assessment proposal, Jack and Ann’s Working for Families Tax Credits would automatically adjust as Jack’s income changes. This better reflects the family’s income and need at the time. They no longer need to update their income during the year if it changes, and no longer need an end of year square-up. While Jack and Ann would receive more under shorter periods than they would under the annual period, this additional amount would not need to be repaid. JACK AND ANN 27 quarter of the year), is that the delay between the time that income decreases and the time that Working for Families Tax Credits increase could raise cashflow issues for some families. A benefit of the proposal to have a shorter period of assessment is that this problem is much less of an issue. However, if having a longer period of assessment is ultimately preferred, consideration could be given to mitigating these cashflow issues by providing an option which would allow some payments to be brought foward as an advance. Using recent income information with continuous reassessments as information is received Another option for families with observable income would be to base assessments on the customer’s most recent income information. As income changes during the year, the family’s entitlement would adjust in response. Using past income to determine payments in a later period means a delay between income received and payments adjusting. Two scenarios are worth considering: • If a family’s income increases, their Working for Families Tax Credits would not decrease until the following payment period. There would be a period in-between in which the family would be earning a higher income without a reduction in tax credits. • If a family’s income decreases, their Working for Families Tax Credits would not increase until the following payment period. There would be a period in- between in which the family would be earning a lower family income without any increase in tax credits. A problem with having a longer period of assessment (such as a PROPOSED OPTION FOR OBSERVABLE INCOME: CONTINUOUS REASSESSMENTS Materiality thresholds would be applied to prevent making changes for very small changes in income Income Working for Families Tax Credits Overtime Pay increase New baby Same SameSameSameSameSameSameSameSame SameSameSameSameSameChangeChangeChange $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ ChangeChange $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ SameSameSame $0 Same $$$ $$ Same 28 The income information would be used to calculate a daily entitlement amount that would continue to be paid (weekly or fortnightly) until Inland Revenue receives the next income information and calculates an updated amount. Customers would be notified of the change in payment. The advantage of this proposal is that income changes would be taken into account as soon as the information is reported to Inland Revenue. How frequently payments change would depend on how often income information changes. For some customers with regular income, or no changes in family circumstances, there may be only a few changes during the year. Also, if income remains below the abatement threshold, a change in income would not change the level of entitlement. For others there may be several changes every month, reflecting a high degree of change in their income or family circumstances. Not every change would trigger a reassessment. There would be thresholds applied to prevent changes to payments for very small changes in income. As with the earlier option, the shift from an annual assessment to continuous reassessments would mean customers receive different amounts at different times. JOANNE Example of continuous reassessment Joanne works 30 hours a week for $1,200 per fortnight. She gets $69.54 a fortnight in child support payments. Inland Revenue receives her income information shortly after each payday and, along with her child support received, calculates an equivalent annual family income of $33,094. Joanne is paid the maximum Working for Families payment of $328 a fortnight. During a busy period at work Joanne agrees to work the next four Saturday shifts. As a result her next two fortnightly pays are $1,520. Inland Revenue receives this information and calculates an annual figure of $39,628. Her child support received hasn’t changed (an annual amount of $1,808), making her equivalent annual family income $41,436. This changes how much Working for Families Tax Credits she will receive in the next two fortnightly pays – the payment will drop to $276 a fortnight. When Joanne returns to normal shifts her pay goes back to $1,200 a fortnight. Inland Revenue receives this information and recalculates the equivalent annual income ($33,094). Fortnightly payments of Working for Families Tax Credits go back to $328. 29 Low High High Low Medium High Regular income declarations End-of-year lump sum Annual income estimate CertaintyRegular paymentsCompliance costs No regular payments Payments throughout the year Payments throughout the year Using declarations of non-observable income information to make assessments When a customer has business income, they may be providing provisional information through the Accounting Income Method (AIM). This could be used by Inland Revenue to recalculate Working for Families Tax Credits entitlements for the next AIM period. The entitlements would be reassessed each time new information is provided through AIM. Customers not using Accounting Income Method (AIM) could provide information on their business income for the previous two months, for example. This information would be used to recalculate their Working for Families Tax Credits entitlements for the next two months. Inland Revenue would reassess the entitlements each time new information is submitted. QUESTION FOR READERS 3.7 If you have non-observable income, do you see benefit in an option that uses more information declared during the year to set interim payments? What would be the best period of assessment given there would be compliance costs from providing more frequent information? OPTIONS FOR NON-OBSERVABLE INCOME the current annual estimate would remain in place with improvements, or customers could provide additional income information throughout the year and have payments based on shorter periods. There would continue to be an end-of- year square-up to check actual income for the year against information provided during the year. When income is not observable The options are more constrained when Inland Revenue is not receiving income information from a third party during the year. In this situation the Government proposes that either 30 Child support As with the proposals for Working for Families Tax Credits, the Government has considered several options to improve the administration of child support. It is proposed that an annual income assessment would be retained. In some cases Inland Revenue does not have the necessary information for some parents to use other options (for example, those parents living overseas). Changing the child support year to use more timely income information One option to improve the timeliness year to a period after income tax obligations are finalised – for example, July. Child support assessments could then be made using income confirmed from the previous tax year (rather than the last calendar year or two years ago). All the customer’s income, including interest income, would be used in the assessment as set out in Chapter 6. This could improve the timeliness of the income information used but would not address the issues arising when income changes during the year or the difficulties with estimating current year income. To get full advantage of using confirmed income information shortly after the end of the tax year, the extension of time rules for filing through a tax agent would also need to be considered. File income tax return for April - March of the previous tax year Apr Mar FEB FEB Jul Aug Aug Change the start of the child support year to a period after income tax obligations are finalised Currently if income is only from salary and wages or interest, the salary and wages from the previous calendar year are used as the annual income figure. If other types of income are received the last filed tax return income is used – which can be income from two years prior to the current child support year. Assessments for child support are currently done in February each year Proposed child support year Current child support year Mar Apr of income information for child support assessments, whether observable or non-observable, is to change the start of the child support QUESTION FOR READERS 3.8 For child support do you see value in moving to shorter, more recent periods of past income information? CHANGING THE CHILD SUPPORT YEAR TO A PERIOD AFTER INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS ARE FINALISED 31 For changes that are over the materiality threshold, Inland Revenue would make the adjustments and notify customers of payment changes. Some customers could end up with many reassessments during the year as their or the other parent’s income changes. If a customer has business income and is providing provisional information about their income through AIM, Inland Revenue could use it to reassess child support obligations for the next AIM period. Those who are not using AIM could provide regular information about their business income for the previous one or two months, which Inland Revenue could use to reassess their entitlements for the next period. At the end of the year the actual annual income would be compared to the provisional information and any adjustments would be made. If the customer is the liable parent and they provide information showing no income for a period, the minimum child support obligation would apply. At the end of the child support year, the actual income for the year would be compared to the provisional information reported during the year, and over or underpayments determined. This is broadly similar to the current estimations process but utilises better information about the way the parent earns income during the year. While the payments may be more timely under this option, they are less certain than the current system. Using observable income information with fixed shorter assessment periods Another option is to keep using recent actual income information but to shorten the period to something more recent, such as the previous month. This is similar to the option to use shorter periods for Working for Families Tax Credits assessments. The income information used would be more current and more likely to reflect the liable parent’s ability to pay and the level of support required by the receiving carer. For example, the May child support assessment could be based on the income information received in March. Because child support requires the income of both parents to determine who is the liable parent and the amount of child support to be paid, both parents would ideally need to have the same period of assessment for their income. Using past observable income information with continuous reassessments Another option is to use past income information to determine the assessment but to reassess payments when either parent has a change in income. Reassessments would be made only when new income information (or changes in family circumstances) is reported, for example, from employers. A materiality threshold would be required to ignore very small changes in income. In the earlier Working for Families Tax Credits example, Joanne’s change in fortnightly pay would mean about 40 cents difference in fortnightly child support payments. 32 A longer period of assessment means: variability in income is less relevant, as highs and lows in weekly income are offset against each other payments are less volatile, more consistent and reliable, making it easier to budget payments are less responsive to changes in income, so it will take a while for payments to change after income changes customers who would be declaring their non-observable income for the period would have fewer interactions with Inland Revenue A shorter period of assessment means: variability in income is more relevant, as high and low income periods matter more to the level of payment there is more volatility in payments, so customers may not know what they will be paid, or be required to pay, in the future payments would respond faster to changes in income, so they more closely reflect current income, needs and ability to pay customers with non-observable income would have to provide information to Inland Revenue more often QUESTION FOR READERS 3.9 What factors should the Government take into account when setting the period? Balancing timeliness and consistency in setting the period of assessment One of the key features of the options outlined for both Working for Families Tax Credits and child support is the use of shorter periods of assessment such as monthly or daily (continuous). There is no perfect length of assessment period that suits everyone. Different groups of customers will have their own preferences and reasons for wanting payments measured over different periods of time. This comes down to trade-offs between different objectives, mostly the timeliness of payments (how quickly payments can change to reflect changes in income) and consistency (how long payments stay the same). 33 solely due to the number of weeks in each month or quarter. There would be less variability in income information and assessments if the period was four or eight weeks, for example. The Government is interested in whether customers prefer shorter or longer periods of assessment and why. NO CHANGE TO ANNUAL ASSESSMENT FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS For domestic borrowers with salary and wages, the current system of payday deductions would continue to apply. Repayments are deducted from wages and paid to Inland Revenue alongside PAYE. The amount of the deduction is calculated based on the income earned in that pay period. There are no repayment changes if you are an overseas-based borrower and have no New Zealand In comparison, most main benefit payments are based on weekly income assessments, although some benefits are assessed on annual income. Paid parental leave is based on an average of weekly income over the previous 26 or 52 weeks (depending on how long the person has worked). For families whose only income is a main benefit, their Working for Families Tax Credits entitlement is assessed monthly rather than annually for the months they receive the benefit. This is explained further in Appendix 1. In the United Kingdom, the universal credit payment is based on monthly income assessments (as monthly pay periods are common). Consideration will be given to payday cycles. Months or quarters will have different numbers of payday cycles, especially in leap years. This can create extra variability in income INCOME INCOME Working for Families Tax Credits payments Working for Families Tax Credits payments MORE RESPONSIVE LESS RESPONSIVE LESS CONSISTENT MORE CONSISTENT MORE INTERACTION WITH INLAND REVENUE LESS INTERACTION WITH INLAND REVENUE SHORTER VS LONGER PERIOD 34 employment income. The remaining concern is how domestic borrowers with other sources of income (known as "adjusted net income") such as investment income and business income, can make loan payments during the year as their income is earned, rather than waiting until the end of the year. It is proposed that the annual assessment for domestic borrowers with adjusted net income will be retained. However, the Government proposes to collect payments during the year as income is earned, to avoid the requirement for a large end-of- year lump sum payment. Chapter 4 discusses how the amount and frequency of these payments will be determined. 35 at the same time as they receive Working for Families Tax Credits. • Student loan borrowers with "adjusted net income" such as schedular, casual agricultural or election-day income would be required to use the SL tax code to make student loan repayments. • Student loan borrowers with other forms of income to include as "adjusted net income" would be required to make more regular payments throughout the year. CHANGES FOR CHILD SUPPORT PAYM E N T S Alongside the proposals for shorter periods of assessment, the Government proposes to change the dates when liable parents must pay and when payments are made to receiving carers. The objectives are to get payments from or to customers as quickly as possible and minimise the chances of incurring debts. The changes in technology and the provision of employment information more frequently offer an opportunity to improve the timing of payments. Currently, the child support annual assessment is divided equally into monthly amounts. Each monthly obligation is due from liable parents This chapter discusses proposed changes to: • child support; and • student loans for domestic borrowers with adjusted net income. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS IN THIS CHAPTER • Child support liable parents who have employment income would have compulsory deductions from salary and wages or schedular payments. • Child support liable parents who do not have compulsory deductions could have to pay more frequently and earlier than currently. • Child support obligations could be met through payments made directly to third parties that are of direct benefit to the child, subject to conditions. • Child support payments could be available for receiving carers as as soon as they are received (or deemed to be received) by Inland Revenue. • Receiving carers would have options for how frequently they can receive payments, including CHAPTER 4 BETTER PAYMENT OPTIONS 36 by the 20th of the following month (for example, the June monthly amount is due by 20 July). If the customer is a beneficiary or has a compulsory or voluntary wage deduction in place, child support payments are made alongside PAYE deductions through the payroll system. This could be weekly, fortnightly or monthly, depending on their pay frequency. Payments through wages are already the most common way of paying. Currently, approximately 73 percent of New Zealand resident liable parents who receive only salary and wage income pay their child support current liability and/or debt by way of employer deductions at some stage during the year. ¹² Once the information provided by employers confirms a deduction has been made from the customer’s pay, the child support amount is treated as being paid by the liable parent even if the employer has not yet passed the funds to Inland Revenue.¹³ If a liable parent is not a beneficiary or in debt, and therefore is not subject to a compulsory deduction, the liable parent is able to choose the means of payment that best suits them, as long as they pay by the 20th of the following month. If Inland Revenue receives the child support payment before the due date, the payment is deemed to be received on the day it is due.¹⁴ Once payment has been made by the liable parent, Inland Revenue generally passes that payment to the receiving carer on the 7th of the following month. So for the month of June the liable parent has until 20 July to pay to Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue has until 7 August to pass the money on. These dates are set out in legislation and took into account the due dates for employer monthly schedules and cheque clearance processes. They are no longer appropriate, and are inconsistent with how child support debt payments are received and paid out. Child support payable for June 20 July payment due 7 August payment to receiving parent 20 ¹²Data from the tax year ending 31 March 2016. Approximately 63 percent of all domestic liable parents who earn salary and wage income and other types of income paid by employer deductions at some stage. ¹³If the employer fails to pass the money on it becomes an employer debt to Inland Revenue. ¹⁴Section 146(2) of the Child Support Act 1991. CURRENT PAYMENT PROCESS FOR CHILD SUPPORT 37 Compulsory wage deductions for liable parents Liable parent payment rates are particularly low when they first enter the child support scheme – only 24 percent make their first three payments on time. Once a liable parent is in debt, compulsory wage deductions can be applied, which significantly increases the number of payments made on time, reduces debt and ensures the carer receives payments. The 2011 child support reforms proposed to introduce compulsory wage deductions on all domestic liable parents who were employees. This change was not implemented at the time, partly due to issues with making changes to Inland Revenue’s computer system (FIRST).¹⁵ The Government proposes that child support deductions from employees' wages be compulsory for all domestic liable parents in the same way as PAYE and student loan deductions.¹⁶ This process could be automated to apply a deduction when a customer enters the scheme or when they move into work. This would be helpful for liable parents first entering the scheme and result in them getting their payments right from the start and avoid going into debt. It would also ensure consistent treatment between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. It is expected that Inland Revenue would notify liable parents of their payment obligation and would instruct the employer to deduct child support payments. The Government is interested in whether there would be any particularly significant compliance ¹⁵FIRST is the heritage IT computer system being replaced by START as part of the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems. ¹⁶Inland Revenue would continue to have the discretion not to apply a deduction if it was inappropriate to do so. issues from this proposal and, if so, how they could be addressed. When expanding compulsory deductions was previously considered there were concerns about privacy, and some submitters did not want their employers to know they were in the child support scheme. At that time, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner considered that, on balance, the public benefit of making compulsory deductions appeared to justify the privacy impacts on compliant individuals, but that additional operational safeguards would be needed to minimise impacts on privacy if this change was implemented. There are no exemptions currently for compulsory wage deductions for beneficiaries or those in debt. The Government is interested in whether there are specific circumstances that would justify an employer not being notified and the liable parent being able to make payment through some other means than compulsory wage deductions. Alternatively, are there ways to have compulsory wage deductions made while protecting a person’s privacy? Payments from other income For liable parents who do not have deductions from salary and wages, for example because they earn most of their income from investments such as shares or from business activities, the Government proposes to require earlier payments than currently. The Government is interested in whether liable parents not subject to compulsory wage deductions should be required to make payments more 4.2 Child support – Are there any particularly significant compliance costs to have compulsory deductions of child support from customers who receive employment income subject to withholding taxes? What are these? QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4 .1 Child support – Do you support compulsory child support wage deductions for all liable parents with employment income? 4.3 Child support – If there were to be exemptions from this proposal, what reasons do you think would justify not having compulsory wage deductions? Are there other ways to have compulsory deductions while protecting a person’s privacy? 4.4 Child support – Should liable parents not subject to wage deductions be required to make child support payments more regularly? What would be an appropriate period of time? 38 should be reintroduced and whether more child support parents would use this option if some of the criteria were changed. For example, should this option be available if the liable parent or receiving carer has child support debt? Some criteria will remain, especially the requirement for agreement between parents and carers and the requirement not to be receiving a main benefit. Further detail on the original option can be found in Chapter 9 of the discussion document Supporting children (September 2010) and in the Child Support Amendment Bill commentary (2011).¹⁸ Making payment to receiving carers as soon as funds are received and processed The Government proposes to clarify that Inland Revenue can make payments to receiving carers as soon as funds have been received and processed. The Government is interested in whether receiving carers should be able to determine for themselves how frequently child support collected is paid to them. For example, some overseas receiving carers may prefer less frequent payments because they incur bank fees on international transfers or cheque deposits. Other receiving carers may want child support to be paid at the same time as their Working for Families Tax Credits. regularly, for example fortnightly. If payments were more regular, what would a reasonable period be? Recognising private payments The 2011 child support reforms also agreed to allow private payments a liable parent made directly to third parties, such as boarding school fees, to be recognised as meeting part or all of their child support obligation. That is, instead of making a payment to Inland Revenue, the liable parent could pay someone who was providing goods or services for the direct benefit of the qualifying child.¹⁷ There were several restrictions around this proposal, including that: • parents and carers must agree in writing that the private payment meets or partially meets the child support obligation; • the payment made is acceptable to Inland Revenue and of direct benefit to the qualifying child; • the receiving carer is not receiving a main benefit; • the liable parent or receiving carer does not have a child support debt; • the care of the child is not shared between the parents; and • the qualifying payment is at least 10 percent of the child support payable for the child. The proposal was not implemented, partly due to issues with Inland Revenue’s FIRST system, and recognition that the criteria would mean few parents would be likely to take up the option. The Government is interested in whether this option QUESTION FOR READERS 4.5 Child support – Would you use a provision to make child support payments directly to third parties providing goods or services that directly benefit your child? Of the criteria previously considered, are there any that you believe should be changed to make this option available to more customers? ¹⁷The Australian Child Support scheme has a similar "non- agency payments" option. 1⁸Supporting children – A Government discussion document on updating the child support scheme, (September 2010), available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2010-dd- supporting-children/overview Child Support Amendment Bill – Commentary on the Bill (October 2011), available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/ publications/2011-commentary-child-support/overview 39 CURRENT PROCESS FOR PAYMENTS MADE Child support is deducted from paying parent FUTURE PROCESS FOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED Payment paid weekly Payment paid fortnightly Payment paid to be aligned with WfFTC payment Payment paid monthly Payments can be made as soon as funds are received and processed Inland Revenue receives payment on 20 July Child support is deducted from paying parent June Options for overseas carers – payments held until requested Payment made to customer on 7 August FREQUENCY OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO RECEIVING PARENT 40 Currently, for domestic borrowers who earn other income ("adjusted net income"), at the end of the year their student loan assessment is based on the amount of that income for that year. Most borrowers have approximately 10 months to pay the obligation, otherwise late payment interest applies. If domestic borrowers have an end- of-year assessment over $1,000, they are required to make additional repayments throughout the following year, similar to provisional tax, with payments required in three equal lump sums. Approximately 20 percent of student loan borrowers with adjusted net income are required to make these interim payments. To avoid the year-end bill and possibility of provisional payments, some borrowers make voluntary payments throughout the year. FREQUENT REPAYMENT OF STUDENT LOANS DURING THE YEAR It is proposed that for domestic borrowers with salary and wages, the current system would continue, that is, New Zealand-based salary and wage earners have student loans repayments deducted from their income through their employers. The deductions are made at the same time and frequency as their PAYE and are treated as "full and final". That means for most there are no further payments to be made at the end of the tax year. For the year ending 31 March 2015, around 85 percent of student loan borrowers only had these wage deductions. Similarly, there would be no change to the repayment of student loans from overseas- based borrowers, which requires two instalment payments during the year, or to the situation of beneficiaries with student loans.

The amount and frequency of payments during the year will be based on the income information provided. For borrowers using the Accounting Income Method (AIM), the amount of the repayment could be based on the provisional information provided through AIM on their provisional income earned for the one or two month period. Borrowers who have adjusted net income and are not using AIM could declare the amount of adjusted net income they consider they have received in the previous two months and make loan repayments accordingly. Alternatively Inland Revenue could use the borrower’s previous year’s assessment of adjusted net income to estimate their income for the year and calculate loan repayments with smaller repayments, being required more frequently. At the end of the year there would be an assessment of that year’s adjusted net income to determine if there is an amount to pay or refund. Any additional obligation the borrower has after this assessment would be collected through additional regular payments in the following year. If the borrower had paid more than required, the overpayment could be offset against the loan or offered as a refund. The Government is seeking to improve the timeliness of student loan payments for domestic borrowers with adjusted net income. The following proposals would replace the current provisional payment rules. The frequency of the payments will depend on the type of adjusted net income the borrower earns. Payments could be through extra deductions from salary and wages or other schedular income, or regular direct payments could be required. Most borrowers who have adjusted net income also have income from wages or schedular income. In the year ended 31 March 2015, 49 percent of borrowers who had an adjusted net income assessment also earned wages or salary, and 39 percent earned schedular income subject to withholding taxes. Deductions from schedular, casual agricultural and election-day income For adjusted net income that is similar to wages and salary, such as schedular, casual agricultural or election-day income, the Government proposes student loan repayments be deducted from these types of income.¹⁹ As with other salary and wage earners, 12 percent would be deducted from income above the repayment threshold each payday. This proposed change will mean the vast majority of domestic borrowers will have regular student loan deductions from employment income. At the end of the year there would be an assessment of the adjusted net income to determine whether the payments made during the year mean additional payments are still required or a refund is due. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4.6 Student loans – Should student loan borrowers who earn schedular, casual agricultural and election-day income be required to have student loan repayments deducted from this income? 4.7 Student loans – How often should student loan extra repayments be made through the year to reflect adjusted net income received by a domestic student loan borrower? Would extra deductions from wages and salary make it easier for borrowers? What would be the impact on compliance costs? ¹⁹80 percent of borrowers who had schedular income claimed no schedular expenses against their income, so their gross and net income was the same, and they were in the same position as salary and wage earners. They would be required to use an SL tax code in conjunction with their WT, CAE or EDW tax codes. 42 These proposals would reduce the end-of-year obligations for borrowers and reduce the likelihood of missed payments and late payment interest being charged. The Government is interested in how often these extra repayments should be made during the year, if they are not made through extra wage deductions. 43 This chapter discusses proposed changes to: • Working for Families Tax Credits; • child support; and • student loans for domestic borrowers. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS IN THIS CHAPTER • Overpayments and missed payments of Working for Families Tax Credits and student loans would be addressed promptly rather than waiting until a 7 February due date. • A small balance write-off would apply consistently across the social policies. • A range of options would be available for most customers to manage an overpayment or missed payment. • Penalties and/or interest would not apply while overpayments or missed payments are being actively managed. • Inland Revenue would be able to set a due date and impose penalties and/or interest when the debt is not being managed, there is fraud, or the customer has a history of non-compliance. INTERVENING EARLIER WHEN THE RISK OF DEBT ARISES The proposals in Chapters 3 and 4 to improve accuracy, shorten the period of assessment and change the timing of payments should significantly reduce the risk of debt arising. When debt does arise, the proposals should identify any overpayment or missed payment earlier and taking action at that time should reduce its size. This chapter looks at further proposals to better manage social policy debt. Debt can arise in three different ways: • An obligation to pay is missed – such as a liable parent missing the due date for a payment. • There is an overpayment of an entitlement for Working for Families Tax Credits or to a receiving carer for child support. • Too little is deducted from income to cover a payment obligation, for example, student loan repayments. If a customer does not fully repay an overpayment or pay an obligation by a required date, penalties and/or CHAPTER 5 MANAGING MISSED PAYMENTS AND OVERPAYMENTS BETTER 44 interest may apply. Each of the social policies Inland Revenue administers has different rules around due dates and the application and rate of penalties and/or interest. For Working for Families Tax Credits and student loan customers the due date is usually 7 February, which is at least 10 months after the obligation arose and at a time when there is often pressure to pay other bills. Child support obligations are currently due 20 days after the end of each month, with penalties applying but no interest. The current approach does not always distinguish between those struggling to do the right thing and those who are deliberately non-compliant. It waits until the debt is due, and uses penalties and/or interest to encourage payment. This works for some customers but for others it can mean the debt grows faster than their ability to repay. If customers are aware, they can contact Inland Revenue to make repayment arrangements, which could mean some penalties are written off or are not imposed, or they can apply for hardship relief. This can result in inconsistent treatment based on customers’ knowledge of the rules. Inland Revenue has several ways to collect debt and has been moving to intervene earlier to reduce levels of debt. However, the legislation generally takes the approach of first imposing penalties and writing them off later. The Government proposes to build further on the early intervention approach to help customers get things right from the start. This means intervening earlier when the risk of debt arises for Working for Families Tax Credits and student loans, and to change the approach to child support debt to help make payments manageable. The proposals build on successes from the 2012 changes to student loan repayments which almost eliminated missed payment debt from salary and wage income for student loan borrowers. Changes to the penalty rules for income tax and Working for Families Tax Credits came into effect from 1 April 2017. This removes the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty for unpaid debt. Use-of-money interest and initial late payment penalties still apply. The main proposal in this chapter is for Inland Revenue to have a range of tools to help customers manage any overpayment or missed payment. Most customers want to pay their debt and will actively seek out how to do so. Alternatives would be available for those who are not able to self- manage or not willing to meet their obligations. Hardship provisions will continue to be available to those who qualify. Ignoring small amounts When family circumstances change there can be an understandable delay in telling Inland Revenue. This delay could result in an overpayment of Working for Families Tax Credits. If the overpayment is small, it could cost Inland Revenue more in time and resources to collect than the value of the amount. For this reason legislation often has thresholds under which debts are not collected. 45 Currently, amounts less than $5 that have been collected but not paid to a receiving carer need not be paid until the cumulative balance exceeds $5.²² This would be removed to reflect the negligible cost in making refunds electronically, in line with the proposals around personal tax refunds in the Better administration of individuals’ income tax discussion document. The Government is interested in whether people think separate thresholds should continue to apply when small amounts of income are required to be reported. Or should all income be reported but any resulting payments would only be paid or collected when the amount exceeds a specified threshold? What factors should be considered when setting either income reporting thresholds or payment thresholds? It is expected that customers would be able to report income changes and family circumstance changes more easily through online accounts. Customers managing the payment themselves Earlier feedback has indicated it is important that social policy customers have some say and control over how their debt is managed. The Government proposes that most social policy customers with an overpayment or missed payment would be able to select a preferred repayment method and the frequency of repayment such as in full or spread over several weeks. As the missed payments or overpayments would be managed more quickly than under the current system, no penalties or interest would apply while the amount is being self-managed. In the Better administration of individuals’ income tax discussion document, the Government is consulting on the personal tax thresholds, including the $20 threshold when tax debt need not be paid, and the $200 income threshold for having to file. There are several small balance thresholds across the different social policies – all setting thresholds at different levels. For example, there is a $20 annual small balance write-off for Working for Families Tax Credits, student loans and overseas child support liable parents.²⁰ For domestic liable parents there is an under $1 small balance write-off. In terms of income being disregarded there is: • a $1,500 threshold for additional other income for student loans purposes; • a $500 threshold for changes in taxable income for child support; and • a $5,000 threshold for other types of family scheme income for Working for Families Tax Credits. The Government proposes to apply the under $20 annual small balance write-off consistently for all Working for Families Tax Credits, child support and student loan customers. The Government will continue to review the rules for under $1 assessments and rounding of amounts. When the small debt is owed to a receiving carer or liable parent from the receiving carer, the Government would make the payment and write-off the debt.²¹ Integrity measures would be put in place to stop customers abusing this provision. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 5.1 Do you think there should be a consistent threshold or separate thresholds for different social policies to ignore small balance amounts? 5.2 Should there be different thresholds for ignoring small amounts of income for different social policies? Or should all income be reported but payments only paid/collected as a result, if the payment exceeds a specified threshold? 5.3 What factors should be considered when setting either income thresholds or payment thresholds? 5.4 Do you agree that any overpayment or missed payment should be self-managed by the person who owes the amount, if at all possible? ²⁰In some cases Inland Revenue is able to refrain from assessing small amounts. ²¹This currently can happen when a receiving carer owes a liable parent but not the other way around. ²²Section 146(3) of the Child Support Act 1991. 46 WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS - RECOVERY THROUGH FUTURE PAYMENTS families who have a Working for Families Tax Credits debt. This option would enable some of the ongoing payments to repay the debt. This option is currently used for child support receiving carers who have an overpayment debt. Again, no penalties and/or interest would apply while this option is in place. With shorter periods of assessment there might be times when a customer has no current entitlement but expects to have a future entitlement, for example, they will soon be returning to full-time work or a child will be returning to their care. Debt repayment from future entitlements would be an option for some customers, although this would be closely monitored. Rather than waiting until 7 February after the tax year, any Working for Families Tax Credits overpayment or missed student loan payment would be identified much earlier, at the end of the shorter period or the tax year, and required to be managed then. The customer would be required to choose a repayment option and if they do not self-manage the repayment, Inland Revenue would choose a repayment method for them. Recovery through future entitlement payments One option, whether the debt is managed by the customer or Inland Revenue, is to recover any debt from future entitlement payments. Currently, Inland Revenue pays Working for Families Tax Credits to Overpayment Working for Families Tax Credits payments 47 compliance history of the customer and the circumstances of the debt. Existing tools for addressing serious non-compliance would also be retained, such as information matching and the ability to make arrests at the border. Recovery through wages and bank accounts When there is no ongoing entitlement from which to make a repayment, another option for customers and Inland Revenue is to have payments deducted from wages or from bank accounts. This option is currently used for student loans, Working for Families Tax Credits and child support debt, and is also used for child support ongoing obligations. Most customers have some salary or wage income subject to PAYE deductions, and payroll systems are already required to make various deductions. If the customer has no employment income (including no main benefit payments), deductions can be made direct from the customer’s bank account. Inland Revenue would discuss with the customer the most appropriate method of payment and set the amount and frequency of the deductions. The objective is to ensure payments are regular and manageable. Again, no penalties or interest would be charged while this recovery option is in place. Imposing a due date, penalties and interest While these options will suit most customers, there will always be a requirement for stricter debt collection actions. Inland Revenue would retain the ability to notify a customer that an amount is due in full. After a given date, penalties and/ or interest would be applied to the balance. The date would reflect the 48 This chapter discusses proposed changes to: • Working for Families Tax Credits; • child support; • KiwiSaver; and • student loans. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS IN THIS CHAPTER • Align the wording of key definitions when they relate to the same concept across different social policies. • Align the rules for shared care of a dependent child at a minimum of 35 percent of ongoing care with reference to any care orders, and a default measure of number of nights in care for the period of the shared arrangement or what is most appropriate in the circumstances. • Align the maximum age of a child to be at the end of the calendar year they turn 18. • Change the definition of "financially independent" to refer to a set dollar amount rather than 30 hours of work a week and ensure the benefit reference is to being on a benefit or receiving a full-rate student allowance. • Align the minimum age of a financially independent child to 16 years. • Align the residence definition, with a person no longer resident once they are out of the country for more than 183 days, unless specific exemptions apply. • Require a dependent child to meet the "physically present in New Zealand" test to qualify for Working for Families Tax Credits, or meet one of the exemptions that deem a person to be New Zealand-based. • More closely align the definition of income used for child support with the definition used for Working for Families Tax Credits so that: Ĕtax losses brought forward from past years are ignored; and Ĕmore types of income are included in the definition. • Make minor wording changes to align the definitions of income across Working for Families Tax Credits and student loans, when appropriate. CHAPTER 6 ALIGNING AND UPDATING KEY DEFINITIONS 49 INCONSISTENT DEFINITIONS MAKE THE PAYMENTS HARDER TO UNDERSTAND Common definitions, such as "resident" or "carer" are used across the different social policy payments that Inland Revenue administers. Sometimes the same term is used and it means the same thing. In other cases the same term is used but the meaning is different, and occasionally different terms are used when referring to the same thing. This can cause confusion and increase the chance of something going wrong. Some definitions also seem overly complicated or out of date. Feedback on the Green Paper has indicated that customers struggle to comply with the rules when they don’t understand what they mean or they don’t fit naturally with what is going on in their lives. Some common definitions have been reviewed to see if they can be simplified, updated and aligned to make the whole system easier to understand and use. The general approach is to align definitions when they refer to the same thing. It is only when there is a significant reason to justify a difference that definitions would not be aligned. An example would be the definitions of "principal caregiver" in Working for Families Tax Credits and "primary carer" in the Parental Leave and Employment Act, as the paid parental leave definition is intended to cover a much wider group of carers, including pregnant women. FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES DEFINITIONS Dependent or qualifying child Shared care of child Both child support and Working for Families Tax Credits can be paid when the care of a child is shared between carers, as long as a minimum amount of care is provided. What that minimum amount is and how it is measured differs between the two schemes. So it is possible that a person could be receiving payments for having shared care of a child for Working for Families Tax Credits but not for child support. A person must provide at least 35 percent of ongoing care of the child to receive child support payments. The proportion of ongoing care is measured primarily by the number of nights in care, although daytime care can also be considered. Inland Revenue can also rely on what is set out in care orders and agreements. The Working for Families Tax Credits requirement is for a person to have 33.3 percent of care over either a four-month period or a tax year to be a principal caregiver and therefore entitled to receive payments of tax credits.²³ The legislation does not set out how the percentage of time is measured – Inland Revenue currently measures how many hours of care a parent has (both day and night). The Government proposes to align the way shared care is determined. The child support shared care legislation was amended in 2013 and shared care was given specific attention ²³There is a specific rule for parental tax credit given it is paid out over 10 weeks only. 50 The criteria are slightly different in that the Working for Families Tax Credits extension applies to the end of the calendar year in which the child in school or tertiary education turns 18. For child support the education extension ends when the child in school turns 19. In both definitions the child must still be attending an educational institution. The Government proposes to remove the educational requirement and to end the extension at the end of the calendar year the child turns 18. This would have an impact on child support parents and carers with a child aged 18 who turns 19 after the end of the calendar year and is continuing in school. The Government is interested in views about whether the requirement to be in education should be retained or dropped – that is, the age is extended to the end of the calendar year the child turns 18 regardless of whether they are in school, as long as they remain financially dependent on the carer. Dropping the schooling requirement would simplify the administration of the scheme. Financially independent child As part of the definition of "dependent child", there is a definition of "financially independent". A child is considered financially independent if they are: • working 30 hours or more a week, or working in what is considered full-time work under an employment contract; or • receiving a main benefit from Work and Income or a student allowance. in Parliament. The Government proposes that the Working for Families Tax Credits rules be aligned to the existing child support rules for determining shared care by changing the Working for Families Tax Credits principal caregiver eligibility rules. This would mean a minimum level of 35 percent of ongoing care. The basis of measuring ongoing care would also be aligned. Inland Revenue would be able to rely on care orders and use nights of care. However, in some cases these may not be appropriate, and Inland Revenue would be given discretion to use the most appropriate measure for the circumstances. The Working for Families Tax Credits four-month/tax year rule for determining shared care would also be replaced by a rule that determines the percentage based on the period of time that the shared care arrangement applies.²⁴ This technically could result in some customers qualifying for Working for Families Tax Credits for very short periods. However, the definition of "principal caregiver" excludes carers when care is provided on a temporary basis. Maximum age of child The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as someone under 18 years-old. Legislation for Working for Families Tax Credits and child support generally supports this maximum age but has provisions that allow the maximum age of a child to be extended when the 18 year-old is still in school. QUESTION FOR READERS 6 .1 For the maximum age of a child, should the requirement that they be in school be retained or removed? ²⁴For example, if there was an agreement for care to be shared over an eight-month period, the percentage of care for each carer would be measured over that eight months rather than a four-month period or tax year. 51 and the period of time for a job to be more than temporary. The other criterion refers to receiving a main benefit or a student allowance. A concern with the current wording is that it does not distinguish between a person who receives a full rate of payment and one who receives a reduced rate because of ongoing assistance from their parents. Specifically, the student allowance can be reduced as a result of a parental income test. Feedback is sought on whether the criteria of receiving a main benefit or a student allowance should be retained, including when a child is receiving a reduced student allowance as a result of a parental income test. Minimum age of financially independent child The Child Support Act has no minimum age when considering whether a child is financially independent – in theory if a one- year-old was financially independent, under the formula assessment no child support would be payable. For Working for Families Tax Credits and main benefits, a child has to be at least 16 years old before the financially independent test applies. This minimum age makes sense when the financially independent test is based on full-time work and receipt of a main benefit – as children under 16 are required to be in full-time schooling and cannot apply for a main benefit. Even if the financially independent test is changed to a dollar amount the main sources of income for most customers are work or benefit. It This definition is used in both Working for Families Tax Credits and child support.²⁵ A problem with referring to hours is that the amount of money a person can receive while working 30 hours can vary. This can lead to situations when a teenager working 30 hours at $15.75 an hour ($472.50 a week) is considered financially independent while another working 20 hours at $30 per hour ($600 per week) is treated as not financially independent. Another issue is that employers do not automatically tell Inland Revenue the number of hours each employee works, so financial independence based on work hours is self-declared or manually checked with employers. Additionally, a parent may not know each week how many hours the child is working, especially if the child is paid a fixed amount rather than an hourly rate. The Government proposes to replace the current hours criteria with a dollar amount. This would be easier to understand and administer, and would address the current inequity with an hours definition. The preference at this stage is an amount equivalent to 30 hours a week at the minimum wage. As with the current hours rule, there would continue to be a requirement for the period of time the income is above the threshold to be "more than temporary". For example, children who earn income above the threshold only in one week in school holidays are not treated as financially independent. Submissions are invited on what is an appropriate dollar amount for a child to be considered financially independent 6.3 Do you agree that a child receiving a reduced level of student allowance due to parental support should continue to be a dependent child? QUESTIONS FOR READERS 6.2 What is the minimum amount of money for a child to be considered financially independent for Working for Families Tax Credits and child support purposes? What factors should be considered when determining the amount? Should the amount be regularly updated? ²⁵It is also used in the Social Security Act and a similar concept (independent circumstances) is used for student allowances. 52 have been living in New Zealand for 183 or more consecutive days, or have approval to be treated as New Zealand based while overseas. This means they are no longer New Zealand based once they have been outside of New Zealand for 184 consecutive days unless an exemption applies. The rule is clear and easy to understand, and the Government does not intend to change this definition. The Government proposes introducing this "day count" for KiwiSaver, child support and Working for Families Tax Credits. The proposal for 183 days presence in New Zealand will be a "bright line" test that customers can easily understand and measure. The period would be sufficient to cover most short-term overseas holidays or travel. Similarly, the Government proposes to include some of the student loan "deemed New Zealand based" tests in other definitions. These treat some borrowers overseas as if they were still in New Zealand and covers people such as New Zealand diplomats. The requirement that people in New Zealand are lawfully present will also be retained and applied consistently. Working for Families Tax Credits and KiwiSaver will also retain their own additional requirements. For example, Working for Families Tax Credits require a person to be a permanent resident, so those on work or study visas are not eligible. In addition, each of the social policy payments has additional criteria, such as requiring permanent residency for a period of time or a physical presence in the country. These other criteria would remain. would be rare for younger children to have significant amounts of income in their own name from interest and dividends or part-time employment. The Government proposes that the minimum age at which the financial independence test is applied be 16 years for child support as well. Resident and residency While governments negotiate double tax agreements to determine the country that has the right to impose and collect tax, there tend not to be similar agreements for social payments and loans. The definition of resident is different between the various social policy payments. It generally refers to the tax definition of residence (which includes a permanent place of abode test) or common law concepts of ordinarily resident. For KiwiSaver, member tax credits are paid to help improve the adequacy of members’ retirement income. They are paid to members who have "mainly" resided in New Zealand in the year the tax credit relates to. This can make it difficult for customers to know when they no longer qualify for a member tax credit. The distinction between being resident and not resident is important. For example, Working for Families Tax Credits are intended to be paid for children in New Zealand, student loan borrowers are not charged interest when they are based in New Zealand, and KiwiSaver member tax credits are paid to members who reside mainly in New Zealand. For student loans, a person is treated as being New Zealand based if they 53 in New Zealand. The Government proposes to change the residency requirements for Working for Families Tax Credits so that the qualifying child must meet the "physically present in New Zealand" test or one of the exemptions that deem a person to be New Zealand based. The Government is interested in views on whether the child should also have to meet the New Zealand permanent residence test or whether it is sufficient for either the child or the caregiver to be a New Zealand permanent resident. In particular, Inland Revenue is aware of situations when a caregiver is a citizen or a permanent resident and they have the ongoing care of a child present in New Zealand who is not yet a permanent resident. Other definitions The Government is also looking at making minor changes to the following definitions: • Principal caregiver/carer – the Working for Families Tax Credits and child support definitions are slightly different and would be aligned. • Dependent child/qualifying child – both definitions refer to the same child in Working for Families Tax Credits and child support, so it is intended to use the same term. • Main benefits/income-tested benefits – some parts of Inland Revenue legislation have not been updated to reflect changes in terminology for main benefits. Child support The child support residency requirements are wider and refer to New Zealand citizens as well as residents. This means New Zealanders who permanently reside overseas can still use the New Zealand child support system if required. The Government is not proposing to change these rules. However, if all parents and children reside overseas there is very limited ability for Inland Revenue to administer any request to collect child support. The Government is considering whether a discretion should be introduced to allow the Commissioner to suspend the child support assessment in such cases. Some parents who are not New Zealand citizens are still part of the child support scheme as they are ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The ordinarily resident test is met if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or they meet a "day count" test. The test is 183 days in New Zealand to be eligible and 325 days out of New Zealand to lose resident status. The definition of resident for these parents who are not citizens would be aligned to the "day count" approach. Working for Families Tax Credits: child or caregiver is resident To qualify for Working for Families Tax Credits either the principal caregiver or the child must be resident. There is no requirement for them both to be resident. It seems unusual for New Zealand to pay a child- based tax credit for a child who is not resident or physically present QUESTIONS FOR READERS 6.4 Is a 183 day count a suitable period of time for determining eligibility to social policy payments administered by Inland Revenue? In what situations should a person overseas for a longer period still be deemed to be New Zealand resident? 6.5 Should Inland Revenue have the ability to cease child support assessments when all parents, carers and children reside overseas? 6.6 Should a dependent child have to meet the permanent resident test before Working for Families Tax Credits are paid, or is it sufficient that the principal caregiver is a permanent resident and the child is physically present in New Zealand? 54 only, and other sources of income are only considered if they are recognised through an administrative review. For most Inland Revenue customers the income used for their social policies is very simple. They only earn salary and wages (including a main benefit or ACC), interest or dividends. It is effectively the same income used for tax purposes. The only difference is whether tax losses from previous years are included. They are for calculating taxable income but are generally excluded or ignored for social policy. Again, most customers do not have tax losses so there is no difference in effect. Ignoring past tax losses brought forward for child support Currently, the definition of income used in the child support scheme uses the "taxable income" definition and therefore includes tax losses carried forward from previous years. In contrast, Working for Families Tax Credits and student loan repayments use "net income" as the base, which excludes tax losses carried forward. One of the objectives of child support is that the level of financial support parents provide for their children in that year is determined according to their relative capacity to do this. It would be at odds with that objective to reduce one parent’s relative capacity to support a child in that year due to tax losses that occurred in an earlier year. This suggests that tax losses from previous years should not be used to reduce the amount of child support payable in the current child support year. DEFINITION OF INCOME The definition of "income" has a big impact on the amount of support or extent of liability for payments. Determining what is included as income for income-tested payments is a significant policy decision. The current approach for social policy is to use a common definition of income, such as the Income Tax Act definition of "net income", and to make adjustments to include or exclude other specific types of income as appropriate. This takes advantage of information received through the tax system and recognises that not everyone receives or need worry about all types of income. This discussion document is not reviewing what makes up the breadth of the definition of income. Instead, the focus is on where the income definitions across the social policy payments differ and whether those differences are due to policy decisions or because the definitions were developed at separate times in different environments. Child support income definition Most of the income definitions are already similar as a result of legislative changes since 2011. The definition now in place for Working for Families Tax Credits and student loan repayments is consistent with the definition used for main benefit payments, and almost identical to the definitions for community services cards and the parental income tests for student allowances. The exception is the income definition used for child support formula assessments. Child support is based on taxable income 55 payments (including, child support) in the definition of income would be excluded to avoid circularity in calculations. The child support formula already takes into account any other child support obligations when determining liabilities. Other technical changes to align income definitions The Government has identified other minor areas where the definitions are not aligned or when wording changes would improve clarity and reduce misunderstanding. These are set out on the following page. The Government proposes to align the base of the social policy income definitions to refer to net income, which means changing the child support definition to exclude tax losses carried forward from previous years. Fewer than 600 child support parents had tax losses in the 2015 tax year. Other adjustments to child support income definition During the 2013 child support reforms it was agreed to widen the definition of income for child support to include most of the other adjustments used in the Working for Families Tax Credits and student loan definitions of income.²⁶ However, this was not implemented, partly due to issues with Inland Revenue’s FIRST system. For the group of customers who have other types of income, and who claim Working for Families Tax Credits or repay student loans, alignment with other social policy payments delivered by Inland Revenue would simplify processes and obligations as income would need only be reported once for all social policies. The modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems provides the opportunity to reintroduce the wider definition of income for child support. The Government proposes to do this to better align with the definition used for Working for Families Tax Credits, as originally legislated in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 and subsequently repealed. In re-introducing the wider definition of income for child support, the Working for Families Tax Credits deduction allowed for maintenance QUESTION FOR READERS 6.7 Do you agree that the child support income definition should be extended to more closely align with the definition for Working for Families Tax Credits and student loans? Are there any components of the definition of income that you consider should not be aligned and why? ²⁶Supporting children - A summary of feedback on the discussion document (July 2011), available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt. nz/publications/2011-other-supporting-children-feedback- summary/overview 56 Social policy payment Working for Families Tax Credits Student loans Changes to definitions Currently the definition of income includes a general "catch-all" provision. Under this provision non- beneficiary income distributed from a trust (when a person is not the settlor) is included as income. The Government is considering introducing a specific legislative provision covering such income. Such a provision would clarify the current definition and align the Working for Families Tax Credits legislation with the current student loan income definition. For the undistributed income from close companies adjustment, the Government is proposing to align the voting interest percentage with the percentage used for Working for Families Tax Credits income. This will include an associated persons test to prevent opportunities to structure shareholdings in close companies to reduce student loan repayment obligations. For the specific retirement savings contributions adjustment the Government is proposing to align the adjustment with the other social policy payments. This brings in a previously approved policy which was not implemented at the time. There would also be alignment for depreciation loss allowed on the sale of a building. A list of the various components of the definition of income is included in Appendix 2. Some differences in the definitions would still remain after these changes – there are good policy reasons for these differences that reflect the underlying purpose of the product or the nature of the group being tested. For example, some definitions apply to individual income only, such as student loan repayments, and others to family income. 57 Inland Revenue is aware of cases when a very small number of customers are in situations not covered by the law, or the law applies a process that results in the policy objectives not being achieved in their situation (even though it works appropriately for everyone else). If a simple legislative amendment is possible this will always be the preferred approach. However, it may not always be possible and, even when it is possible, the time needed to pass legislation means some customers may face significant financial difficulties in the interim.²⁷ Currently, legislation provides very specific and focused authority for Inland Revenue to determine how specific processes should apply to an individual. These are generally referred to as discretions and are relatively common in child support. The Government proposes to provide Inland Revenue with additional authority to work with customers who have unusual circumstances in order to achieve the intended policy outcome for the specific social policies. Legislative discretion, as part of understandable and accessible legislation that covers the vast This chapter discusses proposed changes that would apply across: • Working for Families Tax Credits; • child support; • student loans; and • KiwiSaver. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS IN THIS CHAPTER • Introduce general principle-based discretions for the different social policies administered by Inland Revenue. • Develop guidance for Inland Revenue staff on when to apply discretions. DESIGNING PROCESSES FOR THE MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS Families and individuals face numerous situations which impact on their ability to pay or receive the various social policy payments. To try to legislate for all these possibilities would result in lengthy and complex legislation which would not aid customers’ understanding of the rules. Instead it would more likely risk misinterpretation. Even then new situations could arise that had not been catered for. ²⁷Or the specific unusual case may no longer exist by the time legislation is passed and implemented. CHAPTER 7 CUSTOMERS WITH UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES 58 majority of customers and situations, is considered to be the most effective mechanism for ensuring policy outcomes for these customers and the Crown. WHETHER TO HAVE SPECIFIC OR GENERAL DISCRETIONS IN LAW There are two approaches that could be used: specific discretions targeting specific issues or general discretions that apply more broadly. Most current discretions are specific and have been introduced in response to particular issues. However, as they are narrow in application they can exclude customers in similar situations. Rather than developing very specific discretions in an adhoc fashion over time as issues arise, the Government proposes to set in place more principle-based general discretions for the specific social policies Inland Revenue administers. For example, there could be discretion that allows the Commissioner to determine in- work status for Working for Families Tax Credits that would allow for very unusual working arrangements to be recognised for customers who would otherwise be ineligible. There would be guidance for Inland Revenue staff on when and how discretionary authority should be used. It is important to note that discretions would not be used as a permanent solution to patch up incomplete policy – the first and best preference is to improve the policy settings and the legislation when a simple solution exists. Discretions would be used when it is determined: • there is no other existing remedy that would cater for the unusual circumstance; • the circumstance is at odds with the basic assumptions in the law; and • the policy outcome is not being achieved. UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES DIFFICULT TO LEGISLATE IN ADVANCE Legislation and policy inherently rely on some basic assumptions that do not hold for a small number of people. They are also based on what lawmakers currently understand and anticipate will happen. History shows how difficult it is to anticipate changes in technology or society. The types of assumptions inherent in social policy legislation administered by Inland Revenue are: • all children have legal guardians or parents; • individuals subject to the law are within New Zealand’s range of authority to administer the law; • individuals can be uniquely identified, found and contacted; • people are not constrained from complying with the law, for example, because of natural disasters or acts of war; • people will actively participate; • if people do the right thing, they will get the right outcome; and • people have full capacity to "act", for example, they are capable of QUESTIONS FOR READERS 7.1 Do you support the proposal for more principle-based general discretions for the specific social policies with guidance for Inland Revenue staff on how it is to be applied? 7. 2 What do you think are the key principles that should govern how Inland Revenue applies the discretion? 59 • incorrect outcomes – following the law gets to an outcome that is inconsistent with the policy intent, usually due to an unforeseen combination of factors and the complexities of the person’s life. PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD GOVERN APPLICATION OF DISCRETION In applying a discretion to an unusual circumstance Inland Revenue would need to consider in the context of the circumstance: • equity – given the unique facts of the case, whether substantive justice has been achieved in a way that maintains equity between customers; • fairness – whether the outcome is what would be expected considering everything that has an effect on the situation; and • reasonableness – whether it is rational and acceptable to the average person facing that situation. Inland Revenue would also need to take into account the rights and interests of all affected or potentially affected parties, any risks to the integrity of the law, the impact on customer compliance, the degree to which the policy objectives are not being met and the resources available to address the issue. In general, it is expected that the use of a discretion would be applied to the customer’s benefit and that it would not be used to remove or reduce a social policy entitlement or to impose or increase a social policy obligation. However, as child support is basically making payments and filling in forms. Parliament has provided Inland Revenue with some broad discretion as part of the recent child support reforms. As an example, the child support legislation assumes that a qualifying child has two parents and that they are not living together. Legislation is written on that basis. However, there are cases when the child is cared for by a "non-parent caregiver" and the parents are still living together, or there is only one parent of the child to make a child support formula assessment against. In these situations the legislation gives authority to Inland Revenue to modify the application of the law to fit the actual facts of the case so the correct policy outcome is achieved.²⁸ Unusual circumstances can be thought of as situations that: • have not been considered or foreseen by lawmakers; • are not considered significant enough to specifically legislate for; or • are inconsistent with the assumptions inherent in the legislation. Other aspects that would indicate that unusual circumstances exist are: • small numbers affected (potentially only one person) – if a significant number of people are affected the better solution would be to legislate; • infrequent – situations would be rare, as it is not efficient to set up processes that might never be used again; and ²⁸Section 7B of the Child Support Act 1991. 60 money going from one person to another it would not be possible to require the use of a discretion for child support to benefit all affected customers. In these situations the discretion would look at what is necessary to achieve the right policy outcome in that unusual situation. The child support legislation already includes provisions for affected parties to challenge the outcome of a discretion by formally objecting. The approach here complements the discussion in Chapter 6 of Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act discussion document on the role of the Commissioner and the proposal to allow more administrative flexibility in limited circumstances, for example, cases when the relevant legislation does not adequately deal with a particular situation owing to the complexity of the legislation. Making greater use of regulations The Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act discussion document also discussed a potential greater use of regulation in tax administration. The Social Security Legislation Rewrite Bill, currently before Parliament, sets out regulation making powers to cover a variety of areas, including how discretions would be applied or the criteria that would need to be considered. The intention is that "matters relating to detail and administration will be more appropriately located in delegated legislation to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility and responsiveness to changes in society".²⁹ QUESTION FOR READERS 7. 3 Should more use be made of regulations to set out criteria that Inland Revenue must consider? ²⁹From the Explanatory Note of the Social Security Legislation Rewrite Bill. 61 This discussion document outlines some proposals to improve how Inland Revenue administers Working for Families Tax Credits, child support, student loans and KiwiSaver and seeks your feedback. Following consideration of the submissions, the Government will review the proposals and consider what to implement in the new START system. Most proposals will require changes to legislation and an amending bill is intended to be introduced to Parliament in 2018. The public will have a further opportunity to comment on the legislative changes as part of the Parliamentary process. Additionally, as Inland Revenue begins to move the social policy rules from its current FIRST system into the new START system it is likely that other areas will be discovered where small improvements to administration can be made. If these require a change in legislation there will be an opportunity to make submissions. You can follow progress on the development of the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems at http:// www.ird.govt.nz/transformation/ CHAPTER 8 NEXT STEPS 62 This appendix sets out some background material on how Working for Families Tax Credits are determined, and how child support is assessed. This may help when considering the options in Chapter 3. WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS Current annual estimates approach hard for customers to get right and easy to get wrong Currently, a family has an annual Working for Families Tax Credits entitlement based on whether they receive a main benefit, the number of children they care for and weekly hours of work. The amount a family receives is dependent on their annual family income. Income under $36,350 a year is ignored. For every dollar of income over this amount, a family’s entitlement reduces by 22.5 cents until it is fully abated.³⁰ They are entitled to be paid after the end of the tax year once their income and circumstances for the year have been confirmed, with payment made as a lump sum. This can mean a family caring for a child on 1 April 2017 would receive a lump sum payment around July 2018. Most families require more timely support and opt to receive weekly or fortnightly instalment payments during the year, based on an estimate of their annual income and circumstances. The payments are the annual entitlement divided into 52 weekly or 26 fortnightly payments. They do not reflect how income is earned through the year. The estimate is made in February before the start of the next tax year (1 April). Customers can update their details during the year, re- estimate their annual income and have instalment payments adjusted based on changes in family details or changes in their annual income estimate. The estimate is also rounded up and instalment payments rounded down to reflect they are instalments rather than final payments, and to reduce the risk of overpayment. In some cases, Working for Families Tax Credits payments could be stopped if a re-estimate determines the family has already received their full annual entitlement. After the income tax return and family details for the tax year are confirmed, around July, the annual entitlement based on actual past income is compared to the total instalment payments. Any remaining entitlement is paid out in a lump sum. Any overpayment is repayable. The process repeats itself each tax year. Customers receiving a main benefit during the year are treated differently The annual assessment approach means that some families may not be entitled to any assistance because, over the year, their income is too high. For example, if a family estimates their income in February and they have a low income period at the start of the year, they would get paid during the year based on their estimate. Part way through the year if the family income increases they will have a debt at the end of the year when their annual income is confirmed. This can occur even if they were unemployed for parts of the year. ³⁰These are the current abatement settings. From 1 April 2018, the annual income threshold will be $35,000 and the rate at which payments reduce for every dollar over that amount will be 25 cents in the dollar. Family tax credit rates will also increase for children aged under 16 years. APPENDIX 1 BACKGROUND ON HOW PAYMENTS ARE CURRENTLY DETERMINED 63 HOW INCOME ESTIMATES WORK 2016–17 tax year 1 APR 16 31 MAR 17 WfFTC payments start for 2016 tax year WfFTC payments end for 2016 tax year Inland Revenue updates any changes and new payment is calculated Income estimate calculated and confirmed for 2016 WfFTC payments FEB 16 2015–16 tax year 2017–18 tax year JUL 17 Customer notifies Inland Revenue of any changes to their circumstances during the year FEB 18 Bill is due to be paid Income estimate compared with actual income earned. Bill calculated or refund paid To address this issue, the current legislation "turns off" the annual assessment when a customer is receiving a main benefit and instead shifts to a monthly assessment period for the time they are on the main benefit. This allows Work and Income to pay the maximum amount of family tax credit to customers on main benefits even if they would otherwise not qualify because their annual income is too high. Income earned before or after being on a main benefit is ignored. This ensures that families have full financial support in periods of unemployment. However, these rules do not apply to families who may have a similarly low income in a month but are not receiving a main benefit. For customers not on a main benefit, the annual assessment approach is applied. CHILD SUPPORT The child support system already uses past period income information to determine child support obligations. Assessments for child support are currently done in February each year for the year starting 1 April. If income is earned only from salary and wages or interest payments, the salary and wages from the previous calendar year (January to December) are used as the annual income figure in the assessment.³¹ If other types of income are received, the last filed tax return income is used – that is, income from two years ago. The income figure is adjusted by inflation to reflect that it is not current, but there is no square- up at the end of the year against the income actually earned in that year. ³¹Any interest income received is ignored for this group. 64 Using past income information means the assessment is certain but not always a good indicator of a liable parent’s current ability to meet the payment (or the receiving carer’s need for support). If a parent has a significant drop in income, they can estimate their income for the remainder of the current year, with a square-up after the end of the child support year to determine how accurate the estimate was compared to actual income. This can lead to overpayments or underpayments. In determining income for child support, parents are entitled to a living allowance and can claim a dependent child allowance. If the income is below these allowances, a liable parent would pay the minimum child support amount.³² If income is above these allowances, child support payments are a result of the formula assessment that looks at relative income and care levels and child expenditure. ³²There are some exceptions for specific circumstances such as when a liable parent is in prison with no income. 65 HOW INCOME IS USED FOR CHILD SUPPORT NOW The child support system uses past period income information to determine child support obligations Jan 2016Apr 2015Dec 2016Mar 2016 If income is from salary and wages or interest only then annual income from the previous calendar year is used If other types of income are received, annual income from the last filed return is used Assessments for child support are currently done in February each year e.g Feb 2017 for payments from Apr 2017 to Mar 2018 66 Included in income x Not included in income 33 Other than through an adminstrative review. 34 Contribution already included in a return of income for the income year the contribution is made and therefore in "net income" for social policy purposes. 35 Deduction allowed under the 2013 child support proposal but would have required amendment to avoid circularity in income calculation.

Do you pay or receive Child Support? The Government wants your views on proposals to make Child Support easier for parents Proposed changes would base payments on more up-to-date information Making Tax Simpler is a chance to improve the way Inland Revenue manages Child Support The current system for assessing Child Support payments could be made better The Government wants to improve how Inland Revenue manages the collection and payment of Child Support and is interested in your views. Child Support is money that Inland Revenue collects from parents who don’t live with their children full time or who share care of their children. Inland Revenue passes the money on to the other parent or person who cares for the children. The changes would make it easier and simpler for parents who pay, and more certain for the parents who receive it. The main proposal is to base Child Support payments on more recent information about both parents’ income. All income would be taken into account, not just salary and wages. Child Support payments would be deducted from salary or wages automatically, to help parents get it right from the start. You wouldn’t have to make separate payments, or worry about missing a payment and going into debt. Inland Revenue would pass on the payment more quickly to the other parent. The Government is modernising the tax administration system so it’s less work and easier for you to do the right thing. Other changes already underway mean Inland Revenue will get information from your employer more quickly and from your bank about any interest you get from investments. With more up-to-date information, and a modernised computer system, Inland Revenue will be able to make Child Support easier. At the moment, Child Support payments are assessed in February each year, based on information about income in the last calendar year or two tax years ago. Basing them on old information means they don’t always show how well either parent can contribute to the cost of raising a child right now. Not all of the parents’ income is included in the calculations. After a parent makes a payment, it can take a while before it gets to the other parent. This consultation is your chance to tell the Government whether these proposals would make Child Support easier for you. The proposals are set out over the page. You can go online to answer a quick survey, take part in an online forum or send a formal submission. The Government is also proposing changes to the way Inland Revenue manages Working for Families and Student Loan repayments.

The amount you would pay or receive would match your income at that particular time. If your assessments were done after income tax returns were finalised, instead of in February, they could be based on income from the previous tax year rather than the previous calendar year or two tax years ago. Another option is to look at your recent income information. For example, the Child Support payment for April could be based on both parents’ income from February. A third option is to reassess payments every time a parent has a change in income. Self-employed or business people would be able to have their Child Support payments based on information they provide during the year rather than on their tax return from two years ago. If your income changes from week to week or month to month, you might pay or receive more or less Child Support than under the current system. At the moment, Child Support payments are based on your annual income and then spread evenly across the year. If Inland Revenue looked back more often, the payment would adapt quickly to changes in income. This table shows the potential impact of looking back every month for a liable parent earning $62,000 a year supporting one young child, with income that varies month to month. The Government is proposing that in future Child Support assessments will take into account all income of both parents, whether earned in the parent’s own name, or through a company or trust. Private arrangements where, for example, one parent pays the school fees could be accepted as part of Child Support too. The Government is proposing that in future Child Support must be deducted from your pay, whether you are a contractor or an employee. This means most people wouldn’t have to worry about getting into debt or face late payment penalties. People with income from a business or self-employment would also have to make smaller payments more regularly rather than a lump sum once a month. Inland Revenue would be able to pass the payment on more quickly. The parent or person who cares for the children would be able to choose when to get payments, for example, weekly or with their Working for Families payment.

Are you paying back a Student Loan? The Government wants your views on making repayments simple and easy Two main changes proposed Making Tax Simpler is a chance to improve the way Inland Revenue helps you to repay your loan The Government wants to improve how Inland Revenue manages Student Loans and is interested in your views. Inland Revenue collects repayments of Student Loans from borrowers. If you live in New Zealand and your income is from salary or wages, your employer deducts your Student Loan repayments along with your tax. The Government is proposing changes to the way borrowers who live in New Zealand and who earn other types of income repay their loans. The changes would help these borrowers to stay on top of their Student Loans by making regular payments through the tax year rather than a big payment at the end of the year. There are two main proposals that would affect Student Loan borrowers, but only those who live in New Zealand. The Government is proposing to extend the requirement for employers to deduct Student Loan repayments, so that borrowers who do contract work and casual agricultural work would also have repayments deducted from their wages. Borrowers who are self-employed or who have other income that doesn’t have Student Loan repayments deducted along with tax (the way salary and wages do) would have to make regular payments during the year. The Government is modernising the tax administration system to make tax simpler so it’s less work for you to do the right thing. As part of this modernisation, Inland Revenue wants to work more closely with customers to get their tax or repayments right during the year. Currently, if you have income that’s not salary or wages, you pay a lump sum Student Loan repayment at the end of the year and you may be asked to make three interim payments during the year. It can be difficult to budget for this, and some borrowers get into debt. Paying smaller amounts more often during the year would mean there’s less chance of missing a payment or having to pay late payment interest. This consultation is your opportunity to tell the Government how these proposals would affect you. Please consider the proposals set out over the page and go online to give us your feedback. By helping the Government to improve the way Inland Revenue manages Student Loans you can make a difference to other borrowers throughout New Zealand. makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz BETTER ADMINISTRATION OF SOCIAL POLICY MAKING TAX SIMPLER WORKING FOR FAMILIES CHILD SUPPORT STUDENT LOANS Have your say at: socialpolicy.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz You can have your say until Friday 15 September 2017 Employers would be required to deduct Student Loan repayments from all borrowers, including contractors, casual agricultural workers and election day workers. This means these types of workers would have smaller more regular payments throughout the tax year. At the end of the year there would still be a square-up but they would no longer need to make a large end-of-year payment. Borrowers who have income that can’t have deductions made from it, such as from a business or self-employment, would be able to have their repayments based on information they provide during the year, for example every two months. For those who don’t want to provide information during the year, their previous year’s income would be used to estimate the repayments. These payments would be made more regularly during the year, for example monthly. Borrowers would make smaller, more regular payments throughout the tax year, and there would be a square-up at the end of the year. The amount of the square-up should be smaller than current square-ups. More regular and manageable repayments would reduce the chance of a missed payment, but if it did happen Inland Revenue would step in more quickly to help people get back on track. There would be no late payment interest while people were catching up with their missed payments. The Government wants it to be easy for you to understand the rules around repaying your Student Loan. It’s proposing to review and simplify the definition of “income” that applies to Student Loan borrowers. The Government is proposing to give Inland Revenue more flexibility when working with borrowers with unusual circumstances so those borrowers can continue to repay their loans easily.

Do you receive Working for Families payments? The Government wants your views on proposals to make Working for Families work better for you Proposed changes would give you more accurate payments Making Tax Simpler is a chance to improve the system for families Current system doesn’t work as well as it could for all families The Government wants to improve how Inland Revenue manages Working for Families and is interested in your views. The changes would help you be certain you are getting what you are entitled to, and you wouldn’t have to worry about going into debt when your income changes. Working for Families is a payment from the Government to make it easier for parents to work and raise a family. The proposals mean you would get the correct payment closer to when you need it. Inland Revenue would have easier ways to help you sort things out if you did receive too much. The main proposal is to base Working for Families on your recent actual income instead of an estimate of what you might earn in the current year. Your payments would be more accurate, because they’d be based on what you have earned rather than what you think you might earn. You wouldn’t have to tell us when your income changes. The Government is modernising the tax administration system so it’s less work and simpler for you to do the right thing. Other changes already underway mean that Inland Revenue will get information more quickly from your employer. With more up-to-date information and a modernised computer system, Inland Revenue will be able to react more quickly when your income changes so you keep getting the right amount of Working for Families payments. Currently, if you want to get your Working for Families payments regularly throughout the year, you have to estimate how much you will earn in the year ahead. If you earn more than you thought you would, you can end up in debt. Some people choose to wait until the end of the year and get their Working for Families in a lump sum. Although this means there’s no worry about getting into debt, it also means they might struggle to make ends meet throughout the year. The system can be complicated and this makes it hard for you to be sure you’re getting the Working for Families payments you are entitled to. This consultation is your chance to tell the Government whether these proposals would make Working for Families work better for you. The proposals are set out over the page.

Self-employed or business people would be able to provide information during the year about their recent income. The Government has said that nobody will be entitled to less support from the Government than they are now. You would still have to tell Inland Revenue when your family circumstances change, such as if you have another baby or you reduce your work hours. If your income changes from week to week, or month to month, your payments would adjust – for example, if your income goes up, your Working for Families payments would go down. If Inland Revenue looks back more often, your payments would change more often. If Inland Revenue looks back over a longer period, your payments would change less often. At the moment, Working for Families payments are based on annual income and then spread evenly across the year. If Inland Revenue looks back more often, the payment could adapt quickly to your circumstances so you get your payment when you need it, that is, when you have lower income. This table shows the potential impact of looking back every month for a family earning $62,000 a year with one young child, with income that varies month to month. The Government wants feedback on what recent time period Inland Revenue should look at to see your income, for example, the previous month or the previous three months. Overpayments wouldn’t happen as often under the proposed changes because your payments would be more accurate. It would still happen sometimes, for example, when someone doesn’t tell Inland Revenue about a change in their family circumstances quickly enough. But the amounts of overpayment would be smaller. The proposed changes would do away with the current system of requiring money to be paid back by a certain date. Instead overpayments would be deducted from future payments – a small amount each time. There would be no penalties or interest. If even the smaller future payments wouldn’t work for you, Inland Revenue would talk to you about other options. The Government is proposing to review and simplify the definitions used – such as “income” and “residency”. The Government would allow Inland Revenue to be more flexible when people have unusual circumstances, to make sure Working for Families still works for these people.

This is because some multinationals use base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand and other countries in which they operate. These BEPS strategies include arrangements between related parties which shift profits out of New Zealand (usually into a lower taxed jurisdiction). They also include arrangements which are designed to ensure New Zealand is not able to tax any income from sales here despite there being a physical presence in New Zealand in relation to the sales. These particular BEPS strategies are known as transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance (TP and PE avoidance). 1.2 This discussion document seeks submissions on a package of proposed measures to counter certain base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) activities by large multinationals in New Zealand. The package is focussed on BEPS activities which involve transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) avoidance. The package complements other BEPS related measures which the Government is progressing. 1.3 The proposed measures seek to counter BEPS activities by strengthening the existing rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. They focus on improving the transfer pricing rules and the source rules, while preventing the abuse of double tax agreements (DTA) to avoid New Zealand tax. The proposals also include some new administrative rules to make it easier to assess and collect tax from uncooperative multinationals in practice. 1.4 The proposed measures are intended to prevent the existing tax rules from being avoided or circumvented by multinationals. They are not intended to make any fundamental changes to the current international tax framework. Therefore multinationals whose legal arrangements match the economic substance of their activities and who cooperate with Inland Revenue should not generally be affected by the new measures. 1.5 Multinationals provide many benefits for the New Zealand economy, and the Government is committed to making New Zealand an attractive place for them to do business. However, this does not mean rewarding firms that are aggressive in attempting to flout the current rules. It is important to enforce the integrity and efficiency of the tax system in designing tax policy so that there is a level playing field. Mult inat ional enterprises that set out to circumvent the current tax rules should not be allowed to outcompete more compliant mult inat ional enterprises or domest ic firms. 1.6 In this regard, the package contains base maintenance measures that are intended to ensure that the intended level of tax is borne by all non-residents carrying on business in New Zealand. Neutral taxation of different investors 1 into New Zealand is consistent with New Zealand’s taxation framework for in-bound investment and is in New Zealand’s best economic interest. 1.7 Addressing transfer pricing and PE avoidance is also an important revenue integrity measure. For New Zealanders to have confidence in their tax system, it is important that everyone is seen to pay their fair share of tax, including multinationals. Background 1.8 While the majorit y o f multinationals operating here are tax compliant, there is a minority that engage in aggressive tax practices. This kind of aggressive tax planning may increase if it is left unchecked. In addition, incentives to engage in these practices could increase as we address other profit shifting techniques through other BEPS measures (such as hybrid mismatch arrangements and excessive interest deductions). 1.9 It can also be difficult and resource intensive for Inland Revenue to investigate and assess mult inat ionals that are suspected of engaging in TP and PE avoidance. This is due to the highly fact dependant nature of the cases, combined with the fact that the multinationals possess all the information needed by Inland Revenue to prove its case. Getting this informat ion can also be difficult when it is held offshore by non-residents, even when they are in the same group as a New Zealand taxpayer. 1.10 The OECD has recommended various courses of action to address general BEPS strategies in its BEPS Action Plan. Along with other OECD countries, New Zealand is implementing a number of these OECD recommendations. However we consider that the OECD BEPS actions will not completely address the issue of TP and PE avoidance. Accordingly, the Government would like to explore addit ional measures to address this issue. 1.11 One overseas response to the issue has been to impose a separate tax on the diverted profits that arise from TP and PE avoidance. This is known as a diverted profits tax (DPT), and has been proposed by Australia and adopted by the UK. France is also considering adopting a DPT. A DPT is levied at a penal rate compared to income tax and has greatly enhanced assessment and collection powers. A DPT is intended to incentivise multinationals to pay the correct amount of income tax under the normal rules rather than to raise revenue by itself. 1.12 While the Government has not ruled out the adoption of a DPT, it would like to investigate an alternative approach. 1 This is to take certain features of a DPT and combine them with the OECD’s BEPS measures and some domestic law amendments to produce a package of measures that is tailored for the New Zealand environment. The intention is that this approach would be as effective as a DPT in addressing TP and PE avoidance in New Zealand, 1 See the Cabinet paper published in November 2016, Measures to strengthen transfer pricing rules and prevent permanent establishment avoidance – a Government discussion document, http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-other-cabinet-paper-transfer-pricing/overview. 2 but it would do so within our current frameworks and with fewer drawbacks. This discussion document sets out these alternative measures. 1.13 These measures are in addition to a number of other measures to address BEPS and related issues which the Government has been progressing. In particular: • A bill has recently been reported back from select committee which would strengthen non-resident withholding tax rules, limit the use of look-through companies as conduit vehicles, and clarify that New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule overrides tax treaties. • A bill has recently been enacted to strengthen the foreign trust disclosure rules and implement automatic exchange of informatio n with other tax authorities. • GST now applies to cross border services – including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from overseas websites. • The Government has released a discussio n document on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. These proposals are designed to prevent taxpayers reducing their tax liability by exploiting technical differences in countries’ tax. 2 • The BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules discussion document outlines some proposed law changes that will limit the ability of multinationals to use interest payments to shift their New Zealand profits offshore. • New Zealand intends to sign the OECD’s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (also known as the mult ilateral instrument or MLI). An officials’ issues paper has been released to consult on implementation issues associated with New Zealand signing the MLI. Summary of proposed rules Source and permanent establishment avoidance 1. A new anti-avoidance rule will be introduced that will apply to large multinationals (with over EUR €750m 3 of consolidated global turnover) that structure to avoid having a permanent establishment (taxable presence) in New Zealand. The proposed rule would deem a non-resident entit y to have a permanent establishment in New Zealand if a related entity carries out sales related activities for it here. This permanent establishment will be deemed to exist for the purpose of any applicable double tax agreement (DTA). 2 Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements – a Government discussion document, September 2016, http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-dd-hybrids-mismatch/overview. 3 The EUR €750m threshold has been chosen to align application of the proposed rule with the OECD’s threshold for requiring large multinationals to file country-by-country reports. 3 2. An amount of income will be deemed to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under the permanent establishment article of any applicable DTA. For non-residents in respect of whom no DTA applies, New Zealand’s model treaty permanent establishment article will be incorporated into domestic law to apply as an addit io nal source rule. 3. A non-resident’s income will have a source in New Zealand if the income would have a source, treating the non-resident’s wholly owned group as a single entity. This complements the existing rule in section CV 1 for income derived by corporate groups. 4. Some potential weaknesses of the life insurance source rules will be addressed by amending section DR 3 to ensure that no deductions are available for the reinsurance of life policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand and by amending the definition of a FIF to ensure that New Zealand residents are subject to the FIF rules in respect of any policies that are not subject to New Zealand tax under the life insurance rules. Transfer pricing rules 5. The transfer pricing rules will be strengthened so they align with the OECD’s guidelines and Australia’s new transfer pricing rules. This involves amending our transfer pricing rules so that: • they disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction; • in cases where independent entities would not have entered into the contracted conditions, the transfer pricing rules would allow for those conditions to be replaced by arm’s length conditions (or allow the entire arrangement to be eliminated or disregarded); • the legislation specifically refers to arm’s length conditions and the latest OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines (which incorporate the BEPS actions 8–10 revisions). 6. The burden of proof for demonstrating that the actual condit io ns align wit h arm’s length condit io ns will be shifted fro m the Co mmissio ner of Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the burden of proof for other tax matters). 7. The “time bar” for transfer pricing issues will be increased to seven years (in line with Australia). 8. In addition to applying to dealings between associated parties, the transfer pricing rules will be amended to also apply to investors that “act together”, such as private equity investors. 9. Inland Revenue will collect the information required by the OECD’s country- by-country reporting initiative from multinational groups with over EUR €750m of annual consolidated group revenue (large mult inat ionals). We will not require large multinationals to annually file their master and local files, but we will increase Inland Revenue’s powers to access information and documents held by large mult inat ionals o ffshore. 4 Administrative rules 11. If the large multinational (over EUR €750m worldwide revenues) does not cooperate with Inland Revenue, then Inland Revenue may more readily issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) (and any subsequent documents under the disputes process) based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time. 12. Any disputed tax must be paid by a large mult inational earlier in the disputes process. This only applies in respect of disputes over transfer pricing, the amount of New Zealand sourced income, and the application of a DTA. 13. Tax payable by any member of a large multinational can be collected from any wholly owned group member, or the related New Zealand entity in case of the new PE avoidance rule. 14. Inland Revenue will be empowered to collect more information from large mult inat ionals, including information about its various non-resident group members. Application dates 15. The proposed administrative rules would apply from the date of enactment of the relevant legislation. The proposed rules for addressing the source, permanent establishment and transfer pricing issues would apply to income years beginning on or after the date of enactment.

In general, New Zealand can at present only tax a non-resident mult inat ional group on its sales here if both of the following conditions are met: • The mult inational group has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand. This means the group must operate in New Zealand either though a New Zealand resident subsidiary (in which case the subsidiary is taxable on its income) or through a PE of a non-resident group member. A PE is basically a place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes an agent acting for the non-resident. • Where a mult inat ional operates in New Zealand through a PE of a non- resident group member, some of the non-resident’s net profits fro m its sales can be attributed to its taxable presence here. This involves determining: – the amount of the non-resident’s gross sales income which can be attributed to its PE here; and – the amount of the expenses which can be deducted from that income to determine the net taxable profits in New Zealand. 2.2 The non-resident must also have a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge NRWT on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. The problem 2.3 It is hard to estimate the overall fiscal cost to New Zealand of TP and PE avoidance. In common with BEPS activities generally (and as noted by the OECD), TP and PE avoidance may not be directly observable in the absence of knowledge of the multinational’s global business structure. It is expected that the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative (which New Zealand intends to join) will assist in estimating the fiscal cost of BEPS related activities. 2.4 However we are aware of problematic structures being used in New Zealand. 7 2.5 Through the use of TP and PE avoidance strategies, some multinationals are able to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here. These avoidance strategies involve: • Tax structuring: Non-residents can structure their affairs to avoid a taxable presence in New Zealand, even when they are involved in significant economic activity here (PE avoidance). Non-residents can also enter into arrangements with related parties that reduce their taxable profits in New Zealand, but lack economic substance (transfer pricing avoidance). • Creating enforcement barriers: It is difficult and resource intensive to assess and engage in disputes with multinationals in practice. This is due to the highly factual nature of the issues and the difficulties Inland Revenue faces in obtaining the relevant information. 2.6 We set out examples of the more common structures used by multinationals to do business in New Zealand in the appendix, together with a discussio n o f their current tax treatment. We also discuss how these structures would be taxed under the proposed measures set out in this discussion document. 2.7 The revenue at risk from structures Inland Revenue is currently aware of is estimated to be $100 million per year. Naturally there will be BEPS cases that Inland Revenue is not aware of. In addition, multinationals which use these structures in other jurisdictions typically use them in New Zealand as well. Therefore the total revenue at risk will be greater than this figure. The international response to the issue 2.8 BEPS activities are a global concern (including TP and PE avoidance). The OECD’s BEPS Act ion Plan has been formulated to address these kinds of activities by mult inat ionals. Like many countries, New Zealand is picking up a number of the OECD’s recommendations to address BEPS. More information on BEPS generally and New Zealand’s response to it is set out in the published Cabinet paper on BEPS. 4 2.9 However adoption of the OECD’s BEPS measures is not sufficient on its own for New Zealand to counter all TP and PE avoidance. Many of the OECD’s DTA related BEPS measures will only apply if both parties to the DTA so elect – and we expect several of our trading partners not to. The OECD’s BEPS measures also do not address issues specific to New Zealand, such as issues with our current source rules. Finally, the OECD’s BEPS measures do not generally address the practical difficulties of taxing multinationals (such as information asymmetry and the administrative costs of taxpayer disputes). Accordingly, it is sensible for New Zealand to take additional measures to counter TP and PE avoidance. 4 Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) – update on the New Zealand work programme, released June 2016, http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-other-cabinet-paper-beps-update/overview. 8 Diverted profits taxes 2.10 Another overseas response to the issue has been to impose a separate tax on the diverted profits that arise from TP and PE avoidance related BEPS activities. This is known as a diverted profits tax (DPT). The UK has adopted a DPT and Australia has introduced draft legislation for its DPT into Parliament. France has also proposed a DPT. 2.11 The DPTs that have been proposed in Australia and enacted in the UK tax the diverted profits of large multinationals. Their DPTs are an anti- avoidance measure and are entirely separate taxes levied at a penal rate compared with income tax. DPTs apply to large multinationals that sell goods or services into a country and try to avoid that country’s income tax by either: • using a structure to avoid having a PE in the country, even though they have significant economic activities carried on for them in that country; or • shifting profits out of the country to a low tax jurisdiction through arrangements which lack economic substance. 2.12 A DPT taxes the profit a multinational has avoided reporting for income tax purposes using these methods. A DPT is thus intended to incentivise large multinationals to pay the correct amount of income tax under the normal rules, rather than to raise revenue by itself. 2.13 A DPT has greatly enhanced assessment and collection powers. For example, the DPT must be paid up front, and the taxpayer then has to demonstrate to the revenue authority why its assessment is wrong and by how much (although the assessment can still be challenged in Court after the expiry of a review period). 2.14 Importantly, a DPT is an anti-avoidance measure. It does not change the fundamental basis on which non-residents are taxed. For this reason, a DPT would not tax non-resident suppliers without a material physical presence in the country. Such non-resident suppliers include some of the mult inat ionals with a large internet footprint that have been the focus of some public concern in New Zealand and internationally. The New Zealand response 2.15 While the Government has not ruled out the adoption of a DPT at this stage, it wishes to explore the alternative package of measures set out in this discussio n document. These measures seek to address TP and PE avoidance within our current tax framework. However the measures do incorporate some elements of the DPTs, such as the PE avoidance measures and milder versions of the DPT’s administrative provisions. 2.16 The proposals in this discussion document aim to align the tax rules more with the actual economic substance of the multinational group and its intra- group dealings. That is, the proposed rules effectively disregard the legal separation between different group members (such as in relation to related 9 party payments or the allocation of profits between a New Zealand subsidiary and a non-resident parent) to the extent that the legal form is inconsistent with the actual economic substance. The rules also ensure mult inat ionals cannot avoid having a taxable presence in New Zealand by separating their activities into separate companies. Finally, the proposed rules will disregard artificial arrangements that would not occur between third parties dealing at arm’s length. New Zealand’s international tax framework 2.17 The measures set out in this discussion document are consistent with New Zealand’s international tax framework. 2.18 New Zealand has a general broad-base low rate (BBLR) tax framework, which aims to minimise distortions and promote economic efficiency. A robust company tax rate is an important component of this framework. The company tax rate should apply to both residents and non-residents who derive income from New Zealand sources. 5 It should not favour some taxpayers or some types of economic activity. 2.19 TP and PE avoidance essentially exploit deficiencies in the current international tax system (both in New Zealand and abroad) to allow certain non-residents to pay less than the intended amount of tax. This distortion can lead to unfairness and the substitution of low-taxed investors for tax-paying investors. This has the potential to reduce national income while doing little or nothing to reduce the overall pre-tax cost of capital to New Zealand or increase the overall level of investment. It also distorts the allocation of investment by favouring foreign investors who set out to game the system. 2.20 The proposed measures protect New Zealand’s BBLR tax base fro m these distortions and ensure the intended level of tax is paid by all taxpayers. They are consistent with New Zealand’s general approach to taxing inbound investment. 2.21 Further information on New Zealand’s international tax framework and the economic impact of such base maintenance measures is set out in the document New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment, available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-other-nz- framework-inbound-investment/overview. 2.22 Inland Revenue is currently investigating or disputing several BEPS related cases. Nothing in this document is intended to prejudice any of those disputes or investigations. In particular, none of the proposed amendments in this discussion documents should be regarded as evidence that Inland Revenue cannot address the BEPS activities it is currently investigating or disputing under the current law, or that such BEPS activities are within the policy intent of the current law. 5 There are a number of reasons for applying the company tax rate to non-residents, such as ensuring that location- specific economic rents are taxed, maintaining current taxation of sunk investments and land, ensuring an equal playing field for local and non-resident competitors, and the availability of tax credits for New Zealand tax in the non-resident’s jurisdiction (which effectively reimburses the non-resident for the New Zealand tax charged). 10 CHAPTER 3 Permanent establishment avoidance 3.1 This chapter sets out a proposed rule to prevent multinationals avo iding a PE in New Zealand. The rule broadly applies where a related entity (such as a wholly-owned subsidiary) carries out sales activities for the non-resident in New Zealand under an arrangement which is contrary to the purpose of the PE provisions. 3.2 The proposed rule is an anti-avoidance measure. It is intended to apply where the non-resident’s economic activities in New Zealand should result in a PE here, but the non-resident has been able to structure its legal arrangements to avoid one arising. The proposed rule is not trying to widen the accepted international definit io n of a PE in substance. In particular, the rule will not apply where no material economic activities (other than the sale of the goods or services into New Zealand) are carried on in New Zealand by or on behalf of the non-resident. 3.3 The proposed rule is very similar to the ones found in the UK DPT and the Australian multinational anti-avoidance law (MAAL). Background 3.4 A long established and widely used concept in tax systems around the world is the concept of permanent establishment or “PE”. Historically, taxing rights were based around a taxpayer’s PE in a jurisdiction. Where no PE exists, then there are generally no rights to tax business profits. The advent of the internet has made cross-border commercial traffic much easier, with no need for a company to have a PE in a country. 3.5 Under New Zealand’s DTAs, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business income unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation. 3.6 The current definition of a PE varies from DTA to DTA, however a non- resident will generally have a PE in New Zealand if (amongst other things) either: • the non-resident has a fixed physical place in New Zealand through which it carries on its business (excluding any preparatory or auxiliary activities); or • there is a person in New Zealand (other than an independent agent) who has, and habitually exercises, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident. The person in New Zealand is still treated as concluding the contract if they negotiate all the aspects of the contract and the non-resident only formally executes the contract offshore. This is referred to as a “dependent agent PE”. 11 3.7 If a DTA applies, the non-resident must also have a PE in New Zealand for us to charge NRWT on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. 3.8 Even if a PE exists, not all of the non-resident’s sales income will be taxable in New Zealand. Instead the sales income must be apportioned between the PE and the non-resident’s offshore operations, based on the contributions o f each to the sales income. For example, if goods are manufactured offshore and only sold through a PE in New Zealand, then some of the sales income will need to be apportioned offshore to reflect the profit attributable to the manufacturing activity. The problem 3.9 Some mult inat ionals are able to structure their affairs so they do not have a PE in New Zealand, despite having significant economic activity carried on for them here. This usually involves the non-resident establishing a New Zealand subsidiary to carry out local sales related activities. The subsidiary operates out of the kind of fixed base that meets the definition of a PE. However because that fixed base is used by a separate legal ent it y to the non- resident (even though they are part of the same wholly owned group), the fixed base does not give rise to PE for the non-resident. This is despite the fact that the fixed base is used by the subsidiary to affect the non-resident parent’s sales into New Zealand. 3.10 This kind of structure thus allows a mult inational to avoid having a PE in New Zealand (arguably) by splitting its sales activities between wholly owned group members (or other associated entities). While these group members are treated as separate entities for legal purposes, they are part of the same economic entity in substance. Accordingly the avoidance of a PE in these circumstances is contrary to the economic substance of the arrangement. 3.11 The same concerns also arise where the non-resident’s sales activities are carried out by a New Zealand entity that is not owned by the non-resident, but is commercially dependant on it. In this case, the non-resident is also able to have sales activities carried out by a special purpose entity over which it has significant de-facto control (by virtue of its commercial dependency). The commercially dependant entity is thus also effectively an agent of the non-resident, and so its activities should be also imputed to the non-resident for the purpose of determining whether a PE exists. 3.12 An example of this kind of PE avoidance structure is set out in the appendix (structure 3), together with a more detailed discussion of the current legal issues. 3.13 Inland Revenue is also aware of cases where the multinational argues that the related party only carries out general support activities (such as marketing), but in reality they substantially negotiate the sales agreements. In such cases the related party should constitute a dependant agent PE of the non-resident. 12 However these cases are very resource intensive to prosecute in practice, especially obtaining the requisite evidence to demonstrate the true extent of the related party’s act ivit ies. The overseas response 3.14 The OECD is concerned about the use of DTAs to facilitate BEPS. The OECD has prepared a multilateral instrument, which will make a number of amendments to the DTAs of participating countries to counter DTA related BEPS activities (Multilateral Instrument). In particular, the Multilateral Instrument contains a widened PE definition to counter the avoidance of PE status. 3.15 This widened definition should be effective in addressing some of the PE avoidance we see in New Zealand. However an issue with the widened definit ion is that it will only be included in a DTA if both parties so elect. Several of New Zealand’s trading partners are not expected to elect to include the widened PE definition, including some countries from which significant investment into New Zealand is made. Therefore, the Government expects that the OECD’s PE amendments will not be sufficient to address the issue of PE avoidance in New Zealand. 3.16 The UK and Australia have adopted specific rules to address PE avoidance in their DPT and MAAL. The Australian and UK rules are very similar, and broadly apply where: • a non-resident supplies goods or services to local customers; 6 • a related local entity undertakes activities in relation to the sales; • some or all of the sales income is not attributed to a local PE of the non-resident; and • the arrangement is designed to avoid tax. 3.17 Where the rules apply, the non-resident’s supplies are deemed to be made through a local PE. The usual transfer pricing and profit attribution principles then apply to determine the amount of profits from those supplies which can be taxed in the local jurisdiction. Accordingly not all the profits from the non-resident’s local sales will be taxed when a PE is deemed to exist under the UK and Australian rules. The UK and Australian rules override their DTAs. The proposed solution for New Zealand 3.18 The Government proposes adopting a similar rule to that in the UK DPT and the Australian MAAL. The rule would widen the circumstances in which the activities in New Zealand of a related party would give rise to a PE for the non-resident under any applicable DTA. 6 The customer must be unrelated to the supplier for Australia’s MAAL to apply. 13 Application of the rule 3.19 The proposal would only apply to a non-resident that is part of a mult inat ional group with more than EUR €750m consolidated global turnover. The EUR €750m threshold has been chosen to align application of the proposed rule with the OECD’s threshold for requiring large multinationals to file country-by-country reports . The threshold also broadly matches the AU$1b threshold adopted by Australia for its PE avoidance rule (the MAAL). 3.20 The proposed rule would apply to income years beginning on or after the date that the relevant legislation is enacted. 3.21 Under the proposed rule, a non-resident will be deemed to have a PE in New Zealand for the purposes of any applicable DTA if there is an arrangement under which: • a non-resident supplies goods or services to a person in New Zealand; • a related entity (either associated or commercially dependant) carries out an activity in New Zealand in connection with that particular sale for the purpose of bringing it about; • some or all of the sales income is not attributed to a New Zealand PE of the non-resident; and • the arrangement defeats the purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions. 3.22 It is intended that only activities designed to bring about a particular sale should potentially result in a deemed PE. Therefore general auxiliary or preparatory activities (such as advertising and marketing) would not be sufficient to trigger a possible PE under the rule. This is consistent with the definition of a PE in most DTAs, which prevent the carrying out of auxiliary and preparatory activities from giving rise to a PE. It also reflects the intended scope of the rule, which is to determine whether a particular sale is made through a PE by imputing the related party’s act ivit ies in relat ion to that sale to the non-resident. 3.23 Any sales-related activity carried on by an unrelated independent agent will also generally not give rise to a PE under the proposed rule (to reflect the current definit ion o f a PE in New Zealand’s DTAs). 3.24 For the proposed rule to apply, the arrangement under which the non-resident makes its supplies into New Zealand must defeat the purpose of the PE provisions in the applicable DTA. This test is focussed on whether the non- resident’s supplies are made through a PE in substance. In determining whether this test is met, the following factors will be relevant: • the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement; • the relationship between the non-resident and the related entity in New Zealand; • the nature of the services carried out by the related entit y; 14 • whether the non-resident would have a PE in New Zealand if it and the related entity were treated as a single company; and • whether the arrangement has any of the indicators of PE avoidance, such as the involvement of a low tax jurisdiction, specialised services, or a related entity which is allocated a low amount of profit on the basis it is carrying out low value activities while having a number of well paid emplo yees. 3.25 The legislat ion enacting the proposed rule (if it is adopted) may specify some of these features. 3.26 This test should also ensure that the rule will only deem a PE to exist if the non-resident would have had a PE but for its arrangement with the related party. In this regard, the rule is intended to prevent the avoidance of a PE. It is not intended to deem a PE to exist where one does not in substance. Example A non-resident located in a low-tax jurisdiction sells computer equipment to New Zealand customers. The non-resident does not itself have a presence in New Zealand. However the non-resident has a wholly owned subsidiary which undertakes significant sales activity in New Zealand for the non- resident from a fixed place of business in New Zealand. The subsidiary locates customers, promotes the non-resident’s products to them, discusses their needs and tailors equipment packages for them. It also indicates likely pricing and delivery dates as well as other key terms. These terms are subject to the non-resident’s approval, although in practice approval is rarely withheld. The actual contract however is signed overseas by the non-resident, and includes some material terms that were not discussed by the subsidiary. Under the current rules, the non-resident arguably would not have a PE in New Zealand, as it does not have a presence in New Zealand and the subsidiary did not execute the contract or negotiate all of its material terms in New Zealand. Under the proposed rule however, the non-resident would have a PE in New Zealand for the following reasons: • The non-resident supplies goods or services to a customer in New Zealand. • The subsidiary (who is a related entity of the non-resident) carries out an activity in New Zealand in connection with that particular sale for the purpose of bringing it about. • Some or all of the non-resident’s sales income is not derived through a New Zealand PE of the non- resident. • The arrangement defeats the purpose of the PE provisions in the applicable DTA. This is because the subsidiary is in substance an agent or instrument of the non-resident and carries out the non- resident’s business in New Zealand (although it is not legally an agent). In this regard: – the subsidiary carries out nearly all of the important sales activity in New Zealand through a fixed place of business, with the non-resident only approving its activities and signing the relevant contract (to ensure no dependant agent PE arises under the DTA); – the non-resident would have a PE in New Zealand if it and the subsidiary were treated as a single entity; and – the non-resident’s location in a low tax jurisdiction is a strong indication of PE avoidance. Therefore while the arrangement also has a significant commercial purpose of selling goods into New Zealand, the way the arrangement was implemented defeats the purpose of the PE provisions by preventing a PE from arising at law when one exists in substance. 15 Arrangements involving third party channel providers 3.27 The proposed rule is also intended to apply where an independent third party is interposed between the non-resident and the New Zealand customer as part of the arrangement. Accordingly the rule will also apply where: • a non-resident supplies goods or services in New Zealand; • under an arrangement in which those goods or services are to be on- sold to customers in New Zealand by a third party (whether related or not); • a related entity to the non-resident carries out an activity in New Zealand in relation to the sale by the third party to the customers for the purpose of bringing that sale about; • the sales are not otherwise treated as being made through a PE of the non-resident in New Zealand; and • the arrangement defeats the purpose of the PE provisions. 3.28 This addresses current third party channel provider arrangements, where the sale by the non-resident to the third party is part of a single arrangement in which those same goods or services are to be on-sold by the third party to a particular customer and the non-resident’s subsidiary deals with the end- customers to bring the particular sale about. See the following diagram illustrating this kind of arrangement. N on-res id en t Sa le of go ods Third party channel provider Sa le of go ods Related party 10 0% owner ship Sales p rom otion and ser vices Customer 3.29 There can be good commercial reasons for third party channel provider arrangements, and the Government does not want to penalise them or prevent them from occurring. However they should also give rise to a PE for the non-resident in respect of its sale to the third party. This is because, under such an arrangement, the non-resident and the third party are working together to sell the particular goods or services to the end customer. Further, the non-resident’s sale to the third party is wholly dependent on the customer agreeing to purchase the goods. This means that the related party’s activities are made in relation to the non-resident’s sale to the third party as well as the third party’s on-sale to the end customer (which makes sense given that the related party acts for the non-resident, not the third party). Therefore the 16 activities of the related party should be attributed to the non-resident for the purpose of determining whether it has a PE in respect of its New Zealand sales. 3.30 This additional rule will only apply in respect of the non-resident that makes the relevant sale into New Zealand. Therefore it will not apply in respect of any sales wholly outside New Zealand. 3.31 The rule also will not apply to a standard distributor type arrangement, under which the third party purchases goods from the non-resident and independently sells them to customers in New Zealand. This is because, in such a case, the third party would be carrying out all the particular sales activities (rather than the related party). This would be the case even if the related entity undertook general marketing and advertising activities in New Zealand in respect of the products (or after sale support). Consequences of application 3.32 If the rule applies, then a PE is deemed to exist and the non-resident’s supplies in New Zealand are treated as being made through that PE. 3.33 Only the non-resident’s supplies that are within the ambit of the rule would be treated as made through the deemed PE. For example if the non-resident made some supplies in New Zealand in respect of which a related entity in New Zealand carried out sales activities (and the other requirements of the rule were met), then those supplies would be treated as made through a deemed PE. However if the non-resident also made other supplies in New Zealand and no related entity in New Zealand carried out any sales related activities in respect of those supplies, then those other supplies would not be treated as being made through the deemed PE. 3.34 The PE will be treated as existing for the purpose of any DTA. So the non- resident will not be able to argue the PE article of an applicable DTA prevents New Zealand from taxing the supplies where the proposed rule applies. This matches the position under the Australian MAAL and the UK DPT. 3.35 However the other provisions of a DTA in relation to the taxation of profits of a PE will still apply. Therefore if the rule applies, New Zealand will only tax the portion of the sales income that is attributable to the deemed PE. This will be determined by the application of the normal profit attribut io n principles. 3.36 We expect that the application of these principles will result in a fairly significant amount of the sales income being attributable to the deemed PE in most cases. We also expect a material amount of net taxable profit to remain in the PE after the deduction of related expenses. In this regard, we note that New Zealand, like many countries, has not adopted the OECD’s revised methodology for attributing profits to a PE. 7 The OECD’s revised 7 One reason for this is that the OECD’s latest approach, referred to as the Authorised OECD Approach or AOA, allows a deduction to be taken by the PE for a notional royalty paid to the head office, but does not allow withholding tax to be charged on that notional royalty (unlike a real royalty). 17 methodology is also not currently reflected in many DTAs. New Zealand instead applies the earlier version of the OECD’s methodology. 3.37 If the proposed rule applies, then the PE will be treated as existing for the purpose of all the provisions in the DTA. So for example where the rule applies, New Zealand would be able to impose withholding tax on any royalt y paid by the non-resident in respect of the supplies made through the PE (for example, in the New Zealand/Australia context, under article 12(5) of the NZ Australian DTA). 3.38 The current 100% penalty for taking an abusive tax position (under section 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) will also apply for the purposes of the proposed PE avoidance rule. 3.39 We note that the ultimate objective of the proposed rule is to discourage non- residents from entering into PE avoidance structures in the first place. This reflects the current policy emphasis on voluntary compliance within the Tax Acts. Interaction with New Zealand’s double tax agreements 3.40 The proposed rule should not conflict with New Zealand’s DTAs in the vast majority of cases. 3.41 New Zealand’s DTAs are based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. The OECD’s Commentary to the Model Tax Convention (the Commentary) is an important part of the context in which these DTAs are internationally understood. 3.42 The proposed rule is an anti-avoidance provision. It will only apply to an arrangement which defeats the purpose of the DTA’s PE provisions. The Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. It also confirms that jurisdictions are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that this should not be lightly assumed). 3.43 The OECD’s 2015 report on BEPS Action 6 (Preventing the Granting o f Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances”), which will update the Commentary in light of the OECD’s BEPS project, has also confirmed this posit ion. 3.44 The proposed rule is also consistent with the OECD’s recommended measures to prevent the artificial avoidance of PE status, set out in its report on Action 7. In particular, the OECD recommends a measure to widen the circumstances in which the sales activities of a related party can give rise to a PE for the non-resident. This new measure will be incorporated into a DTA where both parties agree pursuant to the Multilateral Instrument, which will amend the DTAs of participating countries to implement a number of the OECD’s DTA related BEPS measures. 18 3.45 We propose providing that our PE avoidance rule would apply notwithstanding anything in a DTA. This is to simplify the application of the rule. Otherwise it would be necessary to show that the application of the rule was consistent with a DTA in each particular case. This would be a time- consuming and resource intensive exercise. The Government also considers that taxpayers should not be able to rely on DTAs to protect their tax avoidance arrangements. This is the same position as the UK and Australia have taken in respect of their PE avoidance rules. 19 CHAPTER 4 Amendments to the source rules 4.1 This chapter sets out some proposed amendments to the source rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments are designed to fix current deficiencies with the source rules and to ensure they cannot be circumvented. The proposed amendments are not intended to fundamentally widen the scope of the source rules. 4.2 Under the amended rules, income will have a source in New Zealand if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand. There will also be a rule to ensure that non-residents cannot structure around the new source rules by dividing their activities between group members. Finally amendments will be made to address some technical issues with the source related rules for life insurance. 4.3 The amendments proposed in this chapter would apply to income years beginning on or after the date of enactment of the relevant legislation. Background 4.4 In order for New Zealand to tax a non-resident on all or part of its sales income here: • that sales income must have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation; and • we must not be prevented from taxing the sales income under any applicable DTA. 4.5 Whether the sales income has a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation depends on the extent of the business activities carried on in New Zealand by the non-resident. In particular, a non-resident’s sales income will have a New Zealand source if: • the non-resident’s business is wholly or partly carried on in New Zealand; or • the non-resident’s sales contracts are either concluded or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand. 4.6 In either case the amount of sales income with a New Zealand source will be limited to the amount a separate and independent person would have derived if it carried out the non-resident’s activities in New Zealand on an arm’s length basis. The non-resident will then be entitled to deduct its expenses from this income in determining the amount of tax payable. 4.7 In order for a non-resident’s sales to have a New Zealand source under these rules, the non-resident must carry out some business activity in New Zealand. There will not be a New Zealand source where goods are simply shipped to the New Zealand consumer by the non-resident. This reflects a fundamental 20 distinction in international taxation between trading “with a country” (which is not taxable in that country) and trading “in” a country (which may be taxed in that country). 4.8 The Income Tax Act 2007 also has a series of further source rules in respect of specific types of income. For example, royalties paid by non-residents have a source in New Zealand if they are deductible to the non-resident payer. The problem 4.9 Under the current rules, a non-resident’s sales income may not have a New Zealand source even if significant sales activity is carried out for the non- resident by a subsidiary here. This is because the non-resident’s sales income will arguably only have a New Zealand source if the subsidiary is effectively an agent for the non-resident, so that the non-resident can legally be treated as carrying on business in New Zealand through the subsidiary. Where the subsidiary is just contracting to provide sales activities for its non- resident parent, the sales activities might not be attributable to the non- resident. If this is the case, then the non-resident would not be treated as carrying on any business activity in New Zealand, and so its sales income would not generally have a New Zealand source. 4.10 The Government considers that this is an inappropriate result. The subsidiary is part of the same economic entity as the non-resident and is effectively under its control. Accordingly, the non-resident is carrying on its business through the subsidiary in substance. The same analysis also applies where the non-resident uses a commercially dependant representative to carry on its sales activity. 4.11 In addition, the current DTA approach to PEs differs from this strict approach. Under the Model Commentary, a person does not need to be a legal agent of the non-resident to carry on its business for the purpose of determining whether a PE exists. The PE definit io n is also being amended under the Mult ilateral Instrument to widen the circumstances in which a representative can give rise to a PE for the non-resident. 8 In particular, the representative will only need to play a principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts in order to give rise to a PE under the amendments. 4.12 This raises the possibility that New Zealand may be able to tax a non-resident on its sales income under the PE article of a DTA, but is prevented fro m doing so under our domestic law. 4.13 There is general international consensus that if income is derived through a PE in a country, then it is sufficiently connected with that country to be taxed there. Accordingly, any income that is derived by a PE should also have a New Zealand source under our domestic rules. 8 See the officials’ issues paper New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, March 2017, http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-ip -beps-mli-nz/overview. 21 4.14 In addit ion, in order to tax a non-resident on its New Zealand sales income, it is currently necessary to show that the income has both a New Zealand source and is attributable to a PE under a DTA. This increases the administrative requirements of assessing multinationals on their sales income here. 4.15 There is also a further issue concerning possible future attempts by taxpayers to circumvent the source rules. A consequence of strengthening some rules is that taxpayers may try to circumvent other rules to avoid paying tax. Therefore the Government intends to strengthen our source rules against potential attempts to circumvent them in the future. 4.16 Finally, there is an issue with how the source related rules for life insurance interact with a small number of DTAs. 4.17 The following proposals are intended to address these issues. Permanent establishment source rule 4.18 A new source rule is proposed under which income will have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand. 4.19 If a DTA applies in respect of the income, then the definit io n of a PE in that particular DTA will be used for this purpose. The effect of this will be that where income is attributable to a PE in New Zealand under an applicable DTA, that income will automatically have a New Zealand source. The income will also have a New Zealand source where a PE is deemed to exist under the proposed new PE avoidance rule (discussed in chapter 3). 4.20 This is the same approach Australia currently takes. However Australia deems most of the income it can tax under a DTA to have a source in Australia (for example, including dividends, interest, royalties, etc.). The proposal at this stage is only that income attributable to a PE and royalties that New Zealand can tax under a DTA will automatically have a New Zealand source under the new rule. This is because the Government is only aware of issues with the source of these kinds of income. 4.21 If there is no DTA which applies in respect of the income, then the proposed rule will still apply. The Act will be amended to incorporate, for residents of countries with which New Zealand does not have a DTA, the definitio n of a PE in New Zealand’s model PE article. Therefore the income will have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand, as that term is defined in the Act. A similar amendment would also be made in respect of royalt ies. It is important to include this rule so that residents of countries without a DTA with New Zealand are not in a better position than residents of countries with a DTA. 4.22 Whether income is attributable to a PE for the purposes of the new source rules will be determined under the normal PE profit attribution principles (as applied by New Zealand). A deduction would also be permitted for any expenditure incurred in deriving the New Zealand sourced income (subject to 22 the usual deductibility rules) in determining the non-resident’s New Zealand tax liability. Anti-avoidance source rule 4.23 A new rule is proposed stating that a non-resident’s income has a source in New Zealand if it would have a source, treating the non-resident’s wholly owned group as a single entity. This would prevent non-residents from avoiding having New Zealand sourced income by dividing their activities between wholly owned group members. 4.24 It is not appropriate for non-residents to be able to avoid New Zealand sourced income in this way. Given that a wholly owned group is a single economic entity, any income in such a case would have a New Zealand source in substance. Consequently it should also have a New Zealand source under our rules. 4.25 The proposed rule is similar to the existing rule contained in section CV 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CV 1 provides that an amount is income of a member of a wholly owned group if it would be income if the group were a single company. 4.26 The proposed rule is also consistent with the OECD’s BEPS measures which counter PE avoidance strategies, 9 in particular the measures aimed at: • Contract-splitting. This involves a non-resident splitting a single contract into several contracts, each of which is then carried out by a related party. Contract splitting is intended to avoid the application of DTA provisions which deem a non-resident to have a PE in a country if they carry out certain act ivit ies (such as mining or construction) in that country for more than a specified period. • Fragmentation of activities. This involves a non-resident dividing a single business undertaking between related parties. This is intended to prevent a PE from arising by taking advantage of the exemption for preparatory or auxiliary activities in the PE article of most DTAs. The non-resident argues that each part of the business undertaken by a related party is only preparatory or auxiliary, and so it does not give rise to a PE. This is despite the fact that a PE would arise if all of the related parties’ activities were carried on by a single entity. 4.27 These BEPS measures will be introduced into New Zealand’s existing DTAs (provided the other country agrees) under the OECD’s Multilateral Instrument, which New Zealand intends to sign in mid–2017. If New Zealand’s domestic law does not include a similar anti-fragmentation rule, then New Zealand may be prevented from taxing a non-resident’s income fro m its New Zealand activities despite having the agreed right to do so under a DTA. 9 See the OECD’s BEPS report Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status, Action 7 – 2015 Final Report (published on 5 October 2015). 23 4.28 The proposed new source rule would not apply if the income already has a source under another provision of the Income Tax Act 2007. The rule would also only apply to the non-resident who derived the particular income from New Zealand (so it could not apply to a non-resident higher up the corporate chain). Life insurance source rule 4.29 New Zealand has special rules for taxing life insurance. These include source rules which provide New Zealand with a taxing right on any life insurance contract which is entered into or offered in New Zealand by a non- resident life insurer (sections YD 4(17) and EY 48 of the Inco me Tax Act 2007). 4.30 Because life reinsurance premiums can be used to shift income out of New Zealand, section DR 3 is intended to deny a deduction for life reinsurance premiums when the corresponding premium income is not taxable in New Zealand. This is achieved by providing that no deduction is available under section DR 3 for the reinsurance of a policy unless the policy is offered or entered into in New Zealand. 4.31 Life insurance can also be used as a type of investment savings. For this reason, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules apply to life insurance policies owned by New Zealand residents. However, the FIF rules do not apply if the life insurance is offered or entered into in New Zealand. This is because in these cases New Zealand would typically tax the premium income earned by the non-resident (see section EX 28). 4.32 Under Article 7 of our DTAs, New Zealand is prevented from taxing business profits earned by a non-resident unless they are attributable to a PE of the non-resident in New Zealand. To ensure that the life insurance rules can continue to operate for non-resident life insurers without a New Zealand PE, New Zealand typically excludes insurance income from the scope of the business profits exemption in Article 7 of our DTAs. 4.33 However, New Zealand’s DTAs with Canada, Russia and Singapore include life insurance income in Article 7. Under these DTAs, New Zealand is unable to tax a non-resident life insurer on its New Zealand sourced premium income unless that premium income is attributable to a PE of the non- resident in New Zealand. 4.34 New Zealand’s inability to tax life insurance premium income under these DTAs means that the rules denying reinsurance deductions under section DR 3 and the application of the FIF rules may not work as intended when the premium is paid to a non-resident life insurer or reinsurer from these countries. These outcomes are contrary to the policy intent and provide a more favourable tax treatment for life insurance businesses operating out of Canada, Russia and Singapore compared wit h those operating in New Zealand or other countries. 24 4.35 The Government therefore proposes amending section DR 3 to specifically provide that no deduction is available for the reinsurance of policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand (including under a DTA). The definition of a FIF in section EX 28 of the FIF rules would also be amended to specifically provide that New Zealand residents are subject to the FIF rules in respect of any policies that are not subject to New Zealand tax under the life insurance rules or any applicable DTA. Royalty substitution rule 4.36 The Government is aware of attempts in Australia to circumvent royalty withholding tax, for example by re-characterising royalties as distribution fees (see the ATO Taxpayer Alert TA 2016/2). An addit ional anti-avoidance rule for royalt ies was considered. This would have provided that a royalty includes any amount that it is reasonable to conclude is paid in substitution for a royalty (and is not subject to withho lding tax) under an arrangement. 4.37 However the Government does not wish to introduce a new rule that would reduce business certainty about the tax treatments of payments unless the rule is necessary. In this regard, the current definition of a royalty in the Income Tax Act 2007 is very broad. In particular, the definition specifically states that it does not matter how a payment is described or computed in determining whether it is a royalty. Royalt y substitution schemes also do not seem to be a significant issue in New Zealand at this time. 4.38 Accordingly at this stage the Government does not consider that an addit ional ro yalt y subst itution rule is necessary. However we will reconsider this if royalty substitution schemes become a problem in New Zealand in the future. 25 CHAPTER 5 Strengthening the transfer pricing rules 5.1 This chapter proposes strengthening New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s latest guidelines and BEPS recommendations and Australia’s new transfer pricing rules. 5.2 In particular, the proposed new rules would disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction. They would also allow transactions to be reconstructed or disregarded if such arrangements would not be entered into by third parties operating at arm’s length. 5.3 To encourage better quality documentation by taxpayers and to bolster Inland Revenue’s investigative powers, it is proposed that the burden of proof for transfer pricing issues be shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer and that the “time bar” for transfer pricing cases be increased to seven years. 5.4 Inland Revenue will collect the information required by the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative from multinational groups with EUR €750m of annual consolidated group revenue (large multinationals). Although large multinationals would not be required to annually file their master and local files, the Government proposes increasing Inland Revenue’s powers to access information and documents held by large mult inat ionals offshore. 5.5 Finally, in addition to applying to dealings between associated parties, it is proposed that transfer pricing rules should also apply to investors that “act together”, such as private equity investors. 5.6 The amendments proposed in this chapter would apply to income years beginning on or after the date of enactment of the relevant legislation. What is transfer pricing? 5.7 Multinationals can use a variety of strategies to shift profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax bills. One of the major strategies is “transfer pricing” which involves the use of cross-border payments between associated entities such as a parent and a subsidiary. 5.8 Related parties may agree to pay an artificially high or low price for goods, services, funding or intangibles compared to the “arm’s length” price or conditions that an unrelated third party would be willing to pay or accept under a similar transaction. By manipulating these transfer prices or conditions, profits can be shifted out of New Zealand and into a lower-taxed country or entit y. 26 5.9 Consider, for example, a New Zealand subsidiary that borrows money from its overseas parent. Under the terms of the lending agreement the New Zealand subsidiary pays a 10% interest rate to their parent. However, if the subsidiary had borrowed from an unrelated party, such as a bank, on similar terms, the bank would have only charged a 5% interest rate. The transfer pricing rules require the interest rate to be reduced to 5% to match the arm’s length rate. Transfer pricing is becoming increasingly important 5.10 Many of New Zealand’s largest businesses are subsidiaries of foreign-owned multinationals. This increases the potential risk of the New Zealand tax base being eroded through aggressive transfer pricing arrangements. 5.11 New Zealand has relatively high levels of foreign direct investment. In 2015, FDI into New Zealand represented 39 per cent of New Zealand’s GDP, compared with 35 per cent for the OECD as a whole. 10 5.12 Some of the largest transfer pricing transactions involve the use of debt or a licence to use intellectual property. In the year ending March 2016, related party debt ($64b) comprised 25 per cent of all of New Zealand’s external debt, while payments for the use of intellectual property ($1.2b) comprised seven per cent of New Zealand’s total services imports. 11 5.13 Around half of New Zealand’s direct investment is from or into Australia (51 per cent of New Zealand’s FDI and 46 per cent of ODI in the year ending March 2016). 12 It is important that New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules are aligned with Australia’s in order to reduce business compliance costs and the risk of double taxation. Furthermore, if Australia’s transfer pricing rules are perceived as being more robust than New Zealand’s it could lead to a greater share of the profits being allocated to Australia, as taxpayers may perceive there is less risk of a transfer pricing adjustment in New Zealand relative to Australia. New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules need to be updated 5.14 New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation was sufficient when it was first introduced, but transfer pricing practices have evolved significantly in the 22 years since then. New Zealand will need to update the rules to reflect the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and the current tax environment. 5.15 New Zealand’s current transfer pricing legislation largely focuses on the legal form of the transaction and adjusting the consideration that is paid to an arm’s length amount (which can be zero). This means that New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing rules may be unable to adequately address some types of profit-shifting. 10 OECD Data FDI stocks as a percentage of GDP. 11 Statistics New Zealand, Balance of Payments Statistics. 12 Ibid. 27 5.16 Consider, for example, a subsidiary that distributes products that it buys fro m an associated offshore company to New Zealand customers. Under the terms of the contract for buying the goods, most of the risk is contractually assigned to an associated offshore company. As a consequence, the New Zealand subsidiary pays a relatively high price for the goods, which reduces their sales margin and the profits that they earn in New Zealand. This contract may be commercially unrealistic as, in practice, the New Zealand subsidiary controls and bears the economic risk of supplying the goods to New Zealand customers. If the multinational had engaged a third-party to sell their products in New Zealand, the third-party distributor would typically have assumed both the legal and economic risk of supplying the goods to New Zealand customers. (The described example is further illustrated in example 4 of the appendix.) 5.17 Australia’s transfer pricing rules and the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines address this type of profit-shifting by allowing for the conditions of the contract to be adjusted so that it aligns with the economic substance of the transaction. 5.18 The Government therefore proposes updating New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules to reflect the OECD’s BEPS actions (8–10) and recent policy developments in Australia. Including an explicit reference to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines 5.19 Whilst New Zealand has contributed to and applied the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines since they were first published in 1995, these guidelines were substantially updated in 2010. More recently, some major revisions to the guidelines were approved by the OECD in 2016 as part of their wider project to address BEPS (BEPS actions 8–10). 5.20 Australia’s transfer pricing rules are designed to align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. In fact, section 815.20 of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 explicitly instructs taxpayers to apply the 2010 OECD transfer pricing guidelines (to the extent that they are relevant and not contrary to Australia’s transfer pricing rules). In February 2016, Australia announced their intention to update their transfer pricing legislation so it refers to the latest OECD Guidelines (which address BEPS actions 8–10). 5.21 A major driver of Australia’s law changes was to remedy an adverse decision in Commissioner of Taxation v SNF (Australia) Pty Ltd \[2011\] FCAFC 74, where the Full Federal Court did not accept the Commissioner’s position that the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines were relevant to that particular case. 28 5.22 The Government proposes that New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation should include an explicit reference to the latest OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines (which incorporate the BEPS actions 8–10 revisions) in order to ensure that these guidelines will be given due consideration as relevant guidance material by New Zealand courts when interpreting the transfer pricing rules. 5.23 It is important to emphasise that New Zealand already applies the latest version of the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines to aid with the application and interpretation of our existing transfer pricing rules. As transfer pricing has become more sophisticated the guidelines have evolved and been updated over time to represent international best practice. Inland Revenue and taxpayers routinely apply the latest versions of the guidelines to cases from earlier years, as the guidelines are generally consistent with our existing law. Adding a reference to the OECD guidelines into New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation will simply clarify our existing practice of using the latest guidelines. Aligning the transfer pricing rules with economic substance 5.24 Australia’s transfer pricing legislation was updated in 2012 and 2013 to focus on the economic substance of the relevant transactions. 5.25 Australia’s transfer pricing legislation requires taxpayers to have regard to both the legal form and economic substance of those relations (section 815.130(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997). It also requires taxpayers to disregard the form of the actual commercial or financial relations to the extent (if any) that it is inconsistent with the substance of those relations (section 815.130(2)). 5.26 We propose that New Zealand introduce transfer pricing provisions that have a similar purpose as Australia’s sections 815.130(1) and (2) on requiring transfer pricing practices to align with the economic substance. 5.27 The proposed economic substance test is intended to be consistent with conventional transfer pricing practices which involve a functional analysis to identify the economic activities that the related parties perform in relation to the cross-border transaction. As described in the OECD guidelines: “this functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions. The analysis focuses on what the parties actually do and the capabilities they provide.” 5.28 The use of a functional analysis has underpinned transfer pricing practices since the OECD’s 2010 Guidelines. However, the OECD guidelines are being updated as part of BEPS actions 8–10. The new guidelines will emphasise that multinationals cannot simply rely on legal contracts to shift profits into a lower-taxed entity. The transfer pricing rules will not respect such contracts if the economic ownership, risk or substance is unchanged. Australia’s transfer pricing legislation appears to be a good way to codify this approach into the legislation. 29 5.29 The recent BEPS-related revisions to the OECD guidelines are designed to ensure the outcomes (that is, allocation o f profits) from transfer pricing are aligned with the value created through the underlying economic activities. This includes: • rules to prevent BEPS whereby multinationals transfer risks among, or allocate excessive capital to, group members. The new guidelines ensure that inappropriate returns will not accrue to an entity solely because it has contractually assumed risks or has provided capital. They require alignment of returns with value creation. • rules to prevent BEPS whereby multinationals engage in transact ions which would not, or would only very rarely, occur between third parties. The new guidelines clarify the circumstances in which transactions can be reconstructed or not recognised for tax purposes. 5.30 The new OECD guidelines have a particular focus on funding, intangible assets and legal risk as these factors are particularly mobile – they can be shifted through contracts alone. By contrast, other factors such as the location of tangible assets and key staff cannot be easily shifted without also re-locating the actual economic activity. 5.31 On legal risk the new guidelines state that any: “risks contractually assumed by a party that cannot in fact exercise meaningful and specifically defined control over the risks, or does not have the financial capacity to assume the risks, will be allocated to the party that does exercise control and does have the financial capacity to assume the risks.” 5.32 On intangibles they say: “For intangibles legal ownership alone does not necessarily generate a right to all (or indeed any) of the return that is generated by the exploitation of the intangible.” 5.33 On funding arrangements the new guidelines state that if a “capital-rich” group member does not in fact control the financial risks associated with its funding, it will be entitled to no more than a risk-free return. Reconstruction of transactions 5.34 The OECD guidelines recommend that “non-recognition” or reconstruction of transactions should only be used in exceptional circumstances where the related party dealings would not be commercially rational if they were between unrelated parties. The OECD guidelines state that: “the key question in the analysis is whether the actual transaction possesses the commercial rationality of arrangements that would be agreed between unrelated parties under comparable economic circumstances, not whether the same transaction can be observed between independent parties.” 30 5.35 The reconstruction should make the related party dealing align with a commercially rational arrangement that would be agreed by independent businesses operating at arm’s length. If the commercially rational alternative is that an independent business would not enter into a similar arrangement, it may make sense to disregard (rather than reconstruct) the arrangement for tax purposes. 5.36 Australia’s reconstruction rules (sections 815.130(3) and (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) apply when “independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into the actual commercial or financial relations.” 5.37 The ATO have interpreted this requirement as being consistent with the advice in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines that reconstruction should only apply in “exceptional circumstances” where the related party dealings would not be commercially rational if they were between unrelated parties (see paragraph 121 of ATO ruling TR 2014/6). 5.38 It is proposed that New Zealand introduce reconstruction rules based on those in Australia’s transfer pricing legislation. 5.39 Consistent with Australia’s rules, the proposed reconstruction rules would not be explicitly limited to “exceptional circumstances”. This is because “exceptional circumstances” is a fairly subjective concept with several possible meanings which could lead to disputes. For example, there could be instances where several different multinationals adopt essentially the same type of aggressive related party arrangement. Even though these arrangements would not be “exceptional” in the sense of being unique, it may still be appropriate to reconstruct these arrangements if independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another would not have entered into such arrangements. 5.40 The proposed reconstruction rules will reduce certainty for taxpayers, but this should only be the case where the arrangement is aggressive and commercially irrational. Inland Revenue already operates a co-operative approach to transfer pricing compliance, with strong encouragement of taxpayers to seek Advance Pricing Agreements and to raise complex transfer pricing matters with Inland Revenue in a timely and transparent manner in order to increase certainty and compliance. Arm’s length conditions 5.41 New Zealand’s legislation currently refers to an arm’s length amount o f “consideration”. The transfer pricing rules could be amended to refer to arm’s length “conditions” to clarify that the transfer pricing rules require taxpayers, when determining an arm’s length price, to take into account the relevant conditions that a third party would be willing to accept. The proposed change would be consistent with the proposed approach of considering the economic substance of the transaction and also consistent with Australia’s new transfer pricing rules which refer to arm’s length conditions. Australia also defines the term “arm’s length conditions” in 31 section 815.125 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. A similar definition is proposed for New Zealand. 5.42 The Federal Court in Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation \[2015\] FCA 1092 found that the term “consideration”, which was used in Australia’s transfer pricing rules at the time the disputed transaction took place, had a broader meaning than just the price (interest rate). The Federal Court agreed that the Commissioner could make adjustments to other conditions (security and loan covenants in the Chevron case), that could have an impact on the price. This case is currently under appeal. Burden of proof 5.43 When New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules were introduced in 1995 they placed the burden of proof on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. That is, the arm’s length amount of consideration is generally determined by the taxpayer. There are two exceptions to this: • where the Commissioner is able to demonstrate that another amount is a more reliable measure of the arm’s length amount; and • where the taxpayer has not co-operated with the Commissioner and this has materially affected the Commissioner’s administration of the transfer pricing rules, the Commissioner is also able to determine the arm’s length amount. 5.44 At that time, there was much closer alignment between multinational behaviour and market behaviour. This made it feasible for Inland Revenue to obtain relevant information and determine an appropriate arm’s length price for most transactions. 5.45 Over the last 22 years, however, multinational structures and transactions have become vastly more complex and are less aligned with typically observed market behaviours. Information asymmetry, whereby the mult inat ional has much better information than Inland Revenue, has increased. Pertinent information is often held outside New Zealand, which can be difficult for the Commissioner to obtain. 5.46 Unlike New Zealand, in the majority of OECD and G20 member countries, the burden of proof for transfer pricing is on the taxpayer. This creates an implicit bias for allocating profits to countries other than New Zealand, as taxpayers may perceive there is less risk of a transfer pricing adjustment in New Zealand relative to another country. 5.47 It is proposed that the burden of proof should be shifted onto the taxpayer rather than the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This would align the burden of proof in transfer pricing cases with the standard for other tax matters. As transfer pricing is driven by specific facts and circumstances and involves comparisons with similar arm’s length transactions, the taxpayer is far more likely to hold the relevant information to support its pricing than Inland Revenue or any other party. 32 5.48 Multinationals are already required to prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof in many other countries. Such compliance efforts are routine for most multinationals and are managed on a global basis. For this reason, the additional compliance costs that would be imposed under New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules from shifting the burden of proof onto taxpayers is not expected to be substantial. Transfer pricing documentation 5.49 The proposal to shift the burden of proof to the taxpayer will increase the importance of taxpayers ensuring that they adequately document and explain their transfer pricing practices. 5.50 Each taxpayer is responsible for developing their own transfer pricing documentation. This has led to a wide range of different documentation standards depending on the taxpayer’s own standards or the standards expected by different tax authorities. It has also resulted in tax authorities having an incomplete view of transfer pricing arrangements, for example they may only see the leg of a transaction that connects to their country and not the other steps in the supply chain. 5.51 To address these issues, the OECD has developed a three-tier standardised approach to transfer pricing documentation comprising a master file, local files and country-by-country reporting (BEPS Action 13) as explained below. • Master file. Multinational enterprises will provide tax administrations with high-level information regarding their global business operations and transfer pricing policies in a “master file” that is to be available to all relevant tax administrations. • Local file. Detailed transactional transfer pricing documentation will be provided in a “local file” specific to each country, identifying material related party transactions, the amounts involved in those transactions, and the company’s analysis of the transfer pricing determinations they have made with regard to those transactions. • Country-by-Country reporting. Large mult inat ionals (wit h EUR €750m of annual consolidated group revenue) are required to file an annual country-by-country report. For each tax jurisdiction in which they do business the report lists the amount of revenue, profit before income tax and income tax paid and accrued. The country-by- country report will also report on the number of employees, stated capital, retained earnings and tangible assets in each tax jurisdiction. They will identify each entity within the group doing business in a particular tax jurisdiction and provide an indication of the business activities that each entity engages in. Large multinationals are already required to do country-by-country reporting 5.52 Implementing country-by-country reporting is one of the minimum standards for OECD countries and other countries that endorse the BEPS Action Plan. 33 5.53 Accordingly, New Zealand has signed the multilateral competent authority agreement on exchanging country-by-country reports with other tax authorities and Inland Revenue is already requiring New Zealand headquartered multinationals with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year 13 to file a country-by- country report for all income years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. This requirement applies to about 20 multinational groups, who have been notified by Inland Revenue. 5.54 A specific legislative provision for country-by-country reporting is not strictly necessary as Inland Revenue is already able to use sections 17 and 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enforce these requirements, if necessary. However, it may be useful to codify the country-by-country reporting requirements in legislation to provide a more explicit signal to multinationals and other countries of New Zealand’s commitment to country- by-country reporting. Master file and local file documentation 5.55 New Zealand endorses the OECD recommendations on transfer pricing documentation and considers that the master file/local file approach provides a useful platform on which taxpayers with material transfer pricing risks can meaningfully describe their compliance with the arm’s length standard. 5.56 Some countries such as Australia and Japan are requiring large multinationals to provide a master file and a local file to the national tax authority each year in an approved form. Other countries only require this type of transfer pricing documentation to be provided upon a request or audit by the tax authority. 5.57 At this time, it is not considered necessary to require multinationals to routinely provide Inland Revenue with their master file and local file transfer pricing documentation each year. Mandatory requirements for multinationals to update and file their transfer pricing documentation each year could impose undue compliance costs, particularly for lower-risk transactions. Mandatory reporting of New Zealand documentation is also of limited usefulness for Inland Revenue as in many cases the pertinent information is held by an offshore group member (for example, in the local file for an offshore country or the master file of a non-resident head office). 5.58 The Government is proposing that New Zealand only require master and local file transfer pricing documentation to be provided upon a request or audit by the tax authority. 5.59 Chapter 6 of this discussion document proposes that the Commissioner’s powers to request offshore information could be expanded (see paragraphs 6.29 to 6.37 of chapter 6). These proposals will improve Inland Revenue’s ability to investigate transactions where the relevant transfer pricing information or documentation is held by a related offshore group member. 13 EUR €750m is equivalent to $1,164.5m New Zealand dollars using the NZD to Euro exchange rate of 31 December 2014. 34 General requirements to document transfer pricing practices 5.60 There is currently no explicit statutory requirement in New Zealand to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation. Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire of 292 foreign owned groups found that 79 per cent of these groups produced transfer pricing documentation. 5.61 In Inland Revenue’s experience transfer pricing documentation has been prepared for the arrangements they are interested in investigating, but the quality of the documentation can vary and it can be difficult to access documentation that is held by a related offshore company. Therefore, rather than making it mandatory for all arrangements to be documented, the Government proposes shifting the burden of proof onto the taxpayer to encourage higher quality documentation and empowering Inland Revenue to request information and documents from related overseas entities. 5.62 In practice, the actual level of documentation required to demonstrate compliance with the transfer pricing rules should depend on the complexity and risk profile of the relevant transactions. Some transfer pricing practices can be easily shown to align with comparable arm’s length arrangements whilst others require more evidence. Inland Revenue expects taxpayers to exercise their own judgement and prepare documentation that manages their associated transfer pricing tax risks. 5.63 However, if a company’s documentation inadequately explains why its transfer prices are considered to be consistent with the arm’s length principle, Inland Revenue is more likely to audit those transfer prices in detail. The lack of adequate documentation may also make it difficult for the company to rebut an alternative arm’s length transfer price proposed by Inland Revenue and is likely to result in penalties in the event of an adjustment to taxable income. Penalties for lack of transfer pricing documentation 5.64 Rather than mandating for all taxpayers with cross-border transactions to prepare transfer pricing documentation, Australia uses penalties to encourage contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation. Australian taxpayers must have prepared their transfer pricing documentation by the time their relevant tax return is filed in order to reduce the potential penalty rate from 25% (the standard penalty) to 10% (the penalty for an incorrect, but “reasonably arguable” posit ion, which also requires the taxpayer’s position to be “about as likely as not” to be correct). 5.65 It should be noted that Inland Revenue would already apply a “lack of reasonable care” penalty to incorrect transfer pricing positions taken by taxpayers who have failed to adequately document their transfer pricing positions at the time those tax positions were taken. Whilst Australia has codified their approach to penalties for undocumented transfer pricing positions in their legislation, we do not consider this approach to be necessary or particularly useful in the New Zealand context. As mentioned above, in Inland Revenue’s experience, transfer pricing documentation is 35 usually available for the arrangements they are interested in investigating, but it can be difficult to get high quality documentation. 5.66 Failure by a large multinational to provide Inland Revenue with adequate transfer pricing documentation in response to a request for this documentation, could lead to Inland Revenue applying the proposed new administrative measures for uncooperative taxpayers that are discussed in chapter 6. Time bar for transfer pricing tax positions 5.67 When a taxpayer makes an assessment that is incorrect, Inland Revenue can amend the assessment to increase the amount of tax, but only within the statutory “time bar”. The time bar is currently four years from the end of the tax year in which the relevant tax return was provided to Inland Revenue. The time bar recognises there is a trade-off between allowing Inland Revenue to investigate and challenge incorrect tax positions and providing taxpayers with certainty that their tax is final. 5.68 Unlike many other tax disputes, where the facts are often agreed, and the dispute typically centres on differing interpretations of the law, transfer pricing assessments are very dependent on the facts and circumstances of each specific case. Assessing compliance with the arm’s length principle requires very detailed and specific information and analysis of how a comparable transaction between unrelated parties would have been conducted. Some transfer pricing transactions are difficult to assess as they involve “hard to value” intangibles while others involve arrangements that appear reasonable to begin with but only subsequently result in conditions that are not arm’s length. 5.69 For these reasons, it can be difficult for tax authorities to adequately identify the risk, apply the arm’s length principle and amend the relevant tax return within four years. 5.70 As shown in the table many other jurisdict ions have a longer time-bar for transfer pricing assessments. 36 Time bars for other jurisdictions Country Transfer pricing time bar Standard time bar for other tax matters China 10 years 10 years Australia 7 years 4 years Canada 7 years for publicly listed or foreign owned firms, 6 years for private Canadian-owned firms 4 years Malaysia 7 years 5 years Hong Kong 6 years 6 years Japan 6 years 5 years Ireland 4 years 4 years Germany 4 years 4 years UK 4 years extended to 6 if the taxpayer has acted carelessly or up to 20 for a deliberate misstatement 4 years extended to 6 if the taxpayer has acted carelessly or up to 20 for a deliberate misstatement US 3 years extended to 6 for substantial omissions of income 3 years extended to 6 for substantial omissions of income 5.71 In particular, Australia and Canada both have a seven year time bar for transfer pricing, which is three years longer than their four year time bars for other tax matters. The Government proposes increasing New Zealand’s time bar for transfer pricing matters to seven years. 5.72 A longer time bar will decrease certainty for taxpayers. However, this can be mitigated by engaging with Inland Revenue. Taxpayers are already encouraged to seek Advance Pricing Agreements and to discuss complex transfer pricing matters with Inland Revenue ahead of committing to the arrangements. Applying the transfer pricing rules to investors acting in concert 5.73 The existing transfer pricing rules only apply to cross-border transactions between associated persons, for example companies with at least 50 per cent common ownership. However, there is a specific anti-avoidance rule in section GB 2 that applies if an arrangement has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the transfer pricing rules. That arrangement then becomes subject to the transfer pricing rules. 5.74 Inland Revenue is aware of a number of cross-border investments where two or more non-associated investors, each own less than 50 per cent of a New Zealand company but act in concert to make decisions about the investment collectively. Because none of the investors are associated with the New Zealand company or each other, the transfer pricing rules would not typically 37 apply to such investment arrangements, even though the economic substance of the investment is that the investors operate in a similar manner as if they were a single owner. This creates opportunities to use aggressive transfer pricing arrangements to shift profits offshore. 5.75 The transfer pricing rules are intended to apply in conjunction with the thin capitalisation rules. 14 The transfer pricing rules are designed to address BEPS from cross-border payments between associated entities (including interest payments), whereas the thin-capitalisation rules are designed to prevent BEPS through loading excessively high levels of debt funding into a multinational group member. 5.76 The thin capitalisation rules were amended from the 2015–16 income year so that they also apply when non-residents act in concert and collectively own 50 per cent or more of a company. Non-residents are treated as acting in concert if they hold debt in a company in proportion to their equity, have entered into an arrangement setting out how to fund the company with related-party debt, or act on the instructions of another person (such as a private equity manager) in funding the company with related-party debt. Similar amendments are being made to the NRWT rules so that if investors act together they can be treated as receiving “related party” interest payments. 5.77 The Government proposes introducing a similar provision to the transfer pricing rules, so that the interests of non-resident investors acting in concert can be aggregated in determining whether they are associated with a company, and so whether the transfer pricing rules would apply. Under the proposed rule, non-resident investors into a New Zealand business would be treated as “acting together” if they hold debt in a company in proportion to their equity, have entered into an agreement that effectively produces a controlled arrangement, or act on the instructions of another person (such as a private equity manager) in a way that would effectively produce a controlled arrangement. 14 The BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules discussion document describes a detailed proposal for a potential interest rate cap on related-party debt, which if implemented, would apply instead of the transfer pricing rules to limit interest rates. The proposed cap would apply to companies that are subject to the thin-cap rules. Although interest payments are one way to shift profits to a group of unrelated offshore investors, other types of payments could also be used such as service fees paid to a private equity manager. 38 CHAPTER 6 Administrative measures 6.1 This chapter sets out some new administrative measures to make it easier to assess uncooperative multinationals in practice. The proposed measures most ly apply only to large mult inat ionals (those with global turnover of more than EUR €750m). 6.2 Most of the proposed measures would not apply automatically. Instead they would generally be triggered if the multinational does not cooperate with Inland Revenue. It is not expected that the new measures would be applied often. This is partly because their existence should incentivise cooperation and partly because they require significant and persistent non-cooperation. The measures also would not prevent any multinational from challenging Inland Revenue’s assessments in Court. However they do attempt to remove current incentives to delay disputes. 6.3 The proposed measures would make it easier for Inland Revenue to collect informat ion from mult inationals. Further, Inland Revenue’s ability to assess multinationals would not be hampered by their refusal to provide the relevant information. 6.4 The amendments proposed in this chapter would apply from the date of enactment of the relevant legislation. Background The problem 6.5 There are significant problems with the current rules for assessing and collecting tax from large multinationals in New Zealand. 6.6 It can be difficult to prove that a non-resident is subject to New Zealand tax as a practical matter. A non-resident that wishes to minimise or eliminate its New Zealand tax liability will typically structure its legal arrangements with a view to achieving this objective. Its internal processes and documentation are often also drafted to support this. Establishing that the non-resident is subject to New Zealand tax therefore often involves demonstrating, as a factual matter, that its legal arrangements do not reflect the reality of its operations and value creation in New Zealand. This is highly resource intensive. 6.7 This difficulty is compounded by the fact that Inland Revenue is at a significant evidential disadvantage, as the non-resident possesses all the information required to prove Inland Revenue’s case. Further, some of the information may be held by the non-resident offshore, making it difficult for Inland Revenue to obtain it. In addition, the non-resident is not required to pay any tax while it is in dispute with Inland Revenue. This can incentivise a non-resident to delay the progress of disputes. 39 International responses 6.8 The OECD’s BEPS measures generally would not address these issues. The OECD measures do require improved information sharing and reporting by taxpayers. However these are directed more at intelligence gathering than the assessment and collection of tax in relation to particular taxpayers. For example, they will not help Inland Revenue prove that a particular taxpayer’s legal arrangements do not reflect its actual operations. 6.9 The Australian and UK DPTs contain several measures to address these administrative issues. 6.10 The DPTs are significantly easier to assess and collect from multinationals than income tax. In the UK (but not Australia), taxpayers must advise within three months of the end of the accounting year if there is a “significant likelihood” of the DPT applying to them. In both countries, the tax office may raise an initial assessment of DPT, based on its knowledge at the time. Following a short period for limited representations by the taxpayer, the DPT is then formally assessed, and must be paid within 21 days (Australia) or 30 days (UK). There is no right to appeal or postpone payment at this stage. 6.11 The UK DPT can be collected from the non-resident, its deemed PE, or a related entity (meaning 51 per cent or more commonly owned). 6.12 Following assessment and payment of the DPT, there is a 12 month review period in which the taxpayer has to demonstrate why and by how much its DPT assessment is wrong. Alternatively the taxpayer can elect to return the diverted profits as income under normal income tax rules. The DPT may be appealed in Court, but only after it has been paid and the 12 month review period has ended. Proposed rules for New Zealand 6.13 We do not consider it necessary to go as far as the DPTs in assessing multinationals. In particular, we consider that administrative problems generally only arise when multinationals do not cooperate with Inland Revenue. Consequently the proposed administrative remedies are generally targeted at non-cooperative multinationals. The intention is for cooperative multinationals to be generally unaffected by the new rules. 6.14 The proposed rules discussed below will only apply to large multinationals (unless stated otherwise). “Large multinationals” will be defined as multinationals with a greater than EUR €750m consolidated group turnover. 6.15 The EUR €750m has been chosen to align application of the new measures with the OECD’s threshold for requiring large multinationals to file country- by-country reports. The OECD’s measures have been widely adopted and will require multinationals to collect information and report on their global transfer pricing arrangements. Consequently, multinationals to whom the 40 new measures apply should already possess much of the information that Inland Revenue will request fro m them. Non-cooperation 6.16 The rules will need to specify when a taxpayer is to be regarded as non-co- operative. It is proposed that non-cooperation include: • Failure by the taxpayer to provide information within the possession or control of the taxpayer or its associated parties within a statutory time- frame. The taxpayer will also be deemed to be in possession of any informat ion it is required to report under the OECD’s country-by- country reporting standards for this purpose. • Failure to respond to Inland Revenue correspondence. • Failure to comply wit hin a statutory time-frame wit h Inland Revenue’s reasonable requests. • The provision of materially misleading information (including where the information is misleading by omission). • Failure to provide sufficient informat ion to determine the arm’s length amount of a related party transaction, or to determine the amount of profit which should be attributed to a PE. This is to ensure there is no incentive for the taxpayer to fail to adequately document its related party transactions for transfer pricing purposes, or fail to retain the relevant information (or to argue that it does not have such information in its possession). 6.17 However the proposed rules are not intended to impose unreasonable demands on multinationals. Accordingly, the threshold at which a multinational is treated as non-cooperative should be set above what could be regarded as reasonable in the circumstances. 6.18 In addition, the multinational will be warned that it is being non-cooperative and will be given a further opportunity to co-operate before Inland Revenue applies the new administrative measures. Furthermore, the Government expects that Inland Revenue would put in place internal processes so that a decisio n to treat a mult inat ional as non-cooperative must be approved at a sufficiently high level within the organisation (similar to how section BG 1 is applied currently). This should give taxpayers assurance and certainty that the proposed administrative measures will not be imposed arbitrarily or inconsistent ly. 41 Example The following sets out an example of the circumstances in which the Government envisages that a taxpayer would be treated as non-cooperative. Inland Revenue requests information from the local subsidiary of a multinational group in order to help determine the arm’s length price for a transaction between the subsidiary and a related non-resident member of the group. The subsidiary fails to provide the information within the specified period of time. Inland Revenue reminds the non-resident of its information request and again asks for the information to be provided. When the subsidiary fails to provide the information in response to the reminder, Inland Revenue repeats its request and sets a new date by which the information must be provided (in accordance with the guidance set out in the new legislation). Inland Revenue notes that failure to provide the information within this new period may result in the multinational being regarded as non-cooperative. Inland Revenue also explains the consequences of this (being the application of one or more of the proposed administrative measures discussed below). When the subsidiary still fails to provide the requested information by the due date, the Inland Revenue investigator escalates the matter internally, and requests approval to treat the taxpayer as non- cooperative. This request is considered at a senior level within Inland Revenue, with reference to the legislation and all the relevant circumstances (including the reasonableness of the original request). In this case approval is granted and one of the new administrative measures is applied in order to prevent the subsidiary’s non-compliance from frustrating the transfer pricing investigation. The taxpayer is then informed of this outcome and its options going forward. Assessments 6.19 If the large multinational does not cooperate with Inland Revenue, it is proposed that Inland Revenue may issue a NOPA or assessment based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time. This is to ensure that Inland Revenue’s investigations are not unduly delayed by a taxpayer’s non- cooperation. This would be similar to Inland Revenue’s existing power to default assess taxpayers, but would apply in broader circumstances. 6.20 Inland Revenue will still be required to make reasonable efforts to obtain the requested information. It is also intended that this rule should only apply for the particular matter in respect of which the taxpayer has not cooperated. For example, if the taxpayer has cooperated for six tax issues but not the seventh, the rule would only apply for the seventh issue. Payment of tax in dispute 6.21 Currently tax that is being disputed by the taxpayer is not payable until the dispute is resolved. This can delay the collection of tax for several years and provide an incentive for multinationals to prolong the dispute. 6.22 For large multinationals engaged in particular kinds of dispute, the Government proposes bringing forward the time at which the tax must be 42 paid. There are two potential payment dates being considered for this purpose: • within 90 days of Inland Revenue issuing an assessment for the tax (which would only occur at the end of Inland Revenue’s current disputes process); or • within 12 months of Inland Revenue issuing a NOPA in respect of the tax, if Inland Revenue and the taxpayer have not been able to resolve the dispute. 6.23 We consider that either date is a reasonable compromise between tax being payable at the commencement of a dispute and tax not being payable until the very end. Either date would provide a reasonable period of time for Inland Revenue and the multinational to resolve the dispute. Feedback on the appropriate date to be included in legislation is welcomed. 6.24 The proposed rule would only apply for disputed tax in relation to transfer pricing, the amount of income with a NZ source, or the amount of tax payable under a DTA. Purchases from a tax pooling service would not be accepted as the payment of tax for this purpose. 6.25 Inland Revenue would repay the disputed tax if the mult inat ional succeeded in a Court challenge. 6.26 The disputed tax would need to be paid earlier regardless of whether the multinational cooperated with Inland Revenue or not. This is because the rule is intended to remove any incentive for a taxpayer to prolong a dispute with Inland Revenue. In addit io n, refusing to resolve a dispute with Inland Revenue would not usually be regarded as non-cooperation. Collection of tax 6.27 It is proposed that any tax payable by a member of a large mult inat ional would be collectible from any wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational in New Zealand. The tax would also be collectible fro m the related New Zealand entity in a case where the income is attributed to a deemed PE of the non-resident under the proposed PE avoidance rule (discussed in chapter 3). 6.28 This will assist New Zealand in recovering tax payable by non-residents. Collection of information 6.29 To effectively monitor and enforce New Zealand’s international tax rules, Inland Revenue may need to request information from the taxpayer about their functions and the functions of their offshore group members. As the OECD notes in their guidelines on transfer pricing documentation: “It may often be the case that the documents and other information required for a transfer pricing audit will be in the possession of members of the MNE group other than the local affiliate under examination. Often 43 the necessary documents will be located outside the country whose tax administration is conducting the audit. It is therefore important that the tax administration is able to obtain directly or through information sharing, such as exchange of information mechanisms, information that extends beyond the country’s borders.” 6.30 In addition to transfer pricing, there are other areas of tax where offshore information may be pertinent, such as the attribution of business profits to a PE. 6.31 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has an existing power under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request any information or documents that the Commissioner considers necessary to administer or enforce Inland Revenue’s functions. Section 17 is typically used to access information and documents held by a New Zealand entity. However, in many cases, the relevant information is held by an offshore group member. Section 17 can be applied to non-residents that are controlled by a New Zealand resident. 15 However, it does not apply to non-residents that are related to, but not controlled by the New Zealand resident (such as an offshore parent or sister company). 6.32 Recent improvements to the exchange of information between tax authorities are making it easier for Inland Revenue to request and exchange information that is held by offshore tax authorities. However, relying on an ability to request information indirectly from other tax authorities is not always adequate. In so me cases, the relevant informat ion is not held by the offshore tax authority and in other cases the foreign tax authority may be slow or unhelpful in responding to reasonable requests for information. 6.33 For these reasons it is proposed that the Commissioner be provided with a direct power to request information or documents that are held by, or accessible to, a group member that is located outside New Zealand. The proposed rule would only apply in respect of multinational groups with EUR €750m of global revenues and would allow the Commissioner to use her existing power under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request information or documents that are held by or accessible to any offshore group members who are associated with the relevant New Zealand group member or permanent establishment. The information would first be passed on to the relevant New Zealand taxpayer who would then supply this information to the Commissioner. 6.34 This change would align New Zealand’s offshore information powers with other countries’ such as Australia 16 and Canada 17 which have specific provisions that enable their tax authorities to directly request information or documents from offshore. 15 Under section 17(1) Inland Revenue may require a New Zealand resident to provide information in circumstances where the resident’s non-resident employees or agents hold the information/documents for the resident. Section 17(1B) gives Inland Revenue the power to require a New Zealand resident to provide information held by a non-resident entity controlled directly or indirectly by the New Zealand resident. 16 Section 264A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Australia issued 79 formal offshore notices in 2014–15. 17 Section 231.6 of the Income Tax Act. 44 6.35 A consequential change would also be required to amend section 143(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to allow a person to be convicted of an offence if they failed to provide information which was held by an associated offshore group member. Again, this change would only apply in respect of multinational groups with EUR €750m of global revenues. 6.36 Currently, section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to deny deductions for taxpayers which fail to adequately respond to information requests regarding payments by them to an offshore entity. Taxpayers who fail to provide, on a timely basis, information about an offshore payment under a section 21 information request are also unable to use any information that is later provided as admissible evidence in any subsequent court case. 6.37 In many BEPS arrangements the New Zealand entity does not make a deductible payment but instead the arrangement results in income being allocated to an offshore group member when the income was actually generated as a result of economic activity carried out by a New Zealand company or permanent establishment. It is therefore proposed that sectio n 21 be expanded so that it can also be applied to deem an amount of income to be allocated to a New Zealand group member or permanent establishment of a multinational group with EUR €750m of global revenues in cases where they have failed to adequately respond to an informat ion request in relat io n to New Zealand-sourced inco me. Penalties for not providing information 6.38 Currently, there are criminal penalties for not complying with a request for information under section 17 or section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This means that in order to apply these penalties, Inland Revenue has to take court proceedings against the person. If the person is convicted of an offence of not providing the information they are then liable for a fine of up to $4,000 (for a first offence), $8,000 for a second offence, or $12,000 for three or more offences. 6.39 It is resource-intensive to take court proceedings against a person who fails to co-operate with a request for information. It is therefore proposed that the Commissioner be able to impose fines under section 17 and section 21 as civil penalties, rather than as criminal penalties. 6.40 In addition, the modest size of the fine may be an insufficient deterrent for large mult inat ionals. A larger fine of up to $100,000 is therefore proposed for information offences committed by mult inat ional groups with EUR €750m of global revenues where that multinational has failed to comply with information requests made under section 17 or section 21. Australia has announced similar plans to increase their penalties for globally significant mult inat ionals that fail to provide certain information from AU$4,500 to AU$450,000. 45 APPENDIX Taxation of structures multinationals use in New Zealand Structures used by non-residents to do business in New Zealand This appendix examines the current tax treatment of four structures that non-residents commonly use to sell goods into the New Zealand market. These are: 18 1. direct sales by a non-resident from offshore; 2. in-market sales by a fully-fledged in-market manufacturer or assembler; 3. in-market support services for direct sales from offshore; and 4. in-market sales through a New Zealand distributor. This appendix also examines the impact of the OECD’s BEPS measures on these structures and impact of the measures proposed in this discussion document. We note that only structures 3 (in-market support services for direct sales from offshore) and 4 (in-market sales through a New Zealand distributor) give rise to potential BEPS concerns at this time. Consequently only these structures could be affected by the measures set out in this discussio n document. 1. Direct sales by a non-resident from offshore (direct sales structure) This structure involves the non-resident having no presence in New Zealand in relat ion to its sales – either in its own right or through another entity. Instead, the non-resident simply supplies goods or services to New Zealand customers from overseas. This can be by direct sale to consumers or by sale to retailers, who then on- sell the product to consumers. We set out a diagram of this structure below. Direct sales from offshore N on-res id en t supplier NZ customers Of fsh o re NZ Sales o f fin al pr od uct No New Zealand income tax is currently payable by the non-resident on its direct sales under domestic law. This is because there is no New Zealand source for income derived by a non-resident from simply selling goods and services into New Zealand. 18 These structures are simplified versions of the ones used in practice. 46 In addition, the non-resident does not have a PE in New Zealand under the direct sales structure because it has no presence here. So even if the non-resident’s income had a New Zealand source, we would be prevented from taxing it under any applicable DTA. The proposed PE avoidance rule would not change this as it does not apply unless there is a related person carrying on sales activities in the local jurisdiction. From a policy perspective this outcome is entirely in accordance with the current norms of international taxat ion which New Zealand – as well as other countries – follow. Accordingly the Government is not proposing any measures to address this structure. However the OECD is continuing to monitor this issue with respect to the digital econo my and intends to produce a further report in 2020. The Government may reconsider the tax treatment of this structure then. We note that, following recent amendments, GST will generally be payable by non- residents who supply services to New Zealanders under this structure. GST is also currently applied on the importation of higher value goods into New Zealand. 2. In-market sales by a fully-fledged in-market manufacturer or assembler We set out a diagram of this structure below. In-market sales by an in-market manufacturer or assembler N on-res id en t parent NZ customers Of fsh o re NZ Sales o f fin al pr od uct NZ manufacturer 10 0% I npu ts Since everything is happening in-country there are no issues with PE avoidance or transfer pricing. Accordingly this structure does not give rise to any TP or PE avoidance concerns. As a result this structure would not be affected by any of the proposals in this discussion document. 3. Direct sales from offshore with in market sales activities (in-market support structure) This structure is similar to the direct sale structure discussed in Example 1, except that the non-resident needs to have a sales team in New Zealand to liaise with customers and arrange the sales. Under the problematic variant of this structure, the non-resident would have a PE in New Zealand if it carried out those activities itself, and would be taxable on some of its sales income. To prevent this, the non-resident contracts with a New Zealand subsidiary formed to carry out those activities. We refer to this problematic variant as the “in-market support structure”. 47 Under the in-market support structure, the New Zealand subsidiary is paid a fee for its services, but this fee generally only exceeds its costs by a small margin. The non- resident also usually pays a significant royalty to another group member (typically in a no tax jurisdiction) for its use of related intellectual property. This ultimately shifts much of the non-resident’s profits from its New Zealand sales into a non-tax paying jurisdiction (generally without any New Zealand non-resident withholding tax being payable). We set out a diagram of this structure below. In-market support services N on-res id en t NZ customers Low-tax country NZ Sales activity NZ subsidiary 10 0% IP owner Royalties No-tax country Sa les Problems with the current tax treatment of the in-market support structure The significance of the sales activities carried out in New Zealand should generate an equally significant amount of New Zealand tax under this structure. 19 However there are several problems with the current tax treatment which prevent this from happening. These are as follows: • The non-resident’s sales income will arguably only have a New Zealand source if the subsidiary is in substance an agent for the non-resident (so that the non- resident can be treated as carrying on business in New Zealand through its subsidiary). Where the subsidiary is just contracting to provide sales related support activities for its non-resident parent, the sales related activities might not be attributable to the non-resident. If this is the case, then the non-resident’s income will not have a New Zealand source. This is despite the fact that the subsidiary is part of the same economic entity as the non-resident and is effectively under its control. • The royalty paid by the non-resident into the low tax jurisdiction for its New Zealand sales will also arguably not have a New Zealand source. As a result, the royalty will not be subject to New Zealand non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) under our domest ic law. • Similarly, New Zealand will be prevented under any applicable DTA from taxing the non-resident’s New Zealand sales income or applying NRWT to its royalty payments unless the New Zealand subsidiary is effectively a dependant agent of the non-resident. Non-residents who use the problematic variant of this structure typically attempt to arrange their business activities so their non- 19 Although New Zealand would never be able to tax all of the sales income. This is because much of the sales income will be attributable to activities carried out overseas, such as the manufacture of goods. New Zealand can only tax the portion of the sales income that is attributable to the activities carried out in New Zealand. 48 resident subsidiaries are not treated as dependant agents. This can often be achieved, as this currently only requires the sales contracts to be signed and partially negotiated offshore. (Note this will change for some of our DTAs as a result of the BEPS Action Plan as discussed below.) As a result of these problems, non-residents using this structure may be able to escape tax on their New Zealand sales income. In addition, the non-resident may be able to pay a royalty to shift its profit from its New Zealand sales out of the non-resident’s jurisdiction (which has a DTA with New Zealand) and into a low tax jurisdict io n (which does not have a DTA with New Zealand) without any New Zealand NRWT being payable. Even if New Zealand cannot tax the non-resident on its sales inco me, it is possible to increase the amount of income derived by the New Zealand subsidiary. This is because, if the New Zealand subsidiary is carrying out significant sales activity, it can be treated as receiving a higher fee from the non-resident under our transfer pricing rules. This does not solve the current problems with taxation of the structure however, as the amount of additional income derived by the New Zealand subsidiary under the transfer pricing rules will usually be less than the amount the non-resident would derive if its sales income was taxable in New Zealand. Effectively, any value attributable to local market factors and intangibles, such as goodwill, would often not be taxed in New Zealand in these circumstances as a practical matter (largely due to a lack of visibility over the value added through the entire supply chain). Effect of OECD’s BEPS measures The OECD’s BEPS PE measures strengthen the definition of a PE by widening the circumstances in which a non-resident’s local representative will give rise to a deemed PE for the non-resident. In particular, the measures provide that a person will give rise to a PE for a non-resident if the person habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non-resident and the contracts are not materially modified by the non-resident. This measure should generally result in the non-resident having a PE under the In-Market Support Structure. However the measures will only apply to a DTA if the other country elects to include them. We expect that several of New Zealand’s treaty partners will not elect to include them. Accordingly the BEPS PE measures will not be effective in many cases for New Zealand’s purposes. A general anti-avoidance provision is also being inserted into DTAs (where the countries sign up to the Multilateral Instrument) as part of the OECD BEPS programme. Called the “principal purpose test”, it provides that a country does not have to grant a treaty benefit if: • obtaining the benefit was a principal purpose of the relevant arrangement; and • granting the benefit in the circumstances is not within the object and purpose of the DTA. The principal purpose test should help us prevent non-residents from using contrived arrangements to gain protection under a DTA from taxation on their NZ sales income. 49 However the principal purpose test may not be very helpful in the absence of the widened PE definit io n. Effect of the proposals in this discussion document The PE avoidance rule in this discussio n document would address the above problems with taxing this structure. In particular, the rule would: • ensure that the New Zealand subsidiary’s sales activity created a PE for the non- resident; • deem the non-resident to supply its goods or services through the PE; • ensure the non-resident’s sales income had a New Zealand source; and • allow New Zealand to apply NRWT to the royalty paid by the non-resident to the related entity resident in the no tax jurisdict ion under any applicable DTA. Therefore the PE avoidance rule would allow New Zealand to tax this structure. However, the amount of tax paid would still be determined under the usual PE profit attribution and transfer pricing rules. Accordingly, New Zealand would not be able to tax all of the non-resident’s New Zealand sales income. This is appropriate however, given that not all of the value was created by the non-resident in New Zealand. 4. In-market sales through a non-resident owned distributor (in-market distributor structure) Under this structure, the non-resident actually has its own separate distributor in New Zealand. The distributor is a New Zealand resident subsidiary of the non-resident which buys the products from the non-resident and on-sells them to New Zealand customers. Under the problematic variant of this structure, the distribution terms are arranged so that the non-resident can justify charging a high price for its sale of the goods to the New Zealand subsidiary. The non-resident argues that this leaves only a small profit margin for the subsidiary to be taxed on in New Zealand. We refer to this problematic variant as the “in-market distributor structure”. Under the in-market distributor structure, the non-resident is not usually the manufacturer of the product, but instead operates a “regional procurement hub” in a low tax jurisdiction to centralise procurement, inventory and some distribution activities. The non-resident procurement hub entity typically carries on limited actual activit ies in relat ion to its sales to the New Zealand subsidiary. The New Zealand subsidiary manages the risks and is the entrepreneurial entity in reality. We set out a diagram of this structure below. 50 In-market distributor N on-res id en t NZ customers Low-tax country NZ Sa les NZ subsidiary 10 0% Manufacturer Sa les Third cou ntry Phy sical sup ply of g ood s Sa les Problems with the current tax treatment of the in-market distributor structure In this case the non-resident does not itself carry out any activities in New Zealand. Consequently: • the non-resident’s sales income does not have a source in New Zealand; and • the non-resident does not have a PE in New Zealand under any applicable DTA. Therefore it is clear that the non-resident is not subject to income tax on its New Zealand sales income, while the New Zealand subsidiary is fully taxable on its sales income (as a New Zealand resident). The problem with this structure is the low amount of profit attributed to the New Zealand subsidiary compared with the non- resident. Typically the non-resident argues that it legally bears most of the enterprise risk, and so it (the non-resident) should receive most of the profits. This is a transfer pricing issue rather than an income source or PE issue. New Zealand’s current legislation generally allows for a reasonable amount of profit to be attributed to New Zealand in most cases. However it is still possible for non-residents to shift their profits offshore by entering into legal arrangements that lack commercial reality. For example, arrangements can be entered into on terms that are commercially unrealistic, but which legally shift the risk (and thus the profits) to the non-resident. That is, current legislation favours respect for the legal form of the transaction over its economic substance. Application of the OECD’s BEPS measures The OECD has revised its transfer pricing guidelines as part of its BEPS measures. The guidelines have been amended to price transactions between related parties more on the basis of their commercial and economic reality than their legal form (although the legal form is still relevant). The transfer pricing guidelines are also intended to prevent profits from being allocated to a location where no contributions are made to those profits, with the profits instead being allocated to the locations where the business activities are actually conducted. The guidelines also require arrangements to be re-characterised where they are on non-commercial terms. The new guidelines should address the in-market distributor structure. This is because under that structure, the non-resident typically carries on no or minimal actual 51 activities. The New Zealand subsidiary manages the risks and is the entrepreneurial entity in reality. Accordingly the new transfer pricing guidelines should attribute a significant amount of profit to the New Zealand subsidiary. New Zealand follows the OCED transfer pricing guidelines to the extent permitted by our domestic legislation. However New Zealand will need to amend its domestic transfer pricing legislation before the revised OECD transfer pricing guidelines can be fully applied. This is because the current New Zealand legislation has a more legal focus, and so does not permit the more substance based approach of the OECD guidelines to be applied in all cases. Application of the transfer pricing measures set out in this discussion document The transfer pricing measures set out in this document would allow New Zealand to apply the new OECD transfer pricing guidelines. Accordingly, the transfer pricing measures would allow us to appropriately tax the in-market distributor structure. The proposed PE avoidance rule would not apply to deem the non-resident to have a PE in respect of its sales to the distributor under this arrangement. This is because the distributor’s sales activities would be in respect of its own sales to customers, not in respect of the non-resident’s sales. 52

CHAPTER 1 Background Introduction 1.1 Since late 2012, there has been significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This problem is referred to as base erosion and profit shifting or BEPS”. 1.2 BEPS is a global problem and many BEPS strategies exploit technical differences between different countries’ tax rules. Accordingly, New Zealand has been working with the OECD and G20 to develop a co- ordinated global solution to address BEPS through the 15-point G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan. 1.3 The Government has already implemented a number of BEPS-related policy reforms and is working on a number of others, including hybrid mismatch rules and strengthened transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) rules. 1.4 This issues paper seeks feedback on New Zealand’s implementation of another OECD BEPS measure – the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (referred to as the multilateral instrument or MLI). The MLI will modify a number of New Zealand’s existing double tax agreements (DTAs) in order to bring them into line with OECD recommendations. OECD’s multilateral instrument 1.5 DTAs are bilateral agreements that aim to mitigate double tax on cross border transactions, often by requiring states to exempt income or provide tax credits. There is the potential for these bilateral agreements to be misused to reduce or eliminate a multinational’s worldwide tax. Misuse of DTAs in this way has been a feature of a number of cross-border tax avoidance arrangements. 1.6 Therefore, addressing treaty abuse has been a major part of the BEPS project and a number of the Action items in the BEPS Action Plan make recommendations that can only be implemented through changes to DTAs, including: • preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Action 6); • preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (Action 7); • neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect (Action 2); and 1 • providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution (Action 14). 1.7 Some of these recommendations are BEPS “minimum standards” that countries that commit to solving BEPS are required to adopt. The minimum standards are the treaty abuse provisions contained in the Action 6 report and certain elements of the dispute resolution provisions contained in the Action 14 report. 1.8 All other provisions are optional, but are DTA “best practice” and now form part of the OECD Model Tax Convention following adoption of the G20/OECD Action Plan. 1.9 Countries were presented with the difficulty of how to quickly and efficient ly implement these measures without requiring the bilateral renegotiation of several thousand existing DTAs. 1.10 In this respect, Action 15 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan recommended developing a multilateral instrument that would swiftly amend the DTAs of all participating jurisdictions. 1.11 The Ad- Hoc Group of officials from approximately 100 jurisdict ions (both OECD and non-OECD jurisdict ions) was formed to develop the text of the MLI. 1 1.12 The OECD held public consultation on the MLI concept in Paris in July 2016. Material related to this consultation and a video recording of submissions is available on the OECD’s website at http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/public-consultation-beps-action-15- multilateral-instrument.htm. 1.13 The text of the MLI and the accompanying Explanatory Statement was published by the OECD in November 2016 at http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-convention-to-implement-tax- treaty-related-measures-to-prevent-beps.htm. 1.14 New Zealand expects to be in a position to sign the MLI in mid-2017. Following signature, the MLI will go through the domestic process for ratification, including being submitted for parliamentary treaty examination. Summary of issues paper 1.15 In chapter 1, this issues paper explains what the MLI is and, at a high level, how it will operate to amend our DTAs. Chapter 2 then explains how the substantive provisions will address BEPS concerns. Chapter 3 sets out the implementation process and next steps. 1.16 The MLI provides New Zealand with a unique opportunity to strengthen our DTAs and ensure they are consistent with international best practice. 1 A list of participating jurisdictions can be found in the OECD’s Brochure on the MLI published in November 2016 at http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-instrument-BEPS-tax-treaty-information-brochure.pdf. 2 Accordingly, the Government has already indicated it intends to sign the MLI, and has made preliminary decisio ns on which DTAs to cover and provisio ns to adopt. Broadly speaking, New Zealand intends the MLI to cover the majority of its DTA network and to adopt all applicable minimum standard and optional provisions. 1.17 Due to the novel nature of the MLI and its interaction with New Zealand’s DTAs, officials are interested in receiving submissions on the implementation of the MLI and practical issues associated with its adoption. How to make a submission 1.18 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. Submissions should be sent to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz wit h “NZ’s implementation of the MLI” in the subject line. 1.19 Alternatively, submissions can be addressed to: New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.20 The closing date for submissions is 7 April 2017. 1.21 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.22 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 3 CHAPTER 2 The multilateral instrument and how it will amend our DTAs 2.1 The MLI is a multilateral international treaty that will enable participating countries to quickly and efficiently modify their network of DTAs to address the treaty-specific BEPS concerns outlined in the OECD’s Action 6, 7, 2 and 14 reports. 2.2 While this is a novel approach to modifying DTAs, it is not unprecedented in international law. Experts in both international tax and public international law participated in the OECD Ad Hoc Group that developed the MLI. 2.3 The MLI is a flexible instrument that allows countries to choose: • which of their existing DTAs they wish to modify through the MLI; • alternative ways of meeting BEPS minimum standards on treaty abuse and dispute resolution; and • whether they want to adopt the OECD-recommended provisions for non-minimum standards. Within some of these provisions, there are alternative ways of addressing BEPS concerns and the ability for countries to enter a variety of reservations. 2.4 To ensure the operation of the MLI is clear and transparent, signatories to the MLI must notify the OECD Depository of which DTAs it wishes to cover, which reservations it wishes to enter, optional provisions it wishes to choose and which provisions in its nominated DTAs will be modified by the MLI. The OECD will publish this information online and it will be readily accessible to the public. 2.5 In addition, the OECD has adopted an Explanatory Statement that provides detailed commentary on the operation, and in limited cases, the substance of the MLI. The Explanatory Statement is available on OECD’s website at http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/explanatory-statement-mult ilateral- convention-to-implement-tax-treaty-related-measures-to-prevent-BEPS.pdf 2.6 This chapter outlines the structure and high level operation of the MLI. Chapter 3 further explains how the substantive provisions will address BEPS concerns and sets out New Zealand’s position on the MLI. Chapter 4 then sets out the implementation process and next steps. Structure of the multilateral instrument 2.7 Before describing how the MLI operates, it is useful to understand its broad structure. 4 Section Relevant Article(s) Description Title and preamble Sets out the context and purpose of the MLI. Part I: Scope and Interpretation of Terms 1 to 2 Governs application of the MLI and defines key terms including Covered Tax Agreement. Parts II – V: Substantive BEPS measures 3 to 17 Contains the operative clauses on hybrid mismatches, treaty abuse, PE avoidance, and improved Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). Each operative clause has a corresponding compatibility clause, reservation clause and notification clause. Some articles also permit choices between alternative clauses. This structure is explained further below. Part VI: Arbitration 18 to 26 Contains a framework for independent binding arbitration. Part VII: Final provisions 27 to 39 Contains mechanical provisions including those governing signature, ratification, amendment, notifications, language, entry into force and entry into effect. Operation of substantive provisions of the multilateral instrument 2.8 Broadly speaking, the MLI will modify any bilateral DTA 2 to which New Zealand is a party to include the strengthened provisions to the extent: • both New Zealand and the other party choose to include that DTA as a Covered Tax Agreement; and • both New Zealand and the other party choose to adopt the relevant article in a way compatible with each other’s choice. 2.9 In this way, the MLI could be viewed as a way of facilitating a large scale simultaneous negotiat ion to modify bilateral DTAs to include treaty-related BEPS measures (and in particular, to enable jurisdictions to meet the OECD’s minimum standards on treaty abuse and dispute resolution). 2.10 It is important to note that jurisdict ions cannot generally choose to apply different articles of the MLI to different DTAs. Jurisdictions must decide which DTAs they want to include as Covered Tax Agreements and what their choices of articles will be – those choices will apply for all Covered Tax Agreements. 2.11 For example, New Zealand could not choose for the MLI to apply to the New Zealand-Australia and New Zealand-Japan DTAs, but choose for the new dual resident entity provision in Article 4(1) of the MLI to be included in the New Zealand-Japan DTA, but not the New Zealand-Australia DTA. 2 The MLI only applies to existing, full DTAs, not to future treaties or to treaties such as tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). 5 2.12 There are limited exceptions to this principle. Some reservations allo w jurisdictions to make reservations with respect to the application of specific articles in relation to certain Covered Tax Agreements or provisions within Covered Tax Agreements with certain objectively defined characteristics. For example, jurisdictions can choose for certain MLI provisions not to apply to Covered Tax Agreements that already contain equivalent provisions. 2.13 The OECD will maintain a public list of Covered Tax Agreements, reservations and choices of options and a list of affected Covered Tax Agreement provisions online to make it easy for the public to find out which DTAs are modified by the MLI and to assist in determining how a particular Covered Tax Agreement is modified. 2.14 The following paragraphs explain in more detail the structure of the MLI and how it will operate. Covered Tax Agreements: Part I of the MLI: Scope and Interpretation of Terms (Articles 1–2) 2.15 In identifying the effect of the MLI on a DTA, the first question to be asked, is whether the DTA in question is a Covered Tax Agreement. This is governed by Part I of the MLI. 2.16 At the time of signature, every adopting jurisdiction must provide the OECD Depository with a list of the DTAs it wishes to modify via the MLI. If a party to a DTA does not list it, then it will not be a Covered Tax Agreement and it will not be modified by the MLI. 2.17 If there is a bilateral match (both parties list the DTA), that DTA is a Covered Tax Agreement for the purpose of the MLI and will be modified in accordance with the choices made by the parties to that agreement. 2.18 New Zealand has 40 DTAs in force and New Zealand’s general approach is to include the majority of these as Covered Tax Agreements. This gives New Zealand the best chance of strengthening our DTAs with as many countries as possible. The only DTAs we propose to omit are ones where we: • know the other jurisdict ion is not intending to sign the MLI; or • are renegotiating our DTA and the other party also agrees that it should not be covered because the provisions are expected to be included in the new DTA. Modifying provisions: Parts II – VI of the MLI (Articles 3–26) 2.19 Once a DTA is identified as a Covered Tax Agreement, the second question is how it would be modified by the MLI. This is governed by Parts II to VI of the MLI. 6 Specific BEPS measures: Parts II – V of the MLI (Articles 3 – 17) 2.20 These articles implement the measures recommended in the: • Action 2 report – neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect (Articles 3 to 5); 3 • Action 6 report – preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Articles 6 to 11); • Action 7 report – preventing the artificial avoidance of PE status (Articles 12 to 15); and • Act ion 14 report – improving dispute resolution (Articles 16 and 17). 2.21 Generally speaking, each substantive provision contains an operative clause, compatibility clause, a reservation clause and a notification clause: • Operative clause. This is the substantive provision to be read into the Covered Tax Agreement. For example, Article 4(1) contains the new dual resident entity provision recommended in the Action 6 report. • Compatibility clause. Explains the operative clause’s relationship with provisio ns of Covered Tax Agreements. Many of the MLI provisions overlap with provisions found in Covered Tax Agreements. In some cases, they can be applied without conflict with the provisions of Covered Tax Agreements. However, where the MLI provisions conflict with existing provisions covering the same subject matter, this is addressed by the compatibility clauses. The language in, and operation of, the compatibility clauses varies. For example, some clauses use the phrases “applies in the place of”, “applies to”, “modifies”, or “applies in place of or the absence of”. Regardless of the wording used, the compatibility clauses make it clear how the MLI modifies the existing Covered Tax Agreement. For example, Article 4(2) explains that the new Article 4(1) applies “in place of or in the absence of” an equivalent provision in a Covered Tax Agreement. • Reservation clause. This defines the specific reservations parties are able to make with respect to the operative clause (for example, Article 4(3) allows parties to make five alternative reservations with respect to Art icle 4, and choose one optional alternative to the wording in Article 4(1)); and • Notification clause. The notification clause requires parties to notify the OECD Depositary of choices of options, reservations and existing provisions in Covered Tax Agreements that are within the scope of the compatibility clause (for example, Article 4(4) requires parties to notify the OECD Depository of articles in its Covered Tax Agreements that are described in the compatibility clause and are not subject to a reservation). Notification is very important. If the notification required by an article is not completed, generally speaking, an article in a Covered Tax Agreement is not modified pursuant to the compatibility 3 Article 4 relates to dual resident entities and, while it relates to a hybrid entity, the new provision originated in the Action 6, rather than the Action 2 report. 7 clause. The reason for this approach is to ensure clarity and transparency about the application of the MLI. The table below shows how the compatibility clauses and notification process work together. 2.22 For a more detailed discussion on how these provisions operate, see paragraphs 13 to 18 of the OECD’s Explanatory Statement (see paragraph 2.5 for details). Arbitration – Part VI (Articles 18 to 26) 2.23 This Part of the MLI was developed by a separate OECD Sub-Group on Arbitration. Its structure differs from that described above in respect of Parts II to V. Generally speaking, it allows parties to insert an entirely new framework for dispute resolution through mandatory binding arbitration. If the compatibility clause states that the MLI provision... Then the notification provision states that the MLI provision will apply... applies “in place of” an existing provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, the provision is intended to replace an existing provision if one exists, and is not intended to apply if an existing provision does not exist only in cases where all parties to the particular Covered Tax Agreement make a notification with respect to the existence or absence (as applicable) of a relevant provision of the Covered Tax Agreement. “applies to” or “modifies” an existing provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, the provision of the Convention is intended to change the application of an existing provision without replacing it, and therefore can only apply if there is an existing provision applies “in the absence of” an existing provision of a Covered Tax Agreement applies “in place of or in the absence of” an existing provision of a Covered Tax Agreement in all cases. If both parties to the particular Covered Tax Agreement notify the existence of an existing provision, that provision will be replaced by the MLI provision (to the extent described in the relevant compatibility clause). If the parties to a particular Covered Tax Agreement do not notify the existence of a provision, the MLI provision will still apply. If there is a relevant existing provision which has not been notified by all parties, the MLI provision will override that existing provision if it is incompatible with the relevant MLI provision. If there is no existing provision, the MLI provision will in effect be added to the Covered Tax Agreement. 8 2.24 It requires parties to “opt-in” to the arbitration provisio ns by notifying the OECD Depository that it wishes to apply Part VI, rather than “opting-out” by making a reservation. 2.25 It has a single compatibility clause for the entire Part in Article 26, rather than article-by-article compatibility clauses. It also allows parties to make bespoke reservations as to the scope of arbitration, subject to acceptance by DTA partners (rather than the set of defined reservations permitted under Parts II to V). 2.26 For Parts I to VI, the OECD will maintain a public list of reservations, choices of options and affected Covered Tax Agreement provisions to assist all interested parties to determine how Covered Tax Agreements are modified. 2.27 Once the MLI comes into effect for a particular Covered Tax Agreement (explained further in chapter 3), the MLI will operate as a stand-alone treaty that modifies the Covered Tax Agreement according to its terms. 9 CHAPTER 3 How the multilateral instrument provisions will address BEPS concerns 3.1 As discussed in chapter 2, the MLI’s substantive provisions fall into two categories: minimum standards and optional provisions. These provisions to address BEPS concerns in four key areas, which are summarised at a high level in the table below. Generally speaking, New Zealand intends to adopt the minimum standards and optional provisions. 3.2 Further detail of each provision and New Zealand’s approach is provided in the table in the appendix. Substantive BEPS provisions Minimum standard? Preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (for example, treaty shopping) This will be achieved primarily by inserting a “principal purpose test” (PPT) or equivalent provision into Covered Tax Agreements. The PPT is a treaty anti-abuse rule similar to our domestic law general anti- avoidance rule (GAAR) and New Zealand intends to adopt the PPT. This corresponds to Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan. Yes Preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status Unless a multinational’s activity in a jurisdiction reaches a sufficient threshold level known as a PE, that jurisdiction cannot tax any business profits made by that multinational. If a multinational is able to avoid having a PE in a jurisdiction, then it can avoid paying tax on its profits in that jurisdiction. DTAs contain the definition of a PE and this needs to be strengthened to prevent entities structuring around it. This corresponds to Action 7 of the BEPS Action Plan. No Neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch entities These arrangements allow multinationals to structure their commercial arrangements to pay little or no tax by arbitraging the different domestic law treatment of certain instruments and entities between jurisdictions. For example, one jurisdiction may see income as being derived by a partnership as an entity, whereas another jurisdiction may treat that income as being derived directly by the underlying partners (that is, they disregard or look-through the partnership). The changes implemented through the MLI complement the domestic law changes outlined in the recently released officials’ issues paper on hybrid mismatch arrangements. This corresponds to Action 2 of the BEPS Action Plan. No 10 Substantive BEPS provisions Minimum standard? Providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution This is a taxpayer-friendly measure allowing for mandatory binding arbitration of disagreements between competent authorities (CAs). It recognises the fact that measures to counter BEPS should not lead to unnecessary uncertainty for compliant taxpayers and to unintended double taxation. Improving dispute resolution mechanisms is therefore an integral component of the work on BEPS issues. The changes in the MLI will improve the MAP – which allows taxpayers to ask the CAs of each treaty partner to agree the correct interpretation and application of a DTA in a particular case – and will also allow the taxpayer to refer the case to an independent arbitrator (or panel of arbitrators) if the CAs cannot agree on the correct treaty position. This corresponds to Action 14 of the BEPS Action Plan. Yes (in respect of MAP only, arbitration is optional) 11 CHAPTER 4 Implementation and entry into effect Signature and ratification 4.1 The MLI will be signed by a number of participating jurisdictions in June 2017. At the time of signature, a list of reservations, notifications and choices will be provided to the OECD Depository. 4 Jurisdictions will also be able to sign up to the MLI at a later date. 4.2 After signing, the MLI will need to go through New Zealand’s domestic treaty-making process. This will be the same process as for DTAs and amending protocols. Recent amendments to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 – the empowering provision for New Zealand’s DTAs – make it clear that multilateral agreements can be implemented under this section. 4.3 This treaty-making process will involve the tabling of the MLI and a national interest analysis (NIA) in the House of Representatives for treaty examination. Following consideration by Select Committee, an Order in Council will be submitted to Cabinet for approval and once this is in force, New Zealand will formally ratify the MLI by submitting an instrument of ratification to the OECD Depository. At the time of ratification, New Zealand must confirm its list of reservations, notifications and choices. 4.4 After this point in time, jurisdictions are able to add new DTAs as Covered Tax Agreements and wit hdraw their reservations (or enter more limited reservations), but are unable to enter new reservations. The effect of this is that, following ratification, New Zealand (and other) jurisdictions can expand, but not narrow, the application of the MLI to their DTA network. Entry into force 4.5 The MLI will enter into force generally (in its own right) and for the states that have ratified it, three to four months after the fift h jurisdict ion has ratified the MLI. 4.6 For each jurisdiction ratifying the MLI after it has entered into force, it will enter into force three to four months after that jurisdiction deposits it s instrument of ratification. 4 The notification process is very important as the operation of many of the articles of the MLI turn on notification. To facilitate the notification exercise, the OECD is hosting a meeting in February 2017 to enable jurisdictions to ensure their bilateral notifications match. 12 4.7 This entry into force does not mean that a jurisdiction’s Covered Tax Agreements are modified by the MLI at this point in time. For a specific Covered Tax Agreement to be modified by the MLI, the MLI must have come into effect for that Covered Tax Agreement. Entry into effect for a specific Covered Tax Agreement 4.8 The MLI will enter into effect to modify each bilateral DTA, on a phased-in basis, once both parties to the DTA have signed and ratified the MLI. 4.9 For withho lding tax, it will apply where the event giving rise to the tax occurs on or after 1 January of the next calendar year beginning on or after the latest date on which the Convention enters into force for each of the parties to the Covered Tax Agreement. 4.10 For income tax, it will apply to taxable periods (in New Zealand’s case, income years) beginning on or after a 6 mo nth period from the latest date on which the Convention enters into force for each of the parties to the Covered Tax Agreement. 4.11 The example below illustrates the theoretical timeline for how the entry into force and effect could work for a DTA between New Zealand and Jurisdict ion B. Multilateral instrument entry into force and entry into effect for New Zealand–Jurisdiction B DTA 4.12 While the precise dates on which New Zealand’s DTAs will begin to be modified are unknown, it is likely that the earliest modifications will occur in 2019. 13 4.13 Part VI (Arbitration) will generally apply to cases presented to Competent Authorities (CAs) on or after the latest date on which the MLI enters into force for each of the parties to the Covered Tax Agreement. By mutual agreement, jurisdictions can agree to submit a case to arbitration that was presented to the CAs prior to this time. Notification of entry into effect for specific Covered Tax Agreements 4.14 As each jurisdiction submits its instrument of ratification to the OECD Depository, New Zealand will be notified. When the MLI comes into force for each of New Zealand’s DTAs the Government will announce the fact. 5 This is to advise taxpayers that the DTA has been modified. Domestic law changes 4.15 Some domestic law changes may be needed to facilitate the modifications to New Zealand’s DTAs by the MLI. 4.16 For example, officials anticipate there may need to be some amendments to the dispute procedures in Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable cases to be submitted to arbitration without prejudicing taxpayer rights under the domest ic law. 4.17 Officials are interested to receive submissions on these and other aspects of domestic law that may need to be similarly amended. Consolidated versions of DTAs 4.18 The Government will not be producing consolidated versions of each DTA modified by the MLI. This is consistent with existing practice for amending protocols. Commercial publishers are likely to produce consolidated versio ns. Submissions points We are interested to hear from readers: • Are there any significant implementation issues the Government should consider in adopting the MLI? • What practical options exist to minimise uncertainty and compliance costs associated with New Zealand adopting the MLI? • What domestic law changes may be needed to facilitate the implementation of the MLI? 5 Published at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz 14 APPENDIX Substantive BEPS provisions in the multilateral instrument BEPS measure Detail Minimum standard Should NZ adopt? 1. Neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect (Action 2 report) Fiscally transparent entities The MLI introduces or amends a fiscally transparent entity (FTE) provision. FTEs (like trusts or partnerships) create arbitrage opportunities because they are treated differently for tax purposes by different countries. The MLI provision clarifies that treat y benefits will only be allowed to the extent to which the item of income is taxed in the state in which the entity is resident. New Zealand already includes this provision (or an equivalent provision) in its DTAs with Australia, United States, Chile and Japan. Article 3 of the MLI No Yes Dual resident entities The MLI introduces or amends a dual resident entity (DRE) tie breaker provision. Like FTEs, DREs can be used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The proposed provision will require CAs to agree the residence status of a DRE and the DRE will only be entitled to such treaty benefits as the CAs agree. Article 4 of the MLI No Yes Relief of double taxation The MLI allows countries to strengthen their application of the exemption method to relieve double taxation. New Zealand already applies the (more robust) credit method in all of its DTAs, and therefore proposes not to adopt any of the options. Article 5 of the MLI No Not applicable 2. Preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Action 6 report) Preamble language – minimum standard The MLI will amend the preamble to DTAs to emphasise that as well as aiming to relieve double taxation, the treaty also aims to prevent opportunities for non-taxation, reduced taxation or tax avoidance. Article 6(1) and (2) of the MLI Yes Yes Preamble language – optional amendment The MLI allows countries to adopt the following optional amendment to the preamble to DTAs: “Desiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their co-operation in tax matters,” Article 6(3) and (6) of the MLI No Yes 15 BEPS measure Detail Minimum standard Should NZ adopt? Treaty anti-abuse rules The MLI requires jurisdictions to introduce an anti-abuse rule into DTAs. Jurisdictions can meet this minimum requirement in one of three ways: 1. a principal purpose test (PPT) alone; 2. a PPT plus a “simplified limitation on benefits” (LOB) clause. The LOB is a mechanical provision that seeks to identify, through a series of black-letter tests, whether a person is genuinely entitled to the benefits of a DTA; or 3. enter into bilateral negotiations to include a detailed LOB provision plus a PPT or anti-conduit rules. In the case of New Zealand, officials’ favour adopting a PPT alone. The PPT is very similar to New Zealand’s domestic law GAAR and will deny treaty benefits if the principal purpose of an arrangement was to secure those benefits. Also, in officials’ view, it generally covers the same treaty shopping issues as the alternative approaches. Article 7 of the MLI Yes Yes Dividend transfer transactions The MLI introduces a provision that requires shares to be held for a minimum of 365 days for the shareholder to be entitled to the reduced withholding tax (WHT) rates on dividends. This is to stop shareholders buying shares temporarily to access the reduced WHT rates and then immediately selling them. Article 8 of the MLI No Yes Land rich company rules The MLI introduces a treaty provision that strengthens the anti-abuse “land-rich company” test (land rich companies are companies whose assets are mainly land). S ome treaties do not contain this provision at all, so the MLI also allows it to be inserted into those treaties. The new rule reinforces the position that the source jurisdiction can tax land held by non-resident owners in the other jurisdiction through corporate vehicles. To prevent artificial and temporary dilution of the amount of land held by a company just before sale, the MLI provision requires the threshold for the amount of land ownership which triggers the rule to be measured on every day in the 365 day period leading up to the sale of the shares. The MLI provision also ensures the same rule applies to other investment vehicles such as partnerships and trusts. Article 9 of the MLI No Yes 16 BEPS measure Detail Minimum standard Should NZ adopt? Third-state PE rules The MLI introduces a treaty provision that denies treaty benefits in the case of income derived by a PE of a resident of one of the parties to the DTA, where that PE is situated in a low tax third-state. Article 10 of the MLI No Yes Right to tax own residents The MLI introduces a provision that preserves a jurisdiction’s right to tax its own residents (for example, this prevents New Zealand residents engaged in a tax avoidance arrangement claiming a DTA prevents New Zealand from using the domestic law GAAR to impose tax). Article 11 of the MLI No Yes 3. Preventing the artificial avoidance of PE status Commissionaire arrangements and similar strategies Currently, a number of artificial structures including the civil law concept of a “commissionaire” can be used to avoid having a PE in a jurisdiction. A new provision will deem non-residents using these structures to have a PE in the jurisdiction. Articles 12 and 15 of the MLI No Yes Specific activity exemptions – preparatory and auxiliary qualification Certain specific activities carried on in a jurisdiction are deemed not to constitute a PE (for example, premises used for simply storing goods or stock maintained for display or delivery). These specific carve-outs from the PE definition allowed quite substantial economic activities to fall within them. The MLI proposes clarifying that the specific carve- outs listed in the DTA must be subject to an additional requirement that they be “preparatory and auxiliary” in nature. There are two options for dealing with this issues – Option A (which New Zealand favours) which subjects all of the existing specific activities to an explicit “preparatory and auxiliary” test, and Option B, which does not subject the specific activities to the “preparatory and auxiliary” test (because these activities are considered to be inherently preparatory and auxiliary in nature), but subjects any other activity or combination of activities to the “preparatory and auxiliary” test. Articles 13 and 15 of the MLI No Yes Specific activity exemptions – Anti-fragmentation rule The MLI introduces an “anti-fragmentation” rule that will prevent an enterprise from dividing up all of its activities so that related parties each carry on a separate part of the business (that fall within the PE exceptions), but taken together they constitute a PE. Articles 13 and 15 of the MLI No Yes 17 BEPS measure Detail Minimum standard Should NZ adopt? Anti-contract splitting rule Currently a construction, installation or building project does not constitute a PE unless it last for more 12 months. Entities were abusing this 12 month limit by having back-to-back 12 month contracts so they never exceeded the 12 month threshold. Generally the contracts were undertaken by different companies within the same group of companies. The new an “anti-contract splitting” rule will aggregate related projects to prevent PE avoidance. Articles 14 and 15 of the MLI No Yes 4. Providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution MAP – access to the CAs of either jurisdiction In covered tax agreements that do not already have it, the MLI will introduce a provision allowing taxpayers to request mutual agreement procedure (MAP) in cases where they believe taxation is not in accordance with the treaty. If a MAP provision is already contained in a DTA, the MLI will amend it to allow taxpayers to approach the CA of either jurisdiction to resolve uncertainty as to how the DTA applies (New Zealand’s DTAs currently contain MAP provisions, but taxpayers are only entitled to approach the CA of the jurisdiction of which they are a resident). Article 16 of the MLI Yes Yes MAP – corresponding adjustment Requires contracting states to make appropriate corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases. Article 17 of the MLI No Yes Arbitration If, under the MAP process, the CAs do not agree on the correct interpretation of the DTA, the CAs can submit the matter to an independent arbitrator (or a panel of three arbitrators) for decision. The arbitrators will decide which of the CAs is correct. The CAs are generally bound by the decision of the arbitrators, but the taxpayer is not. Therefore, the taxpayer could pursue a court case if it disagrees with the arbitrators’ decision. New Zealand’s approach is to adopt what is referred to as “final offer” or “last best offer” arbitration (in Article 23(1)), but to accept “independent opinion” arbitration if the other party to the Covered Tax Agreement chooses this (by entering a reservation under Article 23(2)). In the case of “independent opinion” arbitration, New Zealand will adopt Article 24(2) and (3) which means that the arbitrators’ decision will not be binding on the CAs if they come to an alternative resolution of all unresolved issues within 3 calendar months of the delivery of the arbitrators’ decision. New Zealand also proposes to require undertakings of confidentiality by all parties involved in arbitration (Article 23(5)) and reserves the right not to include arbitration provisions in Covered Tax Agreements with jurisdictions that do not require the same (Article 23(6) and (7)). New Zealand intends to enter a free form reservation in respect to arbitration to carve out cases that involve the application of New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule contained in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Articles 18 – 26 of the MLI No Yes 18

The proposal would provide the ability to defer the taxation point for employees of start-up companies (with a corresponding deferral of the company’s deduction). 1.2 ESS are an important way o f incentivising and remunerating employees in New Zealand and internationally. It is important that their treatment under New Zealand tax law does not advantage or disadvantage their use compared to other forms of remuneration. The thrust of the proposals in the May 2016 issues paper was to ensure that the taxation of ESS benefits is consistent with the taxation of cash remuneration. Officials released a further consultation document in September 2016 2 seeking submissions on the updated proposal. The policy recommendations resulting from this second round of consultation are contained in the recently introduced Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Investment and Employment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 1.3 Chapter 6 of that issues paper discussed and sought submissions on the possibility of a deferral regime for start-up companies. This deferral regime would delay the point that the employee was required to pay tax on the benefit fro m ESS (with a corresponding deferral of the company’s deduction). The proposal was also discussed with stakeholders who were open to the possibility of an elective regime for start-up companies. 1.4 The purpose of this paper is to provide more detail on a possible deferral regime, and determine through consultation whether a fair deferral regime can be developed. 1.5 The approach taken in this paper is not intended to provide a tax concession. The “cost” of deferring the taxing point is that employees will, in effect, be taxable on any gains on the shares until the deferral taxing point occurs. Of course, where the shares decline in value, this will result in less tax for the emplo yee. Taxation of employee share scheme income as proposed in the Bill 1.6 The proposals in the Bill 3 were designed to ensure that employees will be taxable on shares received in connection with an ESS once the shares are earned by the employee, and they become the “economic owner” of the shares. Broadly speaking, an employee is the “economic owner” of the shares when all conditions and contingencies relating to their ownership or 1 Taxation of employee share schemes: An officials’ issues paper, Inland Revenue (May 2016). 2 Tax treatment of employee share schemes – further consultation, Inland Revenue (September 2016). 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Investment and Employment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 1 retention of the shares have fallen away, so that they hold them on substantially the same basis as non-emplo yee shareholders. This is defined in the Bill as the “share scheme taxing date”. The amount of income is the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date, less any amount the employee pays for the shares. 1.7 Conditions and contingencies can include: • The possibility of loss of the shares if the person does not remain employed for a future period, or if the company’s performance does not meet certain benchmarks. • Where the employer sells shares to the employee and provides a limited-recourse loan to finance the purchase price. Proposals Tax deferral schemes for start-up companies 1.8 This issues paper considers the feedback received on the May 2016 issues paper in relation to start-ups. It then uses those as a starting point for discussing revised proposals. 1.9 For unconditional share schemes, that is, where ordinary shares are provided to an employee with no conditions attached to them, the tax treatment will not change under the proposals in the Bill. These shares will give rise to employment income when the shares are acquired. In the case of employee share options, employees are generally taxed when the options are exercised. 1.10 The proposals in the Bill generally would have the effect of taxing ESS benefits at the same time or later than they are currently taxed. Nevertheless, some submitters commented that taxing share benefits is problematic where the employee cannot sell the shares at the taxing point. This is for two reasons. First, it might be difficult to find the cash to pay the tax. Second, valuation might be problematic. Both of these issues are likely to be at their most pressing for early stage or start-up companies. That is the basis for the deferral proposal for start-up companies in this issues paper, which is discussed in Chapters 2 to 8. 1.11 This paper seeks further submissions on details regarding the design of a deferral scheme. This includes a discussion on: • the scope of the deferral measure; • the nature and timing of the election; • when the tax impost should arise under the deferral scheme; • timing of deductions for the employer; and • matters of administration and compliance. 2 Ensuring the R&D loss cash-out can apply to ESS benefits 1.12 In Chapter 9 we discuss the interaction of the ESS start-up proposals and the existing R&D loss cash-out regime and propose to ensure that ESS costs to the employer are appropriately dealt with under that regime. 1.13 Feedback on this issues paper will be used to help shape recommendations to Government for its consideration and inclusion in a future tax bill.

Even if the shares can be valued, the employees are often unable to sell a portion of their shares to meet the tax liability and therefore have to fund the liability from other income or borrowings – thus making the scheme less attractive. The employer could provide cash income to pay the tax. However, start-up companies typically experience cashflow constraints as well and therefore the problem is simply transferred to the emplo yer. Valuation 2.3 Under both the current law and the proposals in the Bill, calculating the tax payable by an employee often requires a valuation of the shares at the relevant taxing point. 2.4 If the shares are in a listed company, the value of the shares at the time tax is payable can be easily found. It is more difficult to determine the value of the shares in an unlisted company, particularly if it is an early stage or start-up company, with little or no operating history, no cashflows and very few tangible assets. For example, the value of such a company may depend completely on its success in developing an untested idea, and as such is extremely speculative. In such a case, determining the value of the shares is an uncertain and difficult exercise, as well as a potentially expensive one. 2.5 Inland Revenue has recently introduced valuation guidelines for shares received by an employee under an ESS. 4 Liquidity 2.6 Start-up companies are also often cash constrained – all available cash is allocated to developing the business. This is one reason they use employee share schemes to remunerate employees – because it reduces the amount of cash salary they have to pay. Similarly, an employee who accepts part of their remuneration in shares may not have a lot of extra cash. They may 4 Commissioner’s Statement CS 17/01 – Determining “value” of shares received by an employee under a share purchase agreement. 5 receive a modest cash salary to cover living costs and the rest of their remuneration in shares. 2.7 Compounding this issue is that in early-stage companies, and often in a broader set of unlisted companies, there is a very limited market for the employee’s shares. The emplo yee will also often be prohibited from selling the shares other than to existing shareholders (and in some cases, that also may be impermissible) by the terms of the scheme. However, there will usually be no requirement for the existing shareholders to buy the shares. This makes it very difficult for the employee to sell their shares. 2.8 Because the shares may not be easily sold to generate cash, submitters have raised the imposit ion of tax on the ESS benefit received as a barrier to using ESS. Under current law, subject to the potential application of the general anti-avoidance rule, it has been possible to provide share benefits to employees without any income tax arising. So in many cases, this practical cashflow issue may not have been relevant because there is simply no tax to pay. The proposed measures in the Bill prevent the use of these structures to avoid tax. While this is the correct economic outcome, officials recognise the case for considering ways to reduce the difficulty of meeting a tax cost fro m receipt of illiquid shares. Self-help solution – long-term options 2.9 Under current law, it is possible to legitimately structure an employee share scheme so that it has the practical effect of deferring the taxing point – thus avoiding or minimising issues of liquidity and valuation. This can be done by using what is known as a long-dated option. 2.10 For example, if an employee is given an option which expires in 20 years, the employee can defer the taxing point in relation to that option until the company has an initial public offering (IPO) or the employee wishes to sell the shares. The employee can wait until that time to exercise the option. The employee will then have income equal to the value of the shares at that time, less the option price. This avenue for avoiding cashflow and liquidity issues is not affected by the Bill. 2.11 However, submitters have said that option holders may not have the same sense of ownership as shareholders. Option holders do not ordinarily have certain rights held by shareholders in a company, including the right to vote. Share ownership is desirable as it aligns the emplo yees’ mot ivat ions wit h the company’s. 2.12 Submitters also explained that long-dated options are undesirable from the perspective of other shareholders and may result in a significant accounting expense for employers that have to comply with IFRS. 2.13 Therefore submitters said that, as a practical matter, many companies may not wish to take advantage of this self-help so lut ion. 6 CHAPTER 3 Deferral regime for start-up companies 3.1 In the May 2016 issues paper, we asked for submissions on the desirability of a regime which would allow employees in start-up companies to elect to defer the recognition of ESS income until there was a “liquidity event” to fund the tax on the income (for example, when the shares are sold or listed or the assets of the company are so ld and the proceeds are distributed when the company is wound up). The employee would be taxed on the value of the shares at this time, less any amount the employee paid for them (and the employer would be entitled to a corresponding deduction at that time). 3.2 This would address both the valuation and liquidity issues. For example, at the time the shares are listed, there is an established market value and the emplo yee can sell some shares to get the cash with which to satisfy the tax liability. 3.3 Deferral of taxation yields an after-tax outcome for the employee which is equivalent to upfront taxation. The taxation of the changing value of the share can be shown to be equivalent to upfront taxation, without the attendant problems of valuation and cashflow. The intuition is that scaling down the amount invested at the outset of the arrangement through taxation is equivalent to scaling down the benefits by the same percentage through taxation at a later time (that is, when there is a sale or listing of the shares). Example 1: Simple comparison of tax at issue and deferred tax An employee receives $100 of wages, pays tax (or not if tax is deferred), and invests the after-tax proceeds in shares of the company. Suppose the share value increases by a factor of ten between the investment date and the date when the employee sells them. Tax at issue Tax of $33 is paid upfront, leaving an after-tax amount of $67 to be invested in shares of the company. The shares go up 10 times to $670. Deferred tax No tax is paid upfront and $100 is invested in the shares of the company. The shares go up 10 times to $1,000, and tax of $330 is paid when the shares are sold, leaving the same net position of $670. Conclusions Tax at issue and deferred tax at sale are equivalent. Reducing the amount invested by 33% upfront is equivalent to reducing the proceeds by 33% at the end. The small amount of tax of $33 upfront leaves the employee in the same net position as the large amount of tax of $330 at the end. 7 3.4 Under a deferral regime, from the moment that a liquidity event has occurred and the employee’s taxable income is calculated, the emplo yee would hold the shares on the same basis as any other shareholder – that is, based on their specific circumstances they may hold the shares on capital account. For example, if an employee continues to hold the shares after an IPO, and did not acquire the shares for the purpose of disposal, then only the increase in value arising between the time the shares or options were granted and when the shares are listed would be taxed. If the shares continued to increase in value after the IPO, those gains would in most cases be tax-free capital gains. Example 2: Deferral of tax on exercising options An employee has options to acquire 10,000 shares in the company for $1 per share. The option can be exercised once the employee has been working for three years, and the option does not expire for a further two years. The employee exercises their options for $10,000 five years after they are granted. As there is no secondary market for the shares it is difficult to establish their market value. An election has been made to defer the tax on shares issued under the ESS. At the end of year six the company is listed with a share price of $5 per share. This ends the deferral period and the employee is taxed on income of $40,000 ($50,000 of shares less the $10,000 purchase price). The employee sells 500 shares a year later for $7 per share. In most cases there will be no tax to pay, as the shares are held as a capital asset. Forfeiture of tax losses for employers 3.5 Start-up companies generally generate unusable tax losses in their early years of operation, only to forfeit these losses when third party investors buy a stake in the company (because they lose shareholder continuity at that point). It is also after this point in time when companies are likely to be generating a net profit and would like to be able to use the earlier carried forward losses to reduce their current year tax bill. 3.6 Therefore, allowing employers a tax deduction for ESS benefits at an early stage in the company’s life cycle may not be particularly beneficial for start- up companies who often expect to forfeit their tax losses at some stage. 3.7 The ability to defer the taxing point for ESS benefits and the associated tax deduction to a time when they are more likely to be able to use the deduction is likely to be attractive for start-up companies. On the basis that tax deferral applies to deductions as well as income, a deferral scheme may be useful to emplo yers directly. 8 Other possibilities 3.8 There are at least two other possible approaches that could be taken to deal with the issues faced by start-up companies. Non-deductible and non-assessable approach 3.9 One approach would be to exempt the income and deny a deduction. This is the approach taken for widely offered share schemes. It is concessional compared wit h the tax treatment of other forms of remuneration in two respects. First, insofar as the employee’s marginal rate is higher than the corporate rate and second, where the employer is in tax loss. As to the first of these, while at 5% the current margin is not particularly high, it is possible that may change in the future. Accordingly, we do not propose to extend this treatment beyond the ambit of the widely offered schemes. As to the second, because the ESS benefits may be relatively significant, it does not seem appropriate to treat them as non-assessable to the employee, even if deductions were denied to the employer. Officials believe the deferral proposal is a preferable solution to the issues faced by loss companies. Cashing out losses 3.10 A second approach would be to cash out the ESS deduction in the case of a loss making company. This would eliminate the rate differential issue, assuming the cash out is at a 28% rate. It would provide the company with most of the money required to pay PAYE or a cash gross-up paid to the employee. Again, however, it would be a significant departure from our current taxation of employment remuneration. Currently, losses are able to be cashed out only where the R&D loss tax credit regime applies. We propose to ensure this applies to ESS benefits like other forms of remuneration. It does not seem appropriate from a policy perspective to allow a cash out to apply to a certain form of remuneration and not to other expenses. Submission points  Do submitters think a deferral regime would be attractive to employers?  Is there any alternative arrangement that would be attractive to companies and would not result in under-taxation? 9 10 CHAPTER 4 Scope of deferral measure 4.1 In the May 2016 issues paper, we asked submitters for their views on which companies should be eligible to offer schemes with a deferred taxing point. For practical and administrative reasons, our proposal is to restrict the availability of the deferral regime to “start-up” companies (as defined). Defining “start-up” companies 4.2 Some submitters suggested that in principle, the deferral option should be available to all companies without share liquidity. This could include all companies that are not quoted on the official list of a recognised stock exchange. 4.3 However, opening up the availability of deferral too widely could cause administrative difficulties for Inland Revenue, especially in the area of auditing compliance with the deferral regime, for example. Some restrictions on the availability of deferral are therefore necessary. 4.4 Further, more mature unlisted companies: • can generally put in place mechanisms to deal with liquidity problems, because they are likely to have more cash than true start-ups; • are more likely to have an earnings history or tangible assets which can be used to value the company. 4.5 Start-ups are especially affected by the valuation and liquidity problems because they lack the cash to pay the tax on behalf of their employees, and their shares are more difficult to value using orthodox methodologies. 4.6 There are difficulties associated with defining a “start-up company”. In Australia’s recently enacted start-up concession for ESS, a “start-up company” is, broadly speaking: 5 • an unlisted Australian company; • less than 10 years old; and • with annual turnover less than A$50 million. All three tests apply on a group basis. 4.7 One issue with this approach is that it creates a “cliff face” – once a company earns $1 more than $50 million or is 10 years and one day old, it is ineligible for the regime. This could, in theory at least, create perverse incentives at the 5 Section 83A-33, Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Australia). 11 margins – for example, a company would not want to earn more revenue because it would lose eligibility to adopt the deferral approach. For New Zealand’s purposes, we would prefer a definition which clearly excludes companies that would not have the same liquidity and valuation problems that start-ups do. 4.8 However, we consider that similar restrictions should be put in place in New Zealand so that unlisted companies that have enough cash and sophistication to overcome the valuation and liquidity problems are not included in the definit ion o f “start-up”. The “cliff face” issue does necessitate a more careful analysis of what the parameters should be, and we welcome submissions on this point. Officials propose an annual turnover limit of $10 million per annum, reflecting the level of income at which a New Zealand company could be said to have left the start-up category. 4.9 Companies in certain industries may be able to satisfy the above criteria despite not being subject to the same valuation constraints faced by, for example, a start-up company in the technology industry which is developing some new, untested product to take to market. One option is for there to be a low value of tangible assets owned by a company in order to qualify for the deferral regime. Instead, or as well as an asset threshold, legislation could list a number of activities which would disqualify a company from the deferral regime. For example, section CW 12 sets out, for another purpose, a list of industries that may be considered for this purpose. These are land development, insurance, land ownership, mining, construction or acquisition of public infrastructure assets. 6 4.10 In addition, officials seek comments on whether it would be appropriate to define a start-up company as one that has not paid a dividend. Payment of a dividend is an indicator of available cash (so liquidity is much less of an issue) and may also indicate that the company is easier to reliably value. 4.11 Ceasing to qualify as a start-up would have no effect on shares or share benefits already identified as subject to the deferral regime. It would simply prevent the company from issuing further shares subject to the regime. 6 Section CW 12 exempts proceeds from share disposals by qualifying foreign equity investors, unless the resident company is engaged in certain activities. Australia also has rules prohibiting share trading and investment companies from accessing the deferral regime. 12 Submission points We are interested to hear from readers:  Do submitters agree with the thresholds for defining a start-up company being based on the three categories used in the Australian rules (that is, size, age and whether it is listed)?  If a threshold for the relative or absolute value of tangible assets was introduced, what would be an appropriate threshold?  If certain industries were to be excluded from this proposal, which industries would these be?  What other thresholds or indicators might be appropriate? 13 14 CHAPTER 5 Deferral measure – elections 5.1 We are seeking submissions on whether the proposed taxing point deferral should be elective or mandatory. 5.2 If the deferral is elective, then the following decisions will need to be made: • who should make the election; • when should the election be made; and • whether the election should be on a scheme-by-scheme or grant-by- grant basis. Compulsory versus elective 5.3 The deferral proposal described in this issues paper is designed to assist start- ups with liquidity and valuation issues. If companies would prefer to deal with these issues in other ways, this should be open to them. Therefore we do not believe that it should be compulsory for companies meeting the start- up definition to have to use the deferral regime. 5.4 Accordingly, some form of election should be possible. Election by company versus employee 5.5 As an underlying principle, because both the employer’s and employees’ tax positions are affected by deferral, they should both have certainty as to their tax position and, if an election to defer tax is being made, they should both be aware of it before committing to the share scheme. 5.6 Schemes will be implemented in most cases by the company. The company will have the responsibility for providing information about scheme benefits, and paying PAYE if elected, at the taxing point to Inland Revenue. The company will also have to put the amount of the share scheme benefit into its return as a deduction. 5.7 Accordingly, it seems sensible for the deferral election to be made by the company, in advance of the benefit being agreed to be provided. In this way, the employee will know in advance (that is, before agreeing to take remuneration in shares) the basis on which they will be taxed, and can make decisions accordingly. 5.8 It would seem simpler for the election to be made on a scheme-by-scheme basis. However, there would be nothing to prevent an employer providing both a deferred and non-deferred scheme, and allowing the employee a choice of scheme, if it wished to do so. An existing scheme could elect to 15 defer, or not, and a scheme that was previously deferring that subsequently breached an eligibility threshold could continue on a non-deferred basis for subsequent issues. 5.9 This approach provides greater certainty to both the employer and employee in relation to their relevant tax positions under the scheme. 5.10 Another option would be for the employer to be able to choose to defer on an emplo yee-by-employee basis. This would allow them to consult with the employee before deciding whether to provide their shares on a tax-deferred basis. This provides greater flexibility than the scheme-by-scheme approach. Timing of election 5.11 To provide certainty and reduce opportunities for avoidance, it seems desirable for elections to be made up-front – or potentially even be part of the terms of the schemes. 5.12 In Australia, at one time and for certain schemes, employees were able to elect whether to be taxed on an upfront or deferred basis. However, the law was amended so that from 1 July 2009, shares offered under a qualifying deferred taxation scheme were automatically subject to the deferred taxing point. In other words, whether a share or right is subject to taxation up-front or at a later time depends on the structure of the scheme. Emplo yees cannot elect to pay tax upfront on shares received under a qualifying deferred taxation scheme, but employees and employers are free to elect whether or not to participate in or offer a qualifying deferred taxation scheme – which is effectively an election to be taxed upfront or not, made at the time that the scheme is set up. This change was made to reduce the scope for tax avoidance, and also to make it easier for employers to comply with their reporting requirements. 5.13 Officials’ preference is for the election to be made on a scheme-by-scheme basis, at the time a scheme is set up, or when the deferral rules applied for existing schemes. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers:  Whether any deferral regime for start-up companies should be elective or mandatory.  If elective, on what basis (scheme-by -scheme, emplo yee-by-employee)?  Should the choice to defer payment of the tax be available to the employer or the emplo yee?  What other design issues need to be considered for a deferral scheme? 16 CHAPTER 6 Deferred taxing point 6.1 The issues the deferral proposal is trying to address are the lack of liquidity and difficulty of valuing shares. 6.2 Once employees have sold their shares, obviously both of these issues have been resolved, so tax should be payable no later than that time. 6.3 However, there are other events that should also potentially trigger the taxing point for shares – either because the liquidity and valuation issues have been resolved, or there are important integrity reasons for tax to be triggered. 6.4 Therefore in addition to the sale of the shares, we believe the following events should also trigger the taxing point: • an initial public offering (IPO) of the shares on a recognised exchange; • sale of the company’s assets followed by distribution to shareholders when the company is wound up; • cancellation of the shares, including on the company being struck off (this will be a relatively common occurrence for start-up companies); • ceasing to be a New Zealand tax resident; • a “sunset” date – for example, recognition of income cannot be delayed by more than 7 years. 6.5 The occurrence of any one of these events will give rise to a tax liability to the employee and a deduction to the employer if the shares are worth more than their cost to the employee, and an obligation on the employer to report the amount of the benefit on the emplo yer monthly schedule (EMS). This assumes that the usual share scheme taxing date has already passed. For example, if the employee holds a share option, at the time one of these events occurs, the event will not trigger income or a deduction. Initial public offering 6.6 An IPO will establish an objective market value for the shares and will also provide an opportunity to sell some shares to pay the tax. Share values often fluctuate significantly in the period shortly after an IPO, therefore if the employee actually sells their shares within a set period of time after the IPO, we suggest that it is the sale price – not the listing price, or some other weighted average value – that is used to determine the employee’s tax liability in relation to the shares sold. 6.7 We are interested in submissions on what may be an appropriate period to allow the shares to be valued on their sale price rather than the IPO listing 17 price. In Australia if shares are sold on-market within 30 days of the deferred taxing point the sale proceeds from the shares can be taken as their market value. 6.8 Employers will need to take steps to ensure they are aware of these values. As the deduction will arise immediately after the IPO, the employer’s deduction will not be affected by any IPO-related ownership changes which otherwise might see the employer forfeit previously carried forward tax losses from unused ESS deductions. This is another advantage of deferring the taxing point. Distribution of assets 6.9 Start-ups can reach a liquidity point by selling the company’s assets to a third party. The start-up would then distribute these assets (often cash or shares in the acquiring company) to its shareholders when the company was wound up. Due to earn-out periods 7 it can be difficult to ascertain the value of the shares even at the point the assets are sold. It would not be appropriate to value the shares provided under an ESS when the shares were cancelled as at this point they will have zero value. One option would be to tax shareholders with deferred ESS benefits on the value of distributions to the extent it exceeds what they paid for the shares. We invite submissions on this issue. Cancellation of shares 6.10 At the point shares are cancelled the employee no longer holds an interest so there is no benefit in deferring the taxing point beyond this. Ceasing to be a New Zealand tax resident 6.11 When an employee ceases employment with a group they may be entitled to retain shares or options that have yet to reach a taxing point. This creates an administrative risk whether these now former emplo yees will co mply wit h their obligat ions. 6.12 The Australian start-up rules use leaving employment as a trigger for the taxing point. In Australia, an employee is considered to have ceased their employment with the company if they are no longer employed by any company in the same group. Cessation of employment would likely occur once a person receives the last payment they are entitled to which is subject to PAYE. 6.13 Implementing an equivalent rule in New Zealand would provide a tax incentive for an employee to stay with the same company when in the absence of tax they would not. 7 An earn-out period is where a portion of the sale price is dependent on the future performance of the acquired business. These are used to keep pre-acquisition employees involved or where there is uncertainty over future growth prospects. 18 6.14 If emplo yees did not trigger the taxing point upon leaving employment, former emplo yees would continue be required to return tax on the ESS benefit even though they were no longer emplo yed by the co mpany. 6.15 Enforcing these obligations, however, will be much easier if the former employee continues to be a New Zealand tax resident. Therefore, we propose the deferral period should only continue while the former employee remains New Zealand tax resident. 6.16 The rules should not encourage New Zealand employees to leave New Zealand to escape their tax obligations and requiring tax to be paid at the time the individual left New Zealand would achieve this. This is also consistent with many other sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 where a liabilit y is crystallised at the point the person ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident. Sunset period 6.17 We believe it is desirable to provide a finite date at which deferral lapses. This is to prevent the start-up rules allowing an indefinite deferral of tax liability. For instance, we understand that in some jurisdictions bespoke financing packages are available to allow employees in successful start-ups to monetise the value of their share scheme benefits without triggering a taxing point – thus avoiding tax permanently on the employee share scheme benefits. To prevent this we propose a “sunset” period. When this period expires, the taxing point will be triggered regardless of whether one of the other events has occurred. 6.18 The Australian rules include a “sunset” period of 15 years (recently extended from 7 years). After 15 years, tax becomes payable even in the absence of another liquidity event occurring, because it is considered that after that amount of time there is (or is very likely to be) either liquidity or no prospect of liquidity. 6.19 In our view, a company is likely to have a liquidity event – or fail – before the 15 year mark. Accordingly, we think something closer to 7 years would be appropriate. This would also be consistent with the period for which records are generally kept. At some point it will become difficult for employers, employees and Inland Revenue to keep track of the fact that an employee has a contingent tax liability with respect to shares the employee has owned for many years. We are interested in submitters’ views on this point. Takeovers and restructures 6.20 In the absence of specific rules, a corporate takeover or restructure of a company could have unintended consequences for employees with employee share scheme benefits. 19 6.21 In Australia rules are in place so that when the company offering the ESS has been subject to a takeover or restructure, any employee share scheme interests in a company that was acquired in connection with the takeover or restructure are treated as a continuation of the old interests. This is only to the extent that, as a result of the arrangement or change, the employee has ceased holding the old interests, and the new interests can reasonably be regarded as matching the old interests. 6.22 The Bill provides rollover relief where a person’s ESS rights are cancelled and replaced with rights in a different scheme. The value of the replacement rights is not included in the person’s income arising due to the cancellation of the original scheme. The benefit provided by the replacement scheme will be taxed appropriately by applying the proposed new rules to that scheme. Officials consider that the rollover relief provisions in the Bill are sufficient to deal with any unintended consequences resulting from takeovers or restructures. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers:  Whether they agree with each of the tax point events identified.  Whether there are practical difficulties with any of these events.  Whether there are other events that should trigger a tax liability.  Whether there should be a sunset period and, if so, how long it should be? 20 CHAPTER 7 Employer deductions 7.1 The amendments in the Bill provide a deduction for emplo yers for providing employee compensation in the form of shares, just as they can claim a deduction for other types of remuneration. This is consistent with the overall policy goal of neutral treatment between different forms of remuneration. Failing to provide a deduction for remuneration by way of shares similar to that available for remuneration in cash could discourage the use of ESS. 7.2 This deduction reflects the economic reality that the issue of shares for less than full market value involves a cost to the other shareholders in the company (as it dilutes their interests). 7.3 The same principle should apply to employers who provide shares to employees under a deferred ESS. Timing of deduction under a statutory deferral regime 7.4 Under a deferral regime, the emplo yee is the economic owner of the shares at an earlier point in time than when tax is payable. To address the practical issues of valuation and liquidity, the employee becomes taxable (in most cases) upon the satisfaction of a liquidity event, when the shares are more easily able to be valued, and they become converted or convertible into cash with which to pay the tax. 7.5 The question then arises as to whether the deduction should arise for the emplo yer at the usual taxing point or at the deferred taxing point. 7.6 From a revenue collection perspective, the same considerations that mean the Government is indifferent between taxing the employee at the usual or deferred taxing point also apply in relation to the deduction. 7.7 However, if the employee is paying tax on a deferred basis, allowing a deduction at the usual time presents an increased collection and audit risk. The Government would be allowing a deduction to the employer with no guarantee that the employee would return the corresponding income in what might be a substantially later year. This risk is greater if the deferred taxing point can be extended past the employee leaving employment. 7.8 A further argument for deferring the deduction to when tax is payable, is that the same valuation issues for employees apply to the employer. It may not be possible for the employer to calculate the amount of the deduction. 7.9 As discussed above, employers may also prefer to defer their deduction. This is because start-up companies often generate significant, unusable tax losses in their early years of operation, only to forfeit these losses when third party investors buy a stake in the company (because they lose shareholder continuity at that point). It is also at this point in time when companies are 21 likely to be generating a net profit and would benefit from the earlier carried forward losses to reduce their current year tax bill. Therefore, it seems advantageous to the company to defer the deduction until the deferred taxing point, as well as sensible from a revenue perspective. 7.10 In Australia, generally deductions for tax deferred schemes are also deferred to when the employee receives the employee share scheme benefit. 7.11 In light of these considerations, if a deferral regime is introduced, we propose that deductions be deferred until income is recognised by the employee. Submission point We are interested to hear from readers whether they agree that employer deductions should also be deferred in relation to shares offered under a deferred employee share scheme. 22 CHAPTER 8 Administration and compliance 8.1 A statutory deferral option for start-up companies presents design issues which will need to be addressed in order to ensure compliance without imposing undue costs for emplo yers, emplo yees and Inland Revenue. 8.2 There is a range of options that could be implemented, with varying levels of compliance burden for taxpayers. For example, at one end of the spectrum, the regime could require Inland Revenue to hold the shares subject to the employee share scheme, and these would only be released to the employee (and the employer would only be entitled to a deduction) once the tax was paid. 8.3 At the other end of the spectrum, the regime could be entirely self-assessed by employers and employees. 8.4 A middle ground would be a regime which is self-assessed but with obligations on employers and/or employees to provide certain information to Inland Revenue about employee share scheme benefits subject to the deferral regime. Notification 8.5 Prior to 1 April 2017, there were no specific reporting requirements for employers offering, or employees participating in, ESS. From 1 April 2017 as a result of amendments in the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016, employers have an obligation to determine the amount of their employees’ ESS inco me and report it monthly as part of the EMS. 8.6 However employers are not required to provide specific details of the share scheme benefits provided. 8.7 The administration of the statutory deferral regime would be aided greatly by taxpayers providing Inland Revenue with information in relation to the scheme. For example: • What is the structure of the ESS that has been offered to employees (is it an option scheme, shares scheme, loan-funded share schemes)? • Which shares are subject to the deferral regime (if more than one scheme is operated if on a scheme-by-scheme basis or the election is on an employee-by-employee basis)? • Which shares subject to the deferral regime are still to reach a taxing point? • Which shares have reached a taxing point and, for these shares, the assessable income arising to the employee at that time (if any) 23 (recognising that this information should already be included in the EMS – albeit as part of an aggregate figure)? 8.8 If an additional level of reporting were required for a start-up deferral scheme, this could be reconciled with the EMS reporting so there is not a duplicate reporting obligation. 8.9 The obligation to report this information to Inland Revenue could fall on either employers or employees. Alternatively, the obligation to report could be imposed on someone who has no financial interest in the ESS, such as a scheme trustee. However, a requirement for a trustee does not sit well with the concept that deferral would be used primarily by start-up companies, which will generally wish to minimise overhead costs and thus would be less likely to employ the services of a professional trustee. Requiring employers to report 8.10 Some submitters have previously suggested that if a deferral scheme is adopted, then employers should have the obligation to report to Inland Revenue in relation to the scheme. 8.11 This is because employers are better placed to design the scheme terms and conditions to ensure they can control when the deferred taxing point occurs and that they have the necessary information to fulfil reporting obligations. Emplo yers are also likely to have greater resources at their disposal to manage the collection of the relevant information. 8.12 Further, it would be more efficient to impose compliance cost on one employer who can provide employee share scheme information for a number of emplo yees, than to impose those compliance costs on each individual emplo yee. As employers will already have to report some employee share scheme information as part of the EMS under the new rules on the collection of tax on ESS, it would make sense for employers to have all of the reporting obligations. Requiring employees to report 8.13 Employees themselves could personally be responsible for reporting certain ESS information to Inland Revenue, and be required to notify Inland Revenue when certain events have occurred (for example, when they have elected to defer, or when they have sold or transferred their shares). 8.14 However, as noted above, generally employers are more able to efficiently bear compliance costs than employees. Filing returns and paying tax direct ly to Inland Revenue imposes compliance costs on employees, more so if they are unused to the process. These compliance costs could affect voluntary compliance and perceptions about the integrity of the tax system. Fro m Inland Revenue’s perspective, if an individual employee does not return the inco me fro m an ESS, the Commissioner has to expend resources to collect a potentially small amount of tax from that individual. 24 Submission point We are interested to hear from readers:  What kind of reporting and record keeping requirements would be necessary and appropriate to ensure that income and deductions from tax deferred share schemes is appropriately returned, and tax is paid? 25 26 CHAPTER 9 Research and development loss cash-out 9.1 Research and development (R&D) start-up companies are able to receive a payment for up to 28 percent of their tax losses from R&D expenditure in any given year. We refer to losses in respect of which a refund has been received as “cashed-out losses”. These rules may not operate correctly when an R&D start-up company’s costs include ESS expenditure. 9.2 A cashed-out loss can be thought of as an interest-free loan fro m the Government, to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future income; it is intended to provide a cashflow timing benefit only. The rules focus on start-up companies engaging in intensive R&D, and are intended to reduce their exposure to market failures and tax distortions arising from the general tax treatment of losses. 9.3 Companies that qualify for the existing R&D loss cash-out may also be offering ESS to their employees and may qualify as a start-up company under the criteria considered in this issues paper. 9.4 When the R&D loss cash-out was introduced for the 2015–16 and later income years, expenditure on ESS was not explicitly deductible to employers and the R&D loss cash-out rules do not specifically cover ESS expenditure. 9.5 The interaction between the two sets of rules primarily arises in the definitions of “total labour expenditure” and “total R&D labour expenditure” in section MX 3(3). These definitions include salary or wages of the employee as well as other costs such as contractor R&D consideration and certain payments to shareholder-emplo yees. 9.6 ESS costs are not included within the definition of salary or wages so will not currently be included in the definition of total labour expenditure or total R&D labour expenditure. 9.7 Where the costs of ESS are not yet deductible because the taxing point has been deferred, these costs should not be included in the R&D loss cash-out calculations. 9.8 If the taxing point has occurred so that ESS costs are deductible but these amounts are not included in salary or wages this could have two impacts on eligibility for or amount of the R&D loss cash-out: • Where ESS benefits are provided to employees who undertake R&D in a greater (lesser) proportion than other employees this will reduce (increase) the ability to meet the wage intensity criteria. • Where ESS benefits are provided to employees who undertake R&D these costs will not be included in the cap on the maximum R&D loss 27 cash-out at 1.5 times the employer’s total R&D labour expenditure multiplied by the company tax rate. Wage intensity criteria 9.9 The wage intensity criteria requires that R&D labour expenditure is at least 20 percent of total labour expenditure. The purpose of this restriction is to ensure the R&D loss cash-out is targeted at firms that undertake sufficient intensity of R&D as a proportion of their overall activities. 9.10 As the inclusion or exclusion of ESS will affect both the numerator and denominator there will be no effect on the wage intensity calculation if ESS are provided to employees conducting R&D or not conducting R&D in equal proportions to all other remuneration. 9.11 However, certain employees may receive a greater proportion of their remuneration via ESS than other employees in the same company. This would affect the company’s ability, either positively or negatively, to access the cash-out. R&D loss tax credits 9.12 The amount of cash-out available to an eligible company is capped at the lower of a number of separate calculations; one of which is 1.5 times the total R&D labour expenditure multiplied by the company tax rate. 9.13 If costs of ESS are not included within the R&D labour amount then the amount of cash-out available may be lowered by up to 42 percent 8 of those ESS costs. As ESS is a deductible labour expense of the company, this does not seem appropriate. Example 3: Current R&D treatment of ESS costs Start-up Co has been established during the 2018–19 year to develop an innovative new product. In the 2018–19 year it has no sales but incurs $100,000 of cash wages, $200,000 of other cash deductible costs and provided shares to its employees which have been independently valued at $150,000. 90 percent of the cash costs meet the definition of “R&D expenditure” but only 40 percent of the ESS costs do as the majority are given to an employee who does not undertake R&D. Start-up Co has made a tax loss of $450,000 for the 2018–19 year. Its wage intensity calculation is $90,000 ÷ $100,000 = 90% so it meets the wage intensity criteria for an R&D loss cash-out. The maximum amount of the cash out for the 2018–19 year is the lesser of: • $1,100,000 x 28% = $308,000 • Net loss for the year = $450,000 x 28% = $126,000 • Total R&D expenditure = (($100,000 x 90%) + $200,000 + ($150,000 x 40%)) x 28% = $98,000 • R&D labour expenditure = 1.5 x ($100,000 x 90%) x 28% = $37,800 Start-up Co is entitled to an R&D loss cash-o ut amount of $63,000 8 1.5 x 28%. 28 Proposal 9.14 To address both these issues officials propose that ESS costs, if they meet the other requirements, be specifically included within total labour expenditure and total R&D labour expenditure for the purposes of the R&D loss cash-out rules. This will allow co mpanies ent it led to the R&D loss cash-out to receive a tax refund under that scheme which may be able to be used to fund a substantial part of the employee’s tax liability on ESS benefits. Example 4: Proposed R&D treatment of ESS costs Using the same facts from example 3 Start-up Co applies the proposed changes to the R&D loss cash- out. Start-up Co has made a tax loss of $450,000 for the 2018–19 year. Its wage intensity calculation is ($90,000 + $60,000) ÷ ($100,000 + $150,000) = 60% so it meets the wage intensity criteria for an R&D loss cash-out. The maximum amount of the cash out for the 2018–19 year is the lesser of: • $1,100,000 x 28% = $308,000 • Net loss for the year = $450,000 x 28% = $126,000 • Total R&D expenditure = (($100,000 x 90%) + $200,000 + ($150,000 x 40%)) x 28% = $98,000 • R&D labour expenditure = 1.5 x ($100,000 x 90% + $150,000 x 40%) x 28% = $63,000 Start-up Co is entitled to an R&D loss cash-out amount of $63,000 29
Minimum financial reporting requirements for foreign trusts An officials’ issues paper on proposed requirements for the preparation of financial statements May 2017 Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue First published in May 2017 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Minimum financial reporting requirements for foreign trusts – an officials’ issues paper. ISBN 978-0-478-42446-1 CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 Introduction and summary 1 Tax Administration Act 1 The proposals in summary 2 How to make a submission 2 CHAPTER 2 Proposed minimum financial reporting requirements 4 APPENDIX Extract from special report on “Foreign trust disclosure rules” 6 CHAPTER 1 Introduction and summary 1.1 The Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules recommended, amongst other things, that foreign trusts that have a New Zealand-resident trustee should have to file an annual return with Inland Revenue, which includes the trust’s financial statements. The Government adopted the Inquiry’s recommendations and the resultant amendments have recently been enacted. 1.2 These amendments require on-going disclosures by resident foreign trustees, including the requirement to file, as part of an annual return for the foreign trust, financial statements of the trust if the trustee prepares them, or is required to prepare them. 1.3 This paper proposes that resident foreign trustees of foreign trusts be required to prepare financial statements for the trust and specifies the suggested minimum requirements for those financial statements. The purpose of this paper is to consult on these minimum requirements. 1.4 “Foreign trusts” are defined in section HC 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The term “foreign trusts” as used in this paper is limited to foreign trusts that have a New Zealand-resident trustee (a “resident foreign trustee” as defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) at section 3). Tax Administration Act 1.5 The TAA was recently amended (by the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017) to increase the disclosure rules for foreign trusts as recommended by the Inquiry. 1.6 New section 59D of the TAA requires that resident foreign trustees must file an annual return for the foreign trust that must include a set of financial statements if they are prepared or required to be prepared, and provide details on the foreign trust’s settlements and beneficiary distributions. For further information on this section’s requirements refer to the Appendix. 1.7 It is expected that the Government would enable the requirement for resident foreign trustees of foreign trusts to prepare financial statements for the trust by Order in Council (OIC) using the generic provisions of the TAA at sections 21B and 21C. The OIC would specify a minimum level of required detail for the financial statements. 1 The proposals in summary 1.8 For periods commencing 1 April 2017 and later, all resident foreign trustees that have an obligation to file an annual return in 2018 and subsequent years should have financial statements prepared to at least the specified minimum requirements. There will be an exception to this where the trust has a statutory obligation to prepare financial statements. 1.9 We suggest that the minimum requirements for these financial statements would be relatively straightforward historical cost, accrual-based financial statements that would constitute special-purpose financial statements. 1.10 Notes to the financial statements or separate schedules would include a statement of accounting policies and detailed reconciliations of settlors’ and beneficiaries’ current accounts. 1.11 We propose that the financial statements will require that all accounts with settlors and beneficiaries be reconciled for movements through the reporting period. This is in addition to the specific disclosure requirements about settlements and distribut ions to beneficiaries that are required under the new section 59D of the TAA (refer to the Appendix for the detail of this). 1.12 Requirements would be principles-based, although some detail would be required. This is because it is inappropriate for Inland Revenue to attempt to set the format of financial statements or tell accountants the specific detail of what should be in financial statements. Rather, it is envisaged that Inland Revenue would set the principles and the foreign trust specific detail and then rely on the judgement of the person preparing the financial statements for the general accounting detail. The proposed detail about the level of reporting and associated disclosures is contained in Chapter 2. 1.13 A higher standard may be adopted (or required by other law) in which case, so long as the required disclosures are incorporated, these minimum requirements are superseded. How to make a submission 1.14 Submissions are invited on the level of detail that is suggested for the financial statements. While anyone may submit on it, this paper has been provided to interested parties as determined by all those who made a submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the recent amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 concerning foreign trusts. 1.15 Submissions on this paper should be made by 29 June 2017 and can be sent to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Financial reporting for foreign trusts” in the subject line. 2 Alternatively they can be sent to: Financial reporting for foreign trusts C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.16 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 3 CHAPTER 2 Proposed minimum financial reporting requirements 2.1 These are the proposed minimum financial reporting requirements for special- purpose financial statements for foreign trusts. 2.2 These minimum requirements are high-level and, while financial statements and accompanying schedules must be prepared to at least these minimum requirements, they may be prepared to a higher standard or even be general-purpose financial statements, so long as the required information is provided. 2.3 The minimum requirements proposed are: Form of financial statements a) The financial statements must consist of – i. a balance sheet setting out the assets, liabilities and net assets of the foreign trust as at the end of the income year; and ii. a profit and loss statement showing income derived, and expenditure incurred, by the foreign trust during the income year. Principles with which statements must comply b) The financial statements must be prepared applying the principles of accrual accounting. Valuations c) The financial statements may, however, disclose amounts using the following valuation principles: i. tax values, when those values are consistent with double-entry and accrual accounting; and ii. historical cost with impairment or depreciation as appropriate; and iii. market values, when, in the preparer’s opinion, market values provide a better basis of valuation than those in subparagraphs (i) and (ii). Statement of accounting policies d) The financial statements must contain a statement of accounting policies setting out, in sufficient detail so that a user can understand the material policies that have been applied or changed: i. the policies and assumptions that have been used in the preparation of the financial statements; and ii. a description of the effect of any material changes in the accounting policies used since the financial statements prepared for the previous income year. 4 Matters that statements must show e) The financial statements must show the matters prescribed. f) The financial statements must disclose comparable figures for the previous income year where financial statements have been prepared for that previous year. Reconciliations g) A statement of the foreign trust’s New Zealand taxable income (if any) in NZD for the income year. h) Reconciliations from opening to closing balance for all settlor and beneficiary accounts and of the corpus on a line by line basis. Currency i) The financial statements may be prepared in any currency that is appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the foreign trust and its settlors and beneficiaries. 5 APPENDIX Extract from special report - Foreign trust disclosure rules 1 “An ongoing requirement for the contact trustee following the registration of a foreign trust is to prepare an annual return for the foreign trust and send it to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This is set out in new section 59D \[of the Tax Administration Act 1994\]. Section 59D(2) states that the annual return must be in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and must include the following. Information Detail Financial statements for the trust for the return year (section 59D(2)(a)). If the trustee prepares financial statements or is required to prepare financial statements. Settlements made on the trust in the return year, excluding the provision of minor services incidental to the activities of the trust (section 59D(2)(b) and (c)). Each settlement: • date • nature • amount • settlor’s name • settlor’s email address • settlor’s physical residential or business address • settlor’s jurisdiction of tax residence • settlor’s taxpayer identification number. Distributions to beneficiaries made during the return year (section 59D(2)(d) and (e)). Each distribution: • date • amount • nature • beneficiary’s name • beneficiary’s email address • beneficiary’s physical residential address • beneficiary’s jurisdiction of tax residence • beneficiary’s taxpayer identification number. If the beneficiary is a minor: • minor’s age • minor’s jurisdiction of tax residence • minor’s taxpayer identification number • parent or guardian’s name • parent or guardian’s email address • parent or guardian’s physical residential address • parent or guardian’s jurisdiction of tax residence • parent or guardian’s taxpayer identification number. At the time of registration, the contact trustee for a foreign trust must provide information about settlements made on the trust before the trust’s registration. To ensure that the information held by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is kept up to date, subsequent settlements must be reported in the annual return. Consistent with the disclosure of historical settlements, information relating to the provision of minor services at less than market value 1 Foreign trust disclosure rules – pages 16 & 17 of a special report published in March 2017 at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz 6 that are incidental to the activities of the trust does not need to be provided. Also see the section ‘Information required on registration’. Likewise, detailed information about distributions made during the return year need to be included in the annual return. This includes identifying information about beneficiaries, in line with the information provided at the time of registration. Financial statements As noted above, section 59D(2)(a) requires that if the trustee of a foreign trust prepares financial statements or is required to prepare financial statements, these must be provided with the annual return. The intent is that even if a trust does not prepare financial statements for other purposes, they must prepare financial statements in order to meet their obligations under the foreign trust disclosure requirements. An Order in Council will be made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify the minimum standards for financial statements for foreign trusts. The Order in Council will make it clear for foreign trusts, including those that do not ordinarily prepare financial statements, what information must be provided. Due dates Section 59D(3) requires the annual return, including the financial statements, to be filed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue within six months after the trust’s balance date, or by 30 September if the trust does not have a balance date (which is six months after the end of the tax year). This should allow resident foreign trustees adequate time to gather required documentation and meet their obligations, as it is acknowledged that much of the information may be held overseas. Annual returns must be provided for every year that includes a period which the foreign trust is registered, or is required to register under section 59B. However, a transitional rule in 59D(1)(c) allows resident foreign trustees who become liable to register a trust on the date of enactment, to file returns only for years that begin after 31 March 2017. No additional time is provided to non-professional trustees, or those with tax agents.” 7

The objectives outlined included reducing compliance and administrative costs, and improved administration of social policies such as student loans and Working for Families tax credits. 1.3 The discussion document proposed that employers should file PAYE information each payday and that emplo yers using payroll software could do so direct ly fro m their payro ll systems. 1.4 For those using payroll software, their payro ll system could be used to calculate and transmit the information required to correct errors and make adjustments. The discussion document further proposed that the correction and adjustment of PAYE information would require employers to amend the returns in which the error originally occurred. 1.5 Changes to the administration of PAYE are proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced to Parliament in April 2017. The changes proposed in the Bill are summarised in the Appendix. 1.6 The Bill proposes a regulation-making power for matters relating to the correction of errors in “emplo yment inco me informat ion”. 1 It further provides that the Governor-General may make these regulations on the advice of the Minister of Revenue, following appropriate consultation. 2 Purpose of this consultation 1.7 This consultation is being carried out on behalf of the Minister of Revenue and seeks feedback to help shape the regulations in proposed new section 23M of the Tax Administration Act. 1.8 With the co-operation of providers of payroll software, a largely automated approach to error correction is proposed for employers using payroll software. However it is important that the requirements for error correction 1 The Bill uses this term to refer to the information that will be required from employers each payday and information required about new and departing employees. 2 Clause 200 proposes to insert new subpart 3C to the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section includes proposed new section 23M, which includes the proposed regulation-making power. 1 also meet the needs of employers who file through Inland Revenue’s website or on paper. Submissions are also invited fro m these emplo yers. Summary of potential solutions 1.9 Several design principles have been identified to reduce the need for rework: • Where possible, processes for adjustment should be automated and allow employers to make adjustments consistent with their payroll practices. • Employers who use payroll software should be able to use their software to generate the information they require to amend an already filed return. • Emplo yers should also have the option of accessing filed returns through myIR and self-correcting incorrect returns. • A paper error correction form will continue to exist, and emplo yers who only need to make simple corrections will be able to do so by telephone. 1.10 The issues paper identifies a number of types of errors and adjust ments. The solutions suggested here apply to PAYE and related deductions such as student loan repayments and KiwiSaver deductions. An important considerati on will be current practices and the workability of the suggested solutions proposed in table 1. Table 1: Summary of potential solutions Type of error or adjustment Potential solutions Reporting error: When the return does not reflect what was paid or withheld Amend the original return. Payroll: Underpayment No correction required as employees are taxed when the underpayment is paid. Payroll correction: Overpayment When the amount is repaid (or there is agreement to repay), this correction can be made either: • by amending the original return(s); or • by recalculating the pay and tax in the pay periods that require correction, and netting the amounts off the values in a subsequent return. If legally able to and with the agreement of the employee, by reducing the gross income in a subsequent pay period and reporting the reduced figures in a subsequent return. Inland Revenue will not be able to accept negative values in returns until early 2020 but after that it is proposed that they should be accepted. If the overpaid amount is not repaid it should continue to be taxable as PAYE income, no adjustment is required, and there would be no refund of PAYE and related deductions. 2 Type of error or adjustment Potential solutions If the overpaid amount is partially repaid, the sum not repaid remains taxable as PAYE income. If the employer has made an adjustment based on the agreement to repay, a further adjustment would be required to add back the amount not repaid. Interpretation errors: When there is a mistake with the tax treatment A limited ability to correct the error in a subsequent return is suggested. The error may be corrected in a subsequent return: • if PAYE on the error is less than 10 percent of the employee’s PAYE in that payday return; and • subject to a cap of a maximum of $10,000 of upward reassessment by the employer in the tax year. In other cases the correction should be made by amending the returns that contained the error. Errors or corrections that cross tax years We are interested to hear what issues would arise if employers were able to correct overpayments and interpretation errors relating to a previous tax year in a subsequent return. 1.11 Error correction often involves a trade-off between accuracy and cost. The suggested solutions would allow different approaches for reporting errors, overpayments and interpretation errors. An employer concerned about the complexity of distinguishing between different error types could, however, choose to correct reporting errors, overpayments and interpretation errors by amending the returns that contained the errors. 1.12 The issues paper also suggests that employers should report the amount of employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) withheld, at an employee level. 1.13 The so lut ions suggested relat ing to overpaid inco me would require a clarification of the law so that overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid remains taxable as PAYE income. A further clarification is proposed to ensure that the time an employer allows an employee to repay overpaid income does not create a liability for fringe benefit tax on an interest-free loan. 1.14 When “emplo yer” is used in this paper it should generally be read as including “payroll intermediary”. 3 The proposals for error correction in employment income information also apply to non-emplo yees such as contractors who are paid schedular payments from which PAYE must be withheld. 1.15 No special rules have been put forward in relation to the correction of errors in employment income information relating to non-resident employees and non-resident contractors. Some specific issues are, however, being worked 3 Payroll intermediaries already have access to an automated error correction process and are required to file electronically. 3 through separately, to address specific concerns raised in relation to non- resident employees and non-resident contractors. How to make a submission 1.16 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. Submissions can be sent to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “PAYE error correction and adjustment” in the subject line. 1.17 Alternatively, submissions can be addressed to: PAYE error correction and adjustment c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.18 The closing date for submissions is 15 September 2017. 1.19 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.20 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 4 CHAPTER 2 Environment for PAYE error correction and adjustment 2.1 The following principles have guided the approach in this issues paper: • Wherever possible, processes for adjustments should be automated and allow emplo yers 4 to make adjustments consistent with their existing payroll practices. • Processes must, however, be available to accommodate employers that do not use payroll software. • Inco me, tax and other deductions withheld should be determined and reported as accurately and quickly as possible. This should enable social assistance entitlements to be calculated more frequently than annually. • Solutions should be consistent with the principle that employees are taxed when the cash is received; adjustments should fo llow the flo ws of money. • When employer and employee negotiate a correction to pay, as far as possible, tax should follow what is agreed between the parties. • Solutions should be consistent, with reasonable compliance expectations, and should not create opportunities to correct absence of reasonable care or fraudulent behaviour. Systems-wide view 2.2 Changes proposed to PAYE in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill are part of the Government’s transformation of the tax administration system. The proposed changes are intended to make use of digital systems to reduce compliance and administrative costs, and improve the administration of social policies delivered by Inland Revenue. 2.3 In developing the new environment for PAYE reporting, Inland Revenue is committed to an approach that reduces the need for corrections, and minimises the downstream implications of inevitable errors and adjustments. The importance of improving guidance in this area is also acknowledged. 2.4 Planned changes to the PAYE system include the following features, which should reduce the need for rework and/or reduce the downstream impact. 4 “Employers” includes payroll intermediaries. 5 Electronic “on-boarding” and early advice of departures 2.5 Inland Revenue’s new system will be able to electronically receive and respond to information about new employees before they are first paid. 5 This will allo w emplo yers to submit the relevant fields 6 to Inland Revenue and check the IRD number and the employee profile (proposed tax code and deduction types) before the first salary or wage payment is made. This service should help employers to ensure that the correct deductions are being made, reducing the need for subsequent intervention by Inland Revenue, and rework by employers. 2.6 It will also be possible for an employer to advise Inland Revenue directly fro m their payroll system that an employee has left the employer. Early advice will break the employee/employer link in Inland Revenue’s system and should ensure that the employer is no longer contacted about that emplo yee. Resubmit a whole pay 2.7 Emplo yers will have the ability, if necessary, to reverse out and resubmit a who le payday submission (the payday equivalent of an employer monthly schedule). Speed of processing 2.8 Once migration to Inland Revenue’s new computer system is completed, there will be an increase to the speed of processing, for both original PAYE submissions and adjustments, and employers will be able to readily track the progress of submissions and adjustments. 2.9 In addit ion, Inland Revenue’s new system is being designed to ensure that errors in employee data only delay the processing of that particular record, not the whole submission. Multiple submissions 2.10 Some employers pay contractors what are defined as “schedular payments” fro m which PAYE must be withheld. If these contractors are paid through the accounts payable system, the current limitat ion that restricts emplo yers to one emplo yer monthly schedule (EMS) per month can cause problems. Officials understand that some emplo yers routinely file contractor PAYE information using an IR344 (EMS amendment form). 2.11 Payday reporting will require employers to file employment income informat ion wit hin two or seven working days from the day on which contractors liable for PAYE are paid. The existing restriction on multiple 5 While it will be possible to provide this information and get a response before the first payment is made, it will not be a requirement for employers to provide this information before the first payment. The requirement will be that information about new employees comes with or before the first payment of PAYE income. 6 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill also proposes to require employers to provide contact details for their employees and date of birth information when this has been provided. 6 submissions will disappear and it will be possible to file information relating to schedular payments in a standalone submission. Means by which errors may be corrected and adjustments made 2.12 Employers who use payroll software will be able to generate the information they require to amend already filed returns as a by-product of correcting their own records. Rather than being required to resubmit a whole return, it is envisaged that payroll software will be able to generate a schedule of corrections that could either be submitted with the payday return or as and when it is available. 2.13 Employers will also have the option of accessing their filed returns through myIR and self-correcting the records that are wrong. 2.14 In addit io n, a paper error correction form will continue to be available and for the foreseeable future, employers with simple corrections will still be able to make them by telephone. Question • Do you have any questions or concerns about any of the issues or principles covered in this Chapter? Please let us know what they are. 7 CHAPTER 3 Errors and adjustments to employment income information 3.1 Employers have an obligation to provide information to Inland Revenue when they withhold tax and other deductions from PAYE inco me payments. 3.2 The current obligation is to provide the PAYE informat ion mo nthly in an “employer monthly schedule”. The Bill 7 refers to the information as “employment income information” and proposes it will be required on a payday basis. Under the proposals in the Bill, employers over the threshold for electronic filing 8 and employers with smaller payrolls who are using payro ll software will have two working days following payday to submit employment income information for that payday. Employers not required to file electronically, and who are not using payroll software, will have seven working days following payday to report. 3.3 Payday reporting should result in some errors being identified and corrected more quickly. Because of delayed reporting and slow processing it can currently take three months before an employer who has not made employer KiwiSaver contributions is identified and notified to begin contributions. Payday reporting should see this type of error identified and corrected much more quickly. 3.4 It is recognised, however, that payroll corrections are inevitable and that processes for correction must improve if payday reporting is to result in a reduction in compliance and administrative costs. Current requirements 3.5 Inland Revenue’s current PAYE guidance states that PAYE errors must be corrected by phoning or by completing a form which amends the original return that was in error. This requires an amendment to be lodged for each return (monthly at present, payday in future) that was wrong. 3.6 However, in some circumstances, Inland Revenue allows emplo yers to make adjustments in a subsequent return. This approach is not available if netting the corrections off against the subsequent return would result in any of the fields (for example, for gross income or PAYE, or KiwiSaver deductions) having a negative value. This constraint arises because of limitations in Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer system, which cannot use negative values. It also limits the size of errors that can be corrected in a subsequent return. 7 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced to Parliament in April 2017. 8 The threshold is currently set at $100,000 of PAYE and ESCT withheld a year. The Bill proposes that it should reduce to $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT a year. 8 3.7 The suggested changes set out below relate to how errors may be corrected once employers are reporting on a payday basis. The Bill proposes that this will become optional from 1 April 2018 and mandatory from 1 April 2019. Types of errors and adjustments in employment income information 3.8 Over 700,000 corrections were made to PAYE information in 2016, based on informat ion fro m emplo yers. The potential so lutio ns distinguish between a number of different types of errors and reasons for adjustments: • Reporting errors – when someone was paid and tax and other deductions 9 were withheld correctly but there was a mistake in the reporting to Inland Revenue. • Payro ll corrections – including when someone was wrongly paid due to human error, systems error or receipt of informatio n after the payroll has been run. • Interpretation errors – for example, when the employer has made a mistake about whether an allowance is taxable. 3.9 Officials acknowledge that having to distinguish between different error types adds complexity. However, if one rule is applied to them all it may impose more onerous requirements on some types than is necessary. Submitters have the opportunity to comment on the level of complexity. 3.10 For completeness, these sources of error are included but they have their own rules, which this paper does not propose to change: • Emplo yer non-compliance – for example, deliberate non-withho lding or misreporting or failure to take reasonable care. These forms of non- compliance cannot be remedied by “correcting” the resulting “errors” and non-compliant employers will remain subject to existing penalties. • Employee compliance error – for example, use of an incorrect IRD number or provision of wrong tax code, whether deliberate or inadvertent. The emplo yer’s ability to rely on the information provided by the employee, and to only change emplo yee informat ion following an instruction from the employee or from Inland Revenue, will remain. No requirement to correct previous returns is proposed. Reporting errors 3.11 Reporting errors arise when someone was paid and tax and other deductions were withheld correctly but the information was reported wrongly. There are many reasons why an employer might not accurately report what was paid and/or withheld, for example: 9 Typically student loan repayments and KiwiSaver deductions. 9 • An employee might have been paid out-of-cycle, and while they have been paid and withheld from correctly, the details have not been included in the return. • The return might inadvertently have been submitted for the wrong payday. • A transcription error might have been made in recording an amount or other employee details. 3.12 Reporting errors often give rise to a mismatch with the payment made to Inland Revenue, which will generate contact from Inland Revenue and rework. Resolving the error requires the employer to make the correction in the return in which the error occurred, so that it matches with the payment that includes that return. 3.13 In other circumstances, for example, where information about emplo yee A’s income and deductions has been attributed to employee B and vice versa, the reporting error would not generate a mismatch with total payment. It could, however, have social policy consequences for the employee and may generate processing errors when, for example, a KiwiSaver deduction is reported against an employee who is not a member. 3.14 Employment income information is currently shared with the Ministry of Social Development and Accident Compensation Corporation who use it to help ensure that people get their correct entitlements. 3.15 Because of the need for reporting to match payment and the potential impacts of reporting errors on an individual’s entitlements and obligations, officials propose that all reporting errors should be corrected by amending the return that was in error. Question • Do you agree that when reporting does not reflect what was paid and withheld, the error should be corrected by amending the return that was wrong? If you disagree, please explain why. Payroll corrections 3.16 Employment income information can also be incorrect because of the need for payro ll adjustments. In this situat ion tax and other deductions have been calculated correctly but may subsequently require adjustment because the pay needs to be updated. This situation can arise for a variety of reasons, including: • advice of unpaid leave or other changes received after the payroll has run; • an allowance or other entitlement did not cease when it should have; or 10 • paid leave was anticipated and the employer was unable to recover it all from the final pay. Underpayments 3.17 While an underpayment is an error from some perspectives, it is a well- established tax principle that income from wages and salary is derived (taxed) on a cash basis, and is taxed at the rates applying when the cash is actually received. 10 Calculating the tax and other deductions when the payment is finally made remo ves the need for a PAYE correction as the information is simply included in the return when the payment is made. 3.18 If an underpayment spans income years, and tax rates have increased since the income was earned, this can seem unfair to the employee as the underpayment will all be taxed in one year and at the higher tax rate. On the other hand, if tax rates have decreased and/or the employee is on a lower income when the underpayment is corrected, the employee may prefer that the tax is calculated on the rates applying when the payment is made. 3.19 Officials are not proposing any changes to the principle that, when an underpayment is made up, tax and other deductions are calculated at the employee’s rate on the payday when the payment is made. In these circumstances there is no requirement to correct earlier returns. Questions • Do you agree that tax and other deductions due on underpayments should be calculated at the employee’s current applicable tax rate when the payment is made? • If the proposal is not how you calculate tax and other deductions on underpayments, please explain how you calculate the tax and what information you provide to Inland Revenue. If you think your approach is preferable, please explain why. Overpayments 3.20 Because of the employment law obligations, employers are usually required to get employee agreement before correcting overpayments. 11 Officials understand that once agreement to repay is obtained it is not uncommon for payroll systems to correct overpayments back in the pay period(s) in which the overpayment occurred, and recalculate the tax and other deductions in those periods. As illustrated below, these systems then deduct the correction(s) from the income and deductions payable in the current pay 10 Hollis v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,967. 11 The Wages Protection Act 1983 identifies limited circumstances in which employee agreement is not required, such as when there has been unauthorised absence or a strike and the process followed meets the legislative requirements. 11 period. The difference between the net amount owed to the employee for the current pay period and the amount after the agreed overpayment has been deducted is regarded as a loan to the employee, which may be repaid in one amount or over time. 3.21 Despite their own systems recalculating the PAYE and other deductions in the pay period(s) in which the errors occurred, some emplo yers have advised us they would prefer to simply provide Inland Revenue with figures for the current payday, less the overpayments. Because it subtracts the overpayment fro m the amounts payable in the current pay period, this approach eliminates the need to amend (reverse and replace) earlier returns. Option A: Adjustment reported in subsequent payday return Jai has a base salary of $900 gross a week but has been paid a $100 weekly allowance that should have ceased at the end of the previous month. It continued for four weeks before it was discovered. In one of the overpaid periods she was paid $200 overtime. Jai has a student loan but is not in KiwiSaver. If the employer corrected the error by reporting it in a subsequent return they would recalculate what was paid (standard text shows what was originally paid) in each of periods 1 to 4 (the figures in italics are the recalculation) and then net the changes off the amounts after tax and other deductions have been calculated for payday 5. The employer would report the bold figures for payday 5. Original Payday 1 Payday 2 Payday 3 Payday 4 Payday 5 adjusted to net off agreed error Gross income $1,000 − $100 = $900 $1,200 – $100 = $1,100 $1,000 – $100 = $900 $1,000 – $100 = $900 Correct – adjustment: $900 − ($100 × 4) = $500 PAYE $180 $151 (−$29) $242 $211 (−$31) $180 $151 (−$29) $180 $151 (−$29) Correct –adjustment: $151 − (($29 × 3) + $31) = $33 Student loan $76 $64 (−$12) $100 $88 (−$12) $76 $64 (−$12) $76 $64 (−$12) Correct – adjustment: $64 − (4 × $12) = $16 Net pay 12 $744 $685 $858 $801 $744 $685 $744 $685 Correct – adjustment: $685 − ((3 × $59) + $57) = $451 Option B: Amending the earlier returns If the employer amended the earlier returns, the record of Jai’s gross income and deductions for paydays 1 to 4 would be amended to show the figures below. Corrected Payday 1 Payday 2 Payday 3 Payday 4 Payday 5 Gross income $900 $1,100 $900 $900 $900 PAYE $151 $211 $151 $151 $151 Student loan $64 $88 $64 $64 $64 Net pay $685 $801 $685 $685 $685 12 Net pay is not reported to Inland Revenue but is included for completeness. 12 3.22 Option A and Option B, illustrated above, would result in the same overpaid amounts being refunded or credited to the employer. They leave the emplo yee in the same situation both in terms o f social po licy 13 and tax. If the employer amended the original returns, Inland Revenue would, however, pay use-of-money interest on overpaid deductions, provided the amount overpaid was more than $100. 3.23 If the correction is made by netting the changes off against a subsequent return (Option A), Inland Revenue’s records for paydays 1 to 4 will not match the employer’s amended records for those paydays. Officials are aware that PAYE-related reconciliation issues cause some employers significant concern. Submitters are invited to comment on whether employers should only be allowed to report an adjustment in a subsequent return if the employer retains both the original and amended records. 3.24 Allowing the employer to net overpayment corrections off in a subsequent return may also make it hard for Inland Revenue to see that appropriate deductions have been made. It is possible that having an indicator, at the emplo yee level, that this return includes an adjustment to previous returns might resolve most cases. 3.25 It is proposed that when agreement is reached with an emplo yee 14 to repay an overpaid amount, an emplo yer who recalculates the amounts in the pay periods that were wrong could report the change to Inland Revenue either by: • rolling the changes forward and netting them off the gross income and deductions reported in a subsequent return (Option A). For a discussion about the ability to report negative values please see the next section, “Reporting negative values in a return”; or • making a correction by amending the returns that required correction (Option B). 3.26 In terms of emplo yment law, and with their employee’s agreement, emplo yers may be able to correct some overpayment errors in other ways – for example, by reducing gross income payable in a subsequent pay period and calculating the tax and other deductions on the reduced gross. 13 For discussion of overpayments that cross tax years and the implications of the proposed reductions in assessment periods for some social policies see the section on “errors and adjustments relating to a previous assessment period”. 14 Or in the limited circumstances under the Wages Protection Act 1983, where agreement is not required. 13 Option C: Reduced gross income If the employer is legally able to correct an overpayment by reducing the gross payable in a subsequent period, and has their employee’s agreement, the information reported would be what is shown in bold below. This example assumes the same scenario as in Options A and B, a gross overpayment of $400. Reduced gross Information reported Amount Gross income Current pay minus overpayment ($900 − $400) $500 PAYE PAYE on reduced gross $76 Student loan Student loan on reduced gross $16 Net pay 15 Net pay $408 3.27 In this case the situation parallels an underpayment error as the tax and other deductions are calculated on the gross amount in the subsequent pay period. In these circumstances no adjustment or amendment is required. 3.28 The above options (A, B and where possible under employment law, Option C) are intended to meet the design principles of facilitating automat ion and, as much as possible, allowing employers to make corrections or adjustments consistent with their existing payroll practice. The ability to report negative values and what is required when an error occurred in a previous tax year are considered in the following sections. Questions • Is the method described in Option A how you or your system calculates the details of an overpayment? If not, how do you do it? • If you are involved with paying staff, which option (Option A or B) would you adopt to report an error correction to Inland Revenue and why? If your answer would vary depending on the circumstances, please explain why. • Should employers who adopt Option A be required to keep a record of both the original and corrected pay to enable the records to be reconciled if problems arise? • If you have concerns about the workability of the options, or would recommend a variation, please elaborate. • Do you ever recover overpayments by reducing gross income as described in Option C? If you do, can you please describe the circumstances? Reporting negative values in a return 3.29 For employers who pay staff more often than monthly, payday reporting will reduce the values in their returns of employment income information. For 15 Net pay is not reported to Inland Revenue but is included for completeness. 14 example, an employer who pays weekly will have values in their weekly returns that are approximately one-quarter the size of those reported in the emplo yer mo nthly schedule. Unless the constraint on filing negative values is relaxed, payday reporting is likely to increase the requirement to correct errors by amending previous returns. 3.30 The current constraint on filing negative values arises largely because Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer system cannot accurately process negative values. Until Inland Revenue completes its transition to the new computer system, it will be managing PAYE and related social policy deductions across two computer systems: FIRST and START. The constraint on filing negative values will remain during this period, which is referred to as “co- existence”. 3.31 Once Inland Revenue manages all aspects of employment income informat ion in its new co mputer system, it is proposed that employers will be able to file adjustments with negative values. It is not possible to definitively indicate when the system will be able to accept negative values but it will not be before early 2020. Officials are seeking to explore and understand any reconciliation or systems issues that might arise if this change is introduced. Questions • If you run a payroll and make adjustments by netting off the change against a subsequent return, approximately how many times a year does the constraint on filing negative values require you to amend earlier returns? • Do you support the proposal to allow employers to file negative values in their returns of employment income information? • If you have concerns about the proposal to allow employers to report negative values, or if there are issues that implementation must address, please explain them. Interpretation errors 3.32 Another type of error occurs when an employer misinterprets the law – for example, wrongly treating a taxable allowance or provision as non-taxable. These errors are similar to other interpretation errors the employer might make in other aspects of their tax affairs, and it is proposed that similar principles should apply. When a taxpayer discovers an interpretation error, the general rule is that the error must be corrected by making a voluntary disclosure proposing a reassessment of the incorrect return. 16 Interest and penalties may apply. 16 When an employer amends an earlier employer monthly schedule revising the amount of tax to pay upwards it is regarded as a voluntary disclosure. 15 3.33 Some of those who responded to the discussion document, Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST, supported the proposal that there should be an ability to correct genuine PAYE errors in a subsequent return, up to a threshold or cap. A provisio n exists in section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 whereby taxpayers can correct genuine errors, occurring in certain other tax types in a subsequent return, up to a cap of $1,000 per return. 3.34 A limit or cap of $1,000 per payday return for a large employer with several payrolls could amount to a very significant total in a year and could obscure systemat ic problems in the emplo yer’s tax treatment of payroll. 3.35 In addit ion, the possibility of shorter assessment periods for some social policy entitlements and obligations has been raised. 17 If those proposals go ahead, a non-trivial tax treatment error could detrimentally affect an employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations if it was all reported in a subsequent payday return. Example Since starting a new job in April, Phil and his family have lived in a house supplied by his employer at a rent $150 a week below the market rent. The employer has not included the $150 in his gross income. After six months the error is picked up by the tax agent, at which time $3,900 in gross income has gone unreported. At Phil’s salary the PAYE owing is $1,224. 18 If the assessment period for Working for Families tax credits and child support reduces from a year to a shorter period, reporting the whole amount in a single payday return could materially reduce Phil’s entitlements or obligations without his available income changing. 3.36 Entit lements and obligations would be similarly affected if instead of his employer having made an interpretation error the emplo yer had underpaid Phil $150 gross over the six-month period. However, in that case, when the underpayment is corrected, Phil would receive a cash lump sum and it is appropriate that his obligations and entitlements should reflect that. 3.37 Ideally, a threshold for interpretation errors would allow small errors to be corrected in a subsequent return while requiring other errors to be corrected by amending previous returns. 3.38 Officials propose that an employer who makes an interpretation error can correct it in a subsequent return provided PAYE on the discrepancy is less than 10 percent of the employee’s total PAYE in that payday return. 3.39 In addit ion, to ensure that frequent or widespread interpretation errors have visibility, we suggest that employers can only correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to an annual threshold of $10,000 a year of PAYE 17 Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy, Chapter 3. 18 Including ACC levy. 16 discrepancy for that emplo yer. 19 No threshold is proposed for correcting other error types. The $10,000 is proposed as a limit on upward reassessments arising from interpretation errors, not as a net threshold that allows upward and downward reassessments to be netted off. 3.40 A number of issues relating to PAYE information concerning non-resident employees and non-resident contractors were raised in feedback on Making Tax Simpler – A Government green paper on tax administration, and in response to Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST. 3.41 This issues paper does not put forward any special rules in relation to the correction of errors in employment income information relating to these taxpayers. To the extent that the suggested changes would allow more flexibility around error correction, the employers of non-resident employees and contractors should also benefit. A number of specific issues are, however, being worked through separately in an effort to address specific concerns that have been raised relating to non-resident employees and non- resident contractors. 3.42 As with other tax types, interest on interpretation errors corrected by amending previous returns, would continue to apply, as would exposure to late payment and, if warranted, shortfall penalties. Questions • In your experience what issues most often give rise to interpretation errors? • How do you or your payroll system, currently correct interpretation errors? • If you consider that thresholds for allowing interpretation errors in a subsequent return should be set at different values or on a different basis to that suggested here, please tell us your alternative and explain your reasons. Errors and adjustments relating to a previous assessment period 3.43 The majority of PAYE errors and adjustments are identified and rectified relatively quickly. However, some will inevitably cross tax years, raising the question of whether special rules are required for error correction when the error occurred in a previous tax year. In addition, as noted above, the prospect of shorter assessment periods for social policy also needs to be considered. 3.44 As set out earlier in this chapter, underpayments are reported and taxed when they are paid, regardless of the tax year in which the underpayment occurred. 19 Where employers file under different numbers – for example, at different locations each number would be regarded as an employer. 17 3.45 If overpayments in a previous tax year are adjusted in an employment income information return relating to a subsequent year, the individual’s record of income with Inland Revenue will reflect the reduction in income in the later year and it will be taxed at that year’s rates. A case can be made that this is appropriate. The employee was taxed on the income they had in the previous year and it is in the current year when they repay the overpayment that they experience the reduction in income. 3.46 When tax rates, thresholds or the individual’s circumstances have changed in the time between when an overpayment occurred and when repayment was agreed, adjusting in a subsequent period can seem unfair. 3.47 Requiring errors which span tax years to be corrected by amending the original returns would, however, not solve the problem. If the assessment for a prior year has been finalised, an employer amending employment income information returns for that year does not automatically prompt a reassessment for the individual. It would be up to the individual to either make the adjustment in a subsequent IR3 or to contact Inland Revenue to discuss their options. This would include requesting the Commissioner to make amendment. Permitting the employer to report and adjust for a payroll error in a subsequent year would at least ensure that the change factors into an assessment. 3.48 If proposals for shorter assessment periods for some social policies are adopted, entitlements and obligations could be based on income in the prior assessment period. In this environment, reporting an overpayment when repayment is agreed will ensure that the change in income feeds through to social policy entitlements and obligations in the following period. This is appropriate as it is when the available (net) inco me is reduced by the requirement to make repayment(s). 3.49 If the employer chooses to correct an overpayment error by amending earlier returns, some of the reduction in income may fall outside the social policy assessment period. It is intended, however, that there will be a mechanism whereby material changes affecting prior assessment periods are checked to see if a consequent reassessment of social policy calculations is needed. It is also proposed that an employee adversely affected by error correction in an earlier assessment period could seek to have their social policy entitlement or obligation reconsidered. 3.50 Officials suggest that employers should be permitted to report payro ll overpayment errors relating to a previous tax year in a subsequent return. 3.51 If employers are permitted to correct overpayment errors relating to a previous tax year in a subsequent return, there does not appear to be good reason why they should not be allowed to remedy interpretation errors up to the relevant thresholds, in the same way. 18 Questions • Can you estimate how often you correct overpayments or interpretation errors relating to a prior tax year? How do you report them? • Do you agree with the proposal that employers should be able to report overpayment and interpretation errors 20 relating to a previous tax year in a current-year payday return? • If you have issues or concerns with the above proposal for an employee or an emplo yer please tell us about them. Employee compliance errors 3.52 The suggested changes in this issues paper will not change an employer’s obligations if an employee has made an error in the information they have provided to their employer. For example, under payday reporting, the Bill proposes that the employer will only be required to action tax code changes from the next time they run the payroll. There is no obligation on the employer to go back and “correct” earlier periods. Reporting employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) 3.53 Under payday reporting, it is intended that a separate IR345 (“emplo yer deduction form” or EDF) would no longer be required to accompany payment of PAYE. This change would not be introduced until the processing of PAYE and related social policy administration occurs completely within Inland Revenue’s new computer system, which will not be before early 2020. This change would require that information about total ESCT, which is currently reported on the EDF, is added to the employment income information that is reported each payday. 3.54 Officials are aware that the current aggregated reporting of ESCT creates problems. For example, when an employer is due a refund of PAYE, the associated ESCT needs to be separately calculated and notified to Inland Revenue. In addit ion, because Inland Revenue cannot see the amount of ESCT withheld for each employee, it can be difficult to monitor that the employer is making appropriate KiwiSaver contributions. 3.55 To alleviate these problems, officials suggest that emplo yers should be required to report the amount of ESCT withheld for each employee in their payday returns of employment income information. 20 Up to the thresholds. 19 Question • Do you support the proposal that instead of reporting total ESCT in the EDF (IR345) the amount of ESCT withheld is reported in the payday reports of employment income information at the employee level? 3.56 Inland Revenue’s new computer system, and the redesign of PAYE processes, provide an opportunity to eliminate other reasons for contact from Inland Revenue. If employers could notify Inland Revenue, using a checkbox or drop-down menu when something unusual was happening, it should reduce unnecessary contacts. For example, for some employees the employer’s KiwiSaver contribution is subject to PAYE not ESCT and it would help if the employer could indicate this. Only one notification should be required per employee. Question • Do you support the greater use of one-off notifications, such as the one discussed above relating to KiwiSaver being subject to PAYE, to reduce contact from Inland Revenue? Complexity 3.57 Error correction often involves a trade-off between accuracy and cost. The changes suggested in this chapter would allow different approaches for reporting errors, overpayment errors and interpretation errors. An employer concerned about the complexity of distinguishing between different error types could, however, choose to correct all of these errors by amending the previous returns. Question • Would you find the proposed changes unduly complex? If so, how would you simplify them? 20 CHAPTER 4 PAYE income and payroll corrections 4.1 Stakeholder feedback suggests that the law around the taxation of overpaid PAYE inco me requires clarification. It is Inland Revenue’s current view that overpaid wages and salary are not PAYE income and are generally not taxable in the hands of the employee. 21 This view has not been widely promulgated or included in Inland Revenue’s guidance to employers. 4.2 An employer only has an obligation to deduct PAYE from PAYE income. If an employee agrees to repay an overpaid amount 22 that was originally paid as PAYE inco me, the parties have agreed that it was not PAYE income. The emplo yer therefore did not have an obligation to withho ld fro m it, and once notified of the error, Inland Revenue should refund the overpaid deductions to the emplo yer . 4.3 In some cases a repayment schedule may be agreed which spreads the employee’s obligation to repay over a number of pay periods. To reduce compliance and administrative costs, it is proposed that the reduction in inco me could be adjusted in one payday return following agreement to repay, rather than being matched to each repayment from the employee. 23 Alternatively, it could be reported when the sum had been fully repaid. An emplo yer could choose which option best suited the circumstances. 4.4 Not all overpayments result in repayment. Occasionally an employer will agree to leave the overpayment with the employee. Following this decision, the amount might be regarded as a “bonus” and subject to PAYE, or alternatively, taxable as debt remission income. 4.5 Sometimes an employee refuses to repay the employer or leaves the employer with no forwarding address before the overpayment is repaid. Officials understand that when overpaid income is not repaid, it is often treated as if it remains taxable as salary or wages. As a consequence, employers do not adjust the employment income information filed wit h Inland Revenue. 4.6 It is proposed that the legislation should be amended to make it clear that where an overpayment is not repaid, it is PAYE income and no error correction or adjustment should be made. 4.7 This approach would remo ve the need to distinguish between when an employer has agreed to leave the amount with the employee and when they have simply been unable to recover it. It would, however, mean that when the employee does not repay the net amount, the employer is unable to recover the PAYE and other deductions from Inland Revenue. 21 “PAYE where income is received fraudulently or in error”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 11. 22 Or, in the limited circumstances under the Wages Protection Act 1983, where agreement is not required. 23 If the employee subsequently defaulted on the repayment there would be an obligation on the employer to advise of a further adjustment which added the amount not repaid back into the employment income information. 21 Table 2: Summary of proposals for overpayments Type of overpayment Proposal Overpayment repaid When the amount is repaid (or there is agreement to repay) this error type can be corrected either: • by amending the original return(s) that contained the error; or • by recalculating the pay and tax in the pay periods that contained the error, and netting the amounts off the values in a subsequent return. If legally able to and with the agreement of the employee, by reducing the gross income in a subsequent pay period and reporting the reduced figures in a subsequent return. Inland Revenue will not be able to accept negative values in returns at least until after the end of 2019, but after that, it is proposed that negative values should be accepted. Overpayment not repaid When the overpaid amount is not repaid, it continues to be taxable as PAYE income; no error correction is required and there would be no refund of PAYE and related deductions. Overpayment partially repaid If the amount is partially repaid, the sum not repaid remains taxable as PAYE income. If the employer has made an adjustment based on the agreement to repay, a further adjustment would be required to add back the amount not repaid. Question • Do you support the proposal that the law should be amended to make it clear that overpaid income not repaid remains taxable in the hands of the employee as PAYE income? If not, please explain your reasons. Fringe benefit tax 4.8 If the employer and employee agree that the overpaid net income should be repaid over a period of time, it is possible that the overpayment could be regarded as an interest-free loan, which should attract fringe benefit tax. The legislation currently excludes a loan provided as an advance against future salary from fringe benefit tax, provided the loan amount does not exceed $2,000 during the fringe benefit tax period, and it is not a term of the employment contract. 22 4.9 Because the amount to be repaid could exceed $2,000, it is proposed that an amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 be made, to clarify that time allowed to an employee to repay overpaid income does not create a liability for fringe benefit tax. Question • If you have any concerns with this approach, can you please tell us why? 23 APPENDIX Proposed PAYE changes The key changes proposed in The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill currently before Parliament are: • Emplo yers and payroll intermediaries 24 will no longer be required to file an employer monthly schedule; instead they would file employment income information on a payday basis from 1 April 2019. • Employers using payroll software will be able to file their information directly from their payroll system. • Employers will not be required to use payroll software but would have to file their PAYE information on a payday basis. 25 • Emplo yers with the smallest payrolls will still be able to file their PAYE information on paper if they choose to do so. The threshold for electronic filing of PAYE information will reduce from $100,000 a year of PAYE and Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) deductions to $50,000 a year. • The Government is not proposing to change the dates by which PAYE and related deductions must be paid to Inland Revenue. However, emplo yers will be able to make these payments on payday if they choose to. • To improve the workability of the rules, minor changes will be made from 1 April 2018 to the PAYE rules for holiday pay paid in advance, and to align when rate changes come into effect. • The payroll subsidy, which subsidises employers to outsource their PAYE obligations to listed payroll intermediaries, will cease from 1 April 2018. 24 References to employers should generally be read as including payroll intermediaries. 25 For payroll intermediaries, employers above the electronic filing threshold and for those below the threshold using payroll software, the due date would be two working days after payday. For employers below the electronic filing threshold not using payroll software, the due date would be seven working days after payday. 24
International treaty examination of the Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government Republic of India and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 THIRD PROTOCOL TO THE INDI A DOUBLE TAX ATION AGREEMENT 2 International treaty examination of the Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government Republic of India and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee has examined the Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and recommends that the House take note of its report. New Zealand signed a double tax agreement (DTA) with India in 1986. This protocol to the DTA brings the mechanism for the exchange of information up to date to meet the current standard set by the OECD. It also introduces into the DTA with India an article that will enable the tax authorities of New Zealand and India to assist each other in the recovery of unpaid taxes. We support the agreement and have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. THIRD PROTOCOL TO THE INDI A DOUBLE TAX ATION AGREEMENT 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The international treaty examination of the Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income was referred to us by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on 5 December 2016. We met on 14 December 2016, and 8 and 15 February 2017 to consider the agreement. Committee members Chris Bishop (Chairperson) Andrew Bayly Hon Clayton Cosgrove Hon Craig Foss Rt Hon Winston Peters Grant Robertson Jami-Lee Ross Alastair Scott David Seymour James Shaw THIRD PROTOCOL TO THE INDI A DOUBLE TAX ATION AGREEMENT 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS: Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income Executive summary 1. The Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (“the Third Protocol to the India DTA”) was signed on 26 October 2016. 2. The Third Protocol to the India DTA brings the exchange of information mechanism in New Zealand’s DTA with India, signed in 1986, up to date to meet the current standard set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“the OECD”) in the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, which forms the basis of New Zealand’s negotiating model. It also introduces into the India DTA an article on assistance in the collection of taxes, which enables the tax authorities of each country to assist each other in the recovery of unpaid taxes. 3. Owing to historic international and legal principles that otherwise impose barriers to countries assisting each other in enforcing their tax laws, forms of administrative co-operation are typically established through tax treaties, more specifically, traditionally through DTAs. However, DTAs are not the only legal instrument available to enable and encourage administrative co-operation in tax matters. The joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (“the Multilateral Convention”) has been in existence since 1988 but opened for signature to all countries in 2010. The Multilateral Convention is the most comprehensive multilateral instrument available which provides for all forms of tax co-operation to tackle tax evasion and avoidance The Multilateral Convention provides for a wide range of administrative co-operation in tax matters, including exchange of information and assistance in collection. It has now been signed by more than 100 jurisdictions. 4. Once the Third Protocol to the India DTA enters into force, New Zealand and India (“the Contracting States”) will have up-to-date exchange of information and assistance in collection mechanisms available to them under both the Multilateral Convention and the DTA. The tax authorities of the two Contracting States will have flexibility to choose the legal instrument that is most appropriate for the circumstances of any particular case. Both instruments allow for the Contracting States to request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion, as well as assistance in the collection of taxes to enable tax authorities to assist each other in recovering unpaid taxes from absconding taxpayers. 5. It is in the national interest to bring into force the Third Protocol to the India DTA as it will strengthen New Zealand’s exchange of information and assistance in collection network, as well as New Zealand’s diplomatic ties with India, particularly as India is an important trade and investment partner for New Zealand. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 6. The Third Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (“the Third Protocol to the India DTA”) was signed on 26 October 2016. 7. Before the Third Protocol to the India DTA may be brought into force it must be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 provides that such Orders in Council may specify that the provisions of a DTA will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. Section BH 1 expressly applies only to “double tax agreements”. However that term also covers amending protocols, including the Third Protocol to the India DTA. 8. Once the Order in Council is passed it is proposed that the New Zealand and India exchange diplomatic notes confirming completion of each jurisdiction’s domestic procedures required before entry into force. The Third Protocol to the India DTA will enter into force on the date of the last notification (Article 3). However, requests may be made for information or assistance in the collection of taxes relating to periods prior to the entry into force of the Third Protocol. 9. Like the India DTA itself, the Third Protocol will not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 10. The aim of the Third Protocol to the India DTA is to update the article relating to the exchange of information to reflect the international standard set in the OECD Model Tax Convention and to introduce an article relating to assistance in the collection of taxes. 11. Double tax agreements (“DTAs”) are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. DTAs encourage growth in economic ties by reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. More specifically they provide greater certainty of tax treatment, eliminate double taxation, reduce withholding taxes on cross-border investment returns, and exempt certain short-term activities in the host state from income tax. The intention of a DTA is to do this without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. 12. DTAs also enable the tax authorities of treaty countries to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. 13. They do this primarily by establishing a mechanism for exchanging information between the tax authorities of the treaty countries. In addition, they also establish a mechanism for providing and requesting assistance in the collection of taxes. Exchange of information is critical to effective tax administration, as it enables a tax authority to obtain information on the offshore activities and income of tax residents, so as to ensure that worldwide income is being reported correctly for tax purposes. Assistance in the collection of taxes helps to ensure that the correct amount can actually be collected when the taxpayer or their assets are in a different jurisdiction. 14. New Zealand has an existing DTA in force with India, which was signed in 1986, and has two amending Protocols (the first was signed in 1996 and the second in 1999). 15. While the existing DTA contains an article relating to the exchange of information, the provisions of this article are limited and no longer meet the standard for exchange of information set by the OECD in its Model Tax Convention, on which New Zealand’s DTAs are generally based. 16. In addition, the existing DTA does not contain an article relating to assistance in collection as this was only introduced into the OECD Model Tax Convention in 2003, which was after the India DTA was last updated. 17. Administrative co-operation in tax matters is important and New Zealand’s network is under constant development, with a view to establishing arrangements relating to exchange of information and assistance in collection with a wide range of partners. It is also vital that existing treaties be kept up to date. Experience to date from administering such provisions is that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 18. India and New Zealand are signatories to the Multilateral Convention, which provides for all possible forms of administrative co-operation between states in the assessment and collection of taxes, in particular with a view to combating tax avoidance and evasion. This co- operation ranges from exchange of information, including automatic exchanges, to the recovery of foreign tax claims. However, this is also the case with a number of our other bilateral treaty partners, as more than 100 jurisdictions participate in the Multilateral Convention. 19. While there is some overlap between the Third Protocol to the India DTA and the scope of the Multilateral Convention, it provides flexibility to the tax authorities of the Contracting States as to which legal instrument is most appropriate for the circumstances of any particular case. 20. In addition, bringing into force the Third Protocol to the India DTA will strengthen diplomatic ties with India. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand Advantages 21. The Third Protocol to the India DTA will enable tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from India. In addition, it will also enable tax officials to request assistance from India in collecting unpaid taxes from taxpayers who do not reside in New Zealand. These provisions will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax evasion and avoidance, and ensure that the correct amount of tax can actually be collected. 22. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 23. As the provisions contained in the Third Protocol to the India reflect the current OECD standard on exchange of information and assistance in the collection of taxes, there is also the benefit of being able to utilise the comprehensive commentary produced by the OECD to support consistent interpretation and application of the provisions. 24. As noted in paragraphs 18 and 19, both India and New Zealand are signatories to the Multilateral Convention which provides for all possible forms of administrative co-operation in tax matters, including exchange of information and assistance in the collection of taxes. The overlap between the Multilateral Convention and the Third Protocol to the India DTA means that there will be flexibility available to the tax authorities of the Contracting States to choose the legal instrument that is most appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case. 25. Bringing into force the Third Protocol to the India DTA will strengthen diplomatic ties. Disadvantages 26. To the extent that requests for information or assistance in the collection of taxes are received from India, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the information, or costs in providing the requested assistance. However, such costs are already being borne by New Zealand when requests for information are received under the existing India DTA or when requests for information or assistance in collection are received under the Multilateral Convention. As streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with such requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing bilateral treaty network as well as the Multilateral Convention, any administrative costs of responding to requests from India under the Third Protocol to the India DTA are therefore expected to be marginal. 27. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 28. On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to bring into force the Third Protocol to the India DTA. The Third Protocol to the India DTA will extend and strengthen New Zealand’s treaty network and will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax evasion and avoidance. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 29. The Third Protocol to the India DTA places a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting State to provide, upon request, administrative assistance by way of information that is relevant or to the administration and enforcement of taxes (Article 1), or assistance in the collection of taxes (Article 2). The provisions relating to the exchange of information cover taxes of every kind and description and the provisions relating to assistance in the collection of taxes cover all revenue claims, not merely income tax. 30. In the case of a request for information, if Inland Revenue does not already hold the information, it will be obliged to use its information-gathering powers to obtain and forward that information to India in a timely manner. Similarly, for assistance in recovery requests, Inland Revenue will be obliged to use its debt-recovery powers to collect unpaid tax debt and to forward the payments to India. 31. However, the obligations that arise under the Third Protocol to the India DTA already exist under the India DTA, in relation to the exchange of information, and under the Multilateral Convention, in relation to both exchange of information and assistance in the collection of taxes. 32. Inland Revenue already has considerable experience in all forms of exchange of information and has in recent years been building experience in assistance in recovery. As a result, efficient systems for responding to incoming requests for assistance have been developed. Therefore, although entering into treaty arrangements for cooperation in tax matters gives rise to obligations on New Zealand to respond to incoming requests, the administrative costs imposed on Inland Revenue when responding to those requests have not been onerous. The additional obligations that would arise from the Third Protocol to the India DTA are expected to be minimal. 33. The Third Protocol to the India DTA does not contain a dispute-resolution provision, but instead the dispute-settlement mechanisms that are currently in place for the India DTA will also apply to the Third Protocol. 34. Reservations are not provided for under the Third Protocol to the India DTA. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 35. In order to implement the obligations in the Third Protocol to the India DTA an Order in Council must be passed in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 36. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables DTAs (and amending protocols) to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that the provisions of DTAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a DTA, given that the DTA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is otherwise forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other jurisdictions are not required to be disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the Third Protocol to the India DTA. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 37. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 38. Ordinary costs of responding to a request for information or assistance in collection will be borne by the jurisdiction actioning the request. To the extent that requests for information or assistance in collection are received from India, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those requests. However, such costs are already being borne by New Zealand when requests for information are received under the existing India DTA or when requests for information or assistance in collection are received under the Multilateral Convention. As streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with such requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing bilateral treaty network as well as the Multilateral Convention, any administrative costs of responding to requests from India under the Third Protocol to the India DTA are therefore expected to be marginal. 39. Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the Third Protocol to the India DTA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 40. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agreed with the proposed treaty action. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 41. No future protocols are anticipated. New Zealand would consider proposed amendments on a case-by-case basis and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 42. Article 4 of the Third Protocol to the India DTA provides that it shall remain in force as long as the India DTA remains in force and shall apply as long as the India DTA itself is applicable. 43. Either Contracting State may terminate the India DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, at least six months before the end of any calendar year, in accordance with Article 29 of the India DTA. Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the India DTA and its protocols would be subject to the usual Government approvals and procedures. Agency Disclosure Statement 44. Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. Inland Revenue has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the Third Protocol to the India DTA, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. Inland Revenue has considered all other possible options in that process, and is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 45. An Order in Council is required to implement the Third Protocol to the India DTA into New Zealand domestic law. 46. Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common law principles.

International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of San Marino on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 2 International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of San Marino on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee has examined the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of San Marino on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes, and recommends that the House take note of its report. This agreement establishes a mechanism for the exchange of information between New Zealand and the Republic of San Marino to enable the two jurisdictions to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion. We support the agreement and have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of San Marino on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes was referred to us by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on 5 December 2016. We met on 14 December 2016, and 8 and 15 February 2017 to consider the agreement. Committee members Chris Bishop (Chairperson) Andrew Bayly Hon Clayton Cosgrove Hon Craig Foss Rt Hon Winston Peters Grant Robertson Jami-Lee Ross Alastair Scott David Seymour James Shaw AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS: Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of San Marino on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Executive summary 1. The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of San Marino on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”) was signed on 1 April 2016. 2. The TIEA establishes an exchange of information mechanism between New Zealand and the Republic of San Marino (“San Marino”) for the purpose of enabling the two jurisdictions to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion. 3. Because of historical international and legal principles that otherwise impose barriers to countries assisting each other in enforcing their tax laws, forms of tax cooperation between jurisdictions such as exchange of information are typically established by means of tax treaties. The types of legal instruments that can be used for this purpose include:  Double Tax Agreements (DTAs). These treaties are predominantly concluded between trading and investment partners, and cover a range of tax issues in addition to exchange of information. New Zealand has 40 DTAs in force. New Zealand does not have a DTA with San Marino.  The joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (“the Multilateral Convention”), which has been in existence since 1988 but which was only opened for signature to all countries in 2010. The Multilateral Convention provides for a wide range of administrative co-operation in tax matters, including exchange of information. It has now been signed by over 100 jurisdictions. New Zealand and San Marino are both signatories to the Multilateral Convention.  Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). A model TIEA was developed by the OECD in 2002. Dealing solely with exchange of information, TIEAs are particularly useful for establishing bilateral exchange of information terms with jurisdictions that are not major trading or investment partners. 4. Once the TIEA enters into force, New Zealand and San Marino (“the Parties”) will have exchange of information mechanisms available to them under both the Multilateral Convention and the TIEA. The tax authorities of the two jurisdictions will have flexibility to choose the legal instrument that is most appropriate to the circumstances of any particular case. Both instruments allow for the Parties to request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. 5. The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules for effective exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally for the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Parties). 6. It is in the national interest to conclude the TIEA with San Marino as it will extend and strengthen New Zealand’s exchange of information network, and will also strengthen diplomatic ties with San Marino. . Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 7. It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force, by means of an exchange of diplomatic notes, following completion of each jurisdiction’s domestic requirements for entry into force. The exchange of notes constitutes the binding treaty action. However, the full range of steps required in New Zealand, for entry into force of the TIEA are set out in the following paragraphs. 8. The TIEA is required to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 397-400. Standing Order 397(1)(d) requires Parliamentary examination of any major bilateral treaty of particular significance that the Minister of Foreign Affairs decides to present to the House. Although a TIEA would not normally be considered major bilateral treaties of particular significance, it has been decided that any treaty that overrides legislation once in force should be subject to appropriate scrutiny under Standing Order 397(1)(d). 9. Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 provides that such Orders in Council may specify that the provisions of a DTA will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. Section BH 1 expressly applies only to “double tax agreements”. However that term is defined for the purposes of that section as any agreement negotiated for any one or more listed purposes. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, TIEAs fall within the ambit of section BH 1. 10. Upon the promulgation of the Order in Council, the TIEA will be brought into force, in accordance with Article 12 of the TIEA, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. The TIEA comes into force on the date of the last notification, and takes effect from that date for criminal matters. In relation to all other matters, the TIEA comes into effect for taxable periods beginning on or after the date of entry into force or, where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after that date. (In practice this means that requests for retrospective information may only be made in respect of criminal tax matters.) 11. Once an exchange of information mechanism has been established with another jurisdiction, New Zealand can approve that jurisdiction for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Qualifying foreign investors from approved territories are exempt from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. The purpose of the exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital investment into New Zealand.) Approval of a jurisdiction for the purposes of section CW 12 requires the making of an additional Order in Council. This will be attended to after the TIEA enters into force. 12. The TIEA will not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 13. To assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, New Zealand, like most developed countries, has developed a wide network of tax treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 14. Historically, DTAs were the only available type of tax treaty. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. This meant that it could be difficult, if not impossible, to establish exchange of information arrangements other jurisdictions, and in particular with low tax jurisdictions and international finance centres. The international community increasingly came to recognise this as a problem, as much tax avoidance and tax evasion activity occurs through such jurisdictions. 15. In response, in 2002, the OECD produced a model TIEA that provides solely for exchange of information. In 2010, the OECD then also arranged for the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters to be updated and opened for signature to all countries. 16. New Zealand currently has 40 DTAs and 11 TIEAs in force. In addition, New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention on 26 October 2012. Over 100 jurisdictions are now party to Multilateral Convention, although it is currently only in force in respect of 73 of these. Combining our DTAs, TIEAs and Multilateral Convention partners, New Zealand currently has exchange of information arrangements in force with 89 jurisdictions. As is the case with San Marino, a number of our bilateral treaty partners are also signatories to the Multilateral Convention. 17. New Zealand’s exchange of information network is under constant development, with a view to establishing exchange of information arrangements with as wide a range of partners as possible. Experience to date from administering exchange of information provisions is that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 18. San Marino has had a standing request with New Zealand for a DTA. Due to incompatible tax settings, this was not possible in New Zealand’s view. New Zealand instead offered to negotiate a TIEA. At the time of these discussions, San Marino had not signed the Multilateral Convention. However, even if it had, having a choice of legal instrument provides the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions with the flexibility to choose which instrument is most appropriate for the circumstances of any particular case. In addition, the TIEA will also strengthen diplomatic ties with San Marino. 19. The TIEA with San Marino will extend and strengthen New Zealand’s exchange of information network and enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax evasion. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand Advantages 20. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from San Marino under this bilateral information exchange. Access to this information is an important part of Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”, but its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 21. The TIEA closely follows the 2002 OECD model TIEA, and is subject to the comprehensive commentary produced by the OECD to support consistent interpretation and application of the TIEA provisions. 22. The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the bilateral exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA also addresses privacy and confidentiality concerns, by ensuring that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity (the OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”). In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the P arties). 23. Interference from bank secrecy rules and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice (such as legal professional privilege) remain in effect. 24. The approval of San Marino for the purposes of the section CW 12 venture capital exemption may result in increased venture capital exemption into New Zealand. Disadvantages 25. To the extent that requests for information are received from San Marino, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs, TIEAs, and the Multilateral Convention. The administrative costs of responding to requests from San Marino under the TIEA will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 26. On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with San Marino. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 27. The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes (Article 1). Such information includes information that is relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of taxes, the recovery and enforcement of tax claims, or the investigation or prosecution of tax matters. The taxes that the TIEA will apply to are set out in Article 3(1). In the case of San Marino, the TIEA will apply to general income tax which is levied on individuals or bodies corporate and proprietorships, even if collected through a withholding tax. For New Zealand, the TIEA will apply to “taxes of every kind and description”. 28. The legal obligations established by the TIEA include the requirement to provide information without regard to whether the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the Requested Party if such conduct occurred in the Requested Party (Article 5). Such an obligation is a feature of the OECD model TIEA, and is intended to counter any domestic law provision of a country that prevents the exchange of information on matters unless they constitute a crime. Such rules can frustrate effective exchange of information. This is a standard clause in TIEAs to guard against the possibility of the existence or future introduction of any such rule in either country. 29. The TIEA also contemplates the possibility that representatives of the tax administration of the Requesting Party may be allowed to visit the Requested Party to interview individuals and examine records (Article 6). The treaty does not impose any obligation on the Requested Party to agree to such a visit. However, the possibility may prove to be useful in certain cases. For example, in a complex case officials of one Party may wish to consider visiting the other jurisdiction for the purposes of conducting interviews. 30. The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request (Article 8). Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally for the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 31. Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for San Marino, the Central Liaison Office). 32. Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 33. Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 34. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables TIEAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that TIEAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a TIEA, given that the TIEA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other jurisdictions are not required to be disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the TIEA. 35. After the Order in Council has entered into force, New Zealand will notify San Marino by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. San Marino will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification (Article 12). The provisions of the TIEA will generally apply prospectively. However, in criminal tax matters the TIEA provisions can be used to obtain information pre-dating entry into force. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 36. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 37. Ordinary costs of responding to a request will be borne by the jurisdiction actioning the request. To the extent that requests for information are received from San Marino, New Zealand will therefore incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests (Article 9). However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network as well as the Multilateral Convention. Any administrative costs of responding to requests from San Marino are therefore expected to be marginal. 38. Each Party will be required to reimburse the other for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a request made under the TIEA. 39. Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 40. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 41. No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 42. Article 13 of the TIEA provides that, after three years from the date of its entry into force, either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 43. Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual Government approvals and procedures. Agency Disclosure Statement 44. Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. Inland Revenue has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA between New Zealand and San Marino and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. Inland Revenue has considered all other possible options in that process, and is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 45. An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA into New Zealand domestic law. 46. Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common law principles.

February 2017 Automatic Exchange of Information Changes to the Common Reporting Standard User Guide and CRS XML Schema v1.0 Introduction The Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (in short, Automatic Exchange of Information, or AEOI) was developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to assist countries in the detection and prevention of ‘offshore’ tax evasion. It is a global initiative for the automated exchange of financial account information between international tax treaty partners. New Zealand has committed to supporting this initiative. The Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (the “Standard”) is a document that the OECD has published to assist jurisdictions with their implementation of AEOI. The Standard contains the Model Competent Authority Agreement and Common Reporting Standard, Commentaries on the MCAA and the CRS, and guidance on the technical solution. Part of the technical solution to support the Standard is an XML schema, which is to be used for the automatic exchange of financial account information between NZ’s exchange partners. This schema can also be used by NZ financial institutions to submit their disclosure information to Inland Revenue. The Common Reporting Standard User Guide to using this schema can be found in Annex 3 of the Standard. Subsequent to the publishing of the Standard, delegates to the Expert Sub-Group on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the “ESG”) have requested certain changes to how the schema is used. The changes to the Common Reporting Standard User Guide were approved by the Expert Sub-Group on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and Working Party 10, and will need to be reflected in XML disclosures that New Zealand financial institutions submit to Inland Revenue. Correcting and deleting information These changes have been made to how financial institutions and reporting jurisdictions can correct disclosure information that has already been submitted: • The CorrMessageRefId is no longer required, as every correctable element can be identified by its unique DocRefId. This means that the CorrMessageRefId cannot be 1 used to delete an entire disclosure. Instead, a corrected disclosure should be sent deleting all of the records (using the original DocRefIds) of the original disclosure. • Uncorrected information (such as when resubmitting reporting FI information) will not require the use of a new DocRefID. • The Resend function in the DocTypeIndic element of the schema can now be used. Therefore, the following changes should be made to page 253 of the User Guide: DocTypeIndic This element specifies the type of data being submitted. Allowable entries are: • OECD0 = Resend Data (only used when resending the Reporting FI element) • OECD1 = New Data • OECD2 = Corrected Data • OECD3 = Deletion of Data • OECD10 = Resent Test Data (only used when resending the Reporting FI element) • OECD11 = New Test Data • OECD12 = Corrected Test Data • OECD13 = Deletion of Test Data Combinations of DocTypeIndics allowed When correcting a previously submitted disclosure, these combinations of DocTypeIndics are allowed: Account Report OECD1 OECD2 OECD3 OECD0 Account Report can be omitted? Reporting FI OECD1 OECD2    OECD3   OECD0   For example, using the table as a guide, a disclosure that has a corrected Reporting FI element (DocTypeIndic=OECD2) can contain both corrected (OECD2) and deleted (OECD3) Account Reports, or could even contain no Account Report element. However, a corrected Reporting FI element cannot contain new data records (OECD1). 2 Example 1 – Change to Reporting FI and Account Report information This example illustrates a situation where a change needs to be made to a previously submitted disclosure. A correction is being made to the Reporting FI address and to one of the controlling persons’ date of birth.

This is because the DocRefID of a record is unique and therefore sufficient for identifying the record. • The AccountReport element in the corrected disclosures should be repeated in its entirety, with only the corrected elements changing from the previous disclosures. In this example, all account information and controlling persons must be repeated in the corrected disclosure, even though only one controlling person element is being corrected. 3 Example 2 – Multiple corrected disclosures This example illustrates a situation where a change needs to be made to a previously submitted disclosure, and then a second change made to the same disclosure.

This is because the DocRefID of a record is unique and therefore sufficient for identifying the record. • The ReportingFI element must always be included in a disclosure, regardless of whether it requires correction. In this example, the ReportingFI element does not change in the corrected disclosures, therefore the DocTypeIndic is OECD0 (Resent Data) and the DocRefId remains the same. • The CorrDocRefId in the second correction references the disclosure immediately preceding it, instead of the original disclosure. This should always be the case for CRS reporting. • Only the AccountReports that require correction should be included in the corrected disclosure. Any AccountReport element that requires correction and is included in the corrected disclosure should be included in its entirety, with only the corrected fields and values changing from the previous disclosure. 4 Example 3 – Change to Reporting FI information only This example demonstrates a corrected disclosure, where only the Reporting FI address needs to be corrected.

This is because the ReportingFI address details have changed fro m the original disclosure. • Only AccountReports that require correction need to be included in corrected disclosures. In this example, the AccountReport does not require correcting, so it has not been included. 5 Example 4 – Deleting an entire disclosure This example shows how an entire disclosure can be deleted.

February 2017 Automatic Exchange of Information Inland Revenue validations (draft) Virus scan and security threats We will reject files containing viruses or security threats (such as hyperlinks, JavaScript and executable files). CRS schema We will reject files that do not conform to the CRS XSD schema. The CRS schema is available at http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ Latin alphabet We will reject files that are not in the Latin alphabet. Invalid sending company The SendingCompanyIN element should contain the reporting financial institution’s IRD Number. This number will be validated against our system. Incorrect transmitting or receiving country The value in the TransmittingCountry and ReceivingCountry elements should be NZ. Missing contact information The Contact element should be completed with the contact details that Inland Revenue can use if they have any questions about the information provided. Missing or incorrect message reference IDs The MessageRefId element should be a unique value and should not match any previously submitted MessageRefId values. The MessageRefId value should be provided in the format \[IRD Number\].\[Unique ID\]. For example 99999999.00001 1 Mismatch between message type and document type indicators The MessageTypeIndic element should match the DocTypeIndic values used throughout the disclosure. For example, a MessageTypeIndic value of ‘CRS701’ (new data) should only be used with a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD1’ (new data). A MessageTypeIndic value of ‘CRS702’ (corrected data) should only be used with DocTypeIndic values of ‘OECD0’ (resent data), ‘OECD2’ (corrected data) or ‘OECD3’ (deleted data). Incorrect ‘nil report’ message type indicator A disclosure with a MessageTypeIndic value of ‘CRS703’ (no data to report) should not contain any AccountReport elements. Corresponding message reference ID provided incorrectly The CorrMessageRefId element should not be used for CRS reporting. Reporting period The New Zealand reporting period should always end on the 31st March. Financial institution’s residency country code The ReportingFI/ResCountryCode element value should be ‘NZ’. Reporting group elements provided incorrectly Only one ReportingGroup element should be provided for each CRSBody element. The Sponsor, Intermediary and PoolReport elements should not be used for CRS reporting. Missing or incorrect document reference IDs The DocRefId value should be provided in the format \[IRDNumber\].\[UniqueID\]. For example 99999999.00001. When a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD1’ (new data), ‘OECD2’ (corrected data) or ‘OECD3’ (deleted data) is used, then the associated DocRefId should be a unique value and should not match any previously submitted DocRefId values. When a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD0’ (resent data) is used, then the associated DocRefId should match to a DocRefId value in a previously-submitted disclosure. A DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD0’ should only be used in the ReportingFI element. 2 Missing or incorrect corresponding document reference IDs When a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD2’ (corrected data) or ‘OECD3’ (deleted data) is used, then the DocSpec should also contain a CorrDocRefId value. The CorrDocRefId value should match to a DocRefId value in a previously-submitted disclosure and should not have been used to correct a submitted record previously. When a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD0’ (resent data) or ‘OECD1’ (new data) is used, then the DocSpec should not contain any CorrDocRefId value. Mismatch between document type indicators The DocTypeIndic values used in the AccountReport element should not contradict the DocTypeIndic values used in the ReportingFI element. For example, a ReportingFI DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD0’ (resent data) or ‘OECD2’ (corrected data) should only be used with AccountReport DocTypeIndic values of ‘OECD2’ (corrected data) or ‘OECD3’ (deleted data). A ReportingFI DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD1’ (new data) should only be used with AccountReport DocTypeIndic values that are also ‘OECD1’. A ReportingFI DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD3’ (deleted data) should only be used with AccountReport DocTypeIndic values that are also ‘OECD3’. Document type indicators used incorrectly When a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD0’ (resent data) or ‘OECD3’ (deleted data) is used, then none of the corresponding ReportingFI/AccountReport information should have changed from the previous record submitted. Conversely, if a DocTypeIndic value of ‘OECD2’ (corrected data) is used, then at least one of the ReportingFI/AccountReport element values should have changed from the previously submitted record. Incorrect name type The value ‘OECD201’ (SMFAliasOrOther) should not be used as a name type attribute. Undocumented accounts reported incorrectly Undocumented accounts should be reported to Inland Revenue by using an individual ResCountryCode value of ‘NZ’ and an AccountNumber element’s UndocumentedAccount attribute of ‘TRUE’. The use of a ResCountryCode code value of ‘NZ’ without a corresponding UndocumentedAccount attribute of ‘TRUE’ (and vice versa) will fail our validations. Undocumented accounts should only be reported when the account holder is an individual. 3 Incorrect TIN If a TIN issued by attribute has a value of ‘NZ’, then the TIN should match to an IRD Number within our system. Nationality provided incorrectly The Nationality element should not be used for CRS reporting. Birth information provided incorrectly The BirthDate is the only sub-element within the BirthInfo element that should be provided for CRS reporting. The earliest BirthDate value that will be accepted is ‘1900-01-01’. Incorrect account number types When an account number type attribute is used, then this should match the account number format provided. For example, when the AccountNumber AcctNumberType attribute is ‘OECD601’ (IBAN), then the AccountNumber value should follow an IBAN format. When the AcctNumberType attribute is ‘OECD603’ (ISIN) then the AccountNumber value should meet the ISIN format. Incorrect or missing controlling person information The controlling person element should only be provided when the account holder is an organisation, with an AcctHolderType of ‘CRS101’ (passive NFE with one or more controlling persons). Incorrect account balance The account balance should always be greater than or equal to zero. If the account is closed and the AccountNumber element’s ClosedAccount attribute is ‘TRUE’, then the account balance should be 0.00. 4
