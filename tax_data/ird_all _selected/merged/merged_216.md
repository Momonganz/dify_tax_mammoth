NEW LEGISLATION Order in Council – Income Tax (Tax Credit) Order 2022 Section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Order The Income Tax (Tax Credit) Order 2022, made on 14 November 2022, increases three Working for Families tax credits, to take effect from 1 April 2023. Key features Three Working for Families Tax Credits have been increased under section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The tax credit amounts per year before and after are provided in the table below. Tax CreditCurrent amountNew amount Family Tax Credit Eldest child$6,642$7,121 Subsequent child$5,412$5,802 Best Start Tax Credit$3,388$3,632 Minimum Family Tax Credit$32,864$34,216 The Family Tax Credit (FTC) amounts for the first and subsequent child in sections MD 3(4)(a) and (b) have been increased for inflation in accordance with section MF 7(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) amount has also been adjusted for inflation under section MF 7(1)(a). The intent of Cabinet policy for the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) is that low income working families remain better off financially in full time work than on a main benefit especially sole parents. As benefit rates are expected to increase from 1 April 2023, the MFTC will also need to be increased to achieve this policy intention. Effective date The new prescribed tax credit amounts will apply for the 2023–24 and later tax years.

LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS COV 22/20: Variation to section 68CB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Variation The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has, under the discretion provided under section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made the following statutory variation: For a general approval application in relation to the R&D tax credit for the 2021-2022 income tax year under section 68CB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, for applicants whose 2021-2022 income year ends on 30 September 2022, the date on or before which that application must be filed with the Commissioner is amended to be 7 February 2023. This variation applies only where the impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the applicant not receiving, prior to 1 August 2022, information from Inland Revenue or Callaghan Innovation that is reasonably necessary to efficiently make their application. Application date This variation applies from 3 November 2022 to 7 February 2023. Dated at Wellington on 3 November 2022. Jonathan Rodgers Group Leader – Tax Counsel Office Inland Revenue Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. The effect of the variation will be to extend from 7 November 2022 to 7 February 2023 the time by which a person with a 30 September balance date, to be entitled to research and development tax credits under s LY 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, must apply for a general approval for the 2021-2022 income year. This is only where COVID-19 has prevented applicants receiving in a timely manner information needed for their general approval applications. Provisions affected 2. Section 68CB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application of variation 3. This variation applies to a person who is seeking the Commissioner’s approval of their research and development activities by filing a general approval application for the 2021-2022 income year under s 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 4. The variation recognises that the impact of COVID-19 means that in some cases Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation have not been able to provide applicants with information and feedback they reasonably need to put together an adequate application in an efficient manner. 5. Customers can choose not to apply the variation to their circumstances. You can make that decision by taking a tax position, such as in a tax return, or by telling us. If you’ve already complied with the existing legislation in taking a tax position, we will consider that you have not chosen to apply the variation.

Note to Determination DEP109: The Commissioner has been asked to consider what depreciation rate should apply for automated ship mooring systems which are used for mooring ships at wharves and port facilities. Automated mooring systems (or AMS) replace traditional mooring lines with an automatic moveable high strength steel arm connected to the wharf with a vacuum pad on the end of it. The pad clamps (or literally sucks itself onto) to the side of the vessel and the arm restrains and dampens the movement of the vessel against the wharf by means of hydraulics. Other AMS designs use electro-magnetic attraction rather than vacuum to fasten the pad to the ship hull. For large vessels, multiple units are employed at each wharf. AMS units are either mounted on top of the wharf or, where areas have large tides that would exceed the vertical movement of the units between high and low tides, the AMS can be “face- mounted” on a ladder-like structure attached to the face of the wharf so that they can be moved vertically in step with the tide. This determination introduces a generic asset class description to cover both the vacuum and electro-magnetic designs for AMS technology.

Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own items of depreciable property of the kind listed in the tables below: This determination will apply 1 April 2021, with application to the 2022 and subsequent income years. Determination Pursuant to section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the general determination will apply to the kind of items of depreciable property listed in the table below by: Adding into the “Transport” asset category, the new asset class, estimated useful life, and general diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: Asset classEstimated useful life (years) DV rate (%)SL rate (%) Automated ship mooring systems (vacuum, magnetic, hydraulic or winch type) 102013.5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, words and terms have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Reference This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist – Network under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Discussion (which does not form part of the determination) Shares in the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) denominated class of the iShares Green Bond Index Fund (“the Fund”) as part of the BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company (“BRFI”) incorporated under the laws of Ireland to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors. BRFI is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. These sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in the NZD denominated class of the Fund (“the NZD Share Class”) each year. The Fund is a sub-fund of BRFI which invests in a portfolio of global fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements the proceeds of which are used to fund projects with direct environmental benefits. The Fund has on issue a number of share classes that provide holders of that class with an interest in a pool of financial instruments held by the Fund. The NZD Share Class is a share class denominated in NZD. Foreign currency hedging arrangements are to be put in place which effectively provide investors with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund. Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the FDR method for interests in the NZD Share class but would apply if the Fund represented a separate foreign company and the NZD Share Class was the only class of share on issue. The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement including any interposed entities or financial arrangements in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. On that basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Share Class of the Fund, I consider that it is appropriate for them to be excluded from using the FDR method. Scope of determination This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:   This non-resident issuer: –is incorporated in Ireland and issues multiple classes of shares; and –is known at the date of this determination as BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company; and –is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 6 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS   The attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share, issued in the iShares Green Bond Index Fund, a sub-fund of BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company, that provides exposure solely to a portfolio predominantly of fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements   The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non- resident for the purpose of eliminating to the extent possible any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors on a highly effective basis. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires- “Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; “Financial arrangement” means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007; “Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; “Non-resident” means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007; “The Fund” means the iShares Green Bond Index Fund, a sub-fund of BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company. Determination An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest. Application Date This determination applies for the 2022-2023 income year and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination applies for the income year.

Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (Act) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CX 55 and Part C of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is that ANZBGL shareholders will exchange their ANZBGL ordinary shares for shares in a non-operating holding company (NewANZ), as part of a reorganisation of ANZBGL and its subsidiaries (NOHC Reorganisation). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. ANZBGL 1. ANZBGL is: (a) tax resident only in Australia; and (b) required to maintain a franking account for Australian income tax purposes. 2. ANZBGL’s ordinary shares are: (a) on the official list of ASX Limited; and (b) not “fixed-rate shares” as defined in s YA 1, as the dividends payable on the ordinary shares are not restricted to dividends payable at a rate that is a specific percentage or is determined by reference to an external index or rate. 3.

The Ruling applies to ANZBGL shareholders who are issued NewANZ shares under the Arrangement, where those shareholders: (a) are not subject to the following sections of the Act in relation to the Arrangement (referred to in this Ruling as ANZBGL Capital Shareholders): i) s CB 1, because they do not derive the shares from a business or, if they do derive the shares from a business, they receive them on capital account; ii) s CB 2, because they do not hold their ANZBGL shares as trading stock; iii) s CB 4, because they did not acquire their ANZBGL shares for the purpose of disposal; iv) s CB 5, because they are not in the business of dealing in shares; v) s CV 1, because they are not a company that for that income year is part of a wholly-owned group of companies and had the group of companies been a single company, the shares derived by the company would have been income of that single company under s CB 1, CB 2, CB 4 or CB 5; and vi) s CV 2 in relation to the Arrangement because they are not a company that is part of a consolidated group, when the shares derived by the company would be income of the group if the group were one company under s CB 1, CB 2, CB 4 or CB 5; and (b) are not ANZBGL Capital Shareholders, but instead they (referred to in this Ruling as ANZBGL PIE Shareholders): i) are a “portfolio investment entity” other than a “life fund PIE” as defined in s YA 1; and ii) are not assured, under an arrangement with another person, of having a gain on the disposal. 5. For the avoidance of doubt, this Ruling does not apply to ANZBGL group employees: (a) who are participants in any of the ANZBGL employee share schemes; and (b) where their shares in the relevant employee share scheme are not held on bare trust.

The following diagram summarises the post-reorganisation position. NewANZ Bank Hold CoService CoNon-Bank Hold Co Ex-ANZBGL Shareholders ANZBGL Effect of NOHC Reorganisation on employee share schemes 9. Consistent with the Scheme of Arrangement, an Employee who holds a share or option or a right to receive a share or option in ANZBGL under or from the Exempt Share Scheme, ESAP or ESOP shall receive a share or option or right to receive a share or option in NewANZ under the Exempt Share Scheme, ESAP or ESOP on a one-for-one basis (as applicable) such that they continue to hold an equivalent interest in the parent company of the ANZ Group (NewANZ). Exempt Share Scheme 10. In respect of the Exempt Share Scheme: (a) The shares were sold to the Employees for 1 cent each (but held by the Trustee until the end of the period of restriction). ANZBGL made no loans to Employees to subscribe for the shares. (b) The period of restriction (preventing the Employees from dealing in the shares allocated to them) in relation to the last allocation of shares to occur under the Exempt Share Scheme ceases to apply on 2 December 2022 (Final Vesting Date). (c) On or after the Final Vesting Date: i) the Employees have full beneficial ownership of the shares; ii) the Trustee holds the shares as a bare trustee for the Employees; iii) Employees have the option under clause 6.1 of the ESAP Schedule to have the Trustee transfer or purchase the shares. If an Employee chooses neither option, the Trustee continues to hold the shares until the relevant Employee subsequently elects an option. Those rights Employees have in relation to such shares are subject to general trading restrictions (eg, securities law restrictions preventing insiders from selling shares during designated periods). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 19 BINDING RULINGS (d) Shares the Trustee legally transfers to an Employee under the Exempt Share Scheme before the Implementation Date will be subject to the Scheme of Arrangement. Shareholders will exchange their ANZBGL shares for NewANZ shares on a one-for-one basis. (e) For shares the Trustee legally holds for Employees on the Implementation Date (pending an election to be made by an Employee), the ANZBGL board will exercise its discretion to treat those shares the Trustee holds in the same way as other ANZBGL shares in the NOHC Reorganisation. That is, the shares the Trustee holds will be subject to the Scheme of Arrangement, and the Trustee will exchange its ANZBGL shares with NewANZ shares on a one-for-one basis. (f) Up to and at the time of the Final Vesting Date, the Exempt Share Scheme will meet the criteria under which it obtained the Commissioner’s approval under the now repealed s DC 12. ESAP 11. In respect of the ESAP: (a) The ANZBGL board will exercise its discretion to treat any shares the Trustee holds in the same way as other ANZBGL shares in the NOHC Reorganisation. That is, the shares the Trustee holds will be subject to the Scheme of Arrangement, and the Trustee will exchange its ANZBGL shares with NewANZ shares on a one-for-one basis. (b) The ESAP Rules will be amended to: i) include an express provision on the treatment of restricted shares if an NOHC Reorganisation occurs; and ii) expand the definition of ‘ANZ’ in the ESAP Rules to include NewANZ (with effect from the Implementation Date) to allow the shares provided to Employees under the ESAP to be shares in NewANZ. (c) NewANZ will assume all material responsibilities for the management of the ESAP. 12. The proposed amendments to the ESAP Rules provided to Inland Revenue on 30 June 2022 include the following (amendments in red): 2.1 Definitions In these Rules: ANZ means Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522 and, with effect from the Implementation Date, includes \[ANZ NOHC\]: \[ANZ NOHC\] means \[Insert name and ACN\]: Implementation Date means the implementation date under a scheme of arrangement whereby \[ANZ NOHC\] (a non-operating holding company) becomes the ultimate holding company of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522 (expected to be on or around 1 January 2023): Share means a fully paid share in the capital of ANZ 12.4 Acquiring Company If \[ANZ NOHC\] (Acquiring Company) obtains control of ANZ as a result of a scheme of arrangement between ANZ and its shareholders: Shares acquired under the Plan will be affected in the same way as other Shares; and (f) (b) ANZ and the Acquiring Company may agree that the resulting shares in the Acquiring Company will continue to be governed under the Plan and on the same terms as the Shares (as reasonably assessed by ANZ and \[ANZ NOHC\]). ESOP 13. In respect of the ESOP: (a) The options or rights to options will not be subject to the Scheme of Arrangement in the way described above. (b) Instead, the ANZBGL board will exercise its discretion to amend the ESOP Rules to effectively replace ANZBGL options or rights to options with NewANZ options or rights to options, on the same terms and conditions (‘a rollover’). Legally, the ANZBGL board will, under the (to be) amended ESOP Rules, cancel all existing options or rights to options in ANZBGL and grant new options or rights to options in NewANZ. (c) The ESOP Rules will be amended to include: i) NewANZ in the expanded definition of ‘ANZ’ (with effect from the Implementation Date); and ii) a ‘replacement grant’ provision that allows NewANZ to issue new options or rights to options in NewANZ. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 20 BINDING RULINGS 14. The proposed amendments to the ESOP Rules provided to Inland Revenue on 30 June 2022 include the following (amendments in red): 5.9 Acquisition of shares in Acquiring Company If a company (Acquiring Company) obtains control of ANZ as a result of: (a) a takeover bid; (b) a scheme of arrangement between ANZ and its shareholders, and both ANZ and the Acquiring Company agree, ANZ may: (c) on the exercise of options, instead of providing Shares, provide shares of the Acquiring Company or its parent to the same value (as reasonably assessed by ANZ) as the Shares in ANZ that would have been issued; or (c) (d) if the Acquiring Company is \[ANZ NOHC\], replace the Options with options over shares in the Acquiring Company to the same value and on the same terms (as reasonably assessed by ANZ) as the Options, and such options will continue to be governed under the Plan. Trust Deed 15. The Trust Deed, which is a document relevant to all three employee share schemes, will be subject to a range of amendments, including that the employee share schemes will operate in relation to NewANZ shares. 16. The proposed amendments to the Trust Deed provided to Inland Revenue on 10 October 2022 include the following amendments in red: 2 ANZ Group Holdings Limited ACN 659 510 791 of 833 Collins Street, Melbourne (ANZ) ...

Howard Davis Group Leader, Tax Counsel Office Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 22 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner's view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 22/06: Loss carry-forward – continuity of business activities This interpretation statement provides guidance on how the main aspects of the business continuity test in s IB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply. The business continuity test may enable a company to carry forward tax losses despite a breach in ownership continuity if certain requirements are satisfied. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. This interpretation statement provides guidance on how the main aspects of the business continuity test in s IB 3 apply. The key points discussed in the Interpretation Statement are summarised as follows: The main rule in s IB 3 provides that a tax loss may be carried forward despite an ownership continuity breach if no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company occurs during the business continuity period, other than a permitted major change (s IB 3(2)(c)). Section IB 3 sets out various other criteria that must also be satisfied. Further, targeted anti-avoidance rules in ss GB 3BAB and GB 3BAC can negate the benefit of a tax loss carried forward under s IB 3 in prescribed circumstances. An ownership continuity breach for a company occurs where there is a breach in the requirements for continuity of ownership set out in s IA 5, that, if met, enable tax losses of the company to be carried forward (s IB 2). The business continuity period is typically the period starting immediately before the ownership continuity breach and ending on the earlier of: –the last day of the income year in which the tax loss component in question is used; and –the last day of the income year in which the fifth anniversary of the ownership continuity breach falls. However, broadly, for a company where 50% or more of its tax losses eligible for carry-forward arose from bad debt deductions, the business continuity period will end on the last day of the income year in which the tax loss component in question is used. In other words, the five-year cap on the test will not apply (s IB 4). Where a major change (other than a permitted major change) or a cessation occurs part-way through an income year, the tax loss component in question may be carried forward and set off against income arising up to the time of the major change or cessation respectively if the company provides the Commissioner with adequate financial statements under s IP 6 calculating the company’s income for that part of the income year (s IP 3B). The main rule in s IB 3(2)(c) is concerned with the nature of the company’s business activities. The Commissioner considers “business activities” means “actions taken in pursuit of one or more businesses that may be carried on by the company for income tax purposes” and that “nature” means “the basic or inherent features, qualities, or character of a person or thing”, so the test is concerned with the basic or inherent features, qualities, or character of the company’s business activities. The nature of a company’s business activities should be described by reference to: –its core business processes (eg, farming, manufacturing, development, construction, distribution, retailing, services); –the type (ie, category) of products or services produced or provided; –significant assets utilised (eg, premises, plant and machinery, livestock, intellectual property, goodwill); –where relevant, significant suppliers or other inputs (eg, key staff); Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 23 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS –scale (eg, approximate turnover or size); and –the main markets supplied to (eg, retail/wholesale, local/national/specific territories). Determining whether there has been a major change in the nature of a company’s business activities requires consideration of whether there has been a change, and, if so, whether the change is major. Overall, the relevant factors to be taken into account and their weight will depend on the particular facts in question. The change will be major if it is of greater importance when comparing the nature of the company’s business activities before and after the ownership continuity breach. The extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar over the continuity period is a factor to be taken into account in determining whether a major change has occurred (s IB 3(4)). The relevant assets of a company will usually be those recorded in its statement of financial position. However, depending on the particular facts, other assets may also be taken into account, such as internally generated goodwill, brands, customer lists, and early-stage intangibles, but not people, generic business processes, or generic know-how. Any assets the company owns but does not use in deriving its assessable income over the business continuity period must be excluded from relevant assets. Certain assets will be more relevant to the question of whether or not there has been a major change than other assets. Section IB 3(4) requires an assessment of the extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar over the business continuity period. The assets of a company may need to be replaced due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or to keep up with new improvements. It is considered that replacement assets that are significantly smaller or larger in size would not be “similar” in character to existing assets for the purposes of s IB 3(4) unless the overall capacity of the assets (in terms of functionality) was the same or similar. Similarly, significantly fewer or more assets of the same type as existing assets would not be “similar” in character to existing assets unless the overall capacity of the assets (in terms of functionality) was the same or similar. Section IB 3(4) does not limit the factors that may be taken into account. Other factors that may be relevant include changes in: –business processes; –suppliers or other inputs; –scale; –the markets supplied to; and –the type of product or service produced or provided. New Zealand companies that form part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after an ownership breach occurs (for each of the companies) are treated as a single company for the purposes of the business continuity test (and its associated avoidance provisions) (s IB 5). Depending on the circumstances, where a company (including a deemed single company under s IB 5) produces or provides more than one type of product or service, a significant change in the relativities of those products or services could give rise to a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities. If there has been a major change in the business activities carried on by a company, the business continuity test may still be satisfied if the major change is a permitted major change (s IB 3(5)). There are four permitted major changes, broadly, changes: –made to increase the efficiency of a business activity (s IB 3(5)(a)); –made to keep up to date with advances in technology relating to a business activity (s IB 3(5)(b)); –caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity (s IB 3(5)(c)); and –caused by a change in the type of products or services produced or provided (s IB 3(5)(d)). Depending on the facts, it may be easier to first consider whether a change in the nature of the business activities carried on by a company is a permitted major change (on the assumption that the change is major). If the change falls within one or more of the permitted major changes, it will be unnecessary to determine whether the change is a major change. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 24 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Changes caused by a change in the type of products or services a company produces or provides will be a permitted major change under s IB 3(5)(d) in two cases: –if the change involves starting to produce or provide a product or service using the same, or mainly the same, assets as a product or service that the company produced or provided immediately before the start of the continuity period; or –if the change involves starting to produce or provide a product or service that is otherwise closely connected with a product or service that the company produced or provided immediately before the start of the continuity period. For the purposes of this permitted major change, assets used to produce or provide a product or service do not include land other than buildings and fixtures (s IB 3(7)). The first limb of s IB 3(5)(d) can be satisfied where the “same, or mainly the same” assets are used to produce or provide the new type of product or service. In some instances it may be helpful to measure assets for this purpose. To assist with this enquiry, the Commissioner will accept that the “mainly the same” asset requirement is satisfied where at least 75% of existing key assets are used to produce or provide the new type of product or service. This is a ‘safe harbour’ figure. It does not mean that in certain contexts percentages lower than this will necessarily fail the requirement. For the purposes of the second limb of s IB 3(5)(d), the connection between the new product or service and existing products or services needs to be strong. Examples could include products or services: –based on the same underlying technology; –that significantly enhance the utility or enjoyment of existing products or services; or –that are commonly sold together with existing products or services in order to enhance the sales of those products or services. A tax loss cannot be carried forward if before the beginning of the business continuity period the business activities carried on by the company have ceased and have not been revived (s IB 3(3)(a)), or if the company ceases to carry on business activities during the business continuity period (s IB 3(2)(b)). For the purposes of ss IB 3(3)(a) and IB 3(2)(b), a temporary cessation will not constitute a cessation of business activities. In contrast, cessation with the possibility of recommencement will constitute a cessation. Introduction 2. Companies can carry forward unused tax losses to the next tax year under subpart IA only if they satisfy certain ownership continuity requirements. However, from the 2020/21 income year, companies that do not meet those requirements may still be able to carry forward unused tax losses under a new test in subpart IB (the business continuity test). 3. The business continuity test broadly applies where no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company (other than a permitted major change) occurs during the relevant business continuity period, subject to various conditions. 4. This statement sets out how the Commissioner will interpret the main aspects of the business continuity test. Business continuity test What is the purpose of the test? 5. The purpose of subpart IB (which includes the business continuity test) and its associated anti-avoidance measures is set out in s IB 1: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 25 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IB 1 Purpose The purpose of this subpart and sections GB 3BA to GB 3BAC (which relate to arrangements involving tax losses) is— (a) to enable companies to carry forward tax loss components in loss balances despite not meeting the requirements for continuity of ownership of section IA 5 (Restrictions on companies’ loss balances carried forward: continuity of ownership), in order to reduce impediments to— (i) innovation and economic growth: (ii) corporate reorganisations: (iii) changes in the direct or indirect ownership of companies: (iv) companies accessing new sources of share capital: (v) companies adapting their business activities in order to grow or be resilient; but (b) not to encourage tax avoidance arrangements involving the acquisition of ownership interests in companies. What is the main rule? 6. The main rule of the business continuity test is set out in s IB 3(2)(c): IB 3 When tax loss components of companies carried forward despite ownership continuity breach ... Tax loss components for earlier income years carried forward (2) Despite the ownership continuity breach, a tax loss component arising in an earlier income year is carried forward to a tax year in a loss balance under section IA 3(4) (Using tax losses in tax year) if— ... (c) no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company occurs during the business continuity period, other than 1 or more major changes that are permitted under subsection (5); and ... 7. The main rule is that a tax loss may be carried forward despite an ownership continuity breach if no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company occurs during the business continuity period, other than a permitted major change. 8. The aspects of the main rule discussed below are: the meaning of “ownership continuity breach” (from \[15\]); the meaning of “business continuity period” (from \[17\]); how to determine the nature of a company’s business activities (from \[23\]); how to determine whether there has been a major change in the nature of a company’s business activities (from \[35\]); how the rule applies to groups of companies (from \[69\]); and permitted major changes (from \[75\]). What are the other requirements? 9. In addition to the main rule, several other requirements must be satisfied before a tax loss can be carried forward under s IB 3. These requirements are that: an ownership continuity breach must have occurred (during the 2020/21 income year or later) (s IB 3(1) and s 99(2) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021) (see Example 1); Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 26 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 1 – Early balance date Hives Honey Ltd carries on a beekeeping business and has a 31 December balance date. The company incurs losses in its 2019/20 income year. On 1 February 2020, the company has an ownership continuity breach, but does not change the nature of its business activities. The company can rely on the business continuity test to carry forward its losses as the ownership continuity breach occurred in its 2020/21 income year. This is despite the breach occurring prior to the commencement date of the provision enacting subpart IB on 1 April 2020. the tax loss being carried forward must have arisen in the 2013/14 income year or later (s IB 3(2)(a)); the company does not cease to carry on business activities during the business continuity period (s IB 3(2)(b)); the company did not cease to carry on business activities before the beginning of the business continuity period or, if it did, the business activities were revived before the beginning of the business continuity period (s IB 3(3)(a)); the company has not had another ownership continuity breach from (and including) the later of the income year in which the tax loss arose and the 2020/21 income year and in relation to which either the cessation rule in s IB 3(2)(b) or the major change rule in s IB 3(2)(c) was not satisfied (s IB 3(3)(b)) (see Example 2); Example 2 – Intervening ownership continuity breach Flip Flop Ltd incurs $3.5m of losses in the 2020/21 income year from its sandal manufacturing business. The following income year (2021/22), the company has an ownership continuity breach and changes the nature of its business activities to IT consultancy services. The change is a major change that is not a permitted major change. Later that year, the company has a further ownership continuity breach and returns to its roots manufacturing sandals. The new owners cannot rely on the business continuity test to carry forward the tax losses from the 2020/21 income year past the second ownership continuity breach because there was an intervening ownership continuity breach in relation to which the major change rule in s IB 3(2) (c) was not satisfied. for tax losses arising before the 2020/21 income year, those losses could be carried forward to the 2020/21 tax year without needing to rely on subpart IB (s IB 3(3)(c)) (see Example 3); and Example 3 – Pre-2020/21 ownership continuity breach Change Services Ltd, a firm of change consultants, incurred $400,000 of tax losses in the 2017/18 income year, and had an ownership continuity breach in the 2019/20 income year. In the 2021/22 income year there is a further ownership continuity breach. The nature of the company’s business activities have remained the same throughout. The new owners cannot rely on the business continuity test to carry forward the tax losses arising prior to the ownership continuity breach in the 2019/20 income year because those losses could not be carried forward to the 2020/21 tax year without relying on subpart IB. the anti-avoidance rule in s GB 3BA does not apply (s IB 3(6)). 10. In addition, s IB 3 does not apply to certain tax losses of companies that are mineral miners (see s IB 3(5B)). 11. Finally, targeted anti-avoidance rules in ss GB 3BAB and GB 3BAC can negate the benefit of a tax loss carried forward under s IB 3 in prescribed circumstances. 12. The targeted anti-avoidance rules can potentially apply where there is an arrangement under which: a company pre-emptively changes the nature of its business activities in the 2 years prior to an ownership continuity breach in order to enable the business continuity test to be satisfied after the breach (s GB 3BA); a company that carries forward losses under the business continuity test derives income that would otherwise have been derived by an associated person (such as another group company) (s GB 3BAB); or an associated person of the company that carries forward losses under the business continuity test (such as another group company) incurs expenditure or loss that would otherwise have been incurred by the loss company (s GB 3BAC). 13. Except for the cessation rules in s IB 3(2)(b) and 3(3)(a) (which are discussed from \[99\]), these other requirements and targeted anti-avoidance rules are not discussed in this interpretation statement. 14. Appendix One contains a flow chart that can help to determine whether a tax loss component of a company can be carried forward from an income year under s IB 3 despite an ownership continuity breach. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 27 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS What is an ownership continuity breach? 15. An ownership continuity breach is defined in s IB 2: IB 2 Meaning of ownership continuity breach In this subpart, an ownership continuity breach, for a company, means a breach of the requirements for continuity of ownership of section IA 5 (Restrictions on companies’ loss balances carried forward: continuity of ownership) that, if met, enable a tax loss component of the company to be carried forward in a loss balance 16. For the purposes of the business continuity test, an ownership continuity breach for a company will occur if there has been a breach of the requirements for continuity of ownership set out in s IA 5, that, if met, enable tax losses of the company to be carried forward. Under s IA 5, tax losses can broadly be carried forward provided a group of persons holds at least 49% of the voting interests in a company over the relevant continuity period. The interpretation and application of s IA 5 is outside the scope of this item. What is the business continuity period? 17. The business continuity period is defined in s IB 4: IB 4 Business continuity period Period (1) The period referred to in section IB 3(2)(b), for an ownership continuity breach and a tax loss component of a company, is the period beginning immediately before the ownership continuity breach occurs and ending on,— (a) for a company for which the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (2) is 0.50 or greater, the last day of the income year that corresponds to the tax year in which the company uses the tax loss component; or (b) in any other case, the earlier of— (i) the last day of the income year that corresponds to the tax year in which the company uses the tax loss component; and (ii) the last day of the income year in which the fifth anniversary of the ownership continuity breach falls. Formula (2) The formula is— (bad debt deductions – bad debt repayment income) ÷ (total deductions – bad debt repayment income). Definition of items in formula (3) In the formula,— (a) bad debt deductions is the total amount of deductions that the company has been allowed under section DB 31(3) (Bad debts) for income years between the 2013–14 income year and the income year corresponding to the tax year immediately preceding the ownership continuity breach, both income years inclusive, in which a tax loss component included in the company’s tax loss for that tax year arose: (b) bad debt repayment income is the total amount of income that the company has under section CG 3 (Bad debt repayment)— (i) for income years between the earliest and the latest of the income years described in paragraph (a), both income years inclusive; and (ii) that relates to deductions that the company has been allowed under section DB 31(3): (c) total deductions is the total amount of deductions that the company has been allowed for the income years described in paragraph (a). 18. In summary, the business continuity period is typically the period starting immediately before the ownership continuity breach and ending on the earlier of the last day of the income year in which the: tax loss component in question is used; or fifth anniversary of the ownership continuity breach falls. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 28 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 19. However, broadly, for a company where 50% or more of its tax losses eligible for carry-forward arose from bad debt deductions, the business continuity period will end on the last day of the income year in which the tax loss component in question is used. In other words, the five-year cap on the test will not apply. 20. For a tax loss component to be carried forward, no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company (other than a permitted major change) must occur during the business continuity period (s IB 3(2)(c)). This requires a comparison between the business activities the company carried on immediately before the ownership continuity breach and the business activities the company carries on at all times thereafter until the last day of the income year in which the company uses the tax loss component in question (subject to the five-year cap on the test, if applicable). Further, the company must not cease to carry on business activities during the business continuity period (s IB 3(2)(b)). 21. Where a major change (other than a permitted major change) or a cessation occurs part-way through an income year, the tax loss component in question may be carried forward and set off against income arising up to the time of the major change or cessation respectively if the company provides the Commissioner with adequate financial statements under s IP 6 calculating the company’s income for that part of the income year (s IP 3B). 22. Finally, because the test in s IB 3(2)(c) is concerned only with the tax loss component to be carried forward, losses previously carried forward under the test and used in an earlier income year are not jeopardised by a subsequent major change in the nature of the business activities the company carries on. This will be the case even if the tax return for the earlier income year has not been filed by the date of the major change (see Example 4). Example 4 – Earlier used losses and part year losses Photo Developments Ltd has a standard balance date (31 March) and has an ownership continuity breach in the 2020/21 income year. The company relies on the business continuity test to carry forward $1m of tax losses from prior to the breach and subtracts $800,000 of those losses from income arising in the 2021/22 income year. On 1 July 2022, the company makes a major change in the nature of its business activities that is not a permitted major change, and accordingly fails the business continuity test. The $800,000 of losses carried forward under the test and used in the 2021/22 income year are not affected by the subsequent major change. The company prepares financial statements calculating its income for the part of the 2022/23 income year prior to the major change, which enables it to offset a further $50,000 of the losses. The major change prevents the remaining $150,000 of losses from being carried forward beyond 1 July 2022. What is the nature of a company’s business activities? 23. “Business activities” is not a defined term. “Business” is defined in s YA 1 as including any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit. The Court of Appeal interpreted the term in Grieve v CIR \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA) as requiring a two- fold inquiry: an inquiry as to the nature of the activities carried on and an inquiry as to the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. 24. “Activity” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, New York, Oxford University Press) as “an action taken in pursuit of an objective”. 25. It follows that “business activities” are any action taken in pursuit of one or more businesses that the company may carry on for income tax purposes. 26. This interpretation is consistent with the commentary to the Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the Commentary), which refers to the particular actions carried out by the business to generate income and the processes or methods by which they are carried out. 27. The Commentary explains that the term “business activities” was used to ensure that the business continuity test is not applied granularly on a business-by-business basis. In the Commissioner’s view, this means that where a company carries on more than one business the intention is that the continuity of each business does not have to be considered separately; rather, it is the continuity of the combined business activities that is relevant. 28. The main rule is concerned with the “nature” of the company’s business activities. “Nature” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as “the basic or inherent features, qualities, or character of a person or thing”, so the rule is concerned with the basic or inherent features, qualities, or character of the company’s business activities. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 29 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 29. An important issue is determining the relevant features, qualities or character of a company’s business activities for this purpose. In interpreting any provision, regard must be had to the text of the provision in the light of its purpose and its context: s 10 of the Legislation Act 2019. 30. By way of context, s IB 3 indicates that particular features of a company’s business activities are relevant to determining whether or not the company has had a major change in the nature of its activities: Section IB 3(4) requires the extent to which the assets used in deriving a company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar to be taken into account (see further from \[46\]). Section IB 3(5) indicates various other factors that may also be relevant, including business processes, suppliers, other inputs, scale, the markets supplied to and the type of product or service produced or provided (see further from \[66\]). It follows that these features will inform the nature of a company’s business activities. 31. Differing levels of granularity can be used to describe the above features, and, therefore, the nature of a company’s business activities. The specified purposes of the business continuity test, including promoting innovation, economic growth and resilience, suggest a less granular approach. However, another purpose is not to encourage tax avoidance arrangements involving share acquisitions (that is, loss trading), so the descriptions should not be so broad as to permit such arrangements. 32. Consistent with this, it is considered that the nature of a company’s business activities should be described by reference to: its core business processes (eg, farming, manufacturing, development, construction, distribution, retailing, services); the type (ie, category) of products or services produced or provided; significant assets utilised (eg, premises, plant and machinery, livestock, intellectual property, goodwill); where relevant, significant suppliers or other inputs (eg, key staff); scale (eg, approximate turnover or size); and the main markets supplied to (eg, retail/wholesale, local/national/specific territories). 33. Where a company undertakes more than one core business process, each process should be referred to (for example, manufacturing and distribution), rather than adopting a global descriptor. 34. Similarly, where a company produces or provides more than one type of product or service, each type of product or service and their approximate relativities should generally be referred to. This will be particularly relevant to groups of companies that are treated as a single company under s IB 5 (see below from \[69\]). For example, the nature of the business activities of a group of companies that includes car dealerships and garages for servicing cars should refer to both car retailing and automotive servicing and their approximate relativities. Despite this, in some contexts, a broader description of products or services may be appropriate. For example, a large retailer that sells a wide range of products including homewares, electrical goods, sports equipment, clothing and toys could be more broadly described as a retailer of consumer goods. What is a major change in the nature of those activities? 35. The definition of “change” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary includes “an instance of becoming different”. “Major” is defined as “important, serious, or significant.  greater or more important; main”. 36. The meaning of “major change” was considered in a similar context by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Willis (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) v Peeters Picture Frames Ltd \[1983\] STC 453. This case concerned s 483 of the UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, which prevented the carry-forward of tax losses if there was both a change in ownership of a company and a “major change in the nature or conduct of a trade carried on by the company”. The issue was whether the activities of the taxpayer satisfied a definition of that phrase in s 483(3) that included (among other things) a “major change in customers, outlets or markets of the trade”. 37. Gibson LJ said (at 460): In construing the phrase ”major change in the conduct of the trade”, I would deal with it in two parts. Whether there has been a change in the conduct of the trade clearly imports a qualitative test, because one is looking for a different type of conduct. Where the difference in conduct is claimed to be a difference in the manner of the disposal of the company’s goods, it is clearly not sufficient to satisfy the definition if there is merely a change in the number or identity of customers or outlets, or if the proportion of goods distributed through each is changed. But in judging whether the change is major, a different criterion should be applied. The obvious contrast is between changes Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 30 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS which are major and those which are minor; that is to say, it is a question of degree, or a quantitative matter. I would ask the question: is the change of greater or lesser importance when considering the company’s method of trading? The Special Commissioners posed the question whether there had been a significant change. Insofar as there may be changes of major or minor significance, they were perhaps putting the question too favourably to the Crown; though I think they were probably using the word ‘significant’ as meaning of greater than little significance. \[emphasis added\] 38. In summary, Gibson LJ approached the “major change” test in two parts: first considering qualitatively whether there had been a change, and then considering as a question of degree whether the change was major, with “major” meaning “of greater ... importance”. Lowry LCJ, in a separate judgement, similarly said that the primary meaning of “major” was “greater” as in the “major part” (at 462). 39. Although foreign case law is not binding in New Zealand, it is likely that New Zealand courts would adopt a similar approach given the common subject-matter. However, one distinction is that the nature of a company’s business activities for the purposes of the business continuity test (see above from \[23\]) includes features that can be measured quantitatively (such as scale and assets), so the first step of the major change test could have both qualitative and quantitative elements. 40. This approach to the “major change” test is also consistent with the Commentary, which states that not every change will be a major change, and that whether a change is a major change will generally be a question of the significance of the change in the context of the operations of the entire company. 41. Continuity of assets is a factor that must be taken into account in determining whether a major change in the nature of the business activities of the company has occurred (s IB 3(4); and see from \[46\]). But the legislation does not otherwise limit or specify the factors that may be taken into account. The Commentary states that the test is not intended to give special weight to any particular factor. Other potentially relevant factors are discussed from \[66\]. 42. In practice, the nature of a company’s business activities immediately prior to the ownership continuity breach should first be compared to the nature of its activities at all relevant times following the breach to determine whether there has been a change. This exercise should take into account continuity of assets and any other relevant factors, assessing changes at the appropriate level of granularity (as discussed from \[31\]). 43. If there has been a change, it is then necessary to determine whether that change is a major change. A change will be major if it is of greater importance when comparing the nature of the company’s business activities before and after the ownership continuity breach. This will be a question of fact and degree. 44. Where a company produces or provides more than one type of product or service, a significant change in the relativities of those products or services could give rise to a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities, depending on the relevant factors. 45. Overall, the relevant factors to be taken into account and their weight will depend on the particular circumstances. Assets factor 46. Section IB 3(4) provides: IB 3 When tax loss components of companies carried forward despite ownership continuity breach ... Major change: factor that must be taken into account (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), without limiting the factors that may be taken into account in determining whether a major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company has occurred during the business continuity period, the extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar over the business continuity period must be taken into account ... 47. The extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar over the continuity period is a factor to be taken into account in determining whether a major change has occurred. 48. “Assets” are not defined in the Act for the purposes of s IB 3(4). “Asset” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as including both “a useful or valuable thing or person” and “property owned by a company and regarded as having value and being available to meet its commitments”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 31 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 49. For accounting purposes, an “asset” is broadly defined as a right that is controlled by the entity and that has the potential to produce economic benefits. 1 However, certain rights do not satisfy the accounting definition, including: the economic benefit of employee services; internally generated goodwill and brands and customer lists; and internally generated intangible assets that do not satisfy recognition criteria (broadly, research and early development stage intangibles). 2 50. In interpreting the meaning of “assets” in s IB 3(5), regard must be had to the text of the provision in the light of its purpose and its context: s 10 of the Legislation 2019. As discussed earlier, the purposes of subpart IB include promoting innovation, growth, and resilience, but not encouraging tax avoidance arrangements (that is, loss trading). 51. An interpretation of “assets” strictly based on accounting definitions and standards may not be consistent with the purposes of promoting innovation, growth and resilience. This is because assets that are not recognised in a company’s accounts could be important to a company in achieving those purposes. Conversely, a very broad interpretation of assets that includes people and items such as generic business processes or generic know-how could encourage loss trading. This is because people with transferable skills can easily be engaged in different business activities, and, similarly, generic business processes and know-how can easily be applied to different business activities. 52. Practically, the Commissioner considers that the assets of a company will usually be those recorded in its statement of financial position. However, depending on the particular facts, other assets may also be taken into account, such as internally generated goodwill, brands, customer lists and early-stage intangibles, but not people, generic business processes, or generic know-how. Depending on the context, changes in the people involved in a business may be relevant under other factors (see at \[67\]). 53. A further requirement of s IB 3(4) is that the assets to be taken into account are those that are used in deriving the company’s assessable income over the business continuity period. These assets will typically be all current and non- current assets of a company, including trading stock, working capital, and passive investments. However, any assets of a company that are not used in deriving assessable income over the business continuity period must be excluded from the determination. For example, a company may own bare land for the purpose of future expansion that is not currently being used or may own plant or machinery that has been mothballed but not disposed of. 54. Certain assets will be more relevant to the question of whether there has been a major change than other assets. For example, key business assets such as manufacturing plant, specialised equipment, or intellectual property will be important, whereas generic office premises, generic office equipment, and working capital will typically be of little relevance. 55. Changes in key assets can be assessed by comparing new assets to assets that have remained the same or similar over the business continuity period. This comparison could be based on the: numbers of different types of assets; value of different types of assets; or area or floorspace occupied by different types of assets. 56. The most appropriate way of assessing changes in assets will depend on the context. Similarly, the most appropriate way of valuing assets for this purpose will depend on the context. For example, assessing changes by reference to the book value of assets may not be determinative where assets have been significantly depreciated in a company’s accounts. In such cases, historic cost, replacement value or market value may be more appropriate depending on the context. 57. In some instances it may be helpful (or necessary) to value an asset for the purposes of applying the test. For example, a key asset may not be recognised in a company’s financial statements (see at \[52\]), or it may otherwise be appropriate to use the market value of a key asset in a particular context. In such cases, a commercially orthodox valuation methodology should be used. 1 See XRB, New Zealand Equivalent to the IASB Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (issued May 2018 and incorporating amendments to 31 January 2019, Wellington, External Reporting Board) (2018 NZ Conceptual Framework), from \[4.3\]. 2 See 2018 NZ Conceptual Framework at \[4.8\] and XRB, New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 Intangible Assets (issued November 2004 and incorporating amendments to 31 January 2021, Wellington, External Reporting Board) (NZ IAS 38), at \[48\], \[54\], \[57\] and \[63\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 32 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Same or similar assets 58. Section IB 3(4) requires an assessment of the extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar over the business continuity period. 59. The reference to “remained” requires a comparison between the assets the company used immediately before the ownership continuity breach and the assets the company used over the rest of the business continuity period. 60. “Similar” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary includes “of the same kind in appearance, character, or quantity, without being identical.” 61. The Commentary states that some categories of asset require replacement and that the reference to same or similar assets is to clarify that the “normal replacement of specific assets” should not be part of the assessment of whether a major change has occurred. 62. The references to “replacement” in the Commentary suggest that “similar” in this context requires assets of the same kind in character (ie, function). The assets of a company may need to be replaced due to wear and tear, obsolescence or to keep up with new improvements. Provided the replacement assets are of the same kind in character (ie, they perform the same function) as the assets they are replacing without being identical, this aspect of the definition will be satisfied. 63. The reference to “normal replacement of specific assets” in the Commentary also suggests that similarity in size and number is relevant. The assets of a company may need to be replaced, reduced or supplemented when its business activities are changing in scale. For example, existing assets may need to be replaced with smaller or larger assets, or reduced or increased in number. It is considered that replacement assets that are significantly smaller or larger in size would not be “similar” in character to existing assets for the purposes of s IB 3(4) unless the overall capacity of the assets (in terms of functionality) was the same or similar. Similarly, significantly fewer or more assets of the same type as existing assets would not be “similar” in character to existing assets unless the overall capacity of the assets (in terms of functionality) was the same or similar. 64. This interpretation is supported by the permitted major change for increases in scale (see from \[86\]), which implies that a significant change in the size or number of existing assets is a factor that could give rise to a major change. Further, allowing significant decreases in scale under the “same or similar” rule in s IB 3(4) would be inconsistent with the fact that only increases in scale are permitted major changes. 65. If a company acquires significantly larger assets or significantly more assets of the same type as existing assets, the permitted major change relating to increases in scale may be relevant (see Example 5). Example 5 – Same or similar assets Single Track Cycles Ltd operates a mountain bike retailing and repair business from its own premises. The company has tax losses carried forward from recent years, and recently had an ownership continuity breach when a key employee took a majority stake in the company. The premises are by far the company’s most valuable asset, but are proving to be too small due to increasing customer demand. The company seizes an opportunity to acquire a much larger premises nearby (over double the floor-area), and sells its existing premises to part-fund that acquisition. The company’s directors are concerned that the high dollar-value of the transaction may give rise to a major change in the nature of its business. Because the new premises are significantly larger than the previous premises, they are not “similar” to the previous premises for the purposes of s IB 3(4). Accordingly, the change in premises must be taken into account in assessing whether a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities has occurred. While the scale of the company’s business activities is likely to increase, all of the other factors have effectively remained the same. It follows that the acquisition of the new premises will not give rise to a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities under s IB 3(2)(c). Even if it did, the permitted major change for increases in scale in s IB 3(5)(c) would apply. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 33 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Other factors that may be taken into account 66. Section IB 3(4) does not limit the factors that may be taken into account. As context, the permitted major changes in s IB 3(5) indicate additional factors that may be relevant (given that s IB 3(5) applies only once a major change has been identified). In particular: the efficiency and technology permitted major changes (discussed from \[80\] and from \[84\], respectively) suggest that changes in business processes and suppliers or other inputs may be relevant; the scale permitted major change (discussed from \[86\]) suggests that changes in scale and the markets supplied to may be relevant; the type of product or service permitted major change (discussed from \[88\]) suggests that changes in the type of product or service produced or provided may be relevant. These additional factors are consistent with the other potentially relevant factors identified in the Commentary. 67. In terms of “other inputs”, changes in the people involved in a business may be a relevant factor, depending on the context. For example, significant changes in the number or skills of employees in a service-related business could be indicative of a major change. 68. As with the assets factor, these other factors may be measured in different ways. Again, it will depend on the context as to which measurement method is most appropriate in any given fact situation. The primary question is whether there has been a major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company compared with the nature of the business activities carried on immediately before the ownership continuity breach (see Example 6). Example 6 – Reduced scale Facts Bun Factor Ltd carries on a business of baking mass-produced plain loaves of white bread in its own fully-automated bakery premises. The loaves are sold to supermarkets in the surrounding region. The company has a turnover of approximately $700,000 annually. However, due to the low margins on plain white bread, Bun Factor Ltd has suffered trading losses in recent years. The sole shareholder and chief executive of the company, George, decides to shift the company’s focus to baking artisanal sour-dough loaves using wood-fired ovens and organic flour made from heirloom wheat varieties. George hopes this will return the company to profitability as the margins for artisanal bread are much higher than for mass-produced bread, even though the volume of output will be significantly reduced. As George does not have experience in this type of baking he brings in a new majority shareholder, Alexandra, who is a renowned artisan baker. This breaches ownership continuity. To enable the change in product, Bun Factor Ltd removes and sells off its automated bread production line, installs wood- fired ovens and acquires the new plant and equipment required for artisanal bread-making. The company also hires additional staff as the new process is more labour intensive. Bun Factor Ltd changes its name to Hippy Dough Ltd and begins supplying its sour-dough loaves to high-end organic supermarkets, restaurants and cafés. Analysis Before the ownership continuity breach, the business activity of Bun Factor Ltd was bread bakery operation using the key assets of its bakery premises, automated bread production line and delivery vehicles, and a key supplier of flour. The company supplies local supermarkets, bakes 2,000 loaves a day and has a turnover of approximately $700,000. The issue is whether the significant decrease in output has given rise to a major change in the nature of that business activity that is not a permitted major change. The bakery premises, delivery vehicles and some bread-making equipment continue to be used after the change. The new wood-fired ovens and bread-making plant and equipment are similar to (that is, functionally the same as) the automated bread production line that they replaced. Despite the change in baking process, the fundamental steps in making bread remain the same. The new equipment enables those steps to be carried out manually, whereas previously they were automated. It follows that all the key assets the company uses after the breach in deriving its assessable income have remained the same or similar. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 34 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS The company’s business processes have not changed. Hippy Dough Ltd still bakes loaves of bread and sells them to retailers, despite the baking process changing from automated mass-production to artisanal. The company’s main supplier has changed. Hippy Dough Ltd now sources its flour from a boutique flour mill. Despite this, the input is essentially the same – flour. A like for like substitution of suppliers is not indicative of a change in the nature of business activities. Other key inputs have changed though, with the hiring of a specialist artisanal baker and an increase in staff numbers because of the more labour-intensive production process. The type of product the company sells has not changed. Previously, the company produced and sold loaves of bread, which it continues to do after the ownership continuity breach. The scale of output has changed significantly. Previously, Bun Factor Ltd produced 2,000 loaves of plain white bread per day. In contrast, Hippy Dough Ltd now produces 500 artisanal sour-dough loaves a day. The changes in staff and scale of production suggest that there has been some change in the nature of the company’s business activities. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether that change is a major change. The introduction of a key artisanal baker into the business and the increase in staffing levels are not indicative of a major change. These changes merely enable the company to carry out the same business process in a different way. Further, the reduction in the scale of output is not indicative of a major change in this context. The reduction in the scale of output is a result of an improvement in the quality of the bread being baked, which is reflected in higher margins. Based on the above, the company has not had a major change in the nature of its business activities, despite the significant reduction in its output of loaves. For completeness, none of the permitted major changes would be applicable on these facts. The change was not made to increase efficiency, was not made to keep up to date with advances in technology, was not caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity, and was not caused by a change in the type of product produced by the company. How does the rule apply to groups of companies? 69. Section IB 5 sets out how the business continuity test applies to groups of companies: IB 5 When group companies treated as single company New Zealand resident companies that are part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after an ownership continuity breach occurs for each of the companies are treated as a single company for the purposes of this subpart and sections GB 3BA to GB 3BAC (which relate to arrangements involving tax losses). 70. New Zealand resident companies that form part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after an ownership breach occurs (for each of the companies) are treated as a single company for the purposes of the business continuity test (and its associated avoidance provisions) (s IB 5). 71. When determining the nature of the business activities carried on by a deemed single company, the focus of the description should be on the products or services that are sold or provided to customers outside of the group. For example, administrative services provided by a holding company solely to other companies that are part of the same single company under s IB 5 would not be a type of service provided by the single company for the purposes of applying the business continuity test. 72. Similarly, when assessing the continuity of assets of the deemed single company, wholly intra-group assets should be ignored, such as a holding company’s shares in its subsidiaries (see Example 7). 73. In addition: where the deemed single company undertakes more than one core business process each core business process should be referred to (see above at \[33\]); and where the deemed single company produces or provides more than one type of product or service each type of product or service produced or provided (and their approximate relativities) should generally be referred to (see above at \[34\]). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 35 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 74. Depending on the relevant factors, where a deemed single company produces or provides more than one type of product or service, a significant change in the relativities of those products or services could give rise to a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities (see also at \[44\]). Example 7 – Nature of the business activities of a deemed single company The Central Storage group owns and operates a storage unit business. The group consists of a holding company, which owns 100% of the shares in a property-owning company and 100% of the shares in an operating company. All of the companies are resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. The operating company typically has a turnover of around $1m per annum. However, restrictions on international travel have a negative impact on demand for storage, and the operating company incurs losses in the 2021/22 income year. The property-owing company charges the operating company a market rent for the lease of the storage facility and generates a small taxable margin after deductible expenses each year. The holding company operates on a break-even basis by annually charging its subsidiaries management fees equal in aggregate to its deductible costs. The shareholders of the group decide to exit the business and sell 100% of the shares in the holding company to an unrelated purchaser, giving rise to an ownership continuity breach for each of the group companies. The purchaser continues to operate the Central Storage business in the same manner following its acquisition. Because the companies forming the Central Storage group are part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after the ownership continuity breach, the companies are treated as a single company for the purposes of subpart IB and its associated avoidance provisions (s IB 5). When determining the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company, the intra-group property leasing and management services should be ignored, and the holding company’s investment in its subsidiaries should not be taken into account as a relevant asset. It follows that the nature of the deemed single company’s business activities will be the provision of storage services to the local market using the key asset of the storage facility, and with a turnover of around $1m. There are no notable suppliers or other inputs. Following the ownership continuity breach there is no change to the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company. Accordingly, the losses arising in the operating company prior to the ownership continuity breach can be carried forward past the breach under s IB 3. Under the existing loss grouping rules in subpart IC, the losses arising in the operating company prior to the ownership continuity breach will be available to offset against income arising in the property-owning company both before and after the breach. The purchaser of the group must assess the impact of any future changes to the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company against the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company carried on immediately prior to the ownership continuity breach. What are the permitted major changes? 75. If a major change in the business activities carried on by a company has occurred, the business continuity test may still be satisfied if the major change is a permitted major change. Section IB 3(5) and (7) provide: IB 3 When tax loss components of companies carried forward despite ownership continuity breach ... Permitted major changes (5) A major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company during the business continuity period does not breach the requirement set out in subsection (2)(c) if the major change is— (a) made to increase the efficiency of a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 36 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS (b) made to keep up to date with advances in technology relating to a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period: (c) caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period, including as a result of the company entering a new market for a product or service that it produced or provided at that time: (d) caused by a change in the type of products or services the company produces or provides that involves the company starting to produce or provide a product or service using the same, or mainly the same, assets as, or that is otherwise closely connected with, a product or service that the company produced or provided immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period. ... A definition (7) In subsection (5), asset does not include land other than buildings and fixtures. 76. The four permitted major changes set out in s IB 3(5) are, broadly, changes: made to increase the efficiency of a business activity; made to keep up to date with advances in technology relating to a business activity; caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity; and caused by a change in the type of products or services produced or provided. 77. The Commentary states that the permitted major changes are intended to permit loss carry-forward in spite of a major change where the changes: are a consequence of natural development that could have happened absent the change in ownership; are about a company being able to position its resources in a way that maximises returns; and are driven by genuine commercial reasons and are not related to the availability of tax losses. 78. Depending on the facts, it may be easier to first consider whether a change in the nature of the business activities a company carries on is a permitted major change (on the assumption that the change is major). If the change falls within one or more of the permitted major changes, it will be unnecessary to determine whether the change is in fact a major change. 79. A company can have multiple major changes in the nature of its business activities, provided each major change is a permitted major change (s IB 3(2)(c)). Following a permitted major change, the nature of the business activities of the company still need to be assessed against the business activities carried on immediately prior to the ownership continuity breach. Changes to increase efficiency 80. Major changes that are made to increase the efficiency of a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period are permitted under s IB 3(5)(a). “Efficiency” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as the state or quality of being efficient, and “efficient”, in turn, is defined as working productively with minimum wasted effort or expense. 81. The efficiency of an existing business activity can be increased by maintaining the same level of output with reduced costs, or by increasing the level of output without increasing costs. Changes made to increase efficiency will typically involve changes to business processes, assets utilised, suppliers, or other inputs (see Example 8). 82. Increased costs or investment may be incurred in the short term in order to achieve cost savings in the medium to long term. For example, a company might invest in expensive new plant that performs an existing function more efficiently. Such a change (if it contributed to a major change) would be a change made to increase efficiency. 83. As discussed at \[32\], for the purposes of s IB 3(2)(c), business activities should be described by reference to a number of features including the type of product or service produced or provided. A change to a different type of product or service that is either cheaper to produce or provide, or more profitable, is not increasing the efficiency of an existing business activity. Such a change (if it contributes to a major change) should be considered under the permitted major change relating to products and services (see from \[88\]). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 37 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 8 – Outsourcing a manufacturing operation Expeditions Unlimited Ltd designs and manufactures high-quality outdoor equipment in its own local factory. The company supplies this equipment to domestic and international wholesalers. However, due to stiff competition from large northern hemisphere manufacturers, the company has suffered losses. A majority stake in the company is sold to a new investor, which breaches ownership continuity. The new owner insists the local factory be closed and the manufacturing outsourced in order to reduce costs. A company in Vietnam can manufacture the goods to the required standard, and all manufacturing is outsourced to that company. The design of the goods continues to be done in New Zealand, and the branding of the goods remains the same. The completed goods are shipped direct to the wholesalers from Vietnam. Expeditions Unlimited Ltd is concerned about the impact of outsourcing on its ability to carry forward its losses, given the significant change in business processes and assets because of the closure of its local factory. Before the ownership continuity breach, the nature of Expeditions Unlimited Ltd’s business activity was manufacturing outdoor equipment using the key assets of a factory, intellectual property in its designs and branding, and goodwill, and the key input of its design team. The company supplies domestic and international wholesalers, and its turnover is approximately $40m annually. The issue is whether the significant changes in business processes and assets have given rise to a major change in the nature of that activity that is not a permitted major change. Even if the outsourcing gave rise to a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities, the major change would be a permitted major change under s IB 3(5)(a), as it is made to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing operation carried on by the company. Accordingly, the company will satisfy the business continuity test in s IB 3(2)(c), and it is not necessary to determine whether a major change has occurred. Changes to keep up to date with advances in technology 84. Major changes that are made to keep up to date with advances in technology relating to a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period are permitted under s IB 3(5)(b). This could be satisfied, for example, where a new technology enables greater output of an existing product or service (see Example 9). 85. In contrast, changes to producing or providing a type of product or service based on an emerging technology that is unrelated to a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period will not fall within this permitted major change (see Example 10). Example 9 – Technology advances Sustainable Delivery Ltd (SDL) is a courier company that uses a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) to transport parcels between its major depots in an environmentally sustainable way. However, SDL has incurred losses in its early years, due in part to the high wage cost of its drivers. Driverless vehicle technology makes rapid advances and becomes authorised for commercial use in New Zealand. SDL undertakes a large capital-raise to enable it to acquire a fleet of driverless EVs (at significant cost). The capital-raise breaches SDL’s ownership continuity. SDL is concerned that the replacement of its entire fleet of vehicles (its main asset) may jeopardise its ability to carry forward its losses. The change in SDL’s assets is made to keep up with driverless vehicle technology which is relevant to its courier business, so any resulting change in the nature of its business (if that change were a major change) would be a permitted major change under s IB 3(5)(b). Therefore, it is unnecessary for SDL to consider whether any change in the nature of its business activities is major under s IB 3(2)(c). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 38 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 10 – Unrelated technology advances Ariana is a keen brewer of craft beer. She decides to go into business brewing beer from her garage and incorporates a company to carry on the business. The first year proves more difficult than Ariana anticipated and the company suffers losses. The following year, Ariana becomes interested in aerial photography. Recent advances in technology mean that high-quality drones are now more affordable. Ariana decides that the company should sell off its brewing equipment and acquire a high- end drone. Her friend, Patricia, who has access to the necessary capital, joins the company as a majority shareholder breaching ownership continuity. The company uses the newly acquired drone to establish a thriving aerial photography business. The company has had a major change in the nature of its business activities. The change will not be a permitted major change under s IB 3(5)(b), as although the new drone reflects an advance in technology, the technology is unrelated to the brewing business activity. Increases in scale 86. Major changes caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period are permitted under s IB 3(5)(c). Companies may grow organically or by way of acquisition (or a combination of these two things). Provided the increase in scale relates to a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period, this permitted major change will be satisfied. 87. Increases in scale include increases because the company is entering a new market for a product or service that it produces or provides. Examples of new markets for these purposes could be new geographical or demographical markets, or retail compared with wholesale markets. Changes in the type of products or services produced or provided 88. Changes caused by a change in the type of products or services a company produces or provides will be a permitted major change if the change involves starting to produce or provide a product or service: using the same, or mainly the same, assets as; or that is otherwise closely connected with, a product or service that the company produced or provided immediately before the start of the continuity period (s IB 3(5)(d)). 89. The Commentary states that this permitted major change allows a company to: pivot and drop a type of product or service and start producing or supplying another that has a close connection; and be able to retain its existing product or service but also add to it as opportunities arise, as long as there is a close connection. 90. For the purposes of this permitted major change, assets do not include land other than buildings and fixtures (s IB 3(7)). “Land” is defined in s YA 1 as including any estate or interest in land, so land for these purposes will include both freehold and leasehold estates. 91. A “type” of product or service is a category of things having common characteristics. 92. The first limb of this permitted major change can be satisfied where the “same, or mainly the same” assets are used to produce or provide the new type of product or service. “Mainly” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as meaning more than anything else, and for the most part. In this instance, “mainly” is used in conjunction with “same”, so its meaning must be considered in that context. 93. Case law indicates that when the term “mainly” is used in conjunction with the “same” (or its synonyms) it is capable of a range of meanings from “more than half ” to “substantially all”, depending on context and the purpose of the relevant provision (see for example CIR v Mitchell (1986) 8 NZTC 5,181 (HC) at 5,183 and British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers & Attractions Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners \[2011\] TC 01504 (UKFTT) at \[39\]). 94. The purposes of promoting growth, innovation, and resilience support a broader interpretation of mainly, as this would enable companies to achieve those purposes more easily. However, in terms of context, the second limb to this permitted major change requires an otherwise close connection (see from \[97\]), which implies a more restricted interpretation of mainly. On balance, it is considered that a more restricted interpretation of mainly is appropriate in this context. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 39 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 95. The focus of the enquiry should be on the key assets used in the business activity. Again, particular assets will be more relevant than others, depending on the context (as discussed at \[54\]). 96. In some instances it may be helpful to measure assets for this purpose. There are a number of ways that assets can be measured (see the discussion at \[55\] and \[56\]). The most appropriate way will depend on the context. To assist with this enquiry, the Commissioner will accept that the “mainly the same” asset requirement is satisfied where at least 75% of existing key assets are used to produce or provide the new type of product or service. This does not mean that in certain contexts percentages lower than this will necessarily fail the requirement. 97. In terms of the second limb to this permitted major change, “closely connected” is not defined in the Act. “Close” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary in the context of a connection means strong. “Connected” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as including joined or linked together. 98. It follows that the connection between the new product or service and existing products or services needs to be strong. Examples could include products or services: based on the same underlying technology; that significantly enhance the utility or enjoyment of existing products or services; or that are commonly sold together with existing products or services in order to enhance the sales of those products or services (see Examples 11 to 15). Example 11 – Diversifying a “bricks and mortar” business Facts Derek is the sole shareholder of Book Worm Ltd, which operates a bookstore from leased premises. The store has a small but dedicated customer-base. The company has an annual turnover of approximately $200,000, and employs two part-time staff members in addition to Derek. The company’s assets recognised in its accounts are its fit-out of the store (largely consisting of shelving and display stands), a considerable amount of trading stock (that is, books), and some generic IT and office equipment. The fixed assets have a very low book value due to depreciation. No goodwill is reflected in the accounts. Due to competition from online book sellers, the company has suffered losses. Disillusioned with book retailing, Derek sells the company to Rachel, breaching ownership continuity. Under Rachel’s ownership, Book Worm Ltd refreshes the decor and installs a café counter from which coffee and pastries are sold. This involves considerable expenditure on the counter, a work bench, tables and chairs, a coffee machine and other appliances, crockery, and glassware. Rachel hires a part-time barista to run the café counter. Rachel hopes the café counter will generate additional income from the sale of coffee and pastries, and will also increase book sales by attracting additional customers and keeping them in the store longer. The café counter is very successful, with coffee and pastry sales soon constituting approximately 70% of the company’s monthly turnover. Book sales increase slightly, but that side of the business remains loss-making. Despite this, Book Worm Ltd continues to sell books as this gives the store its identity. Analysis Before the ownership continuity breach, the nature of Book Worm Ltd’s business activities was book retailing to the local market. The key assets of the business were its trading stock of books, retail fit-out and some level of goodwill (not reflected in its accounts); the remaining assets are generic business assets. A key input is the company’s relationships with various book suppliers and publishers. The issue is whether the introduction of the café counter has given rise to a major change in the nature of the business activities that is not a permitted major change. The trading stock of books, retail fit-out and goodwill continue to be used in the new business. However, new key assets are now also used in deriving the company’s assessable income (that is, the café counter, work bench, tables and chairs, coffee machine, other appliances, crockery, and glassware). Business processes have changed to an extent – while the company still retails books, a proportionately larger amount of time is spent operating the café side of the business. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 40 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Suppliers and other inputs have changed to an extent. The premises and book suppliers remain the same, but there are new suppliers for the café side of the business, and a significant volume of transactions goes through those new suppliers. A new part-time staff member has also been dedicated to the café business. Scale and markets supplied to (local retail customers) have not changed. The type of product the company sells has changed to an extent. Previously, the company sold books. Now, the company sells predominantly coffee, as well as books. It follows from the above analysis that there has been a change in the nature of the company’s business activities. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether that change is a major change – in other words, whether the change is of greater importance in the context of the operations of the entire company. Business processes, suppliers and other inputs, and the type of product provided have all changed significantly, because coffee sales now represent 70% of the company’s monthly turnover. New key assets have also been acquired by the company. The cost of the new assets is roughly equal to the combined value of the existing key assets (measured at book value). However, assessing the level of change by reference to book value is not determinative in this context, because the existing assets have been heavily depreciated in the company’s accounts. If the existing key assets were instead valued at replacement value, the ratio of new assets to existing assets would be about one- quarter. Therefore, the continuity of assets does not suggest a major change. Weighing up all the factors, on balance, it is considered a major change in the nature of the business activities of the company has occurred. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the major change is a permitted major change. The only potentially relevant permitted major change relates to a change in the type of products or services produced or provided (s IB 3(5)(d)). The issue is whether the provision of coffee uses the same or mainly the same assets as the provision of books, or is otherwise closely connected with the provision of books. The provision of coffee uses the key assets of the café counter, work bench, tables and chairs, coffee machine, other appliances, crockery, and glassware. The provision of books uses the key assets of the trading stock of books and the shelving and display stands. While the trading stock of books and shelving and display stands arguably contribute to the backdrop and atmosphere of the café, they are not key assets for the provision of coffee. The goodwill arguably contributes to both business activities. The IT and office equipment are not given any weight in this context as they are generic business assets. It follows that the provision of coffee does not use the same or mainly the same assets as the provision of books. The remaining issue is whether coffee is otherwise closely connected to books. The inclusion of cafés within bookstores is relatively common practice: the café encourages more customers into the bookstore for longer periods of time, and customers are able to peruse the books while drinking coffee. The inclusion of the café is intended to enhance the sale of books, as well as providing an additional income stream. It follows that the Commissioner will view the connection between the new product (coffee) and the old product (books) as close. The provision of coffee in this context will therefore be closely connected to the provision of books, and therefore the major change will be a permitted major change within s IB 3(2)(c). Additional facts The following year, Rachel decides that selling books is not worth the effort and that profitability would be increased if the entire shop were dedicated to selling coffee and pastries. The shelving, display stands, and trading stock of books are sold, and bookshelf wallpaper is hung as a nod to the shop’s past. Additional café assets are acquired to fill the larger area and enable the company to expand the food on offer. Before the ownership continuity breach, the business activity of Book Worm Ltd was book retailing with the key assets, inputs, markets supplied to and scale as described above. Again, the issue is whether a major change in the nature of that business activity has occurred that is not a permitted major change. As the facts are more extreme than before, it follows that there will have been a major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company. The key issue is again whether that major change is a permitted major change. The only common assets are now the office and IT equipment but these are not given any weight in this context as they are generic business assets. Accordingly, the café business does not use mainly the same assets as were previously used for the provision of books. Despite this, it is considered that coffee is closely connected to books for the reasons discussed above. It follows that the major change will be a permitted major change within s IB 3(2)(c) and therefore the company can carry forward the remaining unused losses that arose prior to the ownership continuity breach. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 41 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 12 – Diversifying a “people-intensive” business Facts Judy, a registered real estate agent, is the sole owner of Property Insights Ltd, through which she provides commercial real estate agency services with the help of a part-time assistant. She is highly regarded for her knowledge and contacts in the commercial property world. However, the company recently sustained losses due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the business. The company leases furnished office premises and a car, and has a small amount of office equipment (including Judy’s laptop and mobile phone). To diversify the business and create opportunities for cross-selling, Judy convinces an acquaintance, Alan, an established commercial property manager, to join the company with his team of four assistants. As part of the deal, Alan takes a 60% stake in the company, breaching ownership continuity. The company continues to operate from its existing premises, with the staff hot-desking when they are in the office. New laptops, mobile phones, and leased cars are acquired for Alan and his team. Alan brings most of his existing clients with him, and his side of the business quickly accounts for about 60% of the company’s monthly turnover. Analysis Before the ownership continuity breach, the nature of the company’s business activities was the provision of real estate agency services to the local market using the key input of Judy and the key asset of her goodwill. The business is a micro- business with one full-time and one part-time employee. The issue is whether the introduction of the property management activities has given rise to a major change in the nature of those business activities that is not a permitted major change. The key assets of the business after the ownership continuity breach are the existing goodwill from Judy’s know-how, clients and contacts in the commercial property world, together with the goodwill that Alan brings to the company in the form of his existing know-how, client list and contacts. The company’s remaining assets largely consist of generic office equipment (that is, laptops, mobile phones and other office equipment) which are not given any weight in this context. The business processes involved in providing real estate agency services and property management services are largely the same (that is, both involve the provision of intermediary-type services for a fee), and suppliers and the markets supplied to (that is, commercial property buyers/owners) remain the same. However, personnel has significantly changed to enable the company to provide the property management services – in particular, the engagement of a new principal and four assistants all of whom are dedicated to the new business activity. This has also given rise to an increase in scale in the company’s business activities. The type of service provided has changed. Previously the company provided real estate agency services, whereas after Alan and his team joined it provides property management services as well, which accounts for about 60% of the company’s monthly turnover. It follows that there has been a change in the nature of the company’s business activities. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether that change is a major change. The fact Alan’s side of the business quickly generates 60% of the company’s monthly turnover suggests there is heavy reliance on his goodwill following the ownership continuity breach, which in turn suggests a significant change in the assets the company uses in deriving its assessable income. The type of service the company provides has had an approximate 60% change, and personnel and the scale of the business activities have significantly changed to enable this. In contrast, the business processes, suppliers, and markets supplied to have not changed materially. It is considered that the changes in key assets, type of service provided, personnel and scale mean a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities has occurred. Real estate services of the kind the company provided are heavily people-dependent, so the changes in goodwill and personnel are particularly important. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 42 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS The only potentially relevant permitted major change is the one relating to changes in the type of product or service produced or provided. The first issue is whether the provision of both real estate agency services and property management services uses the same or mainly the same assets as the provision of solely real estate agency services. As discussed above, the key asset (that is, goodwill) the company uses in deriving its assessable income has significantly changed. It follows that the provision of property management services does not use the same or mainly the same assets as the provision of real estate agency services. Again, generic business assets are not given any weight in this context. The next issue is whether property management services are otherwise closely connected with real estate agency services. It is considered that they would be. Property management services enhance the utility of the real estate agency services, as owners of commercial real estate are likely to also need property management services. In addition, property management services are commonly provided together with real estate agency services and enhance sales opportunities for the real estate agency services. This is supported by the fact one of the reasons Judy brought Alan into the company was to create cross-selling opportunities. The Commissioner will therefore regard the connection between the real estate agency services and property management services as close. It follows that Property Insights Ltd will satisfy the business continuity test in s IB 3, so the losses incurred before Alan and his team joined the company will be available to offset against income of the company after the ownership continuity breach. Example 13 – Agritech start-up Facts Jocelyn, an agricultural scientist, founds a company in the 2020/21 income year to undertake research and development into a hemp-based stock feed that reduces methane emissions from cattle. The company is initially funded by Jocelyn from her own savings and loans from family members. The company employs Jocelyn to work full-time in the business, together with a research assistant and a lab technician. During the 2021/22 income year the research and development progresses well. An angel investor invests $1.5m for a 40% stake in the company. The investment enables the company to hire an additional scientist and assistant, and to upgrade its lab facilities. At the same time, a further 15% of the company’s shares are set aside for an employee share ownership plan. Together, these transactions breach ownership continuity. By the 2023/24 income year a viable product has been developed, and significant investment is required to build a production facility and establish a supply chain. A venture capital fund takes a 60% stake for $25m for this purpose, again breaching ownership continuity. In the 2024/25 income year the production facility is fully operational and the company begins deriving revenue from the sale of the stock feed. The company is loss-making throughout the entire period, and wishes to know whether it can carry forward its losses from prior to both the first and second ownership continuity breaches to the 2024/25 income year. Analysis It is assumed that the activities of the company satisfy the requirements of the Grieve business test from the outset. The nature of the company’s business activities prior to the first ownership continuity breach consisted of research and development of stock feed using the key input of Jocelyn, and the main assets of intangibles (ie, Jocelyn’s know-how) and lab equipment. During this period the company was producing intangibles (ie, know-how/trade secrets), had no turn-over, 3 employees, and supplied no markets. After the first ownership continuity breach the nature of the company’s business activities is essentially unchanged. Although the number of employees has increased, the company is still a micro-business. It follows that the test in s IB 3(2)(c) will be satisfied, and any losses arising prior to the first ownership continuity breach can be carried forward past the first breach under s IB 3. Further, as the requirements of both IB 3(2)(b) and (c) are satisfied, losses from before the first ownership continuity breach will not be prevented from being carried past a further breach by s IB 3(3)(b). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 43 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS After the second continuity breach the nature of the company’s business activities has changed in many respects from that carried on immediately before both the first and second ownership continuity breaches. The company is now predominantly involved in the manufacturing of animal food using specialist manufacturing equipment and the intangibles created during the research and development phase. Turnover is approximately $2m and the company now employs over 50 staff. The markets supplied are domestic animal food wholesalers and retailers. As there has been a change in the nature of the company’s business activities, it is necessary to determine whether that change is a major change – in other words, whether the change is of greater importance in the context of the operations of the entire company. It is considered that there has been a major change. The company has moved from the research and development stage to full production, which has involved significant changes in assets and other inputs, business processes, scale, and the markets supplied to. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the major change is a permitted major change. The most relevant permitted major change in this instance is s IB 3(5)(d) which relates to changes in the type of product or service produced or provided. It is considered that the requirements of this permitted major change will be satisfied. The major change was caused by the company starting to produce a product – stock feed. The stock feed is closely connected to the intangibles (ie, know-how/ trade secrets) that the company produced immediately before each ownership continuity breach, because it is the product of those intangibles. It follows that losses arising prior to both the first and second ownership continuity breaches can be carried forward to the 2024/25 income year. Example 14 – Failing the test Facts Sunshine Holiday Camp Ltd owns a 2-hectare camping ground in a prime beach-front location. The company is family owned and run. The company provides a range of accommodation to holiday-makers from luxury serviced cabins to campervan and tent-sites. The camping ground has considerable infrastructure, including an office block, various types of cabins, shared cooking and ablution blocks, a laundry and a recycling station. Unfortunately, a lack of up-keep of the camping ground, together with competition from online bach-booking platforms, has led to significant losses in recent years. The family is aware that the value of the land has risen significantly, so decides the time is right to wind up the camping ground business and subdivide and sell the land as residential sections. The capital value of the land for rating purposes is $6m, with improvements of $2m. The company is asset-rich but cash poor, and the family has no experience in property development. Accordingly, it decides to bring in an outside investor with experience in major subdivisions to both fund and carry out the development. This breaches ownership continuity. The company sells off what camping-ground assets it can and demolishes remaining structures. The site is contoured and divided into 25 sections, complete with roadways, drainage and services. The company markets the sections and disposes of them for a significant profit. Analysis Before the ownership continuity breach, the nature of the company’s business activities was camping ground operation using the key assets of the land and the various buildings. There are no other notable inputs. The scale of the camping ground is 2 hectares, and the market supplied to is domestic and international holiday-makers. The issue is whether the change to its business activities is a major change that is not a permitted major change. In terms of assets, the land continues to be used by the business in deriving its income (although the amount of land decreases as sections are sold). The various buildings are no longer used. The value of the land significantly outweighs the value of the other camping ground assets that are disposed of. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 44 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Business processes have changed considerably, as has the market supplied to and the type of service or product produced or provided. Despite the continued use of the land, the other factors all strongly suggest that there is a change in the nature of the business activities, and that the change is a major change. None of the permitted major changes will apply in this instance. In particular, the permitted major change relating to changes in the type of product or service produced or provided using the same or mainly the same assets will not be satisfied as land is excluded from the determination. Accordingly, the losses incurred before the ownership continuity breach will not be able to be carried forward and set off against the profits from the land development activity under s IB 3. Example 15 – Diversified group example The Contact Media group owns five local newspapers across New Zealand, each of which is operated through a separate subsidiary. The group has also recently set up a new subsidiary that owns and operates an online classified advertising business. The newspaper businesses account for approximately 80% of the turnover of the group, but due to competition from online news services, have suffered significant losses in recent years. The online classified advertising business makes up the remaining 20% of turnover and is currently breaking even. It is considered that the newspaper businesses and the online classified advertising business are each a distinct business activity for the purposes of the permitted major change tests in s IB 3(5) (which refer to “a business activity” that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period). A new investor takes a majority stake in the holding company of the Contact Media group giving rise to an ownership continuity breach for all of the companies in the group. At the new investor’s instigation, the local newspaper businesses are sold off over the space of a year so that the group can focus on the online classified advertising business, which is considered to have stronger growth potential. The proceeds of sale are used to repay debt owed by the relevant newspaper business subsidiaries. Because the companies forming the Contact Media group are part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after the ownership continuity breach, the companies are treated as a single company for the purposes of subpart IB and its associated avoidance provisions (s IB 5). Prior to the ownership continuity breach the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company included:   newspaper publishing: –using key assets of printing presses, distribution networks, intellectual property (mastheads, etc), land and buildings; –using key suppliers of news content and publishing consumables (eg, newsprint, ink, etc); –using key inputs of specialised employees (editors, journalists, printers, etc); –supplying newspapers to a number of provinces across New Zealand; –with a turnover of approximately $4m;   online advertising services: –using key assets of a technology stack and intangibles; –using a key input of software developers; –providing advertising services to business and private customers nationwide; –with a turnover of approximately $1m. In terms of relativities, the newspaper publishing business accounts for 80% of the deemed single company’s turnover, and the online advertising services business accounts for 20%. It follows that the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company prior to the ownership continuity breach is predominantly newspaper publishing. After the three most profitable newspaper publishing businesses have been sold off, the combined turnover of the remaining newspaper businesses is approximately $600,000. At this point in time, the remaining newspaper businesses account for 37.5% of the deemed single company’s turnover, and the online advertising services business accounts for 62.5%. It follows that the nature of the business activities of the deemed single company is now predominantly online advertising services. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 45 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS It is considered this will constitute a change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the deemed single company which is a major change. This is because the product, business process, key assets, key suppliers and other key inputs associated with the online advertising have increased significantly in importance relative to the newspaper publishing factors. Further, the overall scale of the business activities have reduced, and the markets supplied to have changed to an extent. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the major change is a permitted major change. The major change caused by selling off the newspaper publishing businesses does not increase the efficiency of an existing business activity carried on by the deemed single company. The change does not maintain the same level of newspaper output with reduced costs, nor increase the level of newspaper output without increasing costs. Further, it does not impact on the efficiency of the online advertising business. The major change caused by winding down the newspaper publishing businesses is not made to keep up to date with changes in technology. Selling off print-based newspaper publishing businesses would not satisfy this requirement unless it was, for example, accompanied by a shift to an online news platform. The major change is not caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity carried on by the deemed single company. It is caused by decrease in the scale of the newspaper publishing activity. Finally, the major change is not caused by a change in the type of products or services the company produces or provides that involves the company “starting to produce or provide” a product or service. No new products or services are produced or provided as a result of winding down the newspaper publishing businesses. It is therefore immaterial whether the newspapers and the online classified advertising are “closely connected” products and services. It follows that the losses arising prior to the ownership continuity breach cannot be carried forward under s IB 3. What are the cessation rules? 99. A tax loss cannot be carried forward if, before the beginning of the business continuity period, the business activities the company carries on have ceased and not been revived (s IB 3(3)(a)). In addition, a tax loss cannot be carried forward if the company ceases to carry on business activities during the business continuity period (s IB 3(2)(b)). 100. The Commissioner considers that existing case law on the cessation of a business for income tax purposes is relevant in this context. When have business activities ceased? 101. Whether a business has ceased is a question of fact. A taxpayer will cease to be in business when it no longer has the intention to make a profit from the activities carried on (see AAA Developments (Ormiston) Ltd v CIR (2015) 27 NZTC 22-026 (HC), Case F31 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,712 (TRA), Case G8 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,021 (TRA) and Case J2 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,004 (TRA)). 102. Gendall J in AAA Developments (Ormiston) stated at \[48\]: At the outset I need to say that, as I see the position, the TRA \[Taxation Review Authority\] was correct in finding that the business of AAA ceased from 24 July 2008. AAA was incorporated for one reason, and one reason alone. That was to develop the Land. From the moment AAA attempted to accept Ormiston’s otherwise invalid cancellation of the purchase agreement, it is difficult to accept AAA’s argument that it still maintained some profit making intention from this point in time forward. Of course, in assessing this criterion it is necessary to have regard to statements made by a taxpayer. However, the ultimate analysis requires an assessment of a taxpayer’s intention gleaned from all relevant circumstances. ... 103. A taxpayer will also cease to be in business when there is insufficient activity to constitute a business. Generally, a business will cease when it ceases trading. However, in Case U29 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,273 (TRA), Judge Barber held that the particular facts of the case need to be examined to ascertain whether a business terminated when trading ceased. Judge Barber stated at \[51\]: It now seems to me that the tidying-up of the affairs of a business could often mean the continuance of the business for income tax purposes for a reasonable period beyond cessation of trading, but one needs to examine the particular facts of the case to ascertain whether or not the business terminated when trading ceased. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 46 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 104. Case L89 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,508 (TRA) concerned a taxpayer’s purchase of a hotel business in April 1983. Soon after settlement the hotel business ran into difficulties, and the taxpayer made a claim against the vendor for misrepresentation. The assets of the business were ultimately sold by receivers in October 1983. The taxpayer argued that the business continued after the sale of the assets due to the ongoing litigation against the vendor and the collection of outstanding trade debts. Judge Barber stated at 1,511: by the beginning of the 1985 income tax year there was no business activity taking place on behalf of the objector company. True, the recovery of debts and tidying up of the affairs of a business can be of such a degree as to amount to a continuation of the previous trading business, but not usually. That issue must always be one of fact and degree in any particular case. Here, there was very little such activity in 1985 and 1986. I do not accept as a general proposition that, for income tax purposes, a business continues so long as it has debts which result from that business. 105. In summary, Judge Barber considered that the recovery of debts and tidying up of the affairs of a business could be of such a degree as to amount to a continuation of the previous trading business. However, he considered that this would not usually be the case and would always be a question of fact and degree. 106. The ultimate failure of an activity will not of itself indicate the non-existence of a business (McGrath v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,074 (HC) and Slater v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,453 (HC)). What is temporary cessation? 107. When applying the tests in Grieve v CIR \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA), the courts draw a distinction between a “temporary cessation of business” (where the business activities have temporarily ceased or been suspended but will recommence) and “cessation with the possibility of recommencement” (where business activities have ceased, and it is not certain that the business activities will recommence). In the former case, the business continues to exist despite the temporary cessation, whereas in the latter case, there is a cessation of the business. 108. The distinction between temporary cessation and cessation with the possibility of recommencement is considered in detail in “IS 21/04 Income tax and GST – deductions for businesses disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33, No 9 (October 2021): 8. 109. For the purposes of s IB 3(3)(a) and IB 3(2)(b), a temporary cessation will not constitute a cessation of business activities. In contrast, cessation with the possibility of recommencement will constitute a cessation. Have the business activities been revived? 110. “Revived” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary includes restored to life. For a company’s business activities to be revived, it would need to satisfy the business test in Grieve again (see above at \[23\]).

Sections IB 1 to IB 5 are as follows: IB 1 Purpose The purpose of this subpart and sections GB 3BA to GB 3BAC (which relate to arrangements involving tax losses) is— (a) to enable companies to carry forward tax loss components in loss balances despite not meeting the requirements for continuity of ownership of section IA 5 (Restrictions on companies’ loss balances carried forward: continuity of ownership), in order to reduce impediments to— (i) innovation and economic growth: (ii) corporate reorganisations: (iii) changes in the direct or indirect ownership of companies: (iv) companies accessing new sources of share capital: (v) companies adapting their business activities in order to grow or be resilient; but (b) not to encourage tax avoidance arrangements involving the acquisition of ownership interests in companies. IB 2 Meaning of ownership continuity breach In this subpart, an ownership continuity breach, for a company, means a breach of the requirements for continuity of ownership of section IA 5 (Restrictions on companies’ loss balances carried forward: continuity of ownership) that, if met, enable a tax loss component of the company to be carried forward in a loss balance IB 3 When tax loss components of companies carried forward despite ownership continuity breach When this section applies (1) This section applies when an ownership continuity breach occurs for a company. Tax loss components for earlier income years carried forward (2) Despite the ownership continuity breach, a tax loss component arising in an earlier income year is carried forward to a tax year in a loss balance under section IA 3(4) (Using tax losses in tax year) if— (a) the earlier income year is the 2013–14 income year or a later income year; and (b) the company does not cease to carry on business activities during the relevant period described in section IB 4 (the business continuity period); and (c) no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company occurs during the business continuity period, other than 1 or more major changes that are permitted under subsection (5); and (d) subsection (3) does not apply to prevent the tax loss component being carried forward to the tax year. Tax loss components for earlier income years not carried forward (3) The tax loss component is not carried forward to the tax year if— (a) before the beginning of the business continuity period,— (i) the business activities carried on by the company have ceased; and (ii) the business activities have not been revived: (b) the company has had another ownership continuity breach— (i) since the later of the beginning of the earlier income year and the beginning of the 2020–21 income year; and (ii) in relation to which the requirements of subsection (2)(b) and (c) for the carrying forward to the tax year of the tax loss component are not met: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 49 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS (c) the earlier income year is before the 2020–21 income year and the tax loss component could not be carried forward to the 2020–21 tax year in the absence of this subpart. Major change: factor that must be taken into account (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), without limiting the factors that may be taken into account in determining whether a major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company has occurred during the business continuity period, the extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have remained the same or similar over the business continuity period must be taken into account Permitted major changes (5) A major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company during the business continuity period does not breach the requirement set out in subsection (2)(c) if the major change is— (a) made to increase the efficiency of a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period: (b) made to keep up to date with advances in technology relating to a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period: (c) caused by an increase in the scale of a business activity that the company carried on immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period, including as a result of the company entering a new market for a product or service that it produced or provided at that time: (d) caused by a change in the type of products or services the company produces or provides that involves the company starting to produce or provide a product or service using the same, or mainly the same, assets as, or that is otherwise closely connected with, a product or service that the company produced or provided immediately before the beginning of the business continuity period. Exclusion: mining net losses (5B) This section does not apply to an amount referred to in section IA 7(7) (Restrictions relating to ring-fenced tax losses) that is treated by subsection (1B) of that section as if it were a tax loss component. Avoidance arrangements (6) Section GB 3BA (Arrangements for carrying forward loss balances: companies’ business activities) may apply to treat a company as not meeting the requirements of subsection (2). A definition (7) In subsection (5), asset does not include land other than buildings and fixtures. IB 4 Business continuity period Period (1) The period referred to in section IB 3(2)(b), for an ownership continuity breach and a tax loss component of a company, is the period beginning immediately before the ownership continuity breach occurs and ending on,— (a) for a company for which the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (2) is 0.50 or greater, the last day of the income year that corresponds to the tax year in which the company uses the tax loss component; or (b) in any other case, the earlier of— (i) the last day of the income year that corresponds to the tax year in which the company uses the tax loss component; and (ii) the last day of the income year in which the fifth anniversary of the ownership continuity breach falls. Formula (2) The formula is— (bad debt deductions – bad debt repayment income) ÷ (total deductions – bad debt repayment income). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 50 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Definition of items in formula (3) In the formula,— (a) bad debt deductions is the total amount of deductions that the company has been allowed under section DB 31(3) (Bad debts) for income years between the 2013–14 income year and the income year corresponding to the tax year immediately preceding the ownership continuity breach, both income years inclusive, in which a tax loss component included in the company’s tax loss for that tax year arose: (b) bad debt repayment income is the total amount of income that the company has under section CG 3 (Bad debt repayment)— (i) for income years between the earliest and the latest of the income years described in paragraph (a), both income years inclusive; and (ii) that relates to deductions that the company has been allowed under section DB 31(3): (c) total deductions is the total amount of deductions that the company has been allowed for the income years described in paragraph (a). IB 5 When group companies treated as single company New Zealand resident companies that are part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after an ownership continuity breach occurs for each of the companies are treated as a single company for the purposes of this subpart and sections GB 3BA to GB 3BAC (which relate to arrangements involving tax losses). IP 3B Business continuity breach: tax loss components of companies carried forward When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of section IA 4 (Using loss balances carried forward to tax year) if a tax loss component of a company would have been carried forward under section IB 3 (When tax loss components of companies carried forward despite ownership continuity breach) to a tax year but for a breach or breaches, during the income year that corresponds to the tax year, of either or both of the requirements of section IB 3(2)(b) and (c). Tax loss components for earlier income years (2) Despite the breach or breaches, the tax loss component is carried forward to the tax year to the extent to which— (a) the requirements of section IB 3(2)(b) and (c) would be met if the relevant period described in section IB 4 (Business continuity period) included only part of the income year of the company that corresponds to the tax year; and (b) the company has net income for part of the corresponding income year; and (c) the company provides the Commissioner with adequate financial statements under section IP 6 calculating the amount of the company’s net income for the relevant part of the corresponding income year. Limit on tax loss components carried forward (3) The total tax loss components carried forward under subsection (2) must be no more than the amount calculated under subsection (2)(b) and (c), although the amount may be increased if section IP 5 applies.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 52 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 22/07: Company losses – ownership continuity, sharing and measurement This Interpretation Statement considers the rules applying to company losses, including carrying forward losses, sharing losses and the measurement of ownership interests. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, examples in this statement are to be read independently of each other. Overview 1. The loss rules allow a company (a loss company 1 ) to: carry forward a tax loss to a subsequent tax year – where it will be used to reduce the loss company’s net income (if any) or be added to the tax loss for the subsequent tax year; 2 or share a tax loss with a profit company in a group of companies. 2. Losses can be used in other ways too (see \[43\]). Important concepts: “tax loss” and “tax loss component” 3. An important concept in the loss rules is a tax loss. This is essentially the total loss amount for the tax year that can be carried forward or shared. The tax loss concept is described at \[33\]. 4. A tax loss is made up of tax loss components. An example of a tax loss component is a net loss 3 from a previous tax year that has been carried forward to the current tax year. 5. Tax loss component is an important concept because key requirements of the loss rules need to be tested for each tax loss component. Tax loss components must also be used in the order in which they arose. The tax loss component concept is described at \[38\]. Carrying forward a tax loss 6. To carry forward a tax loss one of the following types of continuity must be satisfied: at least 49% continuity in the ownership of the loss company (ownership continuity), which is discussed further at \[51\]; continuity of the business activities of the loss company (business continuity). 4 7. Continuity must be tested for each tax loss component and must be maintained for the continuity period applying to that component. The continuity period is essentially the period from the start of the income year in which the tax loss component arose to the end of the income year in which the loss is used. 5 1 The terms “loss company” and “profit company” are generally not used in the loss rules anymore (they were previously used extensively, but now only feature in a certain anti-avoidance provisions). Nevertheless, for the purposes of this statement the term “loss company” means a company that has a tax loss component that it can use, and “profit company” means a company that has net income (as modified by the loss rules). 2 There is a temporary rule introduced as a COVID-19 pandemic response that allows a tax loss for the 2020 or 2021 tax year to be carried back. This rule is not discussed further in this Interpretation Statement. 3 A person’s “net loss” for a tax year is the difference between the person’s annual total deductions and their annual gross income (ie, where the annual total deductions are higher). 4 The business continuity test is discussed in a separate Interpretation Statement: IS 22/06 “Loss carry-forward – continuity of business activities”. 5 For the purposes of sharing losses, this period is extended to the end of the profit company’s income year if the profit company has a later balance date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 53 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Sharing a tax loss with another company 8. Two of the main requirements that must be met for a tax loss to be shared with another company are as follows: The loss company must satisfy one of the continuity requirements discussed above. An ownership commonality requirement must be satisfied. Essentially, this requirement is that there is a group of people who each hold ownership interests in the loss and profit companies and the total of each person’s lowest interest of the interests in the two companies (their common ownership interest) is at least 66%. This requirement must be tested for each tax loss component and be satisfied for the commonality period applying to that tax loss component. 9. The requirements are discussed in more detail from \[61\]. 10. A profit company must use a tax loss that is shared with it to reduce its net income. The profit company cannot carry the loss forward, share the loss with another company or use the loss in any other way. 6 11. The amount of tax loss that can be shared is limited by the profit company’s net income. The meaning of net income is modified for this purpose. This is discussed at \[93\]. 12. The loss rules recognise that losses may be shared with or without consideration. The rules provide that a payment made for a loss (a subvention payment) will not be a dividend (that is, in situations where the loss company is a shareholder of the profit company). 13. A loss company and a profit company may have income years with different balance dates. This will mean that for a tax year (a tax year always ends on 31 March), the net loss of a loss company and the net profit of a profit company will be calculated based on income years that do not precisely match. This mismatch will normally not affect the amount of tax loss that can be shared with the profit company. 7 Measurement of ownership interests 14. The ownership continuity and commonality requirements require a loss company to keep track of changes in the ownership of the loss company and (when sharing losses) profit companies. 15. There are two types of ownership interests: voting interests; and market value interests. 16. In most cases, it will be necessary to consider only voting interests. However, if there is a market value circumstance, it is necessary to measure both voting and market value interests. 17. There are detailed rules about how to measure these ownership interests (including a look-through rule). These are discussed from \[114\]. Part-year rules 18. The part-year rules 8 recognise that part way through an income year an event (for example, a change in the shareholding of a loss company) could result in ownership continuity or commonality being breached 9 or established 10 for a tax loss component and a group of persons. 19. In the absence of the part-year rules, if there was a continuity or commonality event part way through the income year, this could prevent a tax loss component from being used for the income year, or from being carried forward. 20. The part-year rules ensure that, in these cases, certain losses can still be used in the relevant part-year periods. This is consistent with the purpose of the loss rules (to ensure that, largely, losses are available to be used by the people who ultimately incurred the losses) and avoids an outcome that would otherwise follow from the assessment of income tax on an annualised basis. 6 However, in a wholly owned group, a tax loss of a loss company can be used to satisfy a shortfall penalty. 7 However, the difference in balance dates can limit the amount that can be shared where there is a breach of continuity or commonality as the balance dates will constrain the period (referred to in the Act as a common span) for which losses can be shared. 8 The part-year rules are contained in subpart IP. 9 For tax loss components in the income year and in previous income years. 10 For part of the net loss for the tax year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 54 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 21. Generally, a tax loss component that relates to a pre-breach period 11 can be used to reduce the loss company’s net income in the pre-breach period and, if sharing requirements are satisfied, an amount of the profit company’s net income. 12 22. A tax loss component (a net loss) that relates to a part-year period following a continuity breach, or following the establishment of commonality between two companies (post-establishment period), can be carried forward by the loss company or shared with a profit company. The profit company can apply this part-year loss against an amount of its net income. 13 23. The part-year rules are discussed in more detail from \[197\]. Amended assessments and consequential loss adjustments 24. If the Commissioner makes an amendment to the assessment of a loss company or a profit company, this can lead to consequential loss adjustments (in the assessments of subsequent income years or in the assessments of other companies). Many different scenarios can arise because: the amended assessments could result in tax loss or net income being increased or decreased; sharing losses depends on both the level of the loss company’s tax loss and the profit company’s net income (see \[11\]); the loss company may or may not have used or shared all its tax loss; reduced tax losses may need to be reallocated among multiple profit companies; and where a tax loss has been transferred by subvention payment and the tax loss is reduced, the subvention payment may be treated as a dividend. 14 25. The effect of amended assessments on losses is discussed in more detail from \[246\]. Special rules apply to certain types of loss 26. This Interpretation Statement considers the general loss rules in part I of the ITA 2007. 27. Special rules, outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement, also apply to: ring-fenced tax losses including some net losses of mineral miners, attributed CFC net losses, FIF net losses, and PIE net losses; loss offsets on an amalgamation or for a consolidated tax group; pre-1993 losses; deferred deductions (technically not losses) from residential rental properties; and for life insurers, policyholder base excess deductions. Other rules 28. Some points to note about losses and other rules in the Act are set out below. The look-through company rules 29. In relation to the look-through company rules, 15 losses are treated as being incurred by “look-through counted owners”, rather than by the look-through company. There are also specific rules about what happens to losses when a company becomes a look-through company. 11 Including a previous income year or the part-year period in the year of the breach. 12 The net income of the profit company that can be reduced is limited to the lower of the profit company’s whole-year net income and the net income calculated for a part-year period corresponding with the pre-breach period (called the common span). 13 The net income of the profit company that can be reduced is limited to the lower of the profit company’s whole-year net income and the net income calculated for a part-year period corresponding to the post-establishment period (also called a common span). 14 This can be avoided if the subvention payment is repaid. 15 Subpart HB. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 55 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS The qualifying company rules 30. The qualifying company rules contain rules about losses incurred by a company before becoming a qualifying company. 16 There is also a rule that prevents a qualifying company from receiving losses a from loss company in the same group of companies if the loss company is not also a qualifying company. However, going the other way, there is no rule preventing a qualifying company from sharing its losses with a non-qualifying company. 31. The qualifying company rules also contain a special 50% continuity requirement that must be met for a company to retain its status as a qualifying company. 17 Research and development loss tax credit rules 32. Under research and development loss tax credit rules an eligible company can apply to convert tax losses into refundable tax credits. 18 These rules were introduced in 2015 (effective from the 2016 tax year) as part of a Business Growth Agenda designed to encourage business growth and confidence. When a loss amount is converted, Inland Revenue will issue an amended assessment that will show a reduced loss balance. Important concepts Ta x l o s s 33. A tax loss is an important concept in the loss rules. It is essentially the total loss amount for the tax year that a loss company can share or carry forward to the subsequent tax year. 34. A loss company’s “tax loss” for a tax year comprises: the loss balance carried forward to the tax year; as relevant: –less the loss company’s net income for the tax year, or –plus the loss company’s net loss for the tax year; 19 plus various other amounts listed in s IA 2(4). 35. A loss balance carried forward to a tax year is usually 20 the tax loss for the preceding tax year that was not used in that year. 21 The unused tax loss for the preceding tax year may include tax loss components that had been carried forward from earlier tax years. The loss balance carried forward to a tax year must be applied against the net income (if any) of the loss company for the tax year. 36. A person has net income for the tax year if their annual gross income is greater than their annual total deductions. A person has a net loss for the tax year if their annual total deductions are greater than their annual gross income. 22 Tax loss component 37. A tax loss is made up of tax loss components. The concept of a tax loss component is important because continuity and commonality requirements must be tested for each component. Also, tax loss components included in a tax loss must be used in the order in which they arose. 38. Tax loss components include: net losses from previous tax years (included in the loss balance carried forward to the tax year); 16 Subpart HA. The qualifying company regime was superseded by the look-through company regime with application to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011. Companies are no longer able to elect into the qualifying company regime from this date, however, existing qualifying companies can continue to operate under the regime. 17 See s HC 6(3). 18 Subpart MX. 19 A person’s “net loss” for a tax year is the difference between the person’s annual total deductions and their annual gross income (ie, where the annual total deductions exceed the annual gross income). 20 Where there is a breach of continuity in the tax year the loss balance that can be carried forward to the tax year may be limited. This is discussed below in the discussion of the “Part-year rules”. 21 Section IA 3(4). The main way that a company can use a tax loss is by sharing it with a group company (s IA 3(2)). A tax loss can also be used to pay shortfall penalties (IA 3(1)) or to reduce the amount of a taxable distribution received from a non-complying trust (s IA 3(3)). 22 Section BC 4. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 56 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS the loss company’s net loss for the tax year (if any); certain additional amounts listed in s IA 2(4), for example, an amount of converted imputation credits arising under s LE 2; and certain losses arising before the 2009 income year that the loss company was entitled to carry forward under previous legislation. Other terms distinguished 39. The concept of a tax loss can be distinguished from the following loss concepts: Available tax loss describes the loss that can be subtracted from a company’s net income to determine its taxable income. An available tax loss for a tax year includes the company’s loss balance carried forward to the tax year (which is the unused tax loss from the previous year), losses that have been shared with (or “made available to”) the company by other group companies, and various other amounts. Loss balance is essentially the tax loss for a tax year that is not used. It generally becomes the loss balance carried forward for the following tax year. 23 Loss is a term used to describe a depreciation loss or certain losses related to the CFC and FIF rules. It is also commonly used in a general sense when referring to the different loss concepts in the Act. How a loss can be used 40. A loss balance carried forward to a tax year must first be used to reduce the net income (if any) of the loss company for the t a x year. 24 The use of a loss balance carried forward to reduce net income is subject to continuity requirements (discussed from \[48\]) being met. Also, for some types of schedular income, a tax loss cannot be used to reduce a loss company’s schedular income tax liability. 25 41. Any remaining loss balance carried forward (after the loss balance is used to reduce any net income of the loss company) forms part of the tax loss for the tax year. 42. The main way in which a tax loss for a tax year can be used is by sharing it with another company in the same group of companies. 43. A tax loss can also be used in the following ways: A loss company can use its tax loss to pay a shortfall penalty for which it is liable. 26 This is restricted to shortfall penalties that arise from a tax position taken in relation to income tax. 27 For a company, the amount by which the penalty is reduced is equal to the company tax rate multiplied by the tax loss that is used. For example, a company could pay a shortfall penalty of $28,000 using $100,000 of tax loss (at the current 28% company tax rate). The loss company must notify the Commissioner that it wishes to use the tax loss in this way by the due date for the payment of the penalty. 28 Similarly, in only a wholly-owned group, the tax loss of a loss company can be used to pay the shortfall penalty of another company in the group. 29 Where the loss company is a beneficiary of a non-complying trust and has derived a taxable distribution from the trust, the loss company can use its tax loss to reduce the taxable distribution. 30 23 Unless there is a breach in the following tax year, in which case the amount that can be carried forward may be limited. See the discussion of the part-year rules later in this Interpretation Statement. 24 This is part of the calculation of a person’s “taxable income” under the core provisions of the Act. Under s BC 5 a person’s taxable income is calculated by subtracting any available tax loss from their net income. A loss balance carried forward to a tax year is part of a person’s available tax loss (s YA 1). 25 This prohibition is in s IA 8, which also lists the types of schedular income to which the prohibition applies. These include life insurers’ schedular policyholder base income, non-resident passive income for filing taxpayers described in s RB 3, income of non-resident shippers, income of non-resident general insurers, and income subject to an arrangement described in s GB 3BAB.  The calculation of schedular income tax liability is in s BC 7. The approach taken to this type of schedular income is to isolate it and calculate what would be the income tax liability of the person if the schedular income was the only income the person derived in that year. 26 Section IA 3(1). See SPS 16/04: Payment of shortfall penalty using losses (October 2016) for further guidance. 27 Section IW 1(1). 28 You can notify the Commissioner using MyIR or in the other usual ways listed on our website (Contact us). 29 “Wholly-owned group” is defined in s IC 4. Essentially, a wholly-owned group means 2 or more companies in relation to which a group of persons holds ownership interests that total 100%. However, the definition includes an exception to the 100% ownership requirement to cater for small (no more than 3%) ownership interests related to employee share purchase schemes. 30 Section IA 3(3). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 57 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 44. Tax loss components must be used in the order in which they arose. 31 For example, the net loss arising for the 2015 income year (being a tax loss component) must be used before the net loss for the 2018 income year (being another tax loss component). Where a loss company wishes to share a loss with a profit company, 32 this ordering rule applies to the tax loss components that can be shared between the two companies. For example, if a loss company and a profit company have a commonality period 33 that begins at the start of the 2017 income year, and the loss company has one tax loss component from the 2015 income year and another from the 2017 income year, the tax loss component from the 2017 income year can be shared with the profit company even if the loss company has not yet used the tax loss component from the 2015 income year. 45. Any tax loss that is not used for the tax year is carried forward to the next tax year as a loss balance (subject to continuity requirements being met). 46. A temporary rule (part of the COVID-19 pandemic response) allows a tax loss for the 2020 or 2021 tax years to be carried back. This rule is discussed in: “COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 7 (August 2020): 4; and Inland Revenue, COVID-19 Temporary loss carry-back scheme (website last updated 12 July 2021). Carrying forward a tax loss 47. As noted above, the balance of a tax loss that is not used in a tax year can be carried forward to the following tax year. This is subject to continuity requirements being met for the tax loss components that make up the balance of the tax loss. 34 Continuity tests 48. There are two continuity tests: the ownership continuity test; and the business continuity test. 49. At least one of these tests must be satisfied to carry forward a loss. 50. Continuity is tested for each tax loss component and must be maintained for the continuity period applying to each tax loss component. The continuity period is essentially the period from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose to the end of the income year in which the tax loss component is used. 35 Ownership continuity test 51. The ownership continuity test requires that there is 49% continuity in the ownership of the loss company (ownership continuity) over the continuity period. 52. Ownership interests are measured in two ways: voting interests; market value interests 53. In most cases, it will be necessary to consider only voting interests. However, if there is a market value circumstance, it is necessary to consider both voting and market value interests. 54. There are also many rules that affect the measurement of the ownership interests. For example, there are rules that require looking through chains of ownership. These rules and the terms voting interests and market value interests are discussed together (from \[119\]). 31 Section IA 9. 32 Sharing of losses is discussed from \[55\]. 33 See \[76\]. 34 Sections IA 3(4) and IA 5. 35 For the purposes of sharing losses, this period may be extended to the end of the profit company’s income year, if it has a later balance date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 58 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 55. Continuity of ownership is determined by identifying the lowest ownership interest 36 held by an owner during the continuity period. If there is a group of persons 37 whose lowest ownership interests total at least 49%, then the continuity requirement is met. This is illustrated in Example 1. Unless stated otherwise examples in this Interpretation Statement are intended to be read independently of each other (that is, facts in one example are not relevant to other examples). The company names “Loss Co” and “Profit Co” are used in many of the examples (and some figures) to reinforce the roles of the companies. Example 1 - Identifying the lowest ownership interests over the continuity period Loss Co had a net loss for the 2015 income year of $100,000. It wishes to use this loss to reduce net income that it has for the 2023 income year. Loss Co has always had a standard balance date. The continuity period for the 2015 net loss, and for the proposed use in the 2023 income year, is the nine-year period:   beginning on 1 April 2014; and   ending on 31 March 2023. No market value circumstance occurred during the period, so it is necessary to consider only voting interests. Two shareholding changes occurred over this nine-year period: on 23 November 2018 and 4 October 2020. This is illustrated in the following table .38 Voting interests as at 1/4/2014 Voting interests as at 23/11/2018 Voting interests as at 04/10/2020 Lowest voting interest Shareholder 150%50%25%25% Shareholder 250%25%25%25% Shareholder 30%25%50%0% Total 50% Loss Co will be able to carry forward the 2015 net loss of $100,000 to the 2023 income year. This is because the total of Shareholder 1 and Shareholder 2’s lowest voting interests over the continuity period is 50%, which is more than the required 49% ownership continuity. Shareholder 3’s lowest voting interest during the continuity period is 0% as it did not hold any shares at the beginning of the period. Business continuity test 56. The business continuity test is generally concerned with continuity of the nature of the business activities of the loss company, rather than continuity of ownership. 39 57. This test applies when a company fails the ownership continuity test. 58. This test is discussed in a separate Interpretation Statement: IS 22/06 “Loss carry-forward – continuity of business activities”. To avoid complicating the facts, examples in this Interpretation Statement do not take into account any possible reliance on the business continuity test and look solely at the ownership continuity tests where relevant. 36 The Act uses the terms “minimum voting interest” and “minimum market value interest”. 37 Or it could be just one person. 38 This table shows the calculation of the lowest voting interest for the nine-year continuity period. In calculating this amount, it is sufficient to consider the voting interests on only the dates shown in the table. However, a loss company is also required to provide similar information on an annual basis in its company income tax return (IR4). The return requires a loss company to enter the total lowest economic interests of shareholders during the income year. In the 2022 version of the IR4, this was required by question 41. For example, the total lowest economic interests of the shareholders in Loss Co during the 2019 income year would have been 75% (shareholder 1’s interest was 50% for the entire income year, shareholder 2’s interest decreased to 25% during the income year and shareholder 3’s interest was 0% at the beginning of the income year). 39 The rules concerning the business continuity test are in subpart IB. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 59 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Anti-avoidance rules 59. Anti-avoidance rules may apply in relation to arrangements that use or circumvent the continuity rules. 40 These rules are not discussed in detail in this Interpretation Statement. However, a common feature of the rules is that they apply where there is an arrangement and a purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of the loss continuity rules or, in the case of some of the provisions, where the arrangement has tax avoidance as its sole or main purpose. Sharing losses 60. A loss company can share its tax loss with a profit company if the requirements listed in \[61\] are met. Requirements that need to be met to share losses 61. A loss company can share a tax loss with a profit company only if: 41 the loss company meets loss company place requirements; 42 notification and payment requirements are met; 43 the loss company meets a continuity requirement; 44 and the profit company and the loss company meet ownership commonality requirements. 45 Loss company place of incorporation or carrying on business 62. The loss company must, for the commonality period, be either: incorporated in New Zealand; or carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. 63. The second point above means that a branch of an overseas company can be a loss company (if it is carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment here). Generally, “fixed establishment” means a fixed place of business in which substantial business is carried on by a person. 46 64. In relation to the first point above, for a company incorporated in New Zealand, there is an additional requirement. 47 That is, the company must, for the commonality period, not be: treated as not resident in New Zealand by and for the purposes of a double tax agreement (DTA); or liable for income tax in, and under the law of, another country or territory because of domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. 65. In other words, a dual-resident company cannot share a tax loss under the loss rules. 66. The loss company place requirement is illustrated in Figure 1. 67. The residence of the profit company is not important. The profit company may be a non-resident. 48 40 Sections GB 3, GB 3BA, GB 3BAB, GB 3BAC and GB 3B. 41 Section IC 5(1). 42 See s IC 7. 43 See s IC 9. 44 See s IC 2(1). 45 See s IC 6. 46 Definition of “fixed establishment” in s YA 1. The definition of “fixed establishment” also has specific inclusions and exclusions. 47 Note that at the time of writing there was an amendment proposed to repeal this additional requirement. See Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2): cl 78. 48 CIR v Alcan NZ Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439 (CA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 60 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Figure 1 - Loss company place requirement Is the loss company incorporated in NZ? The residence requirement is met The residence requirement is not met Is the loss company carrying on a business in NZ through a fixed establishment? Is the loss company: – liable for income tax in another country or territory because of domicile, residence, or place of incorporation; or – treated as not resident in NZ by a DTA? No No NoYe s Ye s Ye s Notification and payment requirements 68. A loss company must notify the Commissioner that a loss has been shared (whether by election or subvention payment) by: the extended return date, or by a later date, if allowed by the Commissioner. 49 69. Also, a profit company that makes a subvention payment must make the subvention payment by the above dates. 70. The extended return date is 31 March of the tax year following the tax year for which the tax loss is being shared. This date is the same whether the loss company has an early, standard, or late balance date. This is illustrated in Figure 2. 71. For more guidance on the notification requirements, including the Commissioner’s policy on accepting late elections, see SPS 20/02: Loss offset elections between group companies.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 61 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Continuity requirements 72. To share a tax loss component with a profit company, the loss company must meet one of the ownership or business continuity requirements for the tax loss component. The continuity requirements are discussed above from \[13\]. As discussed above, a continuity requirement must be satisfied for the continuity period that applies to the tax loss component. Continuity period extended for the purposes of loss sharing 73. Usually, a continuity period ends on the last day of the loss company’s income year. However, the continuity period may be extended in the context of sharing a loss. 74. For the purposes of sharing, the continuity period for a tax loss component is the period: 50 from the start of the loss company’s income year in relation to which the tax loss component arose; to the end of the loss company’s income year (or the profit company’s income year if it has a later balance date) 51 in relation to which the loss company wishes to use the tax loss component. 75. The extension of the continuity period is consistent with the general principle that a tax loss should be available for use only if continuity has been maintained until the end of the period in which the tax loss is sought to be used. 76. The commonality period (discussed further below) will be the same as the continuity period. 77. In Figure 3, the tax loss component arising from the 2020 income year is carried forward and not used until the 2022 income year. The figure shows that Profit Co has a later balance date and that this extends the continuity and commonality periods that would apply in considering whether the loss can be carried forward and shared. Figure 3 - Extension of continuity period for the purposes of sharing losses 2020 income year (Loss Co) Tax loss component, eg net loss 2021 income year (Loss Co)2022 income year (Loss Co) 2020 income year (Profit Co)2021 income year (Profit Co)2022 income year (Profit Co) Net income Continuity period Commonality period Commonality requirement 78. To share a tax loss component, the commonality requirement must also be satisfied. 79. Before discussing the substance of the requirement, it is noted that the commonality requirement must be satisfied at all times during the “commonality period” for the tax loss component. The commonality period is similar to the continuity period (see \[73\]). The commonality period for a tax loss component is the period: from the start of the loss company’s income year for which the tax loss component arose; to the end of the loss company’s income year (or the profit company’s income year if it has a later balance date) 52 in relation to which the loss company wishes to share the tax loss component. 50 Section IA 5(6). 51 Section s IC 10. 52 Section s IC 10. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 62 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 80. The requirement for the commonality requirement to be met at all times during the commonality period means that: it is important to consider when a company was incorporated or when it became a member of the group of companies; 53 a company will not be able to benefit from a tax loss component from a group of companies if that tax loss component arose before company joined the group; and it is necessary to test commonality at particular times during the commonality period when there are ownership changes. 81. The substantive commonality requirement, applied at a particular time, can be summarised below: The commonality requirement requires consideration of people who hold ownership interests 54 in both the loss company and the profit company. For a person with an ownership interest in both companies, the commonality requirement requires the identification of the lowest of the interests held by the person in the two companies. For example, if at a particular time a person holds a 10% ownership interest in the loss company and a 15% interest in the profit company, their lowest interest in the two companies at that time is 10%. The commonality requirement requires that there is a group of people (which can include a single person) whose lowest interests (as described above) total at least 66%. 55 82. The substantive commonality requirement described in the points above is to establish commonality at a particular time and is illustrated in Example 2. 83. Because the commonality requirement requires that commonality is maintained at all times during the commonality period, the above test may need to be repeated at different times; that is, when there are ownership changes. 84. Different tax loss components will generally have different commonality periods and, therefore, may need to be tested separately, depending on the timing of ownership changes. Example 2 – Calculating the total of the lowest common voting interests On 31 March 2022, Loss Co and Profit Co were owned by Carolyn, Rhys and Leia in the following proportions: OwnerLoss CoProfit CoLowest common voting interest Carolyn25%50%25% Rhys25%25%25% Leia50%25%25% 100%100%75% In the above table, the lowest common voting interest for each person in the two companies is identified in the fourth column. The interest is common in the sense that at least that percentage is held in both companies. These lowest common voting interests are then totalled. The table shows that Carolyn, Rhys and Leia are a group of people who at a point in time (31 March 2022) have 75% commonality of ownership over Loss Co and Profit Co. If, during the commonality period for a tax loss component, the ownership of the companies changes, the same exercise will need to be repeated at different times to ensure the commonality of ownership is at least 66% at all times during the commonality period. 53 “Group of companies” has a specific meaning in the loss rules. Companies for which the commonality requirement are satisfied are referred to as companies in a “group of companies”. Section IC 3(1). Note that the term “group of companies” excludes situations where the companies are multi-rate or listed PIEs. 54 For the ownership interests, it will usually be sufficient to consider voting interests. However, if there is a market value circumstance, it will also be necessary to consider market value interests. 55 It is important to note that this test (which starts by examining the commonality at the individual level) produces a different result from that produced by considering the common ownership interests of the group of persons at the group level. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 63 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Group of persons can change during a commonality period 85. It is not necessary that the group of persons holding the common ownership interests stays the same for the whole of the commonality period. 56 The focus of the ownership commonality requirement is on the ownership of the loss company and profit company being common, not on the identity of the owners. This is illustrated in Example 3. Example 3 – Commonality – the group of persons can change Following on from Example 2, Diya purchases Leia’s shares in both Loss Co and Profit Co. This leads to there being a new “group of persons”. Diya maintains the same level of commonality because she purchased Leia’s shares in both Loss Co and Profit Co: OwnerLoss CoProfit CoLowest common voting interest Carolyn25%50%25% Rhys25%25%25% Leia0%0%0% Diya50%25%25% 100%100%75% Commonality would be breached if Diya subsequently sold her shares in the Loss Co. This is because her individual common ownership interest in Loss Co and Profit Co would be zero: OwnerLoss CoProfit CoLowest common voting interest Carolyn25%50%25% Rhys25%25%25% Leia0%0%0% Diya0%25%0% 100%100%50% 86. Although the group of persons can change for the commonality requirement, to share a loss a loss company must maintain ownership continuity of at least 49% during the continuity period (or satisfy the business continuity requirement). For the ownership continuity requirement, there must be a group of persons who at all times during the continuity period have ownership interests that total at least 49%. For example, if during a commonality/continuity period, 52% of the shares in both the loss and profit companies were transferred to an entirely new owner, the 66% commonality requirement would be met but the 49% ownership continuity requirement would not be met. 87. Note that the focus of Example 2 and Example 3 is to illustrate the calculations required for the commonality test, rather than the continuity test. More information would be needed for the companies in the examples to determine whether the continuity test was satisfied for a particular tax loss component (the examples do not identify a particular tax loss component or continuity period to be tested for continuity). However, the facts of the examples would not necessarily result in a continuity breach as the shareholding change in Loss Co was only 50%. 88. Wholly-owned groups are subject to the same commonality requirement as other groups. In particular, it is important to consider when a company in the group was incorporated or when it became a member of the group. Measurement of common ownership interests 89. The commonality test, like the continuity test, requires a company to keep track of ownership changes. The rules relating to the measurement of ownership interests are discussed from \[119\]. 56 Section IC 3(2). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 64 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Anti-avoidance rule 90. An anti-avoidance rule may apply to treat a company as not meeting the loss grouping requirements. 57 This rule applies when: an arrangement exists that allows a company (offset company 58) to meet the requirements of certain loss-sharing provisions ;59 a share in the offset company or another company has been subject to the arrangement; and a purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of the loss sharing provisions. Special rules apply for certain entities 91. Special loss sharing rules apply for: mixed ownership enterprises (these are certain listed enterprises that the Government owns in part); 60 multi-rate, listed or foreign investment PIEs; 61 losses incurred in connection with development work in Niue. 62 Company trustee cannot share losses 92. A company acting in the capacity as a trustee cannot share losses incurred in that capacity with another company in the same group. This is because s IA 3 (which permits sharing by a loss company) uses the term “company” and this term is defined in s YA 1 to not include a company when acting in its capacity as a trustee. Limitations on sharing Amount that can shared is limited by the profit company’s net income as modified by the loss rules 93. The amount that can be shared with a profit company is limited to the profit company’s net income modified as described below. 63 Profit company’s modified net income 94. A profit company’s net income 64 is modified for the purposes of the loss grouping provisions by subtracting: 65 the profit company’s own losses (that is, any loss balance the profit company has carried forward to the tax year); then a tax loss made available to the profit company by another company, which ensures the total of the losses made available to the profit company by the loss company and any other companies does not exceed the net income of the profit company. 95. The calculation of net income doesn’t usually involve tax losses. Usually, it is only in calculating “taxable income” that losses become part of the calculation. Taxable income is calculated by subtracting any “available tax loss” 66 from net income. 67 Profit company must use the loss to reduce its net income 96. The profit company must use the loss to reduce its net income. 68 The profit company cannot carry forward the loss, share the loss further, or use the loss in any other way. 69 57 Section GB 4. 58 This could be a loss company or a profit company. 59 Subparts IC and IP, and ss IZ 7 and IZ 8. 60 Section IC 3(2A). 61 Section IC 3(2B), (2C), and (2D). 62 Section IC 13. 63 Section IC 8(1) and (2). 64 Net income is the difference between annual gross income and annual total deduction (s BC 4). 65 Section IC 8(3). 66 “Available tax loss” is discussed at \[35\]. 67 Section BC 5. 68 Section IC 5(1) and (3). 69 The only exception to this is if a company in a wholly-owned group has a tax loss for a tax year, the amount of the tax loss may be used to pay a shortfall penalty of another company in the wholly owned group (s IW 1). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 65 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Loss and profit companies can have different balance dates 97. A loss company and a profit company may have income years with different balance dates. This will mean that for a tax year (a tax year always ends on 31 March), the net loss of a loss company and the net profit of a profit company will be calculated based on income years that do not precisely match. This mismatch will not usually affect the amount of tax loss that can be shared with the profit company. 70 However, if the profit company has a later balance date, continuity and commonality requirements must be maintained until the end of the profit company’s income year. 71 Amount that can be shared is limited by certain deductions for bad debts or decline in share value 98. The amount of tax loss that a loss company can share is limited if the: 72 tax loss includes a tax loss component (for example, a net loss) that arose from expenditure that was funded by a loan from another company in the group (the write-off company); 73 and write-off company has taken a bad debt deduction for the loan. 99. In this case, the amount of tax loss that the loss company can share is limited by the amount of the write-off company’s bad debt deduction. This is illustrated in Example 4. Example 4 - Sharing of loss limited by bad debt deduction Loss Co and Group Finance Co are in the same group of companies. Loss Co borrows $10,000 from Group Finance Co (which is in the business of lending money) to cover rental payments on Loss Co’s business premises. The amount was lent under a facility that is a “variable principal debt instrument” and the total value on every day in the income year of all variable principal debt instruments was $50,000 or less (this fact is relevant to Group Finance Co’s ability to claim a deduction as discussed further below). Loss Co uses the money to pay its rent and claims a deduction for the expenditure in its return for the 2023 income year. Loss Co makes a net loss of $15,000 for the 2023 income year. Group Finance Co writes off the $10,000 loan as a bad debt on 31 March 2023 and claims a bad debt deduction in its return for the 2023 income year. Loss Co wishes to share its $15,000 loss with Profit Co, which has net income of $100,000 for the 2023 income year. Loss Co, Group Finance Co and Profit Co all have standard balance dates and are all part of a group of companies (the commonality requirement is satisfied for the commonality period applying to the net loss; that is, during the 2023 income year). The amount that Loss Co can share with Profit Co is limited to $5,000. The remaining loss of $10,000 cannot be shared because Group Finance Co is in the same group of companies and took a deduction for the written off loan that was used to pay for some of the expenditure that led to the net loss. Loss Co can still carry forward the remaining loss of $10,000 and use it to reduce any net income it may have in subsequent income years. 100. A similar rule applies where: 74 the tax loss includes a tax loss component (for example, a net loss) that arose from expenditure that was funded by the loss company issuing shares; and a company (the write-off company) in the same group of companies has taken a deduction for a decline in the value of the shares issued by the loss company. 75 70 The difference in balance dates can limit the amount that can be shared where there is a breach of continuity or commonality as the balance dates will limit the common span. 71 Section IC 10. 72 Section IC 12. 73 The loss company’s expenditure does not need to have been directly funded by the loan. For example, the Write-off company could have lent the money to a different company that then on-lent the amount to the loss company. 74 Section IC 12(1). 75 It is not necessary that the shares were issued directly to the write-off company. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 66 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 101. For the purposes of the above rule, shares are treated as declining in value if: there is a loss on the disposal of the shares; that is, the disposal amount is less than the deduction for the cost of the shares; and where there has not been a disposal, the value of the shares declines, as calculated under subpart EB or otherwise. 102. These rules limit sharing but do not prevent the loss company from carrying forward the tax loss component and applying the loss against its own net income for future tax years. Two ways a loss can be shared 103. The two ways a tax loss can be shared are that the loss company can: 76 make an election to share a tax loss with a profit company; and transfer a tax loss to a profit company in return for a payment (referred to as a subvention payment) by the profit company to the loss company. 104. A combination of these methods can be taken in relation to a tax loss. For example, $100 of tax loss can be transferred $28 by subvention payment and $72 by election. This means the subvention payment can be lower than the total loss transferred. This is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4 – Sharing a loss by election and subvention payment Loss company $100 tax loss Profit company $28 loss transferred in return for subvention payment $28 subvention payment $72 loss transferred by election 105. A subvention payment may be desirable if the loss company has some shareholders who are not shareholders of the profit company (but commonality requirements are nevertheless met). The subvention payment can compensate the shareholders of the loss company for tax they may need to pay in the future because of the loss company’s reduced loss balance. For this reason, it is common for 28 cents to be paid for each dollar of tax loss that is shared (this reflects the 28% company tax rate). 106. In the context of a subvention payment, “payment” has its normal meaning. It is considered that “payment” has a meaning corresponding to the definition of “pay” in s YA 1. “Pay” includes to distribute an amount to a person, credit an amount to a person or deal with the amount in the interest of, or on behalf of, a person. This means a profit company can, for example, make a payment to a loss company by acknowledging a debt to the loss company or by forgiving debt that the loss company owes it. 77 107. A subvention payment cannot be more than the amount of the tax loss that the loss company shares with the profit company. 78 108. A decision to share a loss, whether by election or subvention payment, must be notified to the Commissioner by the extended return date or by a later date if the Commissioner allows. See \[70\]. 76 Section IC 5(2). 77 See also “SPS 20/02: Loss offset elections between group companies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 3 (April 2020): 18, at \[8\]. 78 Section IC 8(1) and (2). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 67 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Subvention payment is not a dividend 109. A loss company may be a shareholder of a profit company. In this case, a payment the profit company makes to the loss company could fall within the definition of “dividend” in s YA 1. However, the loss rules treat a subvention payment made by a profit company to a loss company (its shareholder) as not being a dividend. 79 110. The protection from being a dividend can be lost if the Commissioner amends an assessment of one of the companies and this results in a decrease in the amount of tax loss that can be shared. See \[252\]. Decision to share a loss cannot be changed 111. If a loss company chooses to share a tax loss with a profit company, the loss company cannot later change its mind; the decision is irrevocable. 80 However, this rule does not prevent the Commissioner from making an amended assessment that reverses the sharing of the loss. 81 112. Further, this rule does not prevent a loss company from making further loss elections (or receiving further subvention payments). For example, an amendment to a profit company’s income tax return could result in the sharing of a tax loss being reversed. In such a situation, the loss company could make a further election to share that tax loss with a different profit company. The effect of amended assessments is discussed further at \[243\]. Loss company can also transfer imputation credits when sharing losses 113. Where a loss has been shared with a profit company, the Act also allows (where certain requirements are met) imputation credits to be transferred from the loss company (or another company in the same group of companies) to the profit company. 82 This makes up for the fact the loss offset will decrease the amount of tax paid by the profit company, which will result in the profit company generating fewer imputation credits from tax paid. 83 Measurement of ownership rights 114. As discussed above, to: carry forward losses, a continuity test (ownership or business continuity) must be met; and share losses, a continuity test and the commonality test must be met. 115. Both the continuity and the commonality tests require a loss company to keep track of the ownership interests held in the loss company and (if sharing losses) the profit company. The ownership continuity test involves a 49% threshold, and the commonality test involves a 66% threshold. 116. A taxpayer may need to retain records for longer than is required for other purposes. For example, taxpayers are required to retain certain tax records for 7 years after the income year to which they relate. 84 The burden of proving that a tax loss component can be used is on the taxpayer. To satisfy this burden, a company may need to retain records for longer than 7 years. 117. The provisions considered in this part of the Interpretation Statement (that is, the provisions in subpart YC) are also relevant to other rules in the Act, including the imputation credit rules and associated person rules. However, the discussion in this statement focuses on the application of the provisions in subpart YC to the loss rules. 118. As discussed earlier, two types of ownership interest may be required to be tracked: voting interests and market value interests. Voting interest 119. In a simple case, a person’s voting interest in a company will be the same as the percentage of shares they own. This will be the case if there is only one type of share, no options over the shares, and the shares carry standard decision-making rights. 79 Section IC 5(5). 80 Section IC 5(4). 81 Westpac Securities NZ Ltd v CIR \[2014\] NZHC 3377. See also “SPS 20/03 Requests to amend assessments” (2 June 2020). 82 Section OB 83. 83 For more information, see, “Taxation (annual rates for 2016–17, closely held companies, and remedial matters) Act 2017 - Loss grouping and imputation credits”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 5 (June 2017): 30 at 110. 84 Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 68 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 120. In other cases, it is necessary to have closer regard to the definition of “voting interest” in s YA 1. Under the definition, a person’s voting interest in a company is the percentage that represents shareholder decision-making rights carried by shares, or options over shares, held by the person—compared to the total shareholder decision-making rights for the company. Shareholder decision-making rights 121. A shareholder decision-making right means a right to vote or participate in any decision-making concerning: a dividend or other distribution; the constitution of the company; a variation in the capital of the company; or the appointment of a director of the company. 122. It is possible for the percentage of shareholder decision-making rights carried by a share or option held by a person to differ as between the types of decision-making listed above. If this is the case, then the person’s voting interest in the company equals the average (the total weighted average) of those differing percentages. 123. The calculation of this average gives equal weight (25%) to each of the four types of decision-making listed above. If a person has limited rights in relation to one of these types of decision-making, it will bring down the overall average accordingly. 124. Table 1 illustrates the calculation where a company is owned by two shareholders with equal rights, except in relation to the appointment of directors. Table 1 - Calculation of shareholder decision making rights where proportion differs between types of decision- making rights Type of decision-making rightShareholder 1 (class A shares) Weighted (25%)Shareholder 2 (class B shares) Weighted (25%) Dividends50%12.5%50%12.5% Constitution50%12.5%50%12.5% Capital50%12.5%50%12.5% Directors100%25%0%0% Total weighted average62.5%37.5% Protective rights under the Companies Act 1993 125. Sections 107 and 117 of Companies Act 1993 contain provisions that allow some participation in decision-making that could affect share rights. However, these rights are contingent and temporary in nature. The Commissioner considers that these sections do not give rise to shareholder decision-making rights for the purposes of the loss rules. 126. See “IS 13/02: Income tax – whether certain protective rights conferred by the Companies Act 1993 are shareholder decision-making rights”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013): 3. Voting rights where shares are co-owned 127. If shares are co-owned by two or more people, a situation can arise under the Companies Act 1993 where one of the co-owners is treated as having the right to vote at shareholder meetings to the exclusion of other co-owners. 85 The Commissioner’s view is that in these situations the voting co-owner will have at least some fiduciary obligations to the other co-owners in relation to the exercise of the voting interest. 86 Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, for the purposes of the loss rules, all the coowners will share the shareholder decision-making rights in relation to the share. In practice, the appropriate outcome can be achieved by treating the coowners as if they were a single person in relation to the ownership of the shares for the purposes of determining whether the continuity and commonality requirements are satisfied. 85 The first co-owner listed on the share register is given the right to vote to the exclusion of other co-owners: s 124 and cl 11 of schedule 1 of the Companies Act 1993. This rule applies only where the company does not have a constitution that provides otherwise. 86 Note that fiduciary duties do not generally arise from common ownership of property. However, the Court of Appeal in Sew Hoy v Sew Hoy \[2001\] 1 NZLR 391 accepted the proposition that fiduciary obligations may arise when an advantage is obtained by one co-owner utilising a right attaching to the property to the exclusion of others. The situation arising under the Companies Act 1993 for voting at meetings is a situation where one co-owner is given a right to the exclusion of other co-owners and, therefore, it is a case where at least some fiduciary obligations are likely to exist. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 69 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 128. If one co-owner was treated as having shareholder decision-making rights and the other co-owner or owners were treated as not having shareholder decision-making rights, it could lead to anomalous results. For instance, depending on who was first listed on the share register for each company, a situation could arise where two companies that are both wholly and jointly owned by the same group of persons could be treated as having no commonality of ownership. Further guidance on the timing of share transfers and who “holds” shares 129. For guidance on who “holds” shares and the nominee rule in s YB 21, see “IS 12/01: Income tax – timing of share transfers for the purposes of the continuity provisions”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 20. Market value interest 130. As noted above, in most cases, it will be necessary to consider only voting interests. However, if there is a market value circumstance at any time during the continuity or commonality period, it is necessary to consider both voting and market value interests for the period. 131. The purpose of calculating market value interests is to accurately reflect the person’s economic interest in the company in circumstances when voting interests do not do so. 132. Essentially, a person’s market value interest in a company is the percentage that represents the market value of shares and options the person holds—compared with the total market value of such shares and options in the company. 133. There are a range of financial instruments that could fall within the meaning of a “share” or an option over a share. For example, a profit related debenture can be a “share”. 134. The Act specifically defines “market value” for a share or option. 87 There are two definitions, depending on whether the share or option is listed on the official list of a recognised exchange: If the share or option is listed, market value means an amount equal to the “middle market quotation”. This is essentially the average of the buy and sell prices quoted on the exchange at the close of the market (for example, on the NZX, it will be the average of the “high bid” and “low offer”). This method of determining the market value does not apply if the quotation is not a fair reflection of the market value having regard to certain factors listed in the Act. 88 If the share or option is not listed (or if the above definition cannot be used), market value means the amount a willing purchaser would pay to acquire the share or option in an arm’s length acquisition, which is determined using a method that: –conforms with commercially acceptable practice; –may, in appropriate cases, have regard to the present value of the company’s expected income or cash flows and the realisable value of the company’s assets; and –results in a valuation that is fair and reasonable. Market value circumstance 135. A market value circumstance 89 will exist if: a company has on issue: –a profit-related debenture; 90 or –a stapled debt security; 91 or –a share where: a dividend is guaranteed or secured by a party other than the company; and the directors of the company know or could reasonably be expected to know at the time that the payment of a dividend is so guaranteed or secured; and 87 Section YA 1. 88 See the factors listed in para (e) of the definition of “recognised exchange” in s YA 1. 89 “Market value circumstance” is defined in s YA 1. 90 Section FA 2. Without being exhaustive, this is essentially a debenture with a rate of interest that is set from time to time by reference to either the dividend payable by the company or the profits of the company. 91 Section FA 2B. Without being exhaustive, this is essentially where a debt-security is stapled to a share. Stapled means that the debt security and the share can, or ordinarily can, be disposed of only together. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 70 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS the debenture, security or share is not: –an excluded fixed rate security; 92 or –a pre-1991 budget security. 136. A market value circumstance also exists where: an option exists that is: –to acquire a share in the company (that is, a call option) whether granted by the company or another person; or –to require a person to acquire a share in the company (that is, a put option); and –is not an excluded option. 93 137. Despite the above, a market value circumstance will not exist if: none of the shares on issue have a value higher than zero, except for an excluded fixed rate security or a pre-1991 budget security; and no option has a value higher than zero, except for an excluded option. 138. The main ways that a market value circumstance can arise are summarised in Figure 5. Figure 5 – Market value circumstance A market value circumstance exists if: The company has on issue shares with dividends that are guaranteed or secured by a person other than the company The directors of the company know, or could reasonably be expected to know, that the dividends are guaranteed or secured The company has on issue a stapled debt security The company has on issue a profit-related debenture An option exists in relation to shares in the company The option is not an excluded option The shares, security or debenture are not: ••an excluded fixed rate security; ••a pre-1991 budget security The shares, or options over shares in the company, have a value greater than zero, other than: ••an excluded fixed rate security; ••a pre-1991 budget security ••an excluded option 139. The definition of market value circumstance also contains an anti-avoidance provision, 94 which, if it applies, treats a market value circumstance as existing. 140. The above types of market value circumstances are referred to as “direct market value circumstances”. 141. An example of a market value circumstance is provided in Example 5. 92 “Excluded fixed rate security” is defined in s YA 1. Essentially, this is a fixed rate share or debenture that is a stapled debt security, not a profit-related debenture, and does not give the holder any right to vote or participate in any shareholder decision-making, except for certain protective rights. 93 “Excluded option” is defined in s YA 1. The definition is discussed briefly at \[127\]. 94 Para (e) of the definition of “market value circumstance” in s YA 1. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 71 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 5 - Calculating voting and market interests at a point in time Profit Co is wholly owned by Nadine and her voting interest is 100%. However, a market value circumstance exists for Profit Co because Profit Co has issued a profit-related debenture to Loy. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the market value interests held by Nadine and Loy. Nadine’s shares in Profit Co have a market value of $500,000. This market value reflects the earning potential and the assets and liabilities (including the debenture) of Profit Co. A profit-related debenture comes within the meaning of “share”. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the market value of the debenture held by Loy, which is $175,000. This is the amount that a willing purchaser would pay to acquire the debenture in an arm’s length acquisition (which is likely different from the amount repayable under the debenture). The total market value of these financial instruments is $675,000. Therefore, Nadine’s market value interest is 74% (500/675) and Loy’s market value interest is 26% (175/675). Determining the market value of a share that is subject to an option 142. As noted above, the purpose of calculating market value interests is to accurately reflect the person’s economic interest in the company in circumstances when voting interests do not do so. 143. The loss rules take into account the market value of both shares and options. An option over a share can itself have a value to the holder and, at the same time, influence the value of the underlying share. This creates potential for the same economic interest in the company to be double counted, depending on how the market value of the share is calculated. 144. Therefore, the Act provides that if a share in a company is subject to an option, the market value of the share is calculated having regard to the terms of the option. 95 What this means could differ depending on the terms of the option. Further, discussion is beyond the scope of this Interpretation Statement. 145. The operation of this provision is illustrated in Example 6. Example 6 – Market value of a share having regard to the terms of an option Grant holds shares in a company. The shares are subject to an option also held by Grant. The option allows Grant to require the company to repurchase the shares in the company at $2 a share. In the absence of the option, the shares would have a market value of only $1.80 a share. Grant’s market value interest in the company includes the market value of the shares and the market value of the option. The option has a value of at least 20 cents per share. Because the shares are subject to an option, the market value of the shares must be calculated having regard to the terms of the option. The purpose of having regard to the terms of the option is to avoid double counting. The relevant terms here include that this is a put option. If the value of the shares specified in the option was used, this would double count the value of the option. Therefore, in this case, the value of the shares in the absence of the option should be used, rather than the value specified in the option. Therefore, for the purposes of the loss rules the market value of each share is $1.80. Disregarding certain market value changes 146. A continuity or commonality requirement that has not been met is treated as being met if the: 96 requirement would have been met but for a change in the market value interest of one or more people; and change is attributable to: –a change in the market value of an asset (including an intangible asset) of the company; –a change in the market value of any one or more shares in the company that is not attributable to any change in the terms of those shares; or –a combination of the above. 147. This is illustrated in Example 7. 95 Section YC 3(2). 96 Section YC 16. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 72 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 7 - Disregarding a change in the market value of an asset Loss Co is 100% owned by person A. At all times, person A has voting interests of 100%. Loss Co has a standard balance date. Loss Co had a net loss for the 2022 income year that has not been used. It wishes to use this tax loss component to reduce its net income for the 2023 income year. Therefore, the continuity period for this tax loss component is the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. On 2 October 2021, a profit-related debenture (which is treated as a share under the Act) was issued to person B. The value of the debenture represents 50% of the total market value of shares in Loss Co. In the 2023 income year, the value of Loss Co’s intellectual property (IP) is re-valued, and this results in a decrease in the value of person A’s ordinary shares in Loss Co. After the revaluation, person A’s ordinary shares represent only 40% of the total market value of shares in Loss Co. Because there is a market value circumstance (the issue of a profit-related debenture), it is necessary to consider voting interests and market value interests:   The total of the lowest voting interest for the continuity period is 100% because person A at all times has voting interests of 100%.   The total of the lowest market value interests for the continuity period is only 40%. This is the lowest market value interest held by person A in the period (the lowest market value interest held by person B is 0% because they began the period with 0% market value interests). See the following table. This is illustrated in the following table: Continuity period begins: 1/04/2021 Issue of debenture 2/10/2021 Effect of IP Revaluation 31/03/2023 Continuity period ends: 31/03/2023 Lowest market value interest Person A100%50%40%40%40% Person B0%50%60%60%0% To t a l40% In the absence of a rule disregarding changes in market value, the continuity requirement for carrying forward the 2022 net loss would not be met (40% is less than 49%). However, because the failure to meet the requirement is attributable to the change in the market value of Loss Co’s IP, the continuity requirement is treated as being met under s YC 16. Certain financial instruments are disregarded 148. A variety of financial instruments could carry shareholder decision-making rights (which could result in a voting interest) or fall within the meaning of a share or an option over a share (which could result in a market value interest). However, certain financial instruments are disregarded for continuity and commonality purposes, which means changes in the ownership of these instruments do not need to be tracked. 97 The instruments that are disregarded are: an excluded fixed rate security 98 issued by a company; an excluded option granted in relation to a company; and a pre-1991 budget security 99 issued by a company. 149. These instruments are disregarded in the sense that they are treated as never having been issued or granted and as never having been held by the holder. 97 Section YC 6. 98 “Excluded fixed rate security” is defined in s YA 1. Essentially, this is a fixed rate share or debenture that is a stapled debt security, not a profit-related debenture and does not give the holder any right to vote or participate in any shareholder decision-making, except for certain protective rights. 99 “Pre-1991 budget security” is defined in s YA 1. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 73 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Excluded option 150. The Act contains a detailed definition of “excluded option”. 100 Briefly, it means an option to acquire or dispose of a share in the company in any of the following situations: The option is granted on arm’s length terms and the option does not give the holder any right to vote or participate in any shareholder decision-making (with the usual exceptions to prevent alteration). A specific anti-avoidance rule can apply in this situation. This point is likely to exclude most options from consideration when determining voting or market value interests. The price payable to acquire the share on the exercise of the option is set by reference to the market value of the share on the date the option is exercised (or an amount that is not materially different), and the option does not give the holder any right to vote or participate in any shareholder decision-making (with the usual exceptions to prevent alteration). The directors of the company do not know and could not reasonably be expected to know that the option had been granted. The grantor of the option (or any person associated with the grantor of the option at the time the option is granted) did not hold a share in the company over which the option is granted at the time the option is granted, whether directly or indirectly. However, this point does not apply if the grantor of the option is the company. The share is an excluded fixed rate security, subject to s YC 20 in the case of the credit amount continuity provisions. Essentially, the option relates to a pre-1991 budget security that was granted before the specified time on 30 July 1991 and the terms of the option have not been altered since that time. Death of share or option holder 151. If a person acquires a share or option on the death of a person (the deceased person) as a beneficiary or trustee under the will or intestacy, the person is treated as: having acquired the share or option on the date the deceased person acquired it; and having held it until the person in fact acquired it. 152. This treatment will preserve continuity of ownership in relation to the share or option, which could prevent a breach of continuity that might otherwise have occurred. This is illustrated in Example 8. Example 8 – Death of shareholder Loss Co has a $10,000 tax loss component that arose in the 2017 income year that has been carried forward. Loss Co is 100% owned by person A. On 24 June 2022, person A dies and their shares in Loss Co are transferred to trustee X. Trustee X retains the shares for the duration of the Loss Co’s 2023 income year ending 31 March 2023. In the absence of any rule providing otherwise, this transfer on the death of person A would result in a continuity breach as the total of the lowest voting interests would be zero. However, under s YC 8, trustee X is treated as having acquired the shares when they were acquired by person A (sometime before the 2017 income year). Voting interests as at 1/4/2016 Voting interests as at 24/6/2022 Voting interests as at 31/3/2023 Lowest voting interest Person A100%0%0%0% Tr u s t e e X0%100%100%0% To t a l 0% Section YC 8 treatment Tr u s t e e X100%100%100%100% This preserves ownership continuity for Loss Co, meaning the 2017 tax loss component can be carried forward to the 2023 income year. 100 In s YA 1. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 74 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 153. The transfer of a share in a company on the death of a person could still result in a change in the commonality of ownership of the company and another company in a group going forward. For this reason, where a deceased person had shares or options in two or more companies in a group of companies, and an executor plans to transfer the shares to beneficiaries, the proportions in which the shares in the companies are transferred to beneficiaries may affect whether commonality is preserved. Transfer of share or option on settlement of relationship property 154. Similar treatment applies to a person who acquires a share or option on a settlement of relationship property. In this case, the recipient of the property is treated as: 101 having acquired the share or option on the date it was acquired by the transferor; and having held it until the person in fact acquired it. Shares or options held by trustees 155. For continuity and commonality purposes, all the trustees of a trust that hold (in their capacity as trustees of the trust) a share or option in a company are treated as a notional single person. The notional single person is treated as: not being a company (even if the trustees include corporate trustees); and separate and distinct from any other capacities that the trustees may have (for example, their personal capacities or their capacities as trustees of other trusts). 102 156. This treatment means if there is a change in the ownership of shares resulting from a change in the trustees of the trust, the change in ownership will have no effect on continuity or commonality of ownership. 157. This treatment also means ownership interests are not attributed beyond the notional single person; that is, to the beneficiaries of the trust. Attribution under the look-through ownership attribution rules is discussed from \[181\]. 158. The treatment of shares or options held by trustees is illustrated in Example 9. 159. This treatment is subject to anti-avoidance rules. 103 Example 9 – Shares or options held by trustees Loss Co is 100% owned person A as the sole trustee of trust Z. Person A retires as trustee and is replaced by person B. As a result of the change in trustee, the shares in Loss Co are transferred from person A to person B. The transfer of the shares has no effect on continuity or commonality of ownership because the shares are at all times treated as being held by a notional single person; they are never treated as being held by person A or person B. Special corporate entities (including incorporated societies) 160. The treatment of shares or options held by special corporate entities is similar to the treatment of shares or options held by trustees. However, unlike trustees of a trust, a special corporate entity may be able to share a tax loss. 104 161. A “special corporate entity” includes public and local authorities, incorporated societies, and other specified entities that typically do not issue shares to shareholders. 162. However, for tax purposes a special corporate entity is treated as having issued shares. The shareholders 105 are treated as holding the shares and related rights (including any indirect interests attributed under the look-through rule) as a notional single person (similar to the trustees of a trust). 163. The notional single person treatment will ensure that ownership continuity is always maintained allowing a special corporate entity to carry forward losses. 101 Section FB 10. 102 Section YC 9. 103 See s YC 9(2) to (4) and s GB 5. 104 Trustees of a trust cannot share a tax loss because a trust is not a company (also a corporate trustee is treated as not being a company for these purposes). 105 The shares are treated as held by members, for the time being, of the entity (or by directors if there are no members or, in the case of a public authority or state enterprise that does not have members or directors, by the Minister of the Crown). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 75 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 164. Losses can be shared between a special corporate entity and companies owned by the special corporate entity, provided that commonality and other requirements for sharing are met. However, losses cannot be shared between a special corporate entity and its members. Shareholders holding direct ownership interests of less than 10% 165. For continuity and commonality purposes, ownership interests of less than 10% in a subject company (a loss or profit company) are treated as held by a notional single person. 106 This allows smaller ownership interests to be tracked together as a group. 166. This rule applies where: a person has a direct ownership interest in a subject company of less than 10%; and the person is not a company that is associated with the subject company. 167. Note that this rule applies to direct ownership interests; that is, it is applied before the look-through ownership attribution rules (discussed from \[181\]) are applied. 168. Because the ownership interests of less than 10% are treated as being held by the notional single person and not the direct owner, this rule also has the effect of preventing these ownership interests from being attributed to indirect owners under the look-through ownership attribution rules. 169. The application of this rule is illustrated in Example 10. 170. The ownership interests treated as held by the notional single person may contribute to a company maintaining its continuity of ownership during a commonality period. However, despite the application of this rule, the requirements of a continuity or commonality provision can be treated as not being met in the situation described at \[175\]. Example 10 – Shareholders holding direct ownership interests of less than 10% Loss Co has a $10,000 tax loss component arising from the 2019 tax year that hasn’t been used yet. It wishes to use this loss for the 2023 tax year. Loss Co has a standard balance date. During the continuity period for this tax loss component (1 April 2018 to 31 March 2023) there are two shareholding changes:   On 23 June 2019, shareholder 1 sells all their shares (with voting rights of 45%) to shareholder 5.   On 17 October 2021, shareholder 4 sells all their shares (with voting rights of 7.5%) to shareholder 6. The effect of these changes is illustrated in the following table.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 76 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Shareholders 3, 4, and 6 satisfy the requirements of s YC 10 for their voting interests to be treated as held by the notional single person:   their direct voting interests are less than 10%, and   they are not companies that are associated with Loss Co (that is, none of the associated person tests in s YB 2 are satisfied between them and Loss Co). In this case, the sale of shares by shareholder 4 to shareholder 6 had no effect on the level of voting interests that are treated as held by the notional single person. The combination of the 40% lowest voting interest for shareholder 2 and the 15% lowest voting interests treated as held by the notional single person is sufficient to maintain continuity during the continuity period. Therefore, Loss Co can carry the $10,000 loss forward to the 2023 tax year. 171. If a person’s direct ownership interest increases to 10% or more, the notional single person rule will no longer apply to their interest. In the absence of any relief, this could result in a change of ownership that could impact on continuity and commonality requirements. However, relief is provided by the rule to ensure concessionary treatment described below. This rule would allow the company to account for the ownership interest of the person from the beginning of the continuity or commonality period for the purposes of carrying forward or sharing a tax loss component. Rule to ensure concessionary treatment 172. The rule applying to direct ownership interests of less than 10% is intended to be concessionary for taxpayers. However, in some cases, the application of this concessionary rule can result in continuity or commonality requirements not being met. 107 173. The Act responds to this issue by treating continuity or commonality requirements as being met for a company at a particular time if: the continuity or commonality requirements are not met at the time, but would have been met but for the application to a particular extent of the concessionary rule. 108 174. This is illustrated in Example 11. Example 11 – Breach caused by a person’s ownership interest increasing to 10% or more Same facts as in Example 10, except that on 31 March 2023 shareholder 3 acquires 5% of the shares in the company held by shareholder 5. This takes shareholder 3’s ownership interest from 7.5% to 12.5%. This is outside the coverage of the concessionary rule applying to direct ownership interests of less than 10%. As illustrated in the following table, in the absence of any relief, this change in shareholding would result in a breach of the continuity requirement for Loss Co. Despite there only being a 5% change in ownership, the total lowest voting interest would decrease by 7.5% down to 47.5%, which is below the 49% threshold. 107 See Example 11. Another example is that the treatment under s YC 10 can prevent look-through of small ownership interests to other owners that might have contributed to a relevant threshold being met. 108 Section YC 14.

This means that the continuity requirement would have been met but for the application of the concessionary rule. As a result, the Act will treat the continuity requirement as being met. Therefore, Loss Co can still carry the $10,000 loss forward to the 2023 tax year. Anti-avoidance provision 175. Despite the application of the concessionary rule applying to direct ownership interests of less than 10%, an anti-avoidance provision may apply to treat the continuity or commonality requirements as not being met. 109 176. In determining whether the anti-avoidance provision applies, a company can disregard share and option transactions of a certain type. 110 These include certain on-market and off-market transfers between shareholders or between shareholders and the company. 109 Section YC 15. 110 Listed in s YC 15(1)(b). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 78 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 177. If there are other share transactions that cannot be disregarded, it is necessary to consider whether those transactions would, but for the application of the concessionary rules, have resulted in the breach of a continuity or commonality requirement. If they would, then it is necessary to apply a director knowledge test. 111 Under this test, it is necessary to determine whether the directors of the company knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know without making enquiries specifically for the purposes of applying the continuity provisions, that the transactions (that is, the transactions that cannot be disregarded) would result in the breach of the continuity or commonality requirement. If the director knowledge test is satisfied, then the anti-avoidance provision will treat the continuity or commonality requirement as not being met. 178. The knowledge requirement may be more easily satisfied for companies with few shareholders and whose directors are more involved in the tracing of shareholder changes. Special rules 179. Special rules apply: for a company that is a “special corporate entity” as defined in s YA 1; 112 where an insurer stops being a special corporate entity because of demutualisation; 113 to the Crown’s investment in a mixed ownership enterprise; 114 to reverse takeovers 115 and corporate reorganisations that, economically, would not result in an ownership change that would breach continuity; 116 to the legislative conversion of a foreign company of proprietors; 117 and to the termination of trusts for the sole benefit of the New Zealand government or an overseas government. 118 180. These special rules are outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement. Look-through ownership attribution rules 181. Generally, the look-through ownership attribution rules attribute ownership interests in a subject company 119 up any chain of ownership to the ultimate owners of the subject company (although in some cases, as discussed at \[189\], attribution will stop before reaching the ultimate owner). Generally, the ultimate owners are treated as having ownership interests, and the intermediate owners 120 are treated as not having those interests. 121 182. An ultimate owner may have ownership interests in a subject company through more than one chain of ownership (including through a direct ownership interest). Where this is the case, the ownership interests are aggregated to find the ultimate owner’s ownership interest. 122 183. The look-through mechanism operates by treating a person with an ownership interest in an intermediate company as having a portion of the intermediate company’s (direct or indirect) ownership interest in the subject company. This portion is calculated by multiplying the person’s ownership interest in the intermediate company with the intermediate company’s (direct or indirect) interest in the subject company. 123 This attribution can occur multiple times before the interest is attributed to the ultimate owner (or attribution otherwise stops). The attribution calculation is illustrated in Example 12 (based on voting interests) for one of the ultimate owners of a subject company. The attribution calculation needs to be performed for all the ultimate owners unless a look-through exception applies. 111 Section YC 15(1)(c). 112 Section YC 5. The definition of special corporate entity includes, among other entities, public and local authorities, and other specified entities that typically do not issue shares to shareholders. 113 Section YC 17. 114 Defined in s YC 5B and listed in part B of sch 36. There were four mixed ownership enterprises as of 2 May 2022: Air New Zealand Ltd, Genesis Energy Ltd, Meridian Energy Ltd, and Mighty River Power Ltd (now Mercury NZ Ltd). 115 Section YC 18. 116 Section YC 18B. 117 Section YC 19. 118 Section YC 19B. 119 This statement uses the term “subject company”. Note s YC 4 refers to this company as the “issuing company”. 120 This statement uses the term “intermediate owner”. Note s YC 4 refers to this company as the “shareholder company”. 121 This is provided for in s YC 4(2) (for voting interests) and (5) (for market value interests). 122 Section YC 4(2) and (5). 123 Section YC 4(3) and (6). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 79 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 12 – Attribution calculation for one ultimate owner Ultimate owner Intermediate company 2 Intermediate company 1 Subject company 50% voting interest 50% voting interest 50% voting interest 12.5% interest in subject company (50% x 25%) 25% interest in subject company (50% x 50%) 50% interest in subject company 184. Where a company in a chain of ownership has a market value circumstance, it will also be necessary to calculate the market value interests held in that company (that is, using the market value calculation). For other companies in the chain of ownership that do not have a market value circumstance, voting interests in those companies are used to calculate indirect market value interests in the subject company and to attribute market value interests to the ultimate owners. 124 This is illustrated in Example 13 with respect to one of the ultimate owners. Example 13 - Look-through – market value interests Ultimate owner Intermediate company 2 Intermediate company 1 Subject company 50% voting interest 50% market value interest (using market value measurement) Direct market value circumstance 50% voting interest 12.5% interest in subject company (50% x 25%) 25% interest in subject company (50% x 50%) 50% interest in subject company 185. In Example 13, a direct market value circumstance exists in relation to intermediate company 1 (for example, because intermediate company 2 holds a non-market option over shares in intermediate company 1). 186. Because of this, intermediate company 2 must calculate its market value interest in intermediate company 1. The market value interest in intermediate company 1 is then used to calculate intermediate company 2’s indirect market value interest in the subject company. To do this, intermediate company 2 must multiply its market value interest in intermediate company 1 by intermediate company 1’s voting interest in the subject company. This gives intermediate company 2 a 25% market value interest in the subject company. 124 Section YC 4(8). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 80 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 187. It is also necessary for intermediate company 2’s 25% market value interest in the subject company to be attributed to the ultimate owner. This is attributed based on the ultimate owner’s voting interest in intermediate company 2. This is calculated by multiplying the ultimate owner’s 50% voting interest in intermediate company 2 by intermediate company 2’s 25% market value interest in the subject company. 188. This gives the ultimate owner a 12.5% market value interest in the subject company from this chain of ownership. This interest is added together with any other interest that the ultimate owner has in the subject company through other chains of ownership. For example, if the ultimate owner also has direct voting rights of 10% in the subject company, then overall it would have a market value interest of 22.5% (12.5% + 10%). Look-through may stop with an intermediate company in a chain of ownership 189. Generally, the look-through rule will continue to attribute interests in a subject company until the interest is attributed to a natural person (or to a notional single person as in the case of shares held by trustees). However, in the following cases, attribution will stop with an intermediate company in a chain of ownership. This is to reduce compliance costs associated with attribution. Attribution stopping at limited attribution company 190. Attribution will stop with a limited attribution company if the company’s (direct and indirect) ownership interests in the subject company total less than 50%. 125 This is illustrated in Example 14. 191. “Limited attribution company” is defined in s YA 1 as a company that is a building society, registered co-operative company, listed company, widely-held company, or foreign company that is not a closely-held company. Example 14 – Attribution stopping at limited attribution company Shareholders Limited Attribution Company Subject company 100% voting interest 34% voting interest Direct voting interest 15% Intermediate company Attribution stops at the limited attribution company because the direct (15%) and indirect (34% (100% x 34%)) voting interests total 49%, being less than 50% Attribution stopping with intermediate company if the amount that would be attributed is less than 10% 192. The attribution of a portion of ownership interests in a subject company will stop with an intermediate company if the: 126 portion that would otherwise be attributed by the intermediate company to a person is less than 10%; and person is not associated with the subject company. 193. This is illustrated in Example 15. 125 Section YC 11(2). 126 Section YC 11(3). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 81 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 15 – Attribution stopping with intermediate company if amount that would be attributed is less than 10% Attribution stops at the intermediate company because the portion that would be attributed from the intermediate company is less than 10% (50% x 16% = 8%). The person’s other voting interest of 15% is not relevant to this attribution rule. Person (not associated with subject company) Subject company Intermediate company Direct voting interest 15% 16% voting interest 50% voting interest Variation to attribution intended to be concessionary 194. The above variations to the general look-through rule are intended to be concessionary. If continuity or commonality requirements would have been met but for the application of these variations, then the continuity or commonality requirements are treated as being met. 127 This is subject to the same condition as described at \[174\]. Special look-through rules for certain types of entity 195. Special look-through rules apply in relation to certain types of entity and situations, including rules relating to: public unit trusts; 128 and corporate spin-outs. 129 196. These special rules are outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement. Part-year rules Introduction 197. Under the general loss rules, for a tax loss component to be used for a tax year, the loss company must meet the continuity requirement: from the start of the period in which the tax loss component arose; until the end of the income year corresponding to the tax year in which the loss is sought to be used. 198. Similarly, for a tax loss to be shared, commonality must also be satisfied for this period. 199. The part-year rules 130 recognise that part way through an income year there could be an event (for example, a change in the shareholding of a loss company) that results in continuity or commonality being breached 131 or established 132 for a tax loss component and a group of persons. 200. In the absence of the part-year rules, if a continuity or commonality event occurred part way through the income year, this could prevent a tax loss component from being used or shared for the corresponding tax year or from being carried forward. 127 Section YC 14. 128 Section YC 12. 129 ection YC 13. 130 The part-year rules are in subpart IP. 131 For tax loss components in the income year and in previous income years. 132 Generally, for part of the net loss for the tax year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 82 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 201. In these cases, the part-year rules ensure certain losses can still be used in the relevant part-year periods. This is consistent with the purpose of the loss rules (to ensure that, largely, losses are available to be used by the people who ultimately incurred the losses 133 ) and avoids an outcome that would otherwise follow from the assessment of income tax on an annualised basis. 202. There are also part-year rules that cater for breaches of the business continuity rules. However, these are outside of the scope of this Interpretation Statement. See the Interpretation Statement IS 22/06 “Loss carry-forward – continuity of business activities”. Summary of what the part-year rules do 203. Where there is a continuity breach for a tax loss component from an earlier income year, under the part-year rules the component can still be used to reduce the pre-breach net income of the loss company. Then, if commonality is satisfied, the tax loss component from the earlier income year can be used to reduce the pre-breach net income of a profit company. 134 204. Similarly, if there is a tax loss component (for example, a net loss) for the pre-breach part of the income year, 135 the amount could, if commonality were satisfied during that part-year period, be shared and used to satisfy the pre-breach net income of a profit company. 136 205. Following a breach of continuity, the part year rules allow a loss company to carry forward a net loss for the post-breach period. 206. The part-year rules also cater for the possibility that commonality is established part-way through the income year between a loss company and a profit company. In this case, where the commonality is maintained for the part-year period, the part year rules allow sharing of the net loss incurred in the part-year period. 137 Carrying forward losses under the part-year rules 207. There are two carry forward scenarios to consider for a loss company: Where there has been a breach of continuity in an income year for a tax loss component from a previous income year, the tax loss component can potentially be carried forward to the breach income year. 138 This is sometimes referred to as a loss that is “brought forward”. Where there is a breach of continuity that would affect a net loss for a tax year, a post-breach net loss can be carried forward to the subsequent tax year. Carrying forward to the breach income year 208. If there has been a breach of continuity in an income year for a tax loss component that arose in a previous income year, it may still be possible for at least part of the tax loss component to be carried forward to the pre-breach part of the income year. 209. The tax loss component can be carried forward to the extent that the loss company can use or share the loss in the pre- breach period. Any excess amount cannot be carried forward to the income year and will not be available in subsequent income years. 210. The loss company can use the tax loss component to reduce the loss company’s net income for the pre-breach part of the income year. 139 The loss company will need to provide adequate financial statements to support its calculation of the net income in this part-year period. 133 To the extent that the business continuity rules do not apply. 134 This is also limited to the full year net income if that is lower (ss IP 4(2)(ab) and (4) and IC 8). The full year net income might be lower if income and expenses fluctuate for the profit company during the income year. 135 The part-year rules are not restricted to net loss tax loss components, but this will be the main type. Other types of tax loss component such as CFC and FIF losses are outside the scope of this statement. For simplicity, in the year of breach, the rest of this part of the statement will simply refer to net losses. 136 This is also limited to the full year net income if that is lower (ss IP 4(2)(ab) and (4) and IC 8). The full year net income might be lower if income and expenses fluctuate for the profit company during the income year. 137 As noted above, CFC and FIF losses are outside the scope of this statement but note that the part-year rules do not apply to the sharing of these types of loss. See s IQ 4(2)(d). 138 Remember that continuity is tested for each tax loss component. Different tax loss components may have different continuity periods and, therefore, be affected by different share transactions during those periods, for example. 139 The loss company does not need to have net income for the tax year as a whole. For example, the loss company could have a net loss for the tax year as a whole, with net income in the pre-breach period and a larger net loss in the post-breach period. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 83 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 211. This is illustrated in Figure 6 below. In Figure 6, a total of $10,000 can be carried forward to the income year because that is how much loss can be used in the pre-breach period ($6,000 can be used to reduce the loss company’s net income in the pre-breach period and $4,000 can be shared in the pre-breach period as the profit company has net income in the period of $4,000). In the company income tax return (form IR4), $10,000 is entered as the “net losses brought forward” amount. 140 The remaining $2,000 of the tax loss component from the previous year cannot be carried forward to the income year and will not be available in subsequent income years. 212. Carrying forward a loss to a breach income year is also illustrated in Example 16 and Example 17. 213. Sharing losses under the part-year rules is discussed below from \[219\]. Figure 6 – Tax loss component from a previous income year carried forward to breach income year Tax loss component from previous year $12,000 Loss balance carried forward $10,000 Net income in pre-breach period $6,000 Amount that can be shared in pre-breach period $4,000 Not carried forward to the income year $2,000 Breach Net income of $4,000 in pre-breach period Loss company income year Profit company income year Example 16 - Carrying forward to the income year Loss Co made a $100,000 net loss in the 2021 income year. This is Loss Co’s only tax loss component. In the 2022 income year Loss Co had net income of $150,000. Loss Co has always had a standard balance date. Shares in Loss Co were sold on 5 October 2021 (during the 2022 income year), which resulted in an ownership continuity breach for the 2021 net loss amount. Loss Co prepares part-year financial accounts that show net income of $82,000 for the period from 1 April 2021 to 5 October 2021. Loss Co can use $82,000 of the 2021 net loss to reduce its net income in the pre-breach period to zero. Loss Co also identifies from part year accounts that it can share $10,000 of the 2021 net loss with another company under the part-year loss rules (discussed from \[219\]). Therefore, in total, Loss Co can carry forward $92,000 ($82,000 +$10,000) of the 2021 net loss to the pre-breach period for the above uses. Loss Co therefore enters $92,000 as the “net losses brought forward” in field 28A of the 2022 company income tax return (form IR4). The remaining $8,000 of the 2021 net loss cannot be carried forward and will no longer be available. 140 In the 2022 version of the IR4, this was field 28A. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 84 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 17 – Part-year net income, full year net loss Loss Co made a $15,000 net loss in the 2013 income year, which it has been able to carry forward over the years. Loss Co has always had a standard balance date. On 31 October 2022, shares in Loss Co are sold. This share sale results in ownership continuity for the 2013 net loss falling below the 49% continuity threshold. In the 2023 income year, in the part-year period before the continuity breach, Loss Co had net income of $10,000. In the part- year period after the breach, Loss Co had a net loss of $50,000. Loss Co can carry forward $10,000 of the 2013 net loss to the 2023 income year to reduce the $10,000 pre-breach net income. The remaining $5,000 of net loss from 2013 cannot be carried forward and will no longer be available. Carrying forward a post-breach net loss 214. Where a breach of continuity would affect a net loss arising in the income year of the breach, a net loss amount can still potentially be carried forward to the subsequent income year. 141 This net loss amount is the lowest of: 142 the net loss for the post-breach period; the net loss for the income year as a whole (the net loss for the income year as a whole may be lower if, for example, the company’s profitability varies during the year); or zero, if the loss company has net income for the income year as a whole. 215. This is illustrated in Figure 7 and Example 18. 216. To carry forward a post-breach net loss from the tax year, the loss company would need to provide adequate financial statements to support the calculation of the post-breach amount. 217. Alternatively, the post-breach amount could be shared. Sharing losses under the part-year rules is discussed from \[219\]. Figure 7 – Carrying forward a post-breach net loss Subsequent income year Net profit/loss for income year Pre-breach net profit/loss If net loss, could potentially be shared in pre-breach period Cannot be carried forward Post-breach net loss Could be shared in post-breach period The lesser of these (or zero if net profit) can be carried forward Breach Income year 141 Section IP 3(4). 142 Section IP 3(5). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 85 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 18 - Carrying forward a post-breach net loss On 23 November 2022 (during the 2023 income year), Loss Co’s majority shareholder sold his 80% share in the company. Loss Co has always had a standard balance date. Based on part-year financial accounts, in the pre-breach period from 1 April 2022 to 22 November 2022, Loss Co had net income of $10,000. In the post-breach period from 23 November to 31 March 2023, Loss Co had a net loss of $30,000. Therefore, for the whole income year, Loss Co had a net loss of $20,000. The change in shareholding on 23 November 2022 results in an ownership continuity breach with respect to the net loss for the 2023 income year. Despite the breach, the part-year rules allow Loss Co to carry forward $20,000 of net loss (the amount carried forward is limited to the full year net loss as this is lower than the post-breach amount). Pre-breach tax loss components not shared are not available going forward 218. If a loss company has a pre-breach tax loss component (for example, a net loss), this could be shared with a profit company and used by the profit company to reduce net income for a part-year period (see from \[219\]). 143 If the tax loss component cannot be shared, it will not be available going forward. This is illustrated in Figure 7. Sharing losses under the part-year rules Introduction 219. The part-year rules on sharing allow the following: A tax loss component from a previous income year may be shared with a profit company, to the extent that it is used to reduce the profit company’s net income for a period before the breach, referred to in the legislation as a common span (discussed below at \[226\]). The net loss for the pre-breach period in the income year may be shared with a profit company; again, to the extent that it is used to reduce the profit company’s net income for the common span. Part of a net loss for an income year may be shared where a group of persons establishes commonality between a loss company and a profit company part way through an income year. The net loss for the period after commonality is established can be shared and used by the profit company to reduce the profit company’s net income for a corresponding period, which is also referred to as a common span. Notification and adequate financial statements are required 220. To use the part-year sharing rules, the loss company must notify the Commissioner of the part-year treatment of the tax loss. 144 The loss company must give this notification by its extended return date or by a later date allowed by the Commissioner (this is the same notification timeframe that applies for sharing losses generally, see \[68\]). 221. The loss and profit companies must also provide adequate financial statements that calculate the part-year net loss and net income amounts, as discussed from \[238\]. Sharing can be limited by the profit company’s full-year net income 222. Under the general sharing rules, the amount of a tax loss that a loss company can share with a profit company is limited by the net income of the profit company. 145 223. In the part-year rules, the amount that can be shared is limited by the lower of the net income of the profit company: that is allocated to the part-year period (common span); or for the whole tax year. 224. The net income for the whole tax year might be lower due to seasonal differences in the profitability of a company’s business, for example. 225. The amount that can be shared is not limited by the whole-year net loss of the loss company (where that is lower than the net loss calculated for the part-year period). 143 The loss company might also have tax loss components from previous income years that it can share in the pre-breach period. 144 Under s IP 7. 145 Remember that a profit company’s “net income” is modified for this purpose. See \[45\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 86 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Sharing can be limited by the common span 226. The common span is a period that defines the: losses in the breach year that can be shared; and net income of the profit company that can be reduced by the losses. 227. Where there is a breach of continuity or commonality, there will be a pre-breach common span. This will be relevant to a tax loss component from a previous income year and to any net loss for the part-year period leading up to the breach. 228. There will also be a post-establishment common span where continuity or commonality is established part way through the income year. This will be relevant to the net loss for the part-year period following the breach or establishment of continuity or commonality. 229. Loss sharing in a pre-breach common span and a post-establishment common span is illustrated in Example 19. Part-year sharing where the loss and profit company have the same balance date 230. If the loss company and the profit company have the same balance date, the common span is the corresponding part of the loss company’s income year and the profit company’s income year, during which the commonality and continuity requirements are met. 231. See Figure 8, which assumes that commonality exists between Loss Co and Profit Co 1 until a shareholding change at which point the commonality is breached. However, after the shareholding change, commonality is established between Loss Co and Profit Co 2. Figure 8 – Common spans – loss and profit companies with the same balance dates Breach 1 April 31 March31 December Pre-breach common span 9 months Commonality between Loss Co and Profit Co 1 Commonality between Loss Co and Profit Co 2 Pre-establishment common span 3 months Income year (same for all three companies) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 87 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 19 - Application of part-year rules Initially, Loss Co is 100% owned by Red Holdings Ltd. Red Holdings also owns 70% of the shares in Red Profit Co. The initial shareholding of Loss Co is shown below: Red Holdings Ltd Red Profit CoLoss Co 70%100% On 31 December 2022 (in the 2023 income year), Red Holdings Ltd sells all its shares in Loss Co to Blue Holdings Ltd. Blue Holdings Ltd also owns 80% of the shares in a company called Blue Profit Co. The new shareholding of Loss Co is: Blue Holdings Ltd Blue Profit CoLoss Co 80%100% This sale of shares breaches Loss Co’s continuity for all its tax loss components. It also breaches commonality between Loss Co and Red Profit Co for all the tax loss components but establishes commonality with Blue Profit Co in relation to part of the net loss for the 2023 income year. Loss Co, Red Profit Co and Blue Profit Co all have standard 31 March balance dates. Loss Co has $500,000 of tax loss components from previous income years and a $100,000 net loss for the 2023 income year. Financial statements prepared for Loss Co show that $75,000 of the net loss arose in the pre-breach common span (1 April to 31 December) and $25,000 in the post-establishment common span (1 January to 31 March). Financial statements prepared for Red Profit Co show that it had net income of $400,000 for the pre-breach common span. Financial statements prepared for Blue Profit Co show that it had net income of $30,000 in the post-establishment common span, but net income of only $20,000 for the 2023 income year as a whole. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 88 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Pre-breach common span Loss Co can share $400,000 of tax loss components from previous income years with Red Profit Co in the pre-breach common span. This is the amount that is entered as the “net losses brought forward” in the company income tax return (form IR4). The other $100,000 of tax loss components from previous income years cannot be brought forward and will no longer be available. Further, the $75,000 net loss from the pre-breach common span cannot be used as Red Profit Co does not have any more income in the pre-breach common span. Post-establishment common span Loss Co can share $20,000 of the $25,000 net loss from the post-establishment common span with Blue Profit Co. This is capped at the amount of Blue Profit Co’s net income for the income year, which is lower than the net income for the common span. Carried forward to next tax year Loss Co can carry forward the remaining $5,000 of net loss from the post-establishment common span to the next tax year. Part-year sharing where loss and profit company do not have the same balance date 232. If the loss company and the profit company do not have the same balance date, then the common span is the part of the profit company’s income year during which the commonality and continuity requirements are met. This is illustrated in the following figures. 233. The following figures also illustrate some of the limitations on part-year sharing that are caused by differing balance dates. These scenarios assume that the requirements for sharing, including the provision of adequate financial statements, are met. 234. In Figure 9, $5,000 of the loss company’s net loss can be shared and off-set against the profit company’s pre-breach net income of $5,000. The $2,500 of net loss cannot be shared.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 90 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Figure 12 – Post-establishment common span where profit company has an earlier balance date 31 December 30 June 30 September Breach Net loss in common span $70,000 Net income in common span $80,000 Post-establishment common span 6 months Net loss $30,000 Can carry forward Profit company income year Loss company income year Adequate financial statements 238. For the part-year rules to apply, the loss and profit companies must provide adequate financial statements to support the allocation of the net loss and net income to the part-year periods. 239. Adequate financial statements are required for a loss company to: carry forward losses from an earlier year to the tax year to reduce its pre-breach net income; 146 the loss company must provide statements to support the pre-breach net income amount; carry forward a post-breach net loss for a tax year to the subsequent tax year; 147 the loss company must provide statements to support the post breach net loss amount; share a pre- or post-breach net loss with a profit company; 148 the loss company and the profit company must provide statements to support the loss company’s net loss and the profit company’s net income amounts in the relevant common span periods, as relevant; and share losses carried forward to the tax year with a profit company in the pre-breach period; 149 the profit company must provide statements to support its net income in the pre-breach common span. 240. The financial statements need to calculate net loss and net income amounts (as relevant) for the appropriate common span periods. It is important to remember that where a loss company and the profit company do not have the same balance date, the common span is defined by the profit company’s income year and the breach date. For a loss company, it is not necessarily sufficient to merely determine the pre- or post-breach net income amounts (see Figure 9 and Figure 12). 241. The net loss and net income amounts must be determined on a fair and reasonable basis of attribution. This will generally require an attribution based on the timing of the income derived and the deductible expenditure incurred during the income year. 242. For practical guidance on preparing these financial statements, see “SPS 20/02: Loss offset elections between group companies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 3 (April 2020): 18 at \[26\] to \[28\]. 146 Under s IP 3(2). 147 Under (s IP 3(4). 148 Under s IP 4(2). 149 Under s IP 5(2). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 91 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Amended assessments 243. The Commissioner may amend an assessment of a loss company or a profit company. 150 Amendments to the income or deductible expenditure of a company can lead to consequential loss adjustments 151 for the company in assessments for subsequent income years, or in the assessments of other companies. Many different scenarios can arise because: the amended assessments could result in tax loss or net income being increased or decreased; sharing losses depends on both the level of the loss company’s tax loss and the profit company’s net income; the loss company may or may not have used or shared all its tax loss for a tax year; reduced tax losses may need to be reallocated among multiple profit companies; and where a tax loss has been transferred by subvention payment and the tax loss is reduced, the subvention payment may be treated as a dividend. 152 244. Amended assessments are discussed in SPS 20/02. 245. The following sections discuss two scenarios and particular rules that apply in those scenarios: consequential adjustments where net losses have been shared with multiple profit companies and the effect of decreased tax losses on subvention payments. Consequential adjustments where net losses have been shared with multiple profit companies 246. If after a reduction to a tax loss component, a loss company’s adjusted tax loss for a tax year is still higher than the amount that has been shared with profit companies for that tax year, then no further action is required by the profit companies. 247. However, if the adjusted tax loss for a tax year is lower than the amount that was shared, the amount by which the profit companies reduced their net income using the tax loss will require adjustment. 153 248. Subject to one exception, the loss company can choose how the adjustment is allocated between the profit companies. The exception is that a loss company cannot allocate more than a proportionate amount of the adjustment to a profit company that, at the time of the allocation, is no longer a member of the group of companies. If the loss company does, the allocation will be disregarded. 249. The loss company must notify the Commissioner of the allocation within a notification period. This notification period is: six months after the date on which the Commissioner notifies the loss company that the adjustment is required; or a longer period agreed by the Commissioner. 250. If the loss company does not make an allocation, then the tax loss amounts shared with the profit companies are decreased in the same proportion as the loss company’s tax loss has decreased (referred to as a proportionate reduction). 251. This is illustrated in Example 20. 150 Under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TA A). Amendments to underlying assessments, for example, changes to income or allowable deductions, are generally subject to the disputes process. If an amendment is not agreed and other exceptions do not apply, the Commissioner is required to propose the amendment in a notice of proposed adjustment and follow the disputes process to determine whether to make the assessment. 151 Consequential adjustments to losses are not subject to the disputes process. See s 89C(d), (g) and (k) of the TAA. These assessments simply reflect the underlying assessment of income and deductions for example, which will either have been agreed or made because of a direction from the Taxation Review Authority or a court. 152 This can be avoided if the subvention payment is repaid. 153 Section IC 11. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 92 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 20 – Adjustment to tax loss shared with profit companies Loss Co filed its return for the 2020 tax year claiming a net loss of $100,000. This was Loss Co’s only tax loss component. Loss Co shared $75,000 of the $100,000 net loss equally with three profit companies in the same group of companies. Each profit company reduced its net income for the 2020 tax year by $25,000. Following an audit of the 2020 return in 2022, an amended assessment was proposed with a reduced net loss of $50,000. At the same time, the Commissioner notified Loss Co that the total amount of tax loss shared with the profit companies is greater than the adjusted tax loss proposed. Therefore, consequential adjustments are also proposed to the amount shared with the profit companies. Loss Co agrees to the Commissioner’s proposed adjustment and does not make any allocation of the amount by which the tax loss shared exceeds the adjusted tax loss. Therefore, the profit companies make a proportionate reduction as follows: Loss Co OriginalAdjustedAdjustment Tax loss$100,000$50,000$50,000 Tax loss shared$75,000$37,500$37,500 Tax loss remaining$25,000$12,500$12,500 Profit companies (Reduction in net income) OriginalAdjustedAdjustment Profit Co 1$25,000$12,500$12,500 Profit Co 2$25,000$12,500$12,500 Profit Co 3$25,000$12,500$12,500 To t a l$75,000$37,500$37,500 Note the proportionate reduction does not result in all $50,000 of the adjusted net loss being shared. A loss balance of $12,500 remains with Loss Co. Variation – Loss Co instead allocates the adjusted tax loss This variation has the same facts as above, except Loss Co chooses how to allocate the loss adjustment between the profit companies and notifies the Commissioner of the allocation within six months of the Commissioner’s loss adjustment notification: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 93 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Loss Co OriginalAdjustedAdjustment Tax loss$100,000$50,000$50,000 Tax loss shared$75,000$50,000$25,000 Tax loss remaining$25,000$0$25,000 Profit companies (Reduction in net income) OriginalAdjustedAdjustment Profit Co 1$25,000$25,000$0 Profit Co 2$25,000$12,500$12,500 Profit Co 3$25,000$12,500$12,500 To t a l$75,000$50,000$25,000 In this variation, Loss Co has fully allocated the $25,000 decrease in the tax loss between Profit Co 2 and Profit Co 3 and has shared all the adjusted tax loss leaving itself with a zero loss balance. Effect of decreased tax losses on subvention payments 252. As discussed above, where a profit company pays a loss company a subvention payment for a loss, the subvention payment is treated as not being a dividend for the loss company (the payment could be a dividend if the loss company is a shareholder of the profit company). This protection from being a dividend applies only to the extent to which a tax loss is subtracted from the profit company’s net income. 154 253. Therefore, if an amendment is made and, consequently, less tax loss can be shared with the profit company, a subvention payment received by a loss company could be treated as a dividend. 254. However, if a subvention payment received by a loss company is treated as a dividend, the dividend is reduced to the extent that the subvention payment is repaid by the loss company within a notification period. 155 The notification period is: 156 six months after the date on which the Commissioner notifies the loss company that an adjustment is required to the tax loss shared with the profit company; or a longer period agreed by the Commissioner. 255. This is illustrated in Example 21. 154 Section IC 5(5). 155 The repayment can be made in any of the ways a subvention payment could be made. Payment has a meaning corresponding to “pay” in s YA 1. 156 Section IC 11(6). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 94 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 21 - Effect of decreased tax loss on subvention payment Loss Co filed its return for the 2020 tax year on 31 March 2021 claiming a net loss of $100,000. This was Loss Co’s only tax loss component. Loss Co shared the full $100,000 of net loss with Profit Co. In return, Profit Co made a subvention payment to Loss Co of $28,000. In other words, the $100,000 net loss was shared $72,000 by election and $28,000 by subvention payment. The subvention payment was made on 31 March 2021, the same day Loss Co filed its return. Profit Co used the loss to reduce its net income by $100,000. Loss Co and Profit Co both have standard balance dates. Loss Co is a shareholder in Profit Co. Section IC 5 applied to prevent the $28,000 payment from Profit Co to Loss Co from being a dividend. However, on 1 September 2022, as a result of an audit of the 2020 return, the Commissioner proposed to amend Loss Co’s assessment with a reduced net loss of $20,000. On the same date, the Commissioner pointed out to Loss Co that the $100,000 net loss shared with Profit Co is greater than the $20,000 adjusted net loss proposed by the Commissioner. Loss Co agreed to the Commissioner’s proposed adjustment. As a result, a consequential adjustment was also made to Profit Co’s assessment on the basis that the net loss shared by Loss Co with Profit Co is only $20,000 rather than $100,000. This results in Profit Co having an additional $80,000 of net income. Further, on 5 February 2023, within six months of the Commissioner’s notification, Loss Co chose to repay $22,400 of the $28,000 subvention payment that it received from Profit Co (this reduced the subvention payment to $5,600, which is 28% of $20,000). As a result, the adjusted subvention payment is not more than the total loss shared with Profit Co and, therefore, no part of the subvention payment received by Loss Co is treated as a dividend. If Loss Co had not repaid any of the subvention payment it would have had dividend income of $8,000 in the 2021 tax year (the amount by which the original subvention payment exceeded the total loss shared). Reporting obligations Return requires information about minimum ownership interests 256. The company income tax return requires a loss company to enter the total lowest economic interests of shareholders during the income year. 157 257. Note that the “total lowest economic interests” is an annual measurement that is required under the return to help keep track of ownership changes in the income year. This is relevant for determining how a net loss for the income year can be used. However, when determining whether ownership continuity or commonality has been maintained for a tax loss component from an earlier income year, it is necessary to have regard to ownership changes over the entire continuity or commonality period, which could span multiple years. When a non-active company can be excused from filing returns 258. Sometimes a loss company will be non-active, and the question arises as to whether it needs to file an income tax return. 259. Unless the Commissioner requires otherwise, 158 a company is not required to provide a return of income for an income year if the company: 159 was a non-active company throughout the income year; has provided a completed non-active company declaration (IR433) to the Commissioner; and has been a non-active company at all times since making the declaration. 157 In the 2022 version of the IR4, this was question 41. 158 Under s 43A(7) of the TAA. 159 Under s 43A(1) of the TAA. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 95 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 260. A company is non-active for an income year if throughout the income year, the company: 160 has not derived any income (other than interest derived on a bank account that does not exceed bank charges and other minimal administration costs totalling no more than $50); has no deductions (other than statutory company filing fees, associated accounting or other costs, or bank or other minimal administration costs totalling no more than $50; has not disposed of, or been deemed to dispose of, any asset; has not been party to or continued with any transactions that, during the income year give rise to: –income for any person; –fringe benefits to any employee or to any former employee; or –a debit in the company’s imputation credit account. 261. Keep a record of the company’s loss and imputation account balances before the company is excused from filing as this information will be needed if the company is reactivated. Reactivation 262. If a non-active company that was excused from filing ceases to be non-active, the company must: 161 notify the Commissioner; provide the Commissioner with a completed non-active company reactivation form (IR434), which must include: –the company’s loss balance before it was excused from filing; –the company’s imputation credit account balance before it was excused from filing; –the company’s ownership before it was excused from filing; –whether the shareholding ownership of the company (direct or indirect) has changes since it was excused from filing and the details of those changes; and –whether the change in ownership would prevent it using any loss or credit balances.

They are published here as they may be of general interest to readers. QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED QB 22/08: Goods and Services Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools This Question We’ve Been Asked explains the GST treatment of payments parents make to private schools. Another QWBA on donation tax credits and a parent’s payment to their child’s private school (QB 22/09) and a public ruling on payments by parents to state schools and state integrated schools (BR Pub 18/06) can be found on our Tax Technical website. Question When will a parent’s payment to their child’s private school be subject to GST? Answer In most cases, a parent’s payment to their child’s private school will be subject to GST. Private schools make taxable supplies of education and education-related goods and services to parents. Usually, schools will charge GST on these supplies at the standard rate of 15%. However, there can be exceptions, in particular: an “unconditional gift” a parent makes to their child’s private school is not subject to GST; and some of the boarding fees a parent pays to their child’s private school can be subject to GST at what is, in effect, a reduced rate of 9%. Key term Parent also includes a child’s guardian or caregiver who makes payments to a private school. Private school means a school registered under s 214 of the Education and Training Act 2020. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) assumes all private schools are GST registered. It also assumes most private schools are non-profit bodies for GST purposes. Explanation 1. The Commissioner has been asked to clarify the GST treatment of payments parents make to private schools. (QB 22/09: Income Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools and donation tax credits 1 clarifies when payments parents make to private schools will be gifts for donation tax credit purposes.) 2. This QWBA complements earlier GST advice published for parents with children attending state schools and state integrated schools (BR Pub 18/06). 3. In addition, in the past, there have been situations where parents have made “donations” to private schools in substitution for paying no or low school fees. The Commissioner’s view on this practice was addressed in Revenue Alert 14/01. Payments made by parents to private schools incorrectly described as “donations” are not unconditional gifts for GST purposes. 4. Private schools have also asked for some guidance on the GST treatment of boarding fees charged for students staying in a school boarding house, and when the reduced GST rate for the supply of “domestic goods and services” will apply. 5. This QWBA assumes that private schools are registered for GST. 1 Inland Revenue, 2022. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 98 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Scheme of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 6. Generally, a private school charges GST on the goods and services it supplies in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity at the standard rate of 15% (see s 8). A private school’s taxable activity is the provision of education and education- related goods and services to students and their families. 7. Usually, the value of a private school’s supplies is determined by reference to the “consideration” paid for those supplies (see s 10(2)). “Consideration”, as defined in s 2, includes payments made in respect of the supply of goods and services. 8. However, for private schools there can be two exceptions to this general rule. This is where: a parent’s payment is an “unconditional gift” (as defined in s 2) and so is not “consideration”, and therefore is not subject to GST; or a private school makes a supply of “domestic goods or services” (as defined in s 2) to a parent as part of the school supplying boarding accommodation for a student. Generally, for stays in a school boarding house that will be longer than four weeks, the value of the supply of “domestic goods and services” is reduced to 60% of the consideration paid for GST purposes. This effectively reduces the rate of GST the school charges for that portion of the boarding fees from 15% to 9%. 9. Both these exceptions are addressed in more detail below. Unconditional gifts 10. If a private school that is a non-profit body receives a payment from a parent that is an “unconditional gift”, that payment is not subject to GST. 11. For detailed guidance on GST and unconditional gifts, see “IS 20/09 GST – unconditional gifts”. 2 Non-profit body 12. This QWBA assumes that most private schools are non-profit bodies for GST purposes, although it recognises some private schools are not. Essentially, a private school will be a non-profit body for GST purposes (see s 2) if the school is: carried on other than for the purposes of profit or gain to any proprietor, member or shareholder; and prohibited from making distributions to any of those people. 13. If the school’s governing documents do not provide this, then the school cannot be a non-profit body for GST purposes. If a school is a registered charity, it will be a non-profit body for GST purposes. However, registration under the Charities Act 2005 is not a requirement for being a non-profit body for GST purposes. Unconditional gift 14. A payment made to a non-profit body is an “unconditional gift” where: the payment is voluntarily made for the non-profit body to carry on or carry out its purposes; and no “identifiable direct valuable benefit” in the form of a supply of goods and services to the payer (or an associated person) arises or may arise in respect of the payment. Payment is voluntarily made 15. The first part of the definition of “unconditional gift” requires the payment to be “voluntarily made”. These words are not defined in the Act and so they need to be given an ordinary meaning that is consistent with the purpose of the definition of “unconditional gift” (see s 10(1) of the Legislation Act 2019). 16. For the purposes of the definition of “unconditional gift”, the Commissioner considers: a payment is voluntarily made if it is made freely by choice, is not required to be made or is optional; a payment is not voluntarily made if it is made under a legal obligation; a legal obligation includes a statutory obligation and in most instances it also includes an obligation under a contract; a payment made under a sense of moral obligation may still be voluntarily made; and a non-profit body soliciting donations or recommending the amount of a donation does not in itself disqualify a payment from being voluntarily made. 2 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33, No 1 (February 2021): 42. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 99 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED No identifiable direct valuable benefit 17. In the second part of the definition, a payment will not be an unconditional gift where an “identifiable direct valuable benefit” arises or may arise in respect of the payment, in the form of a supply of goods or services to the payer (or an associated person of the payer). 18. An “identifiable direct valuable benefit” is an advantage or gain in the form of a supply of goods or services to the payer (or an associated person) that is: clearly able to be defined or identified; sufficiently closely connected to the payment; useful, important and of real value; capable of being valued; and not of only nominal worth. 19. To disqualify a payment from being an unconditional gift, the identifiable direct valuable benefit (in the form of a supply of goods or services) must arise “in respect of ” the payment made. That the payer (or an associated person) receives the benefit is not by itself enough to take the payment out of the definition of unconditional gift. To be disqualified from being an “unconditional gift”, a payment must have a sufficient link (or nexus) to the benefit arising in the form of a supply of goods or services. 20. Where the benefit will arise regardless of whether the payment is made, the connection between the benefit and the payment will not be sufficient, and so the payment will be an “unconditional gift”. The courts have found that for a payment to be an “unconditional gift”, any benefit arising must not be conditional or dependent on the payment being made. 21. Case 8/2018 (2018) 28 NZTC 4,015 (TRA) was about whether amounts paid by the parents of children attending a private school were consideration for a supply of education services or unconditional gifts. Judge Sinclair found on the facts that because children were not excluded from attending the private school if their parents were unable to pay, their attendance at the school was not “conditional” on parents making the requested financial contributions. 22. However, she found the school was “dependent” on parents’ contributions. This was because it was evident from the background facts before parents made the payments, including the related documentation and correspondence between the school and the parents, that if the parents had not made the contributions, the school would not have been able to operate. For this reason, Judge Sinclair found that in the circumstances a sufficient link could be established between the parents’ contributions and the supply of education services the private school provided, so that the parents’ contributions were consideration for the supply of education services, not unconditional gifts. 23. In determining whether a sufficient link exists between the payment and the benefit, the courts will take into account all the circumstances surrounding the payment. 24. In some circumstances, a non-profit body chooses to supply goods or services to a donor as a “thank you” acknowledging the donor’s generosity. In this case, there will not usually be a sufficient link between the donor’s payment and the supply of goods or services for the supply to be “in respect of ” the donor’s payment (see Example 8: Donation to charity concert in return for free tickets in IS 20/09). In that situation, the payment is not subject to GST. Supplies of domestic goods and services in boarding houses 25. Where a private school provides boarding accommodation for a student in a school boarding house, the GST charged in respect of that supply of accommodation is subject to special rules. 26. Under the special rules set out in s 10(6), a lower rate of GST is chargeable than for ordinary taxable supplies on aspects of the supply of boarding accommodation – but only where the school boarding house qualifies as a “commercial dwelling” and the student’s stay in the boarding house will be for longer than four weeks in total. The goods and services eligible for the lower GST rate are referred to as “domestic goods and services”. 27. A “commercial dwelling” is defined in s 2 and includes hostels and boarding houses. For the purposes of this QWBA it is assumed that school boarding houses operated by private schools for student accommodation are “commercial dwellings”. 28. The term “domestic goods and services”, also defined in s 2, means the right to occupy premises like a boarding house together with any ancillary supplies like power, cleaning and other chattels related to the premises that are included along with the right to occupy. It does not include supplies of non-domestic goods or services such as meals, personal care and personal laundry services that might also be supplied and included within the overall fee charged by the school for boarding accommodation. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 100 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 29. For GST purposes, the value of the supply of “domestic goods and services” is treated as being 60% of the actual consideration for the supply. In effect, this means GST is charged on the supply of “domestic goods and services” at the reduced rate of 9%. 30. Only domestic goods and services are subject to the lower GST rate, so the school must make an apportionment when invoicing boarding fees between supplies of domestic and non-domestic goods and services to parents. An ongoing apportionment percentage can be established using a factual basis. The school must keep sufficient records to support the apportionment basis. 31. However, any expenses incurred in providing domestic goods and services in a school boarding house do not need to be apportioned as they are all incurred in the course of making taxable supplies. 32. Where a boarding house is a “residential establishment” (as defined in s 2), the reduced GST rate applies from the start of any contract or arrangement for boarding accommodation where it is agreed the stay will be longer than four weeks in total. A boarding house will be a residential establishment if at least 70% of the students living in the boarding house will reside there for longer than four weeks. The period of residence does not need to be unbroken – the stay simply needs to be longer than four weeks in total. This means weekly boarders (ie, students who board five days a week during the term) are included. A period of residence is established by considering the legal arrangements between the parties. 33. Supplies of domestic goods and services to short-term boarders who stay for less than four weeks in total are subject to GST at the standard rate. Examples St Christopher’s School, an independent church school, is a private school. It is registered for GST and it is also a registered charity under the Charities Act 2005 so it is a non-profit body for GST purposes. Example 1: Tuition fees for attending private school Michael has been accepted to attend St Christopher’s School as a day student, starting in Year 9. The school advises that Michael’s year 9 tuition fees are $5,500 per term, inclusive of GST. At the beginning of each term St Christopher’s School issues a tax invoice to Michael’s parents for the tuition fees payable for the upcoming term. The invoice includes GST of 15%. Each family at the school also has a disbursement account for additional expenses like stationery, replacement uniform items, exam fees, and outings that are payable in addition to the tuition fees. The balance of the disbursement account is required to be paid monthly by direct debit. All the additional expenses are also subject to GST at 15%. Example 2: Annual donation to scholarship fund In its first newsletter for the school year, St Christopher’s School includes a link to its website and a reminder from the school’s Board that an annual donation from families or friends to help the school to fund its scholarship and building programme would be appreciated. These payments are unconditional gifts as long as the families and friends make them voluntarily and get no identifiable direct valuable benefit in return. In these circumstances, the payments are not subject to GST. Example 3: Donations to school instead of fees St Christopher’s School is offering students the opportunity to attend some “one-off ” music lessons from a visiting “world- class” performer. Interested parents are asked to make voluntary contributions to cover the cost to the school of hosting the performer. The music department’s newsletter makes it clear that the performer’s visit will only go ahead if the school receives sufficient contributions and only children whose parents have made contributions will be able to attend the lessons. These payments are not unconditional gifts. They are consideration for the supply of music lessons by the school. The supply of the music lessons is conditional and dependent on the parents making the payments to the school. The supply of these music lessons by the school, and the payments parents make for them are subject to GST. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 101 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 4: Donation to school with conditions Jack is a businessperson with two children at St Christopher’s School. Jack’s company donates $6,000 to the school, for the school to use to install sunshades over the school playground. The company’s $6,000 donation is an unconditional gift. The company makes the donation for the school (a non-profit body) to carry on or carry out its purposes, even though the funds are for a specified purpose. Jack’s company (or Jack and his children) does not receive an identifiable direct valuable benefit as a result of the company’s payment. Any benefit Jack’s children gain from using the sunshades is not an identifiable direct valuable benefit in the form of a supply of goods or services to an associate of the company. The sunshades are for the benefit of the school community as a whole. The payment is not subject to GST. Example 5: Plaque to recognise philanthropic donation ABC Trust, a private philanthropic trust that a school alumnus has set up, makes a substantial distribution to St Christopher’s School for its project to build a new hall. The school builds a new hall with the funds and in gratitude displays a plaque that states the hall was funded by the generous donation from the ABC Trust. ABC Trust has not received an identifiable direct valuable benefit in the form of a supply of goods or services in respect of the distribution. The distribution is an unconditional gift for GST purposes. While the plaque acknowledges ABC Trust, it is not a “valuable” benefit and so does not prevent the payment from being an “unconditional gift”. The payment is not subject to GST. Example 6: Supply of accommodation in a boarding house St Christopher’s School operates a boarding house for its students during term time. It enters into a contract with a family to supply their child with boarding accommodation for one 10-week term. The school has previously established, based on an analysis of past transactions, that it supplies 30% domestic goods and services and 70% non-domestic goods and services to its boarders. The school has kept records supporting that apportionment. The GST-exclusive fee for a 10-week term boarding in the school’s boarding house is $4,000: $4,000 × 30% = $1,200 (portion of boarding fee attributable to domestic goods and services, including cleaning, bed linen, heating, Wi-Fi, etc): $1,200 × 60% × 15% = $108 (GST on domestic goods and services) $4,000 × 70% = $2,800 (portion attributable to non-domestic goods and services including duty staff, pastoral care, meals, personal laundry services, activities etc): $2,800 × 15% = $420 (GST on non-domestic goods and services) Total GST on the boarding fee is $108 + $420 = $528 Therefore, the total boarding fee inclusive of GST for a 10-week term is $4,528.

Another QWBA on the GST treatment of a parent’s payment to their child’s private school (QB 22/08) and more QWBAs on donation tax credits and payments by parents to state schools (QB 18/10) and state integrated schools (QB 18/11) can be found on our Tax Technical website. Question When will a parent’s payment to their child’s private school qualify for a donation tax credit? Answer Payments parents make to private schools are gifts for donation tax credit purposes where:   the school is a donee organisation;   the payment is money of $5 or more;   the parent makes the payment voluntarily to benefit the school either generally or for a specific purpose or project; and   the parent or child gains no material benefit or advantage in return for making the payment. Key term Parent also includes a child’s guardian or caregiver who makes payments to a private school. Private school means a school registered under s 214 of the Education and Training Act 2020. Explanation 1. The Commissioner has been asked to clarify when payments parents make to private schools will qualify for a donation tax credit. (QB 22/08: Goods and Services Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools 1 clarifies the GST treatment of payments parents make to private schools.) 2. This QWBA complements the earlier QWBAs published for parents with children attending state schools (QB 18/10) and state integrated schools (QB 18/11). 3. Parents with children attending private schools are charged fees for their children to attend the school. There is a contractual relationship between the school and the parents for the provision of education and education-related goods and services in return for the payment of fees. 4. From time to time parents may choose to make donations to private schools. Where the school is a donee organisation, and the donation is a “charitable or public benefit gift”, then parents may be entitled to a donation tax credit under s LD 1 for the donation. 5. In the past, there have been situations where parents have made “donations” to private schools in substitution for paying no or low school fees. The Commissioner’s view on this practice was addressed in Revenue Alert 14/01. There are no donation tax credits for any payments paid by parents to private schools incorrectly described as “donations”. What is a donation tax credit? 6. A donation tax credit is a refundable tax credit available for charitable or other public benefit gifts that an individual makes to a donee organisation where the requirements in ss LD 1 to LD 3 are met. 7. An individual can claim a donation tax credit of one third of the payment amount. An individual’s claim for a donation tax credit must be supported by appropriate donation tax receipts from the donee organisation. The Commissioner reviews an individual’s claim and then notifies the individual of the amount of tax credit that will be allowed. 1 Inland Revenue, 2022. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 104 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 8. The sum of charitable or other public benefit gifts an individual taxpayer makes in a tax year must not exceed their taxable income for that year. Therefore the Commissioner will reduce the donation tax credits for gifts an individual taxpayer makes in a tax year if, in total, the credits claimed exceed the individual’s taxable income for that year (see s 41A(3) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). When are donation tax credits available? 9. Donation tax credits are available for payments of money of $5 or more that a parent makes to a private school only where they satisfy the requirements in ss LD 1 to LD 3. That is, donation tax credits are available where: the private school is a “donee organisation”; and the payment is “a charitable or other public benefit gift”. When is a private school a donee organisation? 10. A private school will be a donee organisation if it: is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 or otherwise meets the requirements of s LD 3(2); and appears on Inland Revenue’s searchable list of approved donee organisations at ird.govt.nz. 11. Only donee organisations may issue donation tax receipts for donation tax credit purposes. Donations by parents to private schools that are not donee organisations will never qualify for donation tax credits. 12. For additional guidance on Donee organisations, see OS 22/04 Part 2: Charities and Donee Organisations: Part 2: Donee Organisations. 2 When will payments to a private school be “charitable or other public benefit gifts”? 13. While s LD 3(1) defines the phrase “charitable or other public benefit gift” (and specifically excludes gifts made by will and forgiveness of debt), it does not define the word “gift”. Aotearoa New Zealand courts say that the meaning of “gifting” and “gift” is to be determined by reference to the text and purpose of the legislation. That meaning is then to be applied by considering all of the arrangements that were actually entered into and carried out. 3 14. In the absence of a statutory definition of “gift”, the courts agree that for donation tax credit purposes the word “gift” should be given its ordinary and natural meaning. 4 15. Based on case law, and taking into account the text of s LD 3(1) in the light of its purpose and its context, 5 the Commissioner considers that the ordinary and natural meaning of “gift” is a payment of money of $5 or more: made voluntarily; made by way of benefaction (ie, made to benefit the donee organisation); and where the payer receives no material benefit or advantage in return. Payment is made voluntarily 16. To qualify as a gift, a parent must make their payment to the private school voluntarily. For gifting purposes, this means the payment is made willingly, freely by choice. 17. As a general rule, a payment will not be made voluntarily if it is made under a contract or required to be made under some statutory or other legal obligation. 6 18. However, the absence of a contract or a legal obligation on a parent to contribute to the school does not automatically mean payments are voluntary. There can be circumstances where, even though a parent has no legal obligation to make a payment to a private school, the payment still will not be considered “voluntary” for donation tax credit purposes. 19. For example, in FCT v McPhail the High Court of Australia found that contributions a parent made to a school building fund in return for reduced school fees were not gifts. In part, this was because the parent’s agreement to contribute to the fund placed an obligation on the school to provide education facilities for the reduced fee. As a result, the court found that 2 Inland Revenue, 2022. 3 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Trust Board and Coward v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2020\] NZCA 143 at \[28\]. 4 For example, Chief Executive of Ministry of Social Development v Broadbent \[2019\] NZCA 201 at \[80\], Coward at \[55\] and Federal Tax Commissioner v McPhail (1968) 117 CLR 111 at 116. 5 Section 10(1) of the Legislation Act 2019. 6 Leary v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 80 ATC 4438 per Bowen CJ. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 105 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED the contribution to the building fund was not a voluntary payment. Furthermore, it found the parent made the payment in the expectation that in return they would receive, and did in fact receive, a substantial concession in the fees charged for the education of their son. 20. Occasionally, a school or other parents may put pressure on a parent to make a payment and this can create a sense of moral obligation on the parent. A payment made under a sense of moral obligation is still voluntary. However, in some circumstances, pressure might also be evidence that a payment is being made under an arrangement between the school and the parent. If an objective analysis of the legal arrangements governing the payment and the surrounding circumstances establishes that the payment is not, in fact, voluntary, it will not be a gift. Payment benefits the private school 21. The Commissioner considers case law 7 supports benefaction being an element of a gift in the context of donation tax credits. Benefaction is the idea that a gift should provide an advantage or benefit to the donee organisation. While the Court of Appeal did not discuss the idea of benefaction in Coward, or refer to Leary, in the Commissioner’s view this should not be taken as meaning a court considering a different set of facts would not see benefaction as being an attribute of a gift for the purposes of s LD 1. Its presence demonstrates that a payment is made to advantage the donee organisation. 22. A payment made without benefaction will not be a gift in the ordinary sense of the word. For example, benefaction will not ordinarily be present where a donor’s payment places a “countervailing material detriment” 8 on the donee organisation so that the organisation is prevented from benefiting (in whole or in part) from the payment. 23. In Case J76 9 a priest made payments to schools to ensure that disadvantaged children in his parish could access appropriate schooling. The priest argued his payments were gifts and therefore he was entitled to the equivalent of a donation tax credit. Judge Keane found there was no doubt that the payments were made out of charity, but the payments placed the schools under a contractual duty to educate the children and were made in return for the schools’ educational services. The priest’s payments were not gifts to the schools and so no donation tax credit equivalent was allowed. 24. To the Commissioner, benefaction is another measure for determining if a payment is a gift for donation tax credit purposes – along with whether the donor makes the payment voluntarily and whether they gain a material benefit in return for making the payment. If, following an objective analysis of the legal arrangements governing the payment and the surrounding circumstances, benefaction cannot be established, then the payment will not be a gift for donation tax credit purposes. 25. Such an interpretation of “gift” is consistent with the policy underlying the donation tax credit rules: that donation tax credits are available “to encourage New Zealand taxpayers to provide financial support to charities”. 10 For example, if by receiving a payment the private school is placed under a countervailing obligation so that the school gains no advantage or benefit from the payment, then the Commissioner considers the payment is not truly a gift in the ordinary and natural meaning of the word. No material benefit or advantage in return 26. A payment to a private school will not usually be a gift in circumstances where the payment results in a material benefit or advantage being conferred in return. 27. The material benefit or advantage does not need to come directly from the school. It also does not need to be received directly by the parent who made the payment (for example, the student may receive the education benefit). 28. A benefit or advantage will be considered “material” if it is of substance and can be valued or owned or both. For example, if the school newsletter advertises a parent’s business in return for the parent making the payment, that would be a material benefit. 29. A benefit or advantage will not be material if it is intangible and cannot be valued or owned. An example of a non-material benefit or advantage is public acknowledgement, such as printing a parent’s name in a school newsletter to acknowledge their gift. 7 The Australian Federal Court in Leary found benefaction to be an essential idea of a gift, in its ordinary sense. 8 Deane J in Leary: “It involves, in my view, the concept that the relevant transfer is by way of well doing in that the recipient will be advantaged, in a material sense and without any countervailing material detriment arising from the circumstances of the transfer, to the extent of the property transferred to him.” 9 Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451. 10 Coward at \[56\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 106 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 30. Importantly, not every material benefit or advantage will necessarily disqualify a voluntary payment to a private school from being a gift. To disqualify a voluntary payment to a private school from being a gift, the benefit or advantage needs to arise in return for the payment. The extent and strength of any connection between the parent’s payment and a benefit or advantage is an important factor in determining whether a payment is a gift. 31. For example, sometimes a school may want to thank and acknowledge the generosity of its parents and alumni by inviting them to a function or by giving them a token of appreciation. This is often referred to as “stewardship”. In those situations, the benefit, even if material, does not disqualify a parent’s payment from being a gift. This is because the parent had no expectation of being invited to the function when making the payment, so the link between the payment and the benefit is insufficient. 32. The Court of Appeal considered the strength of the link between a parent’s payment and an education benefit or advantage in Coward. On the facts in Coward it was concluded there was an insufficient connection between the parent’s payments to the church and any potential material benefit his child received when she was acting as a missionary overseas. However, the court noted that the facts in Coward were quite different from the “education benefit” cases 11 referred to in the decision. 12 In the “education benefit” cases, students received the clearly material benefit of an education and the parents gained the benefit of paying reduced or no fees for the education provided. 33. For example, in the Canadian decision The Queen v Coleman families made voluntary non-refundable payments to a religious charity and in return financial benefits were made available to students from those families to help with the cost of their education. The court found that the payments were not gifts because they had a strong link to the financial benefits to the families. The voluntary payments relieved the families from having to pay education costs. 34. The court determined the strength of the link by looking at a range of factors objectively, weighing them and applying them in a common-sense way. The factors included the relationship between the parties, correlation between the amounts paid and the value of the benefit gained, and the circumstances surrounding the payment. 35. In New Zealand, in Case 8/2018 (2018) 28 NZTC 4,015 (TRA), a GST decision, the issue was whether amounts paid by the parents of children attending a private school were consideration for a supply of education services or unconditional gifts. Judge Sinclair found on the facts that while children could not be excluded from attending the private school if their parents were unable to pay, the school was still “dependent” on parents’ contributions. It was evident from the background facts, including the related documentation and correspondence between the school and the parents, that if the parents had not made the contributions, the school would not have been able to operate. For this reason, Judge Sinclair found that in the circumstances a sufficient link could be established between the parents’ contributions and the supply of education services by the private school, so that the parents’ contributions were made for the supply of education services, and were not unconditional gifts. 36. While Case 8/2018 relates to GST and so is only of limited relevance in the context of donation tax credits, it is an example of a situation where a court determined, after taking into account all the circumstances surrounding the payments made by the parents, that a sufficient link existed between the parents’ payments and the material benefit of an education for reduced or no fees. Can a gift be for a specific purpose? 37. Sometimes gifts will be made to a private school for a specific purpose or project – for example, to build a new gymnasium. The fact that a school seeks donations for a specific project does not, in itself, prevent the payment from being a gift. In the Commissioner’s view, a gift made for a specific purpose will not cease to be a gift so long as no material benefit or advantage is provided in return for the payment. 38. Further, the fact that a parent’s child may be among those who ultimately benefit from a school community project will not usually disqualify the payment from being a gift. However, the stronger the connection between a parent’s payment and any material benefit or advantage they gain in return, the less likely it is that the payment will qualify as a gift. 11 McPhail; The Queen v Zandstra \[1974\] 2 FC 254; The Queen v Coleman (2010) TTC 109; Winters v Commissioner of Internal Revenue 468 F 2d 778 (2nd Cir 1972). 12 Coward at \[61\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 107 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Can part of a payment be a gift? 39. The legal arrangements that the parties enter into and carry out, and the surrounding circumstances, establish the nature of the transaction. It is not open to parents and schools to later choose to describe a payment as comprising two separate payments – one for consideration (eg, a sale) and one made voluntarily for no consideration (ie, a gift) – if, in fact, it was a single transaction. For example, if the price paid for an item at a charity auction to raise funds for the school exceeds the value of the item, the school cannot treat the amount paid above its value as a gift. It may not issue a donation tax receipt in that situation. 40. However, a school may be able to issue a donation tax receipt where a parent makes two payments at the same time. For example, if a parent purchases tickets to an event the school is hosting and at the same time voluntarily supports the school by making an additional payment, the additional voluntary payment may be a gift. For the additional payment to be a gift, the parent must be allowed to attend the event regardless of whether they make any additional payment – that is, the ticket purchase must not depend on the parent making an additional payment. In that situation, the school may choose to issue a single invoice to the parent, so long as it clearly identifies the two separate payments (the ticket sale and the gift), and may issue a donation tax receipt for the gift the parent made. Examples Example 1: Annual donation to scholarship and building fund The first newsletter for the school year includes a reminder from the private school’s Trust Board that an annual donation from families or friends to help the school with funding its scholarship and building programme would be appreciated. These payments are gifts for donation tax credit purposes providing they are voluntary and the donors gain no material benefit in return. If this is so, the school (which is a registered charity under the Charities Act 2005) can issue a donation tax receipt to the donors and individual donors can claim donation tax credits up to their allowable limit. Example 2: Discounted tuition fees A private school requests donations from parents for its building fund. It offers that in return any families who contribute more than $1,500 will enjoy a 5% discount off their child’s annual tuition fees. This payment is not a gift for donation tax credit purposes. In return for making the payment, the parents gain a material benefit in the form of reduced tuition costs. Example 3: Contributions and no fees St Christopher’s School is a private secondary school operated by St Christopher’s Church. St Christopher’s Church is listed as a donee organisation on Inland Revenue’s list of approved donee organisations. Most parents are only charged low fees for their children to attend the school, and some families pay no fees at all. However, all families are asked to make contributions to the church. The contributions the church requests are determined by reference to the school’s operating costs, the number of students attending the school and each family’s circumstances. The school’s enrolment handbook makes it clear that the school is reliant on the parents’ contributions for its continuing operation. The contributions made by parents are not gifts for donation tax credit purposes. Although a parent may have no legal or contractual obligation to contribute, the family gains a material benefit in return for making the requested contributions. That benefit is that their children receive an education at a school chosen by the parents. There is a strong link between the contributions and the benefit to the families. The amount of the payments relates to the education benefit. The payments place the church under a countervailing obligation to fund the school to educate the children. The church should not issue donation receipts to the parents for their contributions. Example 4: Advertising A private school asks families and alumni with businesses for donations to its scholarship fund. In return, it offers to place an advertisement for the business in its yearbook. This payment is not a gift for income tax purposes. The supporter gains a material benefit in return for making the payment in the form of advertising. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 108 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 5: Fundraising dinner Mi-young purchases a ticket to a quiz night that her children’s private school, which is a donee organisation, is putting on as a fundraising event. The ticket costs her $80 and entitles her to attend the event. The school calculates it will raise approximately $50 from each ticket sold to go towards its new performing arts centre. None of the ticket price paid by Mi-young is a gift. The school has sold the ticket to Mi-young for $80. The school should not issue a donation tax receipt to Mi-young for any portion of the ticket price. The situation would be different if the school sold each ticket for $30 and at the same time asked ticket purchasers to consider making a donation of $20, $50, $100 or any other amount. In this case, if Mi-young bought a ticket and opted to make a $50 donation, the school could issue a donation tax receipt to her for the $50. While at the dinner, Mi-young is asked if she would like to contribute towards the school’s scholarship fund. She agrees to make a donation of $500. The school is very grateful and advises Mi-young she will be acknowledged in its next newsletter. The school may issue a donation tax receipt to Mi-young for $500. The public acknowledgement of her generosity is not a material benefit. Example 6: Charity auction Mateo has purchased tickets to attend a cocktail party and charity auction to raise funds for a new swimming pool complex at his children’s private school. The school is a donee organisation. Before the auction night, the school asks for contributions of “prizes” that it can auction off to raise funds. Kaia, a local artist, donates a painting. The painting would ordinarily sell at one of Kaia’s exhibitions for $700. The painting sells at the auction for $1,000. Although Kaia has donated the painting to the school, the school should not give her a donation tax receipt as she has not made a gift of money. The auction sells various donated items to the guests. Mateo bids on a signed rugby jersey. A similar jersey recently sold in an online auction for $200. Mateo is keen to support the pool project so he bids $800 for the signed jersey and wins the auction. Although Mateo may have purchased the jersey for much more than the recent online auction price, no amount of the purchase price he paid is a gift. The school should not issue a donation tax receipt to Mateo. Example 7: Christmas cards and donation Felicity receives a letter from her children’s private school, which is a registered charity, offering her the opportunity to purchase a pack of Christmas cards that students have painted for $20. On the order form, Felicity can also choose to add a donation to the school. She chooses to purchase one pack of cards and to make a donation of $30. She sends the card order away with her credit card details authorising a payment of $50. The school then sends her the cards and a donation tax receipt for $30. This is correct. Felicity’s $50 payment comprised two separately identifiable amounts she paid to the charity – $20 to purchase the cards and a $30 voluntary donation. The cards Felicity receives are not conditional on whether or not she also made a donation.

Facts | Ngā meka 1. The Taxpayer is an individual. The Taxpayer operates a farm on their property. 2. The Taxpayer claimed self-employment losses from farming in their 2020 income tax return. During the course of this dispute, the parties agreed the income from farming should be returned in the 2021 tax year. The Taxpayer considered this meant their expenses and depreciation loss from farming should also be re-returned in the 2021 tax year. However, Customer & Compliance Services, Inland Revenue (CCS) argued that these should remain returned in the 2020 tax year. 3. As well as operating a farm, the Taxpayer worked as an independent contractor in a different city from which the Taxpayer resides (the other city). The Taxpayer travelled to, and rented accommodation in, the other city to perform this work. The Taxpayer was required to attend the offices of the organisation they worked for in the other city on a weekly basis. The Taxpayer also travelled between their home city and the other city weekly to attend to the farm during this period. 4. The Taxpayer claimed expenses against their schedular income in the 2020 tax year. These consisted of the cost of travel between the two cities and meals and accommodation in the other city. CSS argued these expenses were not deductible. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 111 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Issues | Ngā take 5. The main issues considered in this dispute were: whether a deduction for expenses and depreciation loss from farming was allowed to the Taxpayer in the 2020 tax year or the 2021 tax year; and whether the Taxpayer was allowed the following deductions for expenses against their schedular income: the costs of return trips between the Taxpayer’s home city and the other city; the costs of meals in the other city; and accommodation expenses in the other city. Decisions | Ngā whakatau 6. The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) concluded that: the expenses and depreciation loss from farming is an allowable deduction to the Taxpayer in the 2020 tax year (and not the 2021 tax year); and the schedular income expenses at issue were not an allowable deduction to the Taxpayer. Reasons for decisions | Ngā take mō ngā whakatau Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Timing of expenses and depreciation loss deductions 7. The Taxpayer claimed self-employment losses from farming in their income tax return for the 2020 tax year, but agreed, during the dispute that the income from farming should be returned in the 2021 tax year. However, the Taxpayer considered the expenses and depreciation loss from farming should also, as a result, be returned in their 2021 income tax return, because the income to which the expenditure is related is income in the 2021 tax year, and income and related expenditure should be recognised together in the same period. 8. CCS argued that these expenses and the depreciation loss were incurred in the 2020 income year and should be deductible in the 2020 income tax return. 9. The statutory framework of the ITA for the recognition of income and expenses for tax purposes is clear. A global approach is required, under which income and allowable deductions are allocated to an income year under particular timing rules, rather than separate calculations of net income or loss for each source of income. While separate calculations for each source of income, or matching, might be required for financial accounting purposes, in the absence of explicit statutory direction it is not required for tax purposes. 10. A person’s taxable income for a tax year is made up of the person’s annual gross income and annual total deduction for the year, minus any available net loss. 1 Under s BC 3, a person’s annual total deduction is the total of their deductions that are allocated to the corresponding income year. 11. Section DA 1 provides the general permission for allowable deductions, which relevantly provides that a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent that the expenditure or loss is incurred by them in deriving their assessable income (the general permission). 12. Deductions are allocated to an income year under s BD 4. The general rule under s BD 4 is that a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss is allocated to the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section BD 4(3) requires regard to be had to case law for allocation of expenditure or loss to an income year, which requires some people to recognise expenditure or loss on an accrual basis and others on a cash basis, and more generally defines the concept of incurrence. 13. Case law provides that the appropriate and proper system will depend to some extent on the nature of the taxpayer. For a non-trading individual, the cash system of accounting is the most appropriate, where income is “derived” when payment is received. In the case of a trading entity, the accrual system of accounting is usually appropriate and proper method of accounting for tax purposes. In an accrual system, income may be “derived” when it is earnt, and expenditure may be “incurred” independently of payment of expenses. The relevant income and corresponding expenditure are brought in or accrued in one year together, irrespective of actual receipt of money. 2 1 Sections BC 4 and BC 5. 2 Case F156 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,343 (TRA) at 60,346. See also Whitworth Park Coal Ltd (in Liq) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1961\] AC 31; 28 TC 531 (HL). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 112 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 14. In the leading case on when expenditure is “incurred”, the Privy Council determined that for an outgoing to have been “incurred”, the taxpayer must have either paid or become “definitively committed” to the expenditure. 3 The question is whether, “in light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued.” 4 15. TCO concluded that the expenses and depreciation loss at issue were deductible in the 2020 tax year (and not in the 2021 tax year) for these reasons: The Taxpayer should recognise their income and losses from farming, as a trading activity, on an accrual basis. Under an accrual system, the Taxpayer’s farming income can be derived prior to receipt of payment and expenditure may be incurred independently of payment of expenses (and thereby income and expenditure incurred in earning that income are considered together). The Taxpayer’s expenses from farming under dispute were invoiced during the 2020 income year, at which point the Taxpayer had a legal obligation and was definitively committed to pay the amounts invoiced. Therefore, these farming expenses were incurred by the Taxpayer in the 2020 income year and formed part of the Taxpayer’s annual total deduction for the 2020 tax year under s BC 3. For the expenses that the Taxpayer did not provide invoices to support their deduction claim, the evidence showed these expenses have been paid by the Taxpayer during the 2020 income year. On this basis, these amounts would have been incurred by the Taxpayer during the 2020 income year at the latest, and therefore incurred in that year under s BD 4, and deductible to the Taxpayer in their 2020 tax year under s BC 3. In terms of the requirement that a “depreciation loss” 5 satisfies the general permission for deductibility (that is, the loss is incurred), s EE 1(4)(a) provides that an amount of depreciation loss is treated as being incurred in the income year for which it is calculated. On the basis that the amount of depreciation loss at issue was a calculation for the 2020 income year, the amount was treated as being incurred in the 2020 income year. It therefore forms part of the Taxpayer’s total annual deduction for the 2020 tax year under s BC 3. Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Deduction for schedular income expenses 16. The issue is whether the Taxpayer is allowed a deduction for expenses against their schedular income derived from their work as an independent contractor, made up of travel, meal and accommodation costs. 17. The Taxpayer argued the amounts under dispute were deductible because they were required to be in the other city on a weekly basis to perform their contracting work, but during the same period, required to attend to their farm in their home city. The Taxpayer also argued their meal expenses claim was deductible because the amount claimed is less than the additional cost of their meals when travelling as compared to the cost of meals at home. 18. CCS considered the amount at issue was not deductible to the Taxpayer because the expenses had not been incurred in deriving assessable income and were of a private nature. 19. As mentioned in Issue 1, the general permission for allowable deductions is provided in s DA 1. To satisfy the general permission, the expenditure must have the necessary relationship with both the taxpayer concerned and the gaining or producing of the person’s assessable income. 6 In the Australian case, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Payne, 7 the Australian High Court held that this means the outgoing must be incurred “in the course of ” gaining or producing the assessable income 8 , but excludes outgoings, which although incurred for the purpose of deriving assessable income, are not incurred in the course of doing so. 9 20. The general limitations contained in s DA 2 override the general permission. Section DA 2(2) provides for the private limitation, which states a person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. 3 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 (PC) at 12,353. 4 At 12,355. 5 “Depreciation loss” is defined in s YA 1 to mean “a loss that a person has in the circumstances set out in section EE 1(2)” and includes “a deduction for depreciation that a person was allowed under an earlier Act”. 6 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA).

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 113 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 21. The Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Haenga 10 recognised the application of the private limitation will often raise the same questions as that under the general permission. Relevantly, the Court recognised the answer is complicated where the advantage for which the expense is incurred may serve private and income earning purposes. Basic items, such as food, clothing and shelter, while in one sense have a relation to the derivation of income, are ordinary living expenses and properly characterised as consumption. Such expenses are not incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because they are necessary in that sense. 11 Travel expenses 22. The Taxpayer sought to deduct their cost of travel between their home city and the other city in their personal car. 23. Applying the principle in Payne, the cost of travel between two unrelated places of work could not be said to be incurred in the course of deriving income from either and is therefore not an allowable deduction. 24. The question of the deductibility of travel expenses might also be framed in terms of the application of the private limitation, but for the specific rule under s DE 2 that allows a deduction for expenditure incurred for the “business use” of a motor vehicle, which overrides the private limitation. 12 However, the lack of sufficient connection between the expenses and assessable income that prevents deductibility under the general permission applies equally to the consideration of deductibility under s DE 2, given that “business use” is defined in s YA 1 to mean “travel undertaken by the vehicle wholly in deriving the person’s income”. 13 25. TCO decided that the Taxpayer’s travel expenses were not deductible because: The travel occurred in the intervals between the two unrelated income producing activities, being the Taxpayer’s farming activities in their home city and their work as an independent contractor in the other city, and not while the Taxpayer was engaged in either activity. The costs arose from the need for the Taxpayer to be in a position where they could set about the tasks from which assessable income would be derived. The costs were for travel “to one’s work” and “from one’s work”, as opposed to “on work” for either activity. Meal expenses 26. The Taxpayer claimed deductions for meal expenses incurred while the Taxpayer was in the other city. The Taxpayer argued the amounts claimed were the “extra cost” of the meals in the other city, where they were required to perform their work as an independent contractor, as compared to meals at home. 27. As a general proposition, case law has established that the cost of meals is not deductible, being a private matter, properly characterised as consumption and an ordinary living expense. 14 28. The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) in Case E80 15 indicated that an extra cost on meals eaten “out of town” may have sufficient nexus with the income earning process if the quantum of extra cost could be proved. The TRA again considered the “extra cost” issue in Case F117 16 , where they considered that the meal expenses in that case were deductible as the result of abnormal working conditions arising from the taxpayer’s occupation and represented expenses over and above the ordinary cost of eating meals prepared at home. The case law indicates the deductibility of the “extra cost” of meals can only be deductible if incurred as a requirement of a taxpayer’s work. 17 29. TCO decided that the meal expenses were not deductible to the Taxpayer because: The meal expenses were properly characterised as consumption and an ordinary living expense. They did not satisfy the statutory nexus with the derivation of income in the other city and were of a private and domestic nature. To the extent any extra cost (compared to the cost of meals at home) could be proved, these were not incurred as a requirement of the Taxpayer’s contracting work. 10 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA). 11 Haenga at 5,206 to 5,207. 12 See s DE 2(13). 13 This is consistent with the discussion in Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS3448 “Travel by motor vehicle between home and work deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications”. 14 Haenga; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooper 91 ATC 4396 (Full Federal Court, Sydney). 15 Case E80 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,421 (TRA). 16 Case F117 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,125 (TRA). 17 See Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 21/06 “Income tax and GST Treatment of Meal Expenses”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 114 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Accommodation expenses 30. The Taxpayer claimed deductions for accommodation expenses incurred while staying in the other city for their contracting work. 31. As a general principle, the costs of accommodation, like meals, are of a private nature, exclusively referrable to living as an individual member of society and a domestic expense relating to the household or family unit. 18 32. Accommodation costs incurred to put oneself in a position to work, for example in a different location away from home, is not incurred in gaining or producing the income or incurred while carrying on the income producing activity and therefore does not satisfy the statutory nexus with the derivation of income. 19 However, this can be contrasted with a situation where expenses are incurred as a requirement to the income earning activity, and not merely due to the person’s personal decision ordinarily arising on the provision of shelter. 20 33. TCO concluded that the accommodation expenses incurred by the Taxpayer were not deductible because: The accommodation expenses did not satisfy the statutory nexus with the derivation of income from contracting work and, being exclusively referrable to living as an individual member of society, are of a private and domestic nature. The expenses were incurred to put the Taxpayer in a position to work in the other city rather than having been incurred in income derivation from that work. They had arisen because of the Taxpayer’s personal preferences, as opposed to the peculiarities of the contracting work. 18 Haenga at 5,206. 19 Case G57 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,251 (TRA); Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 (TRA). 20 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Hunter (1990) 12 NZTC 7,169 (CA).

The Taxpayer is a GST registered body corporate providing services to the unit owners in an apartment complex. These services include repairing and maintaining the complex. The complex suffered weathertightness issues that required extensive remedial work. 2. The Taxpayer and unit owners lodged a claim under the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 (WHRS Act) and also commenced High Court proceedings against the local council (Council) and others they considered responsible for the defects. The Crown was not a party to the proceedings. In 2015 the parties to the proceedings entered a settlement agreement under which the Taxpayer and unit owners agreed to proceed with obtaining Government Financial Assistance Package (FAP) scheme under the WHRS Act. 3. Subsequently, the Taxpayer, the Crown (acting by and through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)) and the Council entered the FAP Agreement. The FAP Agreement included obligations and acknowledgements that: MBIE and the Council each agreed to pay 25% of the approved remedial costs – which does not include costs that result in betterment. once the first payment is made s 125G of the WHRS Act applies to restrict civil proceedings and relief. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 116 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES MBIE may act as the Council’s agent to pay the Council’s payments in accordance with the FAP Agreement. there is no admission of liability by MBIE and/or the Council. 4. Subsequently, MBIE made payments under the FAP Agreement to satisfy the Crown’s payment obligations (Crown FAP Payments) and those of Council (Council FAP Payments) as the Council’s agent. For reasons that are unclear, the total Crown FAP Payments were greater than the total Council FAP Payments. The Taxpayer distributed an amount to unit owners in late 2019 as a refund for levies not required because there was no further work to be done or paid for. The Taxpayer filed GST returns on the basis that the Crown FAP Payment was not subject to GST. Issues | Ngā take 5. The issue considered in this dispute was: whether the Crown FAP Payments received by the Taxpayer were “payments in the nature of a grant or subsidy” under s 5(6D) and therefore, deemed consideration for a supply that is subject to GST under s 8. 6. The GST treatment of the Council FAP Payments to the Taxpayer was not in issue. Decisions | Ngā whakatau 7. TCO decided that: The Crown FAP Payments to the Taxpayer are gratuitous payments to encourage or promote the repair of leaky buildings. The payments have not been made for the Taxpayer’s personal use or benefit, or for the personal use or benefit of a relative of the Taxpayer. Accordingly, the payments are in the nature of a grant or subsidy for the purposes of s 5(6D) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (G S TA). The Crown FAP Payments are therefore deemed to be consideration for a supply under s 5(6D), and subject to GST under s 8, of the GSTA. To the extent the difference between the Crown FAP Payments and the Council FAP Payments is because the Crown has funded any part of the Council’s obligations under the FAP Agreement, the relevant amount would be a settlement or compensation payment rather than a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy for the purposes of s 5(6D). Reasons for decisions | Ngā take mō ngā whakatau Issue | Take: Whether the payments are in the nature of a grant or subsidy for the purposes of s 5(6D) 8. The issue was whether the payments received by the Taxpayer were a “payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy” under s 5(6D). If they were, then there is a deemed supply for consideration and the payments will be subject to GST. 9. Customer and Compliance Services, Inland Revenue (CCS) argued s 5(6D) applied because the Crown FAP Payments were made without obligation to assist the Taxpayer to repair the property and this benefits both the Taxpayer and the wider public. CCS argued the exclusions (in s 5(6E)) to the term “payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy” did not apply. 10. The Taxpayer argued the Crown FAP Payments were not payments in the nature of a grant or subsidy and s 5(6D) did not apply. The payments, whether Crown or Council funded, arose under the FAP Agreement and were, in form and substance, payments to settle any legal liability of the Crown and of the Council. The payments were not made to assist or enable the Taxpayer to provide goods and services considered of public benefit in accordance with any Government objective. Further, it was argued that the payments were in any case for the personal use and benefit of the Taxpayer and its owners and so the exclusion from being a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy in s 5(6E) applied. 11. Section 5(6D) deems any payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy made on behalf of the Crown to any person in relation to or in respect of their taxable activity to be consideration for a supply of goods and services by the person to whom or for whose benefit the payment is made. The supply is deemed to be in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. 12. The key requirements for s 5(6D) are that there is a payment: in the nature of a grant or subsidy made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority made to a person (not being a public authority) made in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 117 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 13. The issue to be considered was the first bullet point – whether the payments were in the nature of a grant or subsidy. Included in this consideration was whether the specific exclusion for personal use payments and benefits in s 5(6E) applied. Payments in “the nature of a grant or subsidy” for the purposes of s 5(6D) 14. At the time s 5(6D) was enacted the guidance noted that the common thread in the definitions of grant or subsidy is that there “is a gift or assignment of money by government or a public authority out of public funds to a private or individual or commercial enterprise deemed to be beneficial to the public interest.” 1 15. Case law indicates the focus is on the character of the payment from the payer’s perspective, not its receipt in the hands of the payee, and recognises that a subsidy payment changes the nature of a contract from an ordinary commercial contract. 2 The Commissioner’s previously published public guidance 3 has considered factors which may indicate that a payment is in the nature of a grant or subsidy, including where the payment is: a gift, in the sense that there is no obligation to make it a special assistance payment to promote or encourage an industry or enterprise out of public funds beneficial to the public interest. 16. In summary, it was considered that the case law indicates a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy is a gratuitous payment made by the Crown, out of public funds, to promote or encourage an industry or enterprise and that the payment is special assistance, beneficial to the public interest. 4 17. The Taxpayer argued that the Crown FAP Payments were not the sort of payments Parliament envisaged as being subject to GST as payments in the nature of a grant or subsidy. Consequently, TCO considered the legislative background and concluded that the Government’s intention was that GST would be payable on grants and subsidies received by a registered person in the course of their taxable activity. The recipients of these grants are supplying services to the Crown through the use to which they put the grant money they receive and the purpose of s 5(6D) is to make such payments subject to GST. 18. TCO concluded that the Crown FAP Payments were in the nature of a “grant or subsidy” because: The payments were gratuitous payments by the Crown for the purpose of assisting with the cost of repairing the Taxpayer’s property to remedy problems arising from it not being weathertight. The payments were gratuitous because they were not made in response to any duty of care owed to the Taxpayer or unit owners. 5 The FAP Agreement does not acknowledge or otherwise create a duty of care and does not represent an admission of any form of liability by the Crown to the Taxpayer. The Crown FAP Payments are special assistance payments, deemed to be beneficial to the public interest. To the extent it is necessary to conclude that the Crown FAP Payments are beneficial to the public interest, or enable the Taxpayer to provide services to members of the public at a concessionary price, this criterion has been satisfied. This is because it is in public interest that these properties remain habitable by the homeowner and other New Zealanders in the future, and the homeowners were able to have their units repaired at a reduced cost. 1 Commissioner’s public statement: “Application of GST to Government Grants and Subsidies” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 1 (July 1991)).

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 118 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Payments for personal use or benefit of a person excluded under s 5(6E) 19. Under s 5(6E), a payment will not be in the nature of a grant of subsidy for the purposes of s 5(6D) if the payment is “for the personal use and benefit of the person or, as the case may be, a relative (as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition of that term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) of the person”. 6 20. TCO considered that the exclusion in s 5(6E)(b)(ii) does not apply to the Crown FAP Payments because: The Taxpayer is not a person for the purposes of s 5(6E)(b)(ii). The definition of “person” in s 2 of the GST Act includes companies and applies “unless the context otherwise requires”. In the context of s 5(6E)(b)(ii) it was considered that the term refers only to a natural person (ie, not a company). The subsection excludes payments for the personal use and benefit of the recipient person or a “relative” of the person. It was concluded that only a natural person can personally use a grant or subsidy. This position finds some support in the use of the term “relative” in the subparagraph. In any event, the Taxpayer cannot use the Crown FAP Payments personally as it is restricted in how it can use funds by legislation. The IRD guidance that sets out the purpose of s 5(6D) and (6E) 7 supports this conclusion. The Crown FAP Payments are not benefits similar to those paid under the Social Security Act (such as family support tax credits), which can be used by the recipient (who, given the nature of the payments, will be a natural person) for whatever purpose the recipient desires. TCO did not agree with the argument that s 5(6E)(b)(ii) applies to the Crown FAP Payments because some of the ‘settlement monies’ were ultimately distributed to the unit owners to use as they wished. The Crown FAP Payments were paid to the Taxpayer. The amounts distributed to the unit owners by the Taxpayer were not a distribution of the Crown FAP Payments but rather, as described on the credit notes distributed, a refund of levies (previously paid by the unit owners) not required. GST treatment of compensation or settlement payments 21. The parties agreed that a compensation or settlement payment will not be a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy. A payment for loss or damage is not consideration for a supply. 22. There is some crossover between the question of whether the Crown FAP Payments were gratuitous and whether the payments were compensation or settlement payments. Particularly relevant is the Crown has no duty of care to the Taxpayer in relation to weathertightness issues. 23. TCO considered the object of compensation is to financially restore the injured person to the position he or she would have occupied had the breach not occurred. 8 Where physical damage to a building has occurred as a result of the negligence of a builder, designer or local authority, the primary measure of damages is the cost of the remedial work or reinstatement. 9 24. Case law indicates that when determining whether a payment is a compensation payment and not consideration for a supply the emphasis is on the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. For a payment to be consideration for a supply the courts focus on whether there is a nexus between the supply and the consideration. No such nexus is established where the payment is a compensation or settlement payment. Further, a payment to settle a dispute and avoid litigation is not a “payment in the nature of a grant and subsidy” for the purposes of s 5(6D). 10 25. The position in the Commissioner’s guidance on the GST treatment of court awards and out of court settlements 11 is that a payment may be made for the purpose of settling a dispute or to compensate for a loss even where the payer does not accept any liability for the loss. This requires determination of whether the payment is for the purpose of compensating for a loss. 26. When the court proceedings were settled, the Taxpayer and the Council agreed to participate in the FAP scheme under the WHRS Act. The provisions of the WHRS Act applied notably: 6 Unless declared to be a taxable grant or subsidy under s 5(6E)(a)(ii). 7 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 1 (July 1991). 8 Attorney-General v Geothermal Produce New Zealand Ltd \[1987\] 2 NZLR 348 (CA). 9 Invercargill City Council v Hamlin \[1996\] 1 NZLR 513. 10 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA); New Zealand Refining Co Ltd v Commissioner Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,307 (HC). 11 Interpretation Statement IS 3387: “GST Treatment of Court Awards and Out of Court Settlements” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 119 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES s 125BA(2)(b) requires litigation to be discontinued (s 125BA makes no reference to the Crown). Section 125F gives the Crown protection from liability as a result of repairs undertaken through the FAP scheme. Section 125G provides that claimants who enter into the FAP scheme may not name the contributing party (ie, in this case the Crown) or any additional contributing party as defendant in any civil proceedings. 27. TCO considered the WHRS Act and legislative history and concluded that: The purpose of s 125G of the WHRS Act (combined with the contribution criteria requiring a claimant who has commenced civil proceedings against the Council to discontinue those civil proceedings entirely) was to divert funds from taxpayers and the Council away from litigation towards the repair of the property. The reason for the inclusion of the Crown (as a contributing party) in the immunity provided by s 125G was out of an abundance of caution and to ensure that the Crown preserve its position of not incurring liability for leaky homes which the courts have found does not extend to the Crown. 28. That the Crown had no liability for leaky homes was the understanding of the Honourable Maurice Williamson (Minister for Building and Construction) when the FAP Bill was being enacted in 2011. At the first, second, and third readings of the Bill the Minister emphasised that the Crown did not need to make any such payment to homeowners and referenced the failed court attempts to hold the Crown liable for leaky homes damages. This view is consistent with the case law. 29. The Court of Appeal has held that the Building Industry Authority (BIA) (replaced in November 2004 by the Department of Building and Housing which became part of MBIE in July 2012) had no duty of care to property owners of homes with monolithic cladding systems to exercise reasonable care in connection with its statutory responsibilities. 12 The Supreme Court followed this reasoning in confirming that the BIA was not under a duty of care to property owners. 13 30. The courts have taken a different view when considering the liability of territorial authorities/councils to property owners. 14 In summary, the courts’ approach effectively means that MBIE owes no duty of care to property owners facing weathertightness issues as there is insufficient causality between the MBIE and homeowners. However, local authorities can owe a duty of care to property owners. 31. TCO concluded that the Crown FAP Payments were not compensation or settlement payments and neither is it appropriate to treat the Crown FAP Payments as part of one overall FAP payment. In analysing the nature of a supply, the courts look at the underlying contract and what the supplier provided to the recipient. 32. The availability of the Crown FAP Payments and the Crown’s immunity from civil proceedings arose under the WHRS Act. The relationship between the Crown FAP Payments and the settlement of the litigation arises from the Taxpayer’s decision to repair the property through the FAP scheme. The Taxpayer was in legal proceedings involving the Council. The Taxpayer decided to repair the property under the FAP scheme instead of pursuing its legal claim against the Council (and others). As the focus is on the nature of the payment from the payer, not its character in the hands of the payee, whether the Taxpayer would have settled the litigation in the absence of the Crown FAP Payments is not relevant. 33. There was a discrepancy between the Crown FAP Payments and the Council FAP Payments despite the obligation of each party to pay 25% of approved costs under the FAP agreement. To the extent that the Crown has funded any part of the Council’s payment obligations under the FAP Agreement, the amount would be considered to be a settlement or compensation payment. This is because the nature of the payment must be determined by the legal arrangements actually entered into and the rights and duties created. The parties agree the Council payment obligations are settlement or compensation payments and this would not be altered by the Crown partially funding the Council’s payment obligations (if that is the reason for the disparity). 12 Attorney-General v Body Corporate 200200 (Sacramento) \[2007\] 1 NZLR 95. 13 North Shore City Council v Attorney-General \[2012\] 3 NZLR 341. 14 North Shore City Council v Body Corporate 188529 (Sunset Terraces & Ors; North Shore City Council v Body Corporate 189855 (Byron Avenue) & Ors \[2011\] 2 NZLR 289. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11 December 2022Inland Revenue Department 120 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Consistency with Inland Revenue publications 34. The conclusion in this matter was considered to be consistent with the Commissioner’s Statement on the GST treatment of MBIE leaky home payments. 15 That statement sets out the Commissioner’s position that a payment under the FAP scheme is not a payment in respect of any actual supply of goods and services made by the body corporate in return for that payment. The Commissioner considers that the payments are in the nature of a grant or subsidy from the Crown under s 5(6D) and are therefore deemed to be in response to a supply from the body corporate. As a result, these payments are subject to GST. 35. A GST registered body corporate which receives such payments is therefore obliged to include the GST component in its GST return and to pay for any net GST output tax. A body corporate which is not registered (and not liable to be registered) for GST is not obliged to account for GST. 36. TCO also considered the Commissioner’s published guidance on Treaty of Waitangi settlements. 16 Treaty settlements are not subject to GST because the settlement payments are not “consideration” for the supply of any goods or services made by the relevant Māori claimant group to the Crown. The Commissioner considers a Treaty settlement payment made by the Crown to provide redress for historical wrongs that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi is not gratuitous or a gift as it was “occasioned by a moral, and possibly legal, obligation \[on the Crown\] to correct the wrong done”. 37. This obligation to compensate for breaches of New Zealand’s founding document can be contrasted to the weathertightness issue where the Crown had no duty of care to the Taxpayer and no moral obligation to compensate the Taxpayer for the loss suffered from owning a leaky building. 15 Commissioner’s Statement CS 20/05, “GST treatment of payments received by a GST registered body corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 10 (November 2020) at pages 2-4. 16 Interpretation Statement IS 3427 “Treaty of Waitangi Settlements – GST Treatment” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002)).

An amendment was made to this issue of the Tax Information Bulletin on 26 July 2022.

See page 155, heading **_Buyer-created supply information_**

The first line under this heading originally read "A recipient of a supply must provide the recipient with the buyer-created taxable supply information within 28 days of the supply...."

It has now been corrected to say: "A recipient of a supply must provide the supplier with the buyer-created taxable supply information within 28 days of the supply...."

A second amendment was made on 1 March 2023.

See page 137, _Example 119_

The second bullet point has been amended to "George’s partner, Charlotte" and the remaining words removed.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Motor vehicle reimbursement - new rates to replace public service mileage rates Summary This item sets out the new Inland Revenue mileage rates that can be used to calculate the cost of motor vehicle use for tax purposes. The new rates apply from 1 August 1995. The Inland Revenue mileage rates replace the Public Service Mileage Rates (PSMRs) and the averaged mileage rates given in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Three, No.2 (August 1991). The new mileage rates use a simple two tier scale. For the first 3,000 kilometres the mileage rate is 56 cents per km. For each km over 3,000 km the mileage rate is 19 cents per km. Alternatively, a flat mileage rate of 26 cents per km can be used with no limit on the kilometres travelled. Apart from the new rates, an important change from the previous policy is that the limitation on shareholder- employees and self-employed taxpayers has been relaxed. These taxpayers can now use mileage rates for a maximum of 5,000 km a year. Previously, the maxi- mum was 2,000 km. Inland Revenue intends to revise the mileage rates every year and alter them if there is a significant change in motor vehicle operating costs. From 1996, we intend to apply any changes from 1 April. Background For many government departments used the PSMRs to calculate the reimbursement of employees using private motor vehicles for work use. For tax purposes, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue allowed employers to use PSMRs for calculating the tax-free reimbursement paid to employees who used their car for work purposes. The Commissioner has allowed self-employed taxpayers who used a motor vehicle for a small amount of work- related travel to use PSMRs to calculate their deductible motor vehicle expense. After the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee made recommendations on simplifying and extending the use of PSMRs in 1990, Inland Revenue produced some averaged mileage rates that could be used instead of the PSMRs. These rates are set out in Tax Informa- tion Bulletin Volume Three, No. 2 (August 1991) and applied from 1 August 1991. In 1994 the State Services Commission decided that it would no longer calculate and provide PSMRs. The PSMRs were last amended in 1989, and had remained unchanged because subsequent reviews showed the total cost of owning and running a car had not changed substantially. Inland Revenue reviewed the use of PSMRs and con- cluded that they tend to over-reimburse the average motorist for the proportion of overhead costs incurred in work-related running. Inland Revenue also found that the PSMRs treat depreciation as an ongoing running cost rather than a fixed cost. Policy The following table gives the new Inland Revenue mileage rates applying from 1 August 1995. The Commissioner will allow the mileage rates to be used by: • employers to calculate the tax-free reimbursement paid to employees who use their own vehicle for work-related use • employers to calculate the tax-free reimbursement paid to shareholder-employees who use their own vehicle for work-related use of up to 5,000 km. • self-employed taxpayers to calculate the tax-deduct- ible motor vehicle expense incurred in using their own vehicle for work related use of up to 5,000 km. Inland Revenue mileage rates applying from 1 August 1995 Motor cars - two tier scale Annual work- related kmMileage rate 1 to 3,000 km56c per km 3,001 km and over19c for each km over 3,000 Motor cars - flat rate Mileage rate:26c per km Motorcycles - two tier scale Annual work- related kmMileage rate 1 to 3,000 km28c per km 3,001 km and over10c for each km over 3,000 Motorcycles - flat rate Mileage rate:14c per km Note: the distance on which the appropriate mileage rate is calculated is work-related mileage only - not the total distance travelled by the motor vehicle for the year. Motor cars The two tier rate scale uses two significantly different rates. A full cost-recovery mileage rate of 56 cents continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) When an employee is reimbursed for motor vehicle use, a claim form should be filled out by the employee and retained by the employer. The claim form should record the date of the trip, the mileage, and the destination. If the two tier rate scale is used and it is possible that the employee will be reimbursed for more than 3,000 km during the year, the employer must also keep a running total of the mileage reimbursed to that em- ployee since the beginning of the income year. This will enable the right mileage rate to be selected. It will not be necessary to keep a running total if the flat rate is used. Self-employed taxpayers must similarly keep details of each work-related use of their vehicle and calculate their total work-related mileage for the income year. Alternatively, a self-employed taxpayer can keep a full record of all motor vehicle expenses and deduct the actual expenses incurred. In this case, if the vehicle is used for both private and business use, a logbook of all vehicle use must be kept for at least a three-month test period to determine the proportion of private use. The special provisions covering the use of logbooks are discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No. 3 (September 1994). Transition to new rates Until 31 July 1995, the old PSMRs or averaged mileage rates can be used to calculate motor vehicle costs for tax purposes. From 1 August 1995, the new Inland Revenue mileage rates must be used. However, the rate (apart from the flat rate) must be determined by considering the mileage travelled since 1 April or the start of the taxpayer’s non-standard income year. Example 1 Mr A is an employee who uses his own car to travel to work-related conferences and meetings. In the 1995-96 income year he uses his car for 4,800 km of work-related travel, with 1,600 km of travel occurring between 1 April 1995 and 31 July 1995. His employer uses the averaged mileage rates and the new Inland Revenue mileage rates to reimburse him to the maximum extent possible. In calculating Mr A’s non-taxable reimbursement for motor vehicle use for the 1995-96 income year, his employer can pay for 1,600 km at the old averaged mileage rate of 65 cents. The remaining 3,200 km has to be reimbursed using the new rates, based on the annual mileage of 4,800 km. This means 1,400 km (the balance of the first 3,000 km) can be reimbursed at 56 cents per km and the last 1,800 km at 19 cents per km. This gives a total reimbursement for the year of: (1,600 x 65c) + (1,400 x 56c) + (1,800 x 19c) = $2,166. from page 1 per km, that includes estimated overheads such as depreciation, applies for up to 3,000 km of work-related vehicle use. For each km over 3,000 km, a running cost only mileage rate of 19 cents per km applies. The running cost mileage rate includes the estimated cost of petrol, oil, tyres, and repairs and maintenance. Under the two tier scale, the mileage rate drops substan- tially after 3,000 km to prevent taxpayers who use mileage rates from being better off than taxpayers who keep full records and claim a deduction for actual costs incurred. The 3,000 km threshold is calculated as 25% of the average private car usage of 12,000 km a year. As an alternative to the two tier rate scale, a flat rate of 26 cents per km can be used to reimburse employees for an unlimited distance. Shareholder-employees and self-employed taxpayers can also use the mileage rates, but are limited to using mileage rates for a maximum of 5,000 km per year. Previously, the maximum was 2,000 km. When a shareholder-employee or a self-employed person exceeds the 5,000 km limit in any financial year, the person has the option of claiming either: • The specified rates up to 5,000 km only. • The actual expenses incurred apportioned to the percentage of business running over total annual running. The mileage rates are necessarily based on average car operating costs and apply to all cars regardless of size, age, or value. Excess reimbursement Any allowance paid to an employee for motor vehicle use that is greater than the amount allowed using the Inland Revenue mileage rates must be treated as a taxable allowance. The taxable allowance must be treated as part of normal salary or wages, and PAYE is to be deducted accordingly. However, employers can choose to reimburse employees for actual costs incurred for motor vehicle use. Nor- mally, the only verifiable costs incurred by employees using their vehicle for work-related use are petrol costs. For self-employed taxpayers, the Inland Revenue mileage rates give the maximum deduction that can be claimed without full supporting records. Record keeping requirements The year over which the work-related mileage of employees must be accumulated is the standard 1 April to 31 March income year. Self-employed taxpayers can use the same standard income year or, if they have a non-standard balance date, choose to aggregate their annual mileage over their non-standard income year. Whichever approach is adopted, it must be used consist- ently from year to year. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Example 2 Mrs B is a self-employed retailer who uses her car for work-related deliveries. She has a 31 July balance date, and had work-related mileage of 2,200 km in the period 1 August 1995 to 31 July 1996. Rather than keep full records of her car expenses, Mrs B uses mileage rates to calculate her deductible motor vehicle expense. Mrs B can choose to aggre- gate her work-related mileage to her balance date of 31 July or she can measure her mileage from 1 April to 31 March. She decides to use her non- standard income year as her measuring base from the 1996 year onwards. Since Mrs B has 2,200 km of work-related mileage in her 1995-96 income year, which began on 1 August 1995, she can use the 56 cents per km mileage rate for all 2,200 km of travel, giving a total claim of $1,232. Goods and Services Tax No GST input deduction can be claimed on motor vehicle expenses calculated using mileage rates. The Commissioner’s policy on this issue is given in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Three, No. 4 (December 1991). Fruit vines and trees replaced by regrafting or replanting - income tax treatment Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the income tax treatment of the cost of replacing fruit vines and trees used in producing assessable income. The Commissioner’s policy is that in most cases the cost of replacement trees, whether regrafted on to existing rootstock or completely replaced, must be capitalised to the vines or trees account. A current year deduction will only be allowed for replacements when the new vine or tree is a replacement for a vine or tree of the same species and variety that has died or been destroyed. Taxpayers can write off the unexpired book value of vines or trees that have been completely removed from the orchard and have ceased to be used in the produc- tion of assessable income. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background From time to time, orchardists replace varieties, and in some cases, species of vines or trees in order to ensure that their product is of high quality and the variety meets market demand. Replacements are made by either regrafting a new variety onto a cut-back rootstock or by replacing the vine or tree altogether. The costs associ- ated with these replacements are capital in nature, but there is provision in the Act to amortise the capital cost at a flat rate of 10% each year. Plantings made between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer’s 1994-95 income year qualify for the extra 25% deduction, i.e., 12.5%. Plantings made in the taxpayer’s 1995-96 and subsequent income years qualify for a 12% annual deduction. The Commissioner has a discretion to allow the write- off of the unexpired book value of the vines or trees that have ceased to exist or have ceased to be used in the production of assessable income. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DO 4128A DO 4 (4)128A(4A) BB 7104 Schedule 7Schedule 13 Section DO 4 provides a “depreciation-type” rule for expenditure on land improvements used for farming or agricultural purposes, effective from the 1987-88 income year. Specific categories of land improvements listed in Schedule 7 are capitalised and amortised at the rate specified in the schedule. These rates are either 5% or 10%, depending on the nature of the improvement. One of the categories in Part A of the schedule is: (12) The planting of vines or trees on the land other than trees planted primarily and principally for the purposes of timber production. The percentage of diminished value of expenditure allowed for vines and trees is 10%. Section DO 4 (4) gives the Commissioner authority to allow a deduction greater than the 10% specified in Schedule 7 if he is satisfied that the vines or trees have ceased to exist or have ceased to be used in the produc- tion of assessable income. The section states: The Commissioner may, in respect of any item of expenditure of a kind specified in clause 12 of Part A of Schedule 7, allow a deduction of an amount greater than that otherwise allow- able under subsection (3) where the Commissioner is satisfied that the vines or trees have ceased to exist or have ceased to be used in the production of assessable income: Provided that this subsection shall not apply in respect of any vines or trees- (a) That have ceased to exist before 16 December 1991; or (b) In respect of which the Commissioner is satisfied that those vines or trees have ceased, before 16 December 1991, to be used in the production of assessable income. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Example Mrs Pip Stone has an established orchard which contains a block of 300 royal gala apple trees. She decides to change to a braeburn variety over a three- year period. Her plan is to replace 50% of the old trees by regrafting to the existing rootstock and 50% by complete replanting. The written-down book value of the trees at the beginning of the 1994 income year is $3,000. The treatment for income tax purposes is as follows: Notes: For simplicity, this example uses the flat 10% annual deduction. Plantings made between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer’s 1994-95 income year qualify for the extra 25% deduction, i.e., 12.5%. Plantings made in the taxpayer’s 1995-96 and subsequent income years qualify for a 12% annual deduction. 1994 income year Opening value of trees (1 April 1993)$3,000 less trees fully replaced (50 @ $10) - $500 (written off) trees regrafted (50 @ $10) - $500 $2,000 plus replacement trees (50 @ $20)$1,000 regrafted trees (50 @ $20)$1,000 $4,000 Less10% deduction under section DO 4 - $ 400 Closing value of trees (31 March 1994)$3,600\* \* Closing value - royal gala = $1,800 (200 @ $9.00) - braeburn = $1,800 (100 @ $18.00 † ) † (opening value of $10.00 plus cost of regrafting ($10.00), less 10% reduction) Note: Mrs Stone can claim a deduction of $500 for the 50 trees completely removed and the 10% reduction of $400. 1995 income year Opening value of royal gala trees (1 April 1994)$1,800 less trees fully replaced (50 at $9)- $ 450 (written off) less trees regrafted (50 at $9)- $ 450 $ 900 Opening value of braeburn trees (1 April 1994)$1,800 plus replacement trees (50 @ $20)$1,000 plus regrafted trees (50 @ $19) $ 950 $3,750 Total of above values$4,650 less 10% deduction under section DO 4$ 465 Closing value of trees (31 March 1995)$4,185 ‡ ‡ Closing value - royal gala = $810 (100 @ $8.10) - braeburn= $3,375 (200 @ $16.88) Policy Replacement trees Schedule 7 refers to the “planting” of vines and trees. The Commissioner’s view is that “planting” means the initial planting at the establishment of an orchard, and any future replacement plantings when a particular species or variety is removed and replanted with a new species or variety Schedule 7 refers to vines and trees rather than or- chards. The Commissioner’s view is that the term “vines or trees” refers to vines or trees collectively, whether as a complete orchard or part of the orchard such as blocks, or rows of trees. Any replacement plantings of any part of the orchard are a capital expense, and the cost must be capitalised to the orchard account and written off at the 10% rate specified in Schedule 7. The Commissioner will only allow a current year deduction when a small number of vines or trees are replaced because they die or are destroyed. The number of trees and vines allowable as a current year deduction will depend on the facts of each particular case, but will generally be limited to replacing a small number of trees in a row or block, rather than replacing every vine or tree in that row or block. For example, an orchardist plants a new block of apple trees. Of the 50 trees planted, 6 die due to wind damage. The cost of replacing those 6 trees can be claimed as a current year deduction under the general deductibility provisions of section BB 7. There is no need to adjust the tree account to which the cost of the whole planting had been capitalised. In summary, for tax purposes the replacement of vines and trees will be treated as follows: • New plantingscapital • Replacement with new varietiescapital • Regrafting to existing treescapital • Replanting of blockscapital • Single vine or tree replacementsrevenue Write-off of vines or trees Section DO 4 (4) permits the write-off of the unexpired book value of vines or trees that have been replaced and completely removed. The replacement of a variety of vine or tree by cutting back and regrafting to the existing rootstock does not qualify for a write-off. This is because the vine or tree has not ceased to exist or ceased to be used for producing assessable income. The rootstock once regrafted with new budwood will still be producing assessable income sometime in the future. Further, the write-off does not apply to vines or trees that ceased to exist or ceased to be used for producing assessable income before 16 December 1991. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Note: Mrs Stone can claim a deduction of $450 for the 50 trees completely removed and the 10% reduction of $465. Similar adjustments will apply in the 1996 income year. If the orchardist is the lessee of the land, it is the person incurring the expenditure, whether the owner or the lessee, who is entitled to the deduction. A deduction is not permitted in the year the land is sold. Any balance of the unexpired book value of the vines or trees cannot be written off in the year of sale. The book value of the vines or trees is used by the purchaser of the orchard as an opening value to continue the deduction available under section DO 4. Building and engineering industries - successive supplies Summary This item considers the nature of supplies covered by section 9(3)(aa)(ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Supplies made in the building and engineering industries that are subject to an agreement or enactment providing for periodic payments are subject to the time of supply rule as provided in section 9(3)(aa)(ii). The types of supplies to which section 9(3)(aa)(ii) applies are: • Civil engineering works (examples listed in this item). • Other engineering works such as the manufacture of plant. • Building works such as the construction of a house or office block. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Legislation Section 9(3)(aa)(ii) provides a special time of supply rule for the building and engineering industries. The section applies to goods and services supplied directly in the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or an engineering work when those goods and services are supplied under an agree- ment or enactment which provides for periodic pay- ments. Section 9(3)(aa)(ii) determines that the time of supply for each successive supply is the earlier of the time that any payment is due or received, or any invoice is issued relating to that payment. Types of supplies covered by section 9(3)(aa)(ii) In addition to the construction of buildings, section 9(3)(aa)(ii) applies to engineering works. The following list, which is not intended to be exhaustive, indicates the types of engineering supplies considered by the Commissioner as falling within the provisions of section 9(3)(aa)(ii): Civil engineering work examples: • walls, roadworks, canals, railways, aqueducts, bridges, tunnels, viaducts, docks, harbours, piers, quays, wharves, lighthouses, airfields, landing grounds, and cable ducts • water supply systems, dams, reservoirs, water towers, major drainage and sewage schemes, river works, and sea defence works • hydro-electric installations, cooling towers, overhead transmission lines, gas works, pipelines, cable laying, and shaft sinking • bunkers, tanks, silos, or similar containers for bulk storage of materials • defence works, such as rocket ranges and other installations wholly or partly underground • outdoor public recreation grounds, sports arenas, and race tracks involving substantial construction work • work of a subterranean nature involving excavation, tunnelling, segment and steel work, and all subsidiary and complementary work in timber, concrete, brick, tile and other material of construction, together with work in connection with escalators and lifts • thermal power stations, oil refineries and chemical plants, steelworks, and similar large scale industrial or commercial undertakings. Other engineering works: • the manufacture of large items of plant and machin- ery, such as pulp and paper processing machinery or plant used in the meat and dairy industries • the construction and refurbishment of ships and aircraft • the manufacture of mining equipment. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) GST de minimis rule applying to exempt supplies by a registered person Introduction This item considers the application of the “de minimis” rule in the first proviso to section 21(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background “De minimis” is the shortened version of the phrase de minimis non curat lex, meaning that the law does not concern itself with trifles. The de minimis rule in section 21 simplifies accounting for GST for registered persons who supply only a minimum of exempt goods and services in proportion to their total supplies. These registered persons need not make GST output adjust- ments for their exempt supplies when accounting for GST. Legislation Section 21(1) states: Subject to section 5(3) of this Act, to the extent that goods and services applied by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are subsequently applied by that registered person for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies, they shall be deemed to be supplied by that registered person in the course of that taxable activity to the extent that they are so applied: Provided that this subsection shall not apply to any goods and services to the extent that they are applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies where at the commencement of any taxable period there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of all exempt supplies to be made by that registered person in that month then commencing and the 11 months immediately following that month will not exceed the lesser of- (a) The amount of $48,000: (b) An amount equal to 5 percent of the total consideration in respect of all taxable and exempt supplies to be made during that 12 month period. Application GST registered persons may claim an input tax deduc- tion for goods and services they have acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the goods are subsequently used for a purpose other than for making taxable supplies (exempt or private purposes), section 21(1) deems a supply of those goods to occur to the extent they are used for that other purpose. In these circumstances, the registered person must then return output tax on this “deemed supply”. However, the de minimis rule in the first proviso to section 21(1) may apply. The rule applies when the goods and services are subsequently applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies, and it is expected that the total value of all exempt supplies will not exceed the lesser of these two amounts: • $48,000 • 5% of the total consideration in respect of all taxable and exempt supplies, made during the current month and the immediately following 11 months. In this situation the registered person does not need to account for and return output tax on the “deemed supply”. The rule does not apply when goods or services pur- chased for making taxable supplies are later applied for private purposes. The 12-month period in the de minimis rule runs from the beginning of the first month of the taxable period under consideration and includes the following 11 months. If the taxpayer expects the exempt supplies to exceed the threshold over the current month and the next 11 months, he or she must account for output tax on the deemed supply. The de minimis rule will not apply. This does not affect any previous GST returns in which the person did not account for output tax on deemed supplies, as long as the de minimis rule was properly applied in the prior periods. Example Brenda runs her own business, a dairy near the beach at Happy Sands. She leases the premises, and claims an input tax deduction for the GST compo- nent of the rental. The property includes a little cottage used for storage. A holidaymaker asks Brenda if he and his family can use the cottage during the summer. Brenda agrees. This is an exempt supply under section 14(c). Section 21(1) deems a supply of those goods to occur under these circumstances, as goods have been subsequently used for a purpose other than for making taxable supplies. Brenda should then return output tax on this “deemed supply”. However, the de minimis rule in the first proviso to section 21(1) may apply. Brenda makes annual taxable and exempt supplies of approximately $130,000: the exempt supplies being the rental of the cottage for $6,240. Five per cent of the value of the total taxable and exempt supplies that Brenda will make in the next 12 months is $6,500. In these circumstances, Brenda need not make any adjustment to reflect that the lease is now being applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Specified suspensory loans - income tax treatment when remitted Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the tax treatment of remitted specified suspensory loans. Section DC 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (formerly section 172 of the Income Tax Act 1976) deems that any amount of specified suspensory loan remitted is assessable income. The income is assessable in three equal amounts in the year of the remittance and the next two income years. However, the taxpayer can elect to have the income which would normally be assessable in the second and third years wholly or partly allocated to an earlier year in the three year period. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Before the major tax reforms of the mid-1980s, the Government provided incentives to help various manu- facturers and other producers. The Development Finance Corporation, the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation, the Ministry of Energy (as they then were), and other public authorities made various suspensory loans to businesses to encourage development. Each “specified suspensory loan” listed in section DC 2 (5) had varying criteria, but the basis of the loans was for the business concerned to meet specific production targets after the granting of the loan. Once these targets are met the loans are remitted either in whole or in part. Section DC 2 deems the amount remitted to be assess- able income. No new loans have been made for some time, but some loans still exist and will be remitted in the future, provided the requirements of the particular loan are met. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DC 2172 Section DC 2 states: (1) Subject to this section, where any taxpayer has been granted a specified suspensory loan in relation to the business of the taxpayer and the liability of the taxpayer in respect of that loan is remitted, in whole or in part, the amount remitted shall be deemed to be assessable income derived equally in 3 income years, being the income year in which that amount is remitted and the next 2 succeed- ing income years, and the taxpayer shall be assessable and liable for income tax accordingly: Provided that the taxpayer may, if the taxpayer elects by notice in accordance with subsection (3) (which election shall, subject to subsection (4), be irrevocable) be entitled to allocate the whole or any part of that amount which is deemed to be assessable income derived by the taxpayer in either of those 2 succeeding income years to be income derived by the taxpayer in any earlier income year, being one of those 3 income years. (2) Upon receiving notice of allocation under the proviso to subsection (1), the Commissioner shall determine that the amount allocated shall be deemed to be assessable income derived by the taxpayer in the income year to which it is so allocated by the taxpayer and not in the income year in which it was deemed to be assessable income under that subsection. (3) Every notice of allocation under the proviso to subsection (1) shall be given to the Commissioner within the time within which the taxpayer is required to furnish a return of income for the year to which the amount is so allocated, or within such further time as the Commissioner, in his discretion, may allow in any case or any class of cases. (4) Notwithstanding anything in this section, where a taxpayer ceases to carry on the business in relation to which a specified suspensory loan was granted in any income year, any amount remitted in respect of that loan which is deemed to be assessable income derived in any succeeding income year shall be determined by the Commissioner to be assessable income derived by the taxpayer in that income year in which the taxpayer ceased to carry on that business. (5) In this section, “specified suspensory loan” means- (a) Any loan made by the Development Finance Corpora- tion of New Zealand as- (i) An applied technology investment finance loan under an applied technology programme; or (ii) An export suspensory loan, - and designated as such by that Corporation: (b) Any loan made by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand as- (i) A rural export suspensory loan; or (ii) A fishing vessel construction suspensory loan; or (iii) A land development encouragement loan; or (iv) A sharemilkers suspensory loan, - and designated as such by that Corporation: (c) Any loan made by the Ministry of Energy as a liquefied petroleum gas distribution suspensory loan and designated as such by that Ministry: (d) Any other loan, made by a public authority and designated by that public authority as a specified suspensory loan. Application Under section DC 2 the Commissioner is only con- cerned at the point the various loans are converted to continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Example: A sharemilker, Sam Cheeseman, received a sharemilker’s suspensory loan of $6,000 on 12 May 1984 to help him buy his first dairy farm. The term of the loan is ten years. Provided Mr Cheeseman personally owns and farms the property for the ten- year period, the loan is interest free and written off at the end of that period. Sam meets the conditions of the loan and it is remitted on 13 May 1994. Sam has the industry balance date of 31 May. Under section DC 2 (1) one-third of the amount remitted is deemed to be assessable income in each of the 1994, 1995, and 1996 income years - $2,000 for each year. If Sam makes the appropriate election, the $4,000 deemed to be assessable income in the 1995 and 1996 years can be allocated wholly or partly to either of the 1994 and 1995 income years. In effect, this means that Sam could have the entire amount assessed in the 1994 income year, or could allocate the $4,000 in what ever portion he so wishes between the 1994 and 1995 income years. GST - impact on the preparation of income tax accounts Introduction This item explains how GST affects income and ex- penses when people prepare their income tax accounts. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise indicated. Summary GST registered persons generally prepare their income tax accounts on a GST exclusive basis. A registered person’s assessable income is adjusted to account for: • GST not claimed as an input tax deduction for GST purposes; and • GST adjustments made under section 21. A non-registered person treats GST on the same basis as any other cost and completes GST inclusive accounts. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 ED 4140B EG 1108 Section ED 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides the specific rules for the income tax treatment of GST. Section ED 4 contains two general provisions. In summary these are: • A person’s assessable income excludes any output tax charged on supplies made (sales), and any refunds of GST from the Commissioner. • A person cannot deduct from assessable income any input tax charged, levied, or calculated to that person on supplies received (purchases and GST paid to Customs), or any GST payable to the Commissioner. However, the following are exceptions to the above general provisions: • A GST adjustment under section 21(1) for the exempt use of a business purchase is deductible from assess- able income. • A GST adjustment under section 21(5) for the busi- ness use of a private or exempt purchase is included as assessable income. • A GST adjustment under section 21(3) on supplies to employees that are subject to fringe benefit tax is deductible from assessable income. The first two exceptions (relating to section 21(1) and 21(5)) do not apply to GST adjustments for the perma- nent change in the principal purpose of a capital asset (for example, an adjustment to reflect the permanent change in the use of a motor vehicle from business use to exempt use). The GST amount of such adjustments is “capitalised” to the asset. This means that for the grants, i.e. when the loans are remitted. Until that time the loans are ignored for income tax purposes. When a taxpayer has received a specified suspensory loan and that loan is wholly or partly later remitted, the amount remitted is deemed to be assessable income. Section DC 2 (1) deems it to be derived equally in the year of remission and the two following income years. The proviso to section DC 2 (1) allows the taxpayer to elect to have the amount which would normally be assessable in the second or third year allocated instead wholly or partly to an earlier year in the three-year period. This means that all or part of the amount can be assessed in the year of remission and/or the first year after remission. Under section DC 2 (3), a taxpayer who wants to make such an election must make it within the time for filing his or her tax return for the year to which the income is to be allocated. Once made, this allocation becomes irrevocable. If a taxpayer ceases to carry on the business for which a remitted loan was given, any amount not already allocated is deemed to be assessable income for the year that the business ceased. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) purposes of making a depreciation deduction under section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the cost price is: • reduced when the GST adjustment arises from the permanent change from a non-taxable purpose to taxable purpose; and • increased when the GST adjustment arises from the permanent change from a taxable purpose to a non- taxable purpose. Section ED 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 also provides that a GST exclusive value is applied to the determina- tion of trading stock values, the calculation of capital expenditure, and the calculation of depreciation recov- ered. Preparing income tax accounts Non-registered persons Non-registered persons cannot deduct input tax for GST charged on expenditure incurred. This means that GST charged to them is a real cost. To account for the “cost” of GST, non-registered persons complete their income tax accounts on a GST inclusive basis. This means that all expenditure items are claimed inclusive of the GST charged, depreciation is based on the GST inclusive cost of the asset, and trading stock is valued using the GST inclusive cost of the stock. Section ED 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 does not apply to non-registered persons. Registered persons Registered persons may complete their income tax accounts on a GST inclusive or GST exclusive basis. The application of section ED 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 ensures that GST does not affect the calculation of a person’s income tax liability. The “Statements of Standard Accounting Practice” (“SSAPs”) published by the New Zealand Society of Accountants describe the methods of accounting approved by the Council of the New Zealand Society of Accountants. SSAP 19 states that the preferred method of accounting for GST is to state both income and expenditure items net of GST, but that GST inclusive amounts should be used for expenditure items when no input tax deductions are claimed. GST inclusive accounts GST inclusive accounts record income and expenditure on a GST inclusive basis. Revenue and expenditure amounts are calculated using GST inclusive values. To eliminate GST from the net profit figure, GST refunds are treated as assessable income and GST paid to Inland Revenue is allowed as a deduction against assessable income. GST exclusive accounts GST exclusive accounts record transactions using GST exclusive values, taking into account any GST adjust- ments made under section 21(1) and section 21(5), and any expenditure items not claimed for GST purposes. Example A company has sales including GST of $112,500, inputs including GST of $33,300, and wages of $40,400. In that income year it provides $9,000 of fringe benefits to employees, and purchases plant costing $22,500 including GST. Some of the company’s assets are applied to a minor degree for making GST exempt supplies, and ongoing output tax adjustments totalling $1,200 are made in that year under section 21(1).

An overview of the New Zealand residence rules, including a discussion of the meaning of permanent place of abode, appeared initially in PIB 180 (June 1989). Case law establishes that when determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand the material factors to consider are continuity, the duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand, and the durability of the person’s association with New Zealand. Those factors are weighed and viewed in context as a whole rather than in isolation. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 3242 BB 11294 OE 1241 OE 1 (1)241(1) Under section BB 3, a person who is resident in New Zealand is liable for income tax on all income derived at the time he or she was resident, whether the income is derived from New Zealand or from elsewhere. The person’s liability is subject to other provisions of the Act (for example, section BB 11 which allows relief from double taxation on income potentially liable for tax in two or more countries). Section OE 1 sets out the tests for whether a person is a resident in New Zealand. Under section OE 1 (1) the overriding test of residence is whether the person has a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand. Section OE 1 (1) applies despite any other provision in section OE 1. OE 1 (1) states: Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a person, other than a company, is resident in New Zealand within the meaning of this Act if that person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, whether or not that person also has a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand \[emphasis added\]. Application The legislation does not define “permanent place of abode”. Case law has established that the expression means a “fixed and habitual place of abode”, “a place of abode with which the person has an enduring relation- ship and where the person habitually or normally lives”. Whether a person has a permanent place of abode is a question of fact, and a number of factors are taken into account such as: • relevant period of association with New Zealand • continuity and duration of presence • durability of association. Relevant period of association with New Zealand In determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode, a person’s past and future associations with New Zealand can be considered. The inquiry is not limited to factors occurring within the relevant income year(s). Continuity and duration of presence How long has the person been absent from New Zea- land? Generally, the longer a person is absent from New Zealand, the more likely it is that he or she does not have a permanent place of abode here. A temporary stay overseas will usually point to a person having a perma- nent place of abode in New Zealand. In FCT v Jenkins 82 ATC 4,098 (an Australian case), Justice Sheahan discussed the meaning of a “temporary” stay overseas. He held that the fact the taxpayer had agreed to accept a transfer for a fixed period did not mean that his stay away was only temporary as opposed to leaving Australia permanently. He said at page 4,101: ...how long a stay is a “temporary” one. If a stay \[overseas\] of ten years cannot sensibly be regarded as “temporary”, why should a period of three years be so regarded. True it is that in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary one of the primary meanings of “temporary” is “lasting for a limited time”. To limit means, inter alia, to assign within limits, but I baulk at the notion that a stay out of Australia by a person on transfer for a fixed period of ten years must be regarded as temporary simply because the limits of the stay are fixed and ascer- tainable \[emphasis added\]. Durability of association “Durability of association” involves looking at the extent and strength of the attachments and relationships that the person has established and maintained in New Zealand. A number of relevant factors include: Availability and use of dwelling What type of accommodation does the person have while in New Zealand? Does the person rent, board, own a home, live with relatives, or house sit? If a person owns a home, what happens to it while the person is overseas? Is it let out, occupied, unoccupied, or made available to friends? 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) The pattern of accommodation is important. A person owning or occupying a house for a number of years (as opposed to temporary accommodation) is more likely to have an enduring connection with New Zealand. Intention Does the person intend to return to New Zealand? Determining a person’s intention is a subjective matter, but the actual actions of the person can later indicate what his or her intention really is. A person’s intention is important, but it is not viewed in isolation and is balanced against the other factors. Family and social ties Does the person have a spouse or children? Is the person’s family accompanying him or her overseas? Where does the person’s immediate family live? How strong are the family ties? The weight attached to family ties may vary from individual to individual according to the circumstances. Generally, the stronger the family ties are to New Zealand the more likely it is that the person has a close association with New Zealand. Other social ties may also be important, for example, sporting and cultural connections. Employment and business interests and economic ties How much of the person’s employment, business, trade, or profession is carried out in New Zealand? Does the person retain employment, business, trade, or profes- sional ties with New Zealand while absent? Does the person retain membership of professional and trade associations in New Zealand? Has the person resigned or applied for leave to go overseas? The person’s overall economic connections with New Zealand are also relevant. Does the person have credit cards, bank accounts, shares, property investments, superannuation, or other investments in New Zealand? All of these factors can indicate that the person has a close association with New Zealand. Personal property If the person has personal property, (e.g., furniture or a vehicle) situated in New Zealand, that can be taken into account in determining whether the person has an enduring association with New Zealand. Miscellaneous Miscellaneous factors, such as whether the person receives any social welfare payments or returns to New Zealand for holidays, may also be relevant. Conclusion Case law establishes that in determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand the material factors to consider are continuity, the duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand, and the durability of the person’s association with New Zealand. Those factors are weighed and viewed in context as a whole rather than in isolation. Case law The following examples from case law may provide guidance as to the way the courts have considered the various factors. Case J98 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,555 The objector, a health inspector from New Zealand, exchanged jobs and homes with a person from Canada. The objector and his family were absent from New Zealand for a total of 315 days. Judge Barber of the Taxation Review Authority held that the objector’s permanent place of abode during the period of his absence was New Zealand. The factors that were material in the case were: • The objector retained his job in New Zealand during the period of the exchange. • The employer released the objector on leave for 10 months. • There were documents stating that it was only a temporary exchange and each health inspector was to return to his job in his own country. • The objector retained his home during the exchange and could re-occupy it once he returned from over- seas. • The objector continued to live in the same home for 15 months when he returned from overseas. Case H97 (1986) 8 NZTC 664 A construction worker entered into a contract of em- ployment to work at a mining site in New Guinea for a minimum period of six months. Before his departure the objector lived with his parents, and left in their care his motor vehicle for resale. He took his other personal belongings to New Guinea. While in New Guinea the objector lived in spartan conditions. After six months he returned to New Zealand for a holiday. However, he became ill and remained in New Zealand. Judge Barber of the Taxation Review Authority held that the objector’s permanent place of abode was the home of his parents in New Zealand. He considered the following factors to be relevant in the particular case: • The construction camp was of a temporary or transi- tory nature. • The objector had entered into a contract of employ- ment for a fixed period. • The home of the objector’s parents was his “fall-back base”. Judge Barber noted that in his evidence the objector seemed to suggest that he intended to remain out of New Zealand indefinitely. He said at page 668: continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) house let on long-term lease can be a person’s perma- nent place of abode. Judge Barber found that the objector had and continued an enduring relationship with New Zealand and his permanent place of abode was in New Zealand. He was simply on leave from his New Zealand employer during his absence and retained his dwelling, assets, and connections. Judge Barber said at page 5,319: I consider that having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, in terms of s.241(1) of the Act, is not the same as having accommodation there at one’s disposal on a permanent basis... in my view, it does not much matter that a house is not available for a taxpayer’s use during the taxpayer’s temporary absence from New Zealand. ...I consider that the phrase “has a permanent place of abode” require, inter alia, the availability of a place in which to dwell but that the existence of a home or dwelling does not necessarily create a permanent place of abode. The latter concept also requires some durability of connection with a locality as well as the availability of a place in which to sleep. ...I think the strength of a person’s ties with New Zealand is the paramount factor in assessing residency but those ties must include the availability on a permanent basis (continuing indefinitely) of a place in which to dwell and sleep if that person is to have a permanent place of abode somewhere in New Zealand. The enduring availability of a dwelling is a fundamental criterion to having a permanent place of abode, but it is not decisive on its own \[emphasis added\]. Example Bob left New Zealand to take up a job as a chef in London. Initially, it was a three year contract, but if all went well Bob intended to stay there indefinitely. Most of Bob’s family and friends lived in London and his wife was to accompany him. Bob sold his house and his car, and gave some furniture he did not want to his sister. He closed off his New Zea- land bank accounts and terminated his New Zea- land superannuation scheme. Bob also resigned from the various clubs he belonged to and has no business or professional ties with New Zealand. After considering Bob’s circumstances, the Com- missioner would determine that Bob did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 1995 international tax disclosure exemption ITR6 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities. This section came into force on 1 April 1995, replacing the previous section 245W of the Income Tax Act 1976. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 1995. This exemption Case law has held that in determining where the permanent place of abode is located, the Authority should look at “not only what was intended but what in fact occurred”: Case F139 (ibid). The objector stated that his intention “to stay out of New Zealand” is proved by his possession of the air ticket to Perth before he underwent medical tests in New Zealand. However, the concept of staying out of New Zealand for a substantial time is not inconsistent with having a perma- nent place of abode in New Zealand \[emphasis added\]. Case Q55 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313 The objector was a university professor who went on sabbatical leave overseas for a period of 368 days. During his absence the objector retained ownership of his city residence in New Zealand and ensured that it was available for reoccupation by him and his wife as their home immediately upon their return to New Zealand. It was clear that their stay overseas was temporary and that they intended to return to the house. They retained the same telephone number. They re- tained possession of the small basement room for storage purposes and a garage in which the objector’s wife’s car was stored. The objector continued to be employed by the university while overseas and was paid by the university during his absence. He retained other extensive financial ties with New Zealand. He derived dividends from 11 New Zealand companies. He had investments in 11 overseas banks or companies and net dividends or interest was forwarded to New Zealand for him. He derived rental income from about five properties in New Zealand. He also retained membership of a medical care society and of other associations and clubs. The objector and his wife were out of New Zealand for 368 days from 21 January 1990 until 25 January 1991. Judge Barber of the Taxation Review Authority thought that relative to the circumstances, that was not a particularly long period. The objector had resided at the city residence for about 51 years before his departure overseas. It was also relevant that the objector lived at the city residence ever since his return to New Zealand in January 1991. The objector argued that he could not have been a New Zealand resident because there was nowhere in New Zealand he could have slept or lived. The objector submitted that the main issue in the case was whether a from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemp- tion ITR6”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 1995 disclosure exemption is the same as the 1994 exemption. Disclosure is required for these interests: • an interest held in a FIF • an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determin- ing exemption from disclosure it includes these inter- ests: 1. an income interest held directly in a foreign com- pany 2. an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3. an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8 (3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF inter- ests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” on page 14). Foreign company interests A person who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 1995 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on form IR 4G “Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Schedule”. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: • attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. • to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction . • the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15 (1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: • rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (e.g., a unit trust) • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannua- tion scheme • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy • an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a FIF under section CG 15 (2) does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15 (2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: • an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC • an interest in a foreign entity that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA • an interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme • interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquir- ing the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year • an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or considera- tion readily convertible to New Zealand currency • an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s “Foreign Investment Funds” booklet (IR 275B). continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2. Use the IR 4G form to disclose: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either forms IR 4G or IR 4H for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Summary The 1995 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (i.e., it is less than 10%). The disclo- sure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. A person who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 1995 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form “Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule and Worksheet” (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed four forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either form IR 4G or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file: 1. Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) from page 13 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR6” 1. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1995. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 1995, shall not be required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that income interest or control interest in that foreign company and that income year, except where: • the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 17th day of July 1995.

The Accident Rehabilita- tion and Compensation Insurance Corporation (ACC) accepted his claim for compensation as a work injury, and paid for part of his medical treatment. The builder paid the balance of the medical costs himself. He asked if he can claim a deduction for these costs. Section BB 7 is the main provision allowing for deductions. It states that: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) If the expenditure is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business, a deduction is permitted under section BB 7. Notwithstanding section BB 7, in some cases section BB 8 specifically limits the wider deductions that would otherwise be permitted under section BB 7. Under section BB 8 (b), in calculating the assess- able income derived by any person, no deduction is allowed for: Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature: Inland Revenue’s view is that expenditure required to remedy injury or disabil- ity to the human body is expenditure of a private or domestic nature, even if the expenditure is to enable the taxpayer to resume earning income by having his or her health restored. Such expenditure is not incurred in the course of gaining or producing income, nor is it an overhead or functioning cost in a taxpayer’s business. Instead, it is a health maintenance cost for a taxpayer as a human being. In this case the builder cannot claim an income tax deduction for the medical costs that weren’t recoverable through ACC, because they are private or domes- tic expenditure. Rental property expenses - relocating a rental building Section BB 8 (section 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976) - Certain deductions not permitted: A taxpayer is in the business of renting houses. She plans to relocate one of her houses and build a second dwelling on the site. She has asked if the following costs are deductible: • relocating the old house • repairs to the old house arising from damage caused by the shift • upgrading the old house at the time of the relocation Section BB 7 allows a deduction for any expenditure or loss which is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or in carrying on a business for that purpose. However, under section BB 8 capital expenditure is not deductible. (See previous question for relevant text from section BB 7.) Inland Revenue’s view is that the relocation costs of the house are a capital cost, so they are not deductible. The cost is not a repair, or an alteration, or mainte- nance to a building in the normal sense. Any minor repairs to the house as a result of damage from the shift will be deductible, as will any routine maintenance carried out at the same time. The upgrading done at the same time as the shift must be capitalised and depreci- ated. The taxpayer may need to make an apportionment between non-deductible capital expenditure (moving and upgrading the building), and deductible rev- enue expenditure, (repairs and maintenance). Architects and builders are usually able to show such apportionments in their charges. For more information on repairs and maintenance and capital/revenue expendi- ture, see TIB Volume Five, No. 9 (February 1994). Industrial research promoter - income tax exemption Section CB 4 (1)(b) (section 61(24), Income Tax Act 1976) - Categories of exempt income: A company plans to apply to the Royal Society of New Zealand for approval as an industrial research promoter. Before submitting its application, a representative of the company has asked Inland Revenue to confirm that a company can be eligible for the income tax exemption in section CB 4 (1)(b). from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Section CB 4 (1)(b) exempts from tax: Income derived by any society or association, whether incorporated or not, which is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, established substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting or encouraging scientific or industrial research, and which is approved by the Royal Society of New Zealand, if no part of the income or other funds of the society or association is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder of the society or association. The Royal Society and Inland Revenue have agreed on the following eligibility criteria for exemption under section CB 4 (1)(b): • The applicant must be an organisation (not an individual), but it does not have to be incorporated. • The organisation must be established substantially or primarily to promote or encourage scientific or industrial research. • The Royal Society must be satisfied that such research falls within the Society’s definition of that term. • The organisation must have one of: a constitution, charter, trust deed, rules, or Memorandum and Articles of Association, and this must include clauses to the effect that: - No part of the organisation’s income or other funds may be used or be avail- able to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder; and - If the organisation is wound up, any surplus funds are to be transferred to any tax exempt organisation having similar aims and objects. The word “company” implies an association of a number of individuals formed for some common purpose. A company will not fail to qualify for the exemption simply because it is a company. We advised the company representative that the company’s application will be considered against the above criteria, firstly by the Royal Society of New Zea- land and secondly by the Commissioner. However, as administrator of the Income Tax Act 1994, the Commissioner must ultimately determine any particu- lar applicant’s eligibility for tax exemption. If Inland Revenue grants approval, it will apply from the start of the income year in which the application was made or from such other date as the Commis- sioner may determine. Overseas dividends - income tax liability Section CF 1 (section 65(2)(j), Income Tax Act 1976) - Dividends included in assessable income: A taxpayer received a dividend from an overseas company whose advice notice stated that the dividend had been paid from the share premium account. No tax had been deducted by the overseas company. The taxpayer has asked if the dividend is taxable in New Zealand, and if she should include it in her tax return. Dividends are assessable income for taxation purposes under section CF 1, whether paid from an overseas source or paid by a New Zealand company. However, certain dividends are excluded from the term “dividends”; these are detailed in section CF 3 (section 4A, Income Tax Act 1976). Although this overseas dividend was paid from the company’s share premium account, it does not fit within the exclusions. Therefore the dividend is still a taxable dividend and must be included as assessable income. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Write-off of assets costing $200 or less Section EG 16 (section 108O, Income Tax Act 1976) - Low value asset write-off: A taxpayer heard that the depreciation rules allow the cost of assets purchased for $200 or less to be deducted from assessable income in the year of purchase. She wonders if this is conditional in any way. From the 1993-94 income year onwards, the cost of low value property may be claimed as a deduction in the year in which it was acquired or created for in- come-producing purposes and was primarily and principally used, or available for use, for those purposes. A taxpayer can claim the deduction, provided all the following criteria are met: • The property would be “depreciable property” as defined in section OB 1 (section 107A, Income Tax Act 1976) but for the election to treat it as low value property. • The asset is not created at the same time or purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies (unless the entire purchase costs less than $200). • The asset will not become part of other depreciable property (for example, materials to build a wall in a factory). • The cost of the asset is not specifically deductible under any other provision of the Act. “Low value property” is defined in section OB 1 (section 108O, Income Tax Act 1976) as any property of a taxpayer: (a) Which is acquired or created by the taxpayer for a total cost not exceeding $200 or such higher value as may be specified by the Governor-General by Order in Council... The $200 write-off limit excludes GST for GST registered taxpayers who acquire the property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It includes GST for those taxpayers not registered for GST, or when an input tax deduction cannot be claimed. If an asset which has been written off under the above provisions is subse- quently sold, the sale proceeds are assessable income in the year the asset is sold. Income equalisation scheme deposits and matrimonial property agreements Section EI 1 (section 175, Income Tax Act 1976) - Income equalisation deposits: A farmer made deposits to an income equalisation account under section 175 of the Income Tax Act 1976, and claimed the appropriate deduction from his as- sessable income. Subsequently, he entered into a matrimonial property agree- ment in which half of his assets were transferred to his wife. Since entering into that agreement, the couple have filed partnership returns for their farming business, splitting profits on a 50:50 basis. The farmer has now applied for a refund of his deposits, and has asked if that assessable income is assessed to him individually or to the partners of the partnership on a 50:50 basis. Under section EI 1 (5), amounts entered in any taxpayer’s income equalisation account can in no way be assigned, charged, or passed to any other person by operation of the law. Although the farmer entered into a matrimonial property agreement with his wife, he made the deposit before entering into the agree- ment. He will therefore have to return the income equalisation refund in his own tax return. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Qualifying company shareholder becoming sui juris Section HG 4 (section 393D, Income Tax Act 1976) - Shareholder elections: A shareholder in a qualifying company has a 19-year old son who is also a share- holder of the company. She has asked if her son turning 20 will affect the share- holder election in any way. Section HG 4 (1) states that: A company may only be a qualifying company where each shareholder in that company who is sui juris has by notice in writing to the Commissioner in such a form as the Commissioner may allow- (a) Elected that the company should become a qualifying company; and (b) Elected to be personally liable in respect of each income year during which the election is at any time in effect for such percentage of... “Sui juris” is a legal phrase to describe people who are under no disability affect- ing their legal capacity to deal with their property, bind themselves to contracts, and to sue and be sued. People who do not have full legal capacity (and are therefore not sui juris) include minors and people who are mentally disabled. A minor is a person under the age of 20 years. Section HG 6 (section 393F, Income Tax Act 1976) allows a period of grace for new shareholder elections made under specified circumstances. Section HG 6 (3) states: A company shall not cease to be a qualifying company by reason only of a failure to comply with section OB 3 (1)(f) due to-... (b) An existing shareholder becoming sui juris,- if, within the period of 63 days following the date upon which the shares were acquired or the shareholder became sui juris, or within such extended period as the Commissioner may allow on the application of the new shareholder or the newly sui juris shareholder, or of any other person who may make a shareholder election in respect of the relevant shareholding, a valid shareholder election is made in respect of that shareholding. Once the son turns 20 years of age, and provided he is under no disability, he will be sui juris. Accordingly, he will have to make a shareholder election within the specified timeframe if the company is to remain a qualifying company. Estate cannot pass on losses to beneficiary Section HH 3 (section 227, Income Tax Act 1976) - Income assessable to benefi- ciaries: A beneficiary of an estate that has losses at the time of distribution has asked if, as one of the three beneficiaries, she can offset one-third of the estate’s loss against other income she has derived during the income year. Under section HH 3 a person’s assessable income in any income year includes any beneficiary income and any taxable distribution derived by that person in that income year. “Beneficiary income” is defined in section OB 1 as: ....income derived during that income year by a trustee of the trust which - (a) During that income year vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary; or (b) Is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during, or within 6 months after the end of, that income year; - but does not include income derived by a trustee of the trust in any income year during which the trust is a superannuation fund... When an estate incurs a loss, that loss is considered to have been incurred by the trustee, not by the beneficiaries. The loss is not “beneficiary income” and cannot be passed on to the beneficiaries to be offset against income from other sources during the year in the beneficiaries’ individual assessments. Instead, the estate must carry the loss forward and offset it against trustee income in future years. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) The above will not apply when the trustee carries on the business as a bare trustee. In such cases beneficiaries are treated as partners for income tax pur- poses, and both income and losses are transferable to them. Resident withholding tax deducted in error - refunds Section NF 6 (section 327F, Income Tax Act 1976) - Resident Withholding Tax deductions varied to correct errors: The treasurer of a sports club which is exempt from income tax under section CB 4 (h) (section 61(30), Income Tax Act 1976), invested surplus club funds with the local bank. When the bank paid interest it deducted resident withholding tax (RWT), despite the club holding a certificate of exemption from RWT. The treasurer has asked if there is any way this money can be refunded to the club. An exemption from income tax granted under section CB 4 to a non-profit body or charity includes an exemption from RWT. Organisations are issued with a certificate of exemption that they can present to all the financial institutions they deal with, to ensure that RWT is not deducted from any interest they may earn. Section NF 6 permits a bank to refund RWT deducted in error, when the refund will be made before 31 March in the year in which the deduction was made, and either: • a resident withholding tax deduction certificate including the excess deduction has not been issued; or • a resident withholding tax deduction certificate including the excess deduction has been returned and cancelled. The bank will issue an amended tax deduction certificate, and either offset the amount refunded against future RWT payments to Inland Revenue, or apply to Inland Revenue for a refund of the excess RWT it has refunded to its customer. Alternatively, under section NF 7 (section 327G, Income Tax Act 1976), Inland Revenue can refund any RWT that has been deducted in error and paid to Inland Revenue by the institution that made the deduction. This refund would go directly to the person who derived the income . To obtain the refund, the treasurer (or another duly authorised officer of the club) must complete a Resident Withholding Tax on Interest Refund Request (IR 15F), and have it authorised by the bank (or organisation that deducted the RWT). The completed form should be presented to Inland Revenue, and we will send a refund to the club. If the club has other unpaid tax outstanding, we may instead offset the refund against the overdue amount. NRWT deducted at wrong rate - refunds Section NF 7 (section 327G, Income Tax Act 1976) - Refunds of deductions: A non-resident who has money deposited with a New Zealand bank had resident withholding tax (RWT) of 33% deducted from the interest she received. She has asked if she is liable for RWT, and if not, if the over-deduction can be refunded. Non-residents who have money deposited with New Zealand banks are liable for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) of 15%. The tax is deducted from any interest earned, unless the deposit is subject to the approved issuer levy rules, or there is a relevant double taxation agreement in place that varies the NRWT deduction rate. Non-residents should advise their bank of their residence status so that the correct rate of tax is deducted. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Under section NF 7 (1), when the deduction of RWT exceeds the amount of tax that should have been deducted, and the tax has been paid to Inland Revenue, the excess tax must be refunded. To apply for a refund, the non-resident should complete a Resident Withholding Tax on Interest Refund Request (IR 15F). He or she should then send the com- pleted form and evidence to support the claim (such as a copy of the bank state- ment or deduction certificate) to: Non-Resident Centre Inland Revenue Private Bag 1932 Dunedin NEW ZEALAND Secondhand motor vehicle - cost price for FBT Schedule 2 (Tenth Schedule, Income Tax Act 1976) - Value of fringe benefit provided to employees: A company bought a secondhand car from a car hire company for $35,000. The unlimited private use of the vehicle by the firm’s accountant, an employee, will be a fringe benefit. The car is only one year old and originally cost $45,000. The car hire company’s policy is to dispose of its hire vehicles after one year’s use. The manager of the company that bought the car has asked what the value of the vehicle will be for FBT purposes. His company files quarterly FBT returns. Schedule 2 shows fringe benefit values for motor vehicles used or enjoyed pri- vately, or available for private use or enjoyment. When the motor vehicle is owned by the employer (as in this case) the value of the fringe benefit is 6% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to the employer, per quarter. The motor vehicle cost the purchaser $35,000 (including GST). Under clause 2 of Schedule 2, the “cost price” of a car includes any GST that was paid on the acquisition of the car by the person providing the benefit. The value of the fringe benefit is therefore $2,100 per quarter ($35,000 x 6%). FBT is payable at 49% of the value of the fringe benefit, so the quarterly FBT payable is $1,029 ($2,100 x 49%). Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 Shearing contractor with no certificate of exemption - withholding tax deductions Regulation 12 - Tax deductions from payments made by contractors to employ- ees or subcontractors: A shearing contractor who does not have a certificate of exemption has asked whether a farmer must deduct withholding tax from the contract payment made to him. The shearing contractor will be faced with a shortage of funds if, after withholding tax is deducted, he has to pay PAYE deducted from his shearers’ wages to Inland Revenue. Under regulation 1(3), the withholding payments regulations apply to all with- holding payments. The Schedule attached to the Regulations provides that payments for shearing are to have withholding tax deducted at the rate of 15 cents in the dollar (30 cents at the no-declaration rate). The shearing contractor does not have a certificate of exemption, so the farmer must deduct withholding tax at 15 cents in the dollar. If the shearing contractor has not properly completed an IR 13, the farmer must deduct withholding tax at the no-declaration rate of 30 cents in the dollar. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Regulation 12(b) gives some relief to the shearing contractor by providing that when the farmer has deducted withholding tax, the shearing contractor no longer has to account to Inland Revenue for the PAYE deducted from his shear- ers on a monthly basis. When the shearing contractor files his wages reconciliation, the credit held from the withholding tax is first offset against any PAYE due. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Cruise ship passengers - when purchases can be zero-rated Section 11(1) - Zero-rated goods: A retail company frequently sells goods to customers from visiting cruise ships. The goods usually have a value of less than $1,000, and so there is no require- ment for them to be entered for export. The retail company obtains documenta- tion confirming the customer’s overseas travel. A representative from the com- pany has asked Inland Revenue to confirm that goods delivered direct by her company to the ship’s purser, and signed for by the purser, will qualify for the zero-rating provisions of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. As a general rule, the effects of GST are felt on goods and services consumed or supplied in New Zealand. When goods and services are supplied overseas, GST should not be charged at the full rate, for by doing so the price of the commodity would increase on overseas markets. Section 11(1)(ab) allows goods normally subject to GST at 12.5 percent under section 8 to be zero-rated when: The supplier has satisfied the Commissioner that the goods have been exported by the supplier to a place outside New Zealand. To zero-rate the goods in the above situation, the supplying company must do two things: • It must ensure that the document signed by the purser contains a clause to the effect that the purchaser will not gain access to the goods while they are in New Zealand. When the ship berths at more than one New Zealand port, the goods may only be made available to the purchaser after the vessel has left its final New Zealand port of call. • It must keep records that identify the purchaser’s name and address and the ship’s name and departure date, together with a copy of the document signed by the purser. If the retailer meets these conditions, it will be considered to have satisfied the Commissioner under section 11(1)(ab) and will be able to zero-rate supplies made under the conditions outlined by the representative. We consider that the supplier is complying with the legislation through the purser who is ensuring that the goods will not become available to the purchaser until the vessel has left New Zealand. For more information about zero-rating of goods supplied to people leaving New Zealand, see TIB Volume Six, No.7 (December 1994). GST on excise duty and “in bond” goods Section 13 - Imposition of goods and services tax on goods liable to excise duty and supplied at “in bond” prices: A taxpayer has asked what bonded ware- houses are, and what happens when a supplier sells goods held in them. The taxpayer is considering purchasing goods stored in a bonded warehouse. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Part IVA of the Customs Act 1966 (the Customs Act) imposes excise duty on the manufacturing of tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and fuel. New Zealand Customs grants licences to people to operate “bonded” warehouses when they manufacture or export goods that are subject to excise duty. People who hold such a licence may keep the goods and only pay the excise duty when they remove the goods from the bonded warehouse. People often sell goods they are storing in bonded warehouses. Usually, the vendors include the excise duty in the sale price of the goods. However, some- times the sale price does not include excise duty. When the supplier sells the goods for a price that includes excise duty, section 8 imposes GST on the supply. The total value of the supply is the price charged plus the excise duty imposed on the goods. If the price excludes excise duty, section 8 only imposes GST on the price the buyer pays for the goods because the excise duty is not included in the total consideration paid. In this instance, section 13 will apply to impose GST on the excise duty when the buyer becomes liable for excise duty. Therefore, in answer to the taxpayer’s query: • Bonded warehouses are premises where taxpayers may store goods that are subject to excise duty under the Customs Act. Excise duty is not payable while the goods are in store, but is paid when the goods are removed from the ware- house. • The GST Act imposes GST on the sale of goods that the supplier is storing in a bonded warehouse. When the consideration for the supply of goods includes the excise duty, GST is levied on the price of the goods and the excise duty by section 8. When the price excludes excise duty, New Zealand Customs levies GST on the excise duty when the goods are removed from the bonded ware- house under section 13. Progress payments for motel - private use adjustment Section 21(1) - Adjustment for private use: A GST registered person is having a motel complex built, and running the motel will become her taxable activity. During construction, she makes progress payments to the builder which include GST. As her private accommodation will be part of the complex, she realises that she will be required to make output tax adjustments covering the private use. She has asked if the adjustments should be made from each progress payment, or when the private accommodation is completed. The motel is being acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable sup- plies, so the taxpayer is allowed a full input tax deduction as long as she holds the necessary tax invoices when she files her GST return. Section 21(1) requires the registered person to make an adjustment: ... to the extent that goods and services applied by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are subsequently applied by that registered person for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies ..... Accordingly, the taxpayer can claim input tax deductions on the full amount of the progress payments. She will have to make output tax adjustments once she begins to use the private accommodation. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Discount for early payment of share capital is not interest Rating:• Case:TRA 94/27 and 94/28 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 64B(1), 65(2)(j) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections OB 1, CE 1(1)(a)) Keywords:interest, variable principal debt instrument Summary:A discount credited to shareholders’ “advance” accounts for paying outstanding share capital earlier than required was not assessable as interest income to the shareholders. Further, the “advance” accounts were not variable principal debt instruments.

There was an arrangement between the shareholders and the company whereby the shareholders paid outstanding share capital in advance on a monthly basis over a defined period of about three years. These sums were credited to each shareholder’s “advance account” by the company. The company got into financial difficulties and sought cash by persuading its shareholders to pay for share capital earlier than they otherwise would under the monthly programme. As an inducement, the company offered a “discount”. Under the discount arrangement, the shareholders would pay about 20% less than they otherwise would have done in order to have their shares fully paid up. The discounts were credited to the advance accounts. The company claimed a deduction by way of interest for the discount. The Commissioner argued that the discount was assessable to the shareholders as interest income under section 65(2)(j). As an alternative, the Commissioner argued that the advance account was a variable principal debt instrument and, in accordance with the accruals rules, the “discount” credited was assessable income. Decision:Judge Barber found that the discount was not a payment of interest to the share- holders and, in fact, no payment was made at all. The definition of “interest” shows that interest is a payment made to one person by another in respect of or in relation to money lent. In this case, the facts did not disclose that the share- holders lent money to the company. The shareholders simply paid a lower amount for shares than the amount originally due. Judge Barber noted that, given there was no interest payment by the company, it seemed that the com- pany was not entitled to a deduction for the discounts. In relation to the alternative argument advanced by the Commissioner, Judge Barber found that the advance account was not a variable principal debt instru- ment. The credits to the accounts were not loans to the company but subscrip- tions of share capital. The advance account was not in fact an account or finan- cial arrangement into which there were to be “advances” as required by the definition of “variable principal debt instrument”. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Whether a body corporate is carrying on a taxable activity Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 92/60 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 3(1)(ka), 6(1)(a), 6(3)(a), 6(3)(aa). Keywords:body corporate under the Unit Titles Act 1972, taxable activity, agent Summary:The taxpayer is a body corporate which operates a timeshare resort. The body corporate is a separate legal entity from its proprietors. It supplies services to the proprietors in carrying on the taxable activity of administering the timeshare resort. Facts:The objector is a body corporate constituted under the Unit Titles Act 1972. It operates a timeshare resort which has 28 units which are owned by 850 proprie- tors. Each unit has an individual certificate of title issued for each week pur- chased by an owner. The objector is responsible for managing and maintaining the property. It collects annual levies from the proprietors and uses them to pay all the outgoings on the property. The objector keeps any surplus for future repairs and maintenance on the capital assets in the resort. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Until 31 December 1987 a consultancy company had a contract with the objector to manage the timeshare. During this time the objector registered for GST. When the objector took over the role of managing the resort in December 1987 it sought permission to cease to be registered. The Commissioner advised that the objector’s registration had ceased from 30 September 1987. However, two years later the Commissioner formed the view that the objector was in fact carrying on a taxable activity and that it must be registered. Decision:Judge Barber held that the objector must register for GST. The body corporate is a legal entity which is distinct from the proprietors. It is not merely a nominee or agent of the proprietors. It is also not the same as a group of individuals who share a holiday home as they are not incorporated in any sense. The body corpo- rate has been given a wide range of powers under the Unit Titles Act. These powers indicate that a body corporate is an entity which is distinct from its members in both law and fact. The objector carries on the taxable activity of administering the timeshare resort. It does not matter that the activity is not carried on for pecuniary profit. The activity involves supplying services to each proprietor and the proprietors as a group for consideration in the form of levies. It makes no difference that the payment may be for capital outgoings as GST is a transaction-based tax and the supply must be examined to determine whether or not GST is chargeable. The activity is not excluded from the application of GST as a private recreational pursuit or hobby, nor is it exempt as the provision of a financial service under section 3(1)(ka). (This section is aimed at investments and equity securities). The proprietors do not have an equity security as they do not have an interest in or a right to a share in the capital of the objector. The objector has no corporate capi- tal. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether land purchased for the purpose of erecting a dwellinghouse Rating:••• Case:Unreported TRA 94/34 Act:Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 - sections 24 and 54(2) Keywords:conveyance duty, dwellinghouse, land acquired Summary:On the facts Judge Willy held that the objector did not, at the time he made the certificate to the Commissioner, have a settled intention to build dwellinghouses on the vacant sections. He did not therefore qualify for an exemption from stamp duty. Facts:The case concerned two vacant sections known as Lot 5 and Lot 7. Before taking possession of both lots in December 1990, the objector placed them both on the market in October 1990. In December 1990 the objector purchased both lots and in February 1991 sought a conveyance duty exemption under section 24. The objector certified to the Commissioner that the land had been acquired as resi- dential land which was to have a dwellinghouse erected upon it, building to commence in approximately two years and to be completed within three months. Both lots were placed on the market again in April 1991 with Lot 5 selling in October 1992 and Lot 7 selling in August 1992. Issue:The two issues that arose for consideration were: from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) • Whether the Commissioner is able to reopen an assessment made under sec- tion 24 that no conveyance duty is payable on a transaction and • Whether or not the expressions of fact and intention in the certificate given by the objector must be accepted at face value by the Commissioner as existing at the time the certificate is given, regardless of any subsequent change of mind or intention by the objector. Decision:The objector claimed that when he acquired the properties, he firmly intended to build two unit type developments, in the hope of leasing one and having the use of the other. His long term intention was to resettle in the South Island, where the properties were situated. However, in the meantime the objector had suc- cessfully stood for local office in the North Island and this, together with the requirements of his business, meant that he had abandoned any such intention. Judge Willy considered in detail the chain of events leading to the sale of both lots. In particular he looked at the objector’s explanation as to why he had placed both lots on the market prior to actually purchasing them. The objector explained that he did this in order to ascertain whether the price he was paying for the properties was realistic. Judge Willy found this explanation difficult to believe, when measured against the evidence that the objector subsequently placed both lots on the market again in April 1991. Judge Willy noted that it was up to the objector to prove that it was more prob- able that events occurred as he said, than not. He commented that in judging credibility in such cases it is always important to look carefully at the actions and statements of the witness at the time and in the context of the purposes for which such actions and statements were made. On the facts Judge Willy found that the objector had failed to reach the required standard of proof. His Honour found that at the time the objector made the certificate to the Commissioner, he had no settled intention in relation to the land. Building a dwelling was merely one of a number of options the objector had. On the evidence before him, Judge Willy found that at the time of making the certificate, the objector’s primary intention was to dispose of the land and liquidate debt. Judge Willy found the legislative history of section 24 helpful in interpreting the section. He held that Parliament had intended to widen the concession when it repealed the previous exemption in 1981. This exemption had only applied to conveyances of land on which a dwellinghouse was already erected or which was accompanied by the right to require a dwellinghouse to be erected on the land. Judge Willy noted that what was important was the objector’s purpose at the time of the acquisition of the property and referred to the comments of Justice Blanchard in Baillie v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11405 at 11408. His Honour noted that it was a question of fact in each case and found on the facts of this case that the objector had not discharged the required onus of proof. His Honour then referred to the objector’s further submission that section 54(2) of the Act did not give the Commissioner the right or power to revisit the issue of exemption at a later date, unless the Commissioner can show that the factual information he was provided with for the purpose of the assessment was wrong. If a purchaser had the requisite purpose at the requisite time (i.e., at the time the certificate was provided to the Commissioner), and at a later date realises that he is unable to achieve that purpose, the Commissioner has no grounds to invoke section 54(2). In February 1991 the objector had the requisite purpose, but by April 1991 circumstances had changed and had brought about a change of purpose. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) While not categorically accepting the submission at face value, Judge Willy held that he was not satisfied on the evidence before him that the objector had dem- onstrated to the required standard that the factual information he had given to the Commissioner in the certificate was correct. The Commissioner had a statu- tory obligation to consider all information relevant to the transaction from what- ever source, and to consider his position in light of that information. Judge Willy noted that the information which put the Commissioner on inquiry was the fact that the objector sold the properties within a relatively short time of acquiring them. This raised a doubt about the bona fides of the stated purpose in the certificate. His Honour held that the Commissioner performed no more and no less that his statutory duty in reassessing the transaction for conveyance duty. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. GST input tax credit claimed on the purchase of a farm dwelling Rating:••••• Case:CIR v Coveney, CIR v Dooley, CIR v Swain and Adams CA 23/94 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 2(1), 5(14)and 10(18) Keywords:input tax, apportionment, single supply of secondhand goods Summary:The Court of Appeal rejected the Commissioner’s interpretation of the definition of input tax. Where there is only one supply, not being a taxable supply, of a farm property including a dwelling there is no basis under the Act for appor- tioning the consideration. Where the property is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies an input tax deduction calculated on the whole consideration is available. Facts:This was an appeal from three test cases heard together before the High Court. In each case the GST registered taxpayers had purchased a farm property, in- cluding a dwelling, from unregistered sellers. In each case the agreement pro- vided for sale of the property as a single undivided unit, and for a single sum. The taxpayers claimed an input tax deduction calculated on the whole consid- eration. The Commissioner disallowed the part of the claim that related to the value of the dwelling and curtilage. It did not relate to a good or service acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The taxpayers objected. The High Court found that in each case the purchase of the farm was one sup- ply, and nothing in the Act provides for apportionment of input tax in this situation. The principal purpose of acquiring the whole property was the mak- ing of taxable supplies. Decision:The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision. Although acknowledging that various provisions of the Act do contemplate apportionment, the Court was unconvinced that on the present facts apportionment was sustainable given the definition of input tax. The Court considered that there may be sound policy reasons for apportioning the consideration on the sale of farm property and other secondhand goods. However, it would be inconsistent with the scheme and language of the definition, particularly paragraph (c) and the proviso, to introduce apportionment in these circumstances. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Share sales profits - assessability Rating:••••• Case:CIR v Rangatira Limited (1995) CA 184/94, 17 NZTC 12,182 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(a), 65(2)(e), and 191(4A)(since repealed). (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 4(a), BB 4(c)) Keywords:assessability, dealing in shares, carrying on a business, business profits Summary:The Court of Appeal found that profits on the sale of the shares were business profits. The taxpayer sold the shares as part of its ordinary business or as an ordinary incident of its business. Facts:The taxpayer was an unlisted public company which served as an investment vehicle. The company’s main investments were shareholdings in public and private companies, which provided dividend returns as income to a number of charitable trusts. During the years 1986-1990, the company made substantial gains from the sale of shares. The Commissioner assessed these gains for the 1986 income year under the second limb of section 65(2)(e), and for subsequent years until 1990, under sections 65(2)(a), 65(2)(e) and 191(4A). The Commissioner was precluded by the lapse of time from relying on section 65(2)(a) in the 1986 income year. The High Court had found that the taxpayer was not engaged in business for the purposes of section 65(2)(a), nor did its activities amount to a business of dealing in property for the purposes of section 65(2)(e). However, some individual share sales were assessable under section 65(2)(e). The Commissioner appealed against all findings that the gains were not assess- able. Decision:The Court of Appeal found that the taxpayer company was selling shares as part of its ordinary business, or as part of an ordinary incident of its business. The sales were not just a realisation or change of investment, but part of the carrying on of the business. Factors that the Court took into account included: • The acquisition of some shares for the acknowledged purpose of selling, which indicates that the selling of shares is part of the company’s business; • The company was not a passive investor; • The importance of the share portfolio to the company’s growth; • The large number of share sales Once the Court had reached this conclusion, it was unnecessary to consider the argument based on the three limbs of section 65(2)(e) and section 191(4A). The Court dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal in relation to one transaction in the 1986 income year, and the gain on the share sale in that instance was not assess- able. The Court allowed the deduction of losses on the sale of shares for the years in question. Comment:The taxpayer is appealing this decision to the Privy Council. Real estate agent’s reimbursement - monetary remuneration? Rating:••••• Case:David Albert Norton v CIR, HC 143/93 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(b) (Income Tax Act 1994 - section BB 4) Keywords:reimbursing allowance, monetary remuneration, real estate agent continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Summary:The true nature of the payments made to the taxpayer, a real estate agent, were monetary remuneration and therefore were assessable income under section 65(2)(b). Facts:The Commissioner ruled that from 1 April 1989 real estate agents were to be regarded as employees. This precluded the agents from deducting expenses incurred in producing assessable income. This policy was subsequently upheld by the High Court in a test case on point. On 30 March 1990 the taxpayer entered into a contract with the licensee which had effect from 5 January 1990. This allowed the taxpayer to be reimbursed for expenses incurred on behalf of the licensee. During the year ended 31 March 1990 the taxpayer received a total of $43,370.07 from the licensee. The taxpayer treated $5,912.45 of that amount as a tax-free reimbursing allowance and returned the balance as part of his assessable in- come. The Commissioner issued an amended assessment, adding the $5,912.45 to the declared assessable income. The appellant objected to the amended assessment and a case stated for determination by the Taxation Review Authority resulted. The Authority held that the Commissioner had acted correctly in issuing the amended assessment. The taxpayer appealed. Decision:The High Court held that the effect of the agreement dated 30 March 1990 did not operate to take the amounts in question outside the category of assessable income under section 65(2)(b). The payments in question were “monetary remu- neration” as defined in section 2 (OB 1). Justice Henry said it is important to keep in mind that the labelling used by parties to a contract is not determinative. He accepted that parties cannot alter the true nature of a payment between them by giving a different label to the payment. The true nature of a payment is to be decided by reference to the particular circumstances, including the construction of the parties’ contractual rights and obligations as set out in the formal contract. A further reason for holding that the payments were not genuine reimburse- ment of expenditure on behalf of the licensee was that the expenses were in- curred personally by the taxpayer, not “on behalf of” the licensee. The fact that the expenses were incurred in fulfilling the taxpayer’s contractual obligations did not alter their character or convert them into the employer’s expenses. It was unnecessary for Justice Henry to consider the retrospective provisions of the agreement dated 30 March 1990. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Apportioning GST input tax credits between zero-rated and exempt supplies Rating: • Case:TRA 94/57 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:onus of proof, GST input credits, apportionment. Summary:The case involves the taxpayer contesting the Commissioner’s reassessment that reduces the amount of GST input credits the taxpayer claimed. The TRA upheld the Commissioner’s assessment as the taxpayer had not dis- charged the burden of proof to show that the Commissioner’s assessment was incorrect and by how much it was incorrect. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995) Facts:The taxpayer is a representative member of a group of companies who provided services in management, mercantile and consultancy, and debt collection. The group of companies was based in both Australia and New Zealand. They pro- vided a mixture of exempt financial services and zero-rated services. The Commissioner was of the view that the services the taxpayer provided in New Zealand were exempt supplies and not subject to GST output tax. There- fore, the taxpayer could not claim GST input credits for those supplies. How- ever, the services supplied to the group in Australia were zero-rated and the Commissioner allowed the taxpayer to claim an input credit of 5% for those services. The taxpayer claimed that an accurate figure of the percentage of GST input credits relating to zero-rated services was between 35 - 40%. However, they lowered their claim to 23%. The investigating accountant gave evidence on behalf of the Commissioner as to the basis of the assessment. All the taxpayer’s records of the transactions for the period in question had been destroyed. The shareholders, directors, and execu- tives of the taxpayer were not prepared to come to New Zealand to give evi- dence. Decision:Judge Barber held that the taxpayer had failed to discharge the onus that the Commissioner’s assessment was wrong and by how much it was wrong. He also held that the Commissioner had acted fairly in issuing the reassessments as the investigation had been carried out as thoroughly as possible under the circum- stances of the case. Comment:We do not know if the taxpayer is appealing this decision.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Binding rulings series Introduction This item describes the binding ruling process and explains the role of the Rulings directorate in Inland Revenue’s National Office. In addition, public and product rulings made by the Commissioner will be published in this series. Background to binding rulings For many years the Commissioner has provided taxpay- ers with advice on tax matters. In most cases tax is assessed in line with this advice. However, the Commis- sioner’s statutory duty is to make correct assessments. Accordingly, the Commissioner cannot be required to assess on the basis of earlier advice when at the time of assessment he considers that the earlier advice is not in accordance with the law. In practice, the Commissioner is reluctant to deviate from earlier advice. However, due to the overriding statutory duty to make correct assessments it is possible that the Commissioner may reverse a stated position. This can create uncertainty for taxpayers. In its 1992 budget, the Government announced its intention to introduce a system for issuing binding rulings on tax matters. The underlying policy of this system is to give taxpayers certainty about the Commis- sioner’s view on the tax implications of proposed transactions. After extensive policy development, the Tax Adminis- tration Amendment Act 1995 was enacted. The Act inserts the binding rulings rules into Part V A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) provides a full commentary on the binding rulings legislation. Binding rulings are administered by the Rulings directorate, National Office, Inland Revenue. Rulings directorate The primary function of the Rulings directorate is to provide the Commissioner’s policy on the interpretation and application of the tax laws administered by Inland Revenue. Before 1 April 1995, Rulings provided statements of policy to taxpayers and tax professionals in the form of non-binding rulings published in the TIB. These statements are of general application on areas of tax law where clarification is required. Rulings will continue to provide non-binding statements of policy. However these will be limited to topics that the Commissioner is unable to make a binding ruling on, for example, statements of administrative practice such as this article or matters covered by the Tax Administration Act 1994 such as the imposition of penalties. Rulings is not responsible for specific taxpayer advice other than in the form of formal determinations (depre- ciation, accruals, and livestock valuations) and from 1 April 1995, private binding rulings. In the past, Rulings has occasionally provided some specific tax- payer advice where that advice has given rise to issues of general application. However, with the introduction of the binding rulings regime Rulings will focus on its key functions of providing binding rulings, and general statements of policy (non-binding rulings) where it is not appropriate to make a binding ruling. Taxpayers and tax professionals who require specific taxpayer advice should in the first instance contact their district office, or in the case of corporate clients, the Corporates Unit. Public rulings A public ruling will bind the Commissioner in respect of any taxpayer to whom the ruling applies if the taxpayer calculates his or her tax liability in accordance with the ruling. Public rulings will be initiated by the Commissioner. Taxpayers cannot apply for a public ruling, although they may suggest that the Commissioner issue a public ruling on a particular matter. Rulings welcomes suggestions for public rulings, and these should be addressed to: Manager (Rulings) Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Rulings will acknowledge all suggestions and will indicate whether the topic is suitable for the Commis- sioner to make a public ruling. The letter of acknowl- edgment will also indicate a planned date for publishing the public ruling in this series. Rulings will also invite comment on draft public rulings. Comments can be made using the Public Binding Rulings comment form found at the back of each TIB. Public rulings process 1. Rulings will place an article in each TIB indicating that a draft public ruling is being prepared on a certain topic. The article will invite comment from the public on the ruling, and will indicate the date that the draft is available for the public and the date by which comment must be sent to the Manager (Systems) Rulings. (See page 51 of this TIB for the topics for comment during September). 2. Rulings will issue the draft to those people wishing to make comment. 3. Rulings will consider the comments received and rework the article where appropriate. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Example 3 Under a public ruling, certain non-profit bodies can apply the tax exemption provisions of section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under “The period for which this ruling applies” it is stated: “This ruling applies to income derived by (speci- fied) non-profit bodies for the 1996 and 1997 income years, and includes non-profit bodies with non-standard balance dates corresponding to those income years.” The application period for this ruling relates to specific income years and recognises that taxpayers have early or late balance dates relevant to a particular income year. Example 4 A public ruling states that GST registered persons who purchase (specified) goods from non-registered persons can claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction if the goods are used principally in their taxable activity. Under “The period for which this ruling applies” it is stated: “This ruling applies to purchases of the (specified) goods during the period 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1998.” In this example the application period is determined by the date the secondhand goods are purchased, regardless of the registered person’s taxable period. Registered persons may seek to make the deduction in their June 1998 GST return. Although the taxable period ends outside the application period, the ruling will apply as long as the purchase is made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1998. Private and product rulings Taxpayers can apply for private and product rulings. Private rulings provide an interpretation of the tax law that is specific to the taxpayer and an arrangement. When a taxpayer calculates his or her tax liability in accordance with a private ruling, the Commissioner is bound to assess that taxpayer in accordance with the ruling. Product rulings provide an interpretation of the tax law on a particular product. A product ruling will define the product and specify its tax treatment. It will not state how the tax law applies to the product holder. Private and product rulings process 1. A taxpayer who wishes to apply for a private or product ruling can obtain an application form from any IRD office. The application form for a private ruling is an IR 113. The application form for a product ruling is an IR 114. The completed applica- tion form, application fee of $210, and supporting documents should be sent to the following address: from page 1 4. Once the public ruling is made Rulings will place a notice in the New Zealand Gazette, and also arrange for the ruling to be published in the TIB. 5. The public ruling will describe the arrangement and specify the period for which the ruling applies. Application period Each public ruling will specify a period for which the ruling will apply. In addition, a public ruling will only apply if the arrangement specified in the ruling is entered into during the period that the ruling applies. The applicable period for a public ruling will vary. Several factors could influence the setting of the period, for example: the type of arrangement (whether it is a one-off or ongoing arrangement), the revenue type (e.g. income tax, GST), a changing business environment. It is important to note that a public ruling only applies if the arrangement is entered into during the period. There are two factors to the application period for a public ruling. First, the arrangement specified in the ruling must be entered into during the period the ruling applies, and secondly, the ruling applies only for the period specified. Example 1 A public ruling states that specified expenditure is deductible under section BB 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under “The period for which this ruling applies” it is stated: “This ruling applies to any person who incurs the (specified) expenditure within the period 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1998.” The application period in this example is specific to the date on which the taxpayer incurs the expendi- ture. A taxpayer who deducts the expenditure in an income year outside the application period could still rely on the ruling, as long as the expenditure was incurred within the application period. Example 2 A public ruling states that specified income derived by a non-resident is assessable under section CN 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under “The period for which this ruling applies” it is stated: “This ruling applies to arrangements entered into between 1 April 1995 and 31 March 1998 and to income derived from such arrangements during the period 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1998.” There are two criteria to be met for this public ruling. For the ruling to apply, the arrangement must be entered into during the application period and the income derived from the arrangement must be derived during the application period. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Director (Rulings) Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Taxpayers who are clients of Inland Revenue’s Corporates Unit should deal directly with their account manager who will liaise with Rulings. 2. On receipt of the application form, Rulings will make the following checks to verify the validity of the application and then issue a letter of acknowl- edgement: •Has the IR 113, or IR 114, been fully completed and signed? •Is the application fee attached? •Does the Commissioner have the power to rule (refer to page 2 of the IR 113 or IR 114)? •Has the applicant made full disclosure (refer to page 2 of the IR 113 or IR 114)? •Is a draft ruling attached? •Have all other supporting documents been attached? 3. If the application is deficient, or the Commissioner has no power to rule, Rulings will contact the applicant (or agent) and either request the additional information, or advise that a ruling cannot be made. The application fee is still payable if no ruling is made. 4. Time spent formulating the ruling, in excess of the first two hours, is charged at $105 per hour. In addition, any fees for specific work or services will also be charged if the Commissioner requires external advice to issue a ruling. 5. If the application is valid, Rulings will issue a letter to the applicant (or agent) and advise who is dealing with the application and give an initial estimate of the fee for making the ruling. The Commissioner is required to advise the applicant of any changes to that fee estimate. 6. In most cases, the person dealing with the applica- tion will consult with the applicant during the formulation of the ruling. The legislation requires that the applicant be given the opportunity to consult if the Commissioner’s proposed ruling differs from the draft provided by the applicant. If the matter is straightforward and the Commissioner’s ruling does not differ from the draft provided, there may be no need for consultation. 7. The time taken to formulate each ruling will vary according to the complexity of the issue and the quality of the application. Applications can be processed more quickly if they contain a full disclo- sure and are accompanied by all relevant documents. 8. Once the ruling is completed it is issued to the applicant. 9. The first private ruling issued to a taxpayer for each income year will have a Private Rulings Disclosure Return (IR 115) and Private Ruling Disclosure Attachment (IR 115A) enclosed. Each subsequent ruling for that year to the same taxpayer will be accompanied by an IR 115A only. The IR 115 is an annual return and an IR 115A is required for each ruling that is valid during that year. 10. If there are any hourly or other charges to be made, Rulings arranges for an invoice to be issued to the applicant. Payment is due upon receipt of the invoice. 11. Notification of the issue of product rulings is made in the New Zealand Gazette and the rulings may be published in Inland Revenue’s TIB. Draft ruling to accompany application Generally, the standard of application has been good, but some applicants have omitted the draft ruling. There is no required format for a draft ruling. However, as a minimum, the draft ruling should identify the applicant’s answer to the questions raised in the appli- cation. Some applicants have found it helpful to follow the format used by Rulings when drafting a private ruling. This format is set out below. Applicants are welcome to follow the format, but there is no require- ment to do so. Private ruling This is a private ruling made under section 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Person to whom the ruling applies This ruling applies to \[Name and IRD number of applicant\]. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of \[quote section(s) and statute(s) to which ruling the applies\]. The arrangement The arrangement is \[describe arrangement\]. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumption(s) that \[state key assumptions\]. Ruling \[Clearly state the ruling\] The period for which the ruling applies This ruling applies for the period \[state the period ruling applies\]. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Associated non-profit bodies - $1,000 income tax exemption Public ruling - BR Pub 95/1 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section CB 4 (1)(k) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a non-profit body associated with a national or princi- pal organisation (“associated non-profit body”) seeks the $1,000 income tax exemption under section CB 4 (1)(k). The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to income derived by an associated non-profit body for the 1996, 1997, and 1998 income years, and applies regardless of the taxpayer’s balance date. The ruling The $1,000 income tax exemption in section CB 4 (1)(k) is available to associated non-profit bodies which are separately identifiable taxable entities and which satisfy the other requirements of section CB 4 (1)(k). This ruling is signed by me on the 15th day of August 1995. Jeffrey Tyler Director (Rulings) Analysis of the ruling This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Background Generally, any assessable income derived by a taxpayer is subject to income tax. Non-profit bodies are eligible for a $1,000 income tax exemption under section CB 4 (1)(k). Types of organisations which may be eligible to claim the $1,000 income tax exemption under section CB 4 (1)(k) are: • Trade associations. • Progressive associations. • Political parties. • Social clubs (including those amateur sports bodies that do not qualify for an income tax exemption under section CB 4 (1)(h)). Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CB 4 (1)(h)61(30) CB 4 (1)(k)61(34) Application of legislation Under section CB 4 (1)(k), an income tax exemption of up to $1,000 of income in any income year is available to those non-profit bodies that meet the criteria set out in that section. Section CB 4 (1)(k) states: Income derived by any society, association, or organisation, whether incorporated or not, which is not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to any proprietor, member, or shareholder and which is, by the terms of its constitution, rules, or other document constituting that society, association, or organisation or governing its activities, prohibited from making any distribution, whether by way of money, property, or otherwise, to any such proprietor, member, or shareholder: 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Provided that the amount of the exemption under this para- graph in any income year shall not exceed $1,000 of the aggregate of that income. For an organisation to qualify for the section CB 4 (1)(k) exemption, the organisation must not be carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and its constituting document must prohibit the organisation from making any distribution whether by way of money, property, or otherwise to its members or persons associated with the members. Associated non-profit bodies are also eligible for the $1,000 exemption Section CB 4 (1)(k) may also apply to bodies that are associated with a national or principal non-profit organisation (referred to in the ruling as “associated non-profit bodies”). It is not possible to define exactly what an associated non-profit body is for the purposes of this ruling, but examples are regional or district branches of a national office. The fact that an associated non-profit body shares its constituting document with other “aligned” or “group” organisations does not prevent the section CB 4 (1)(k) exemption from apply- ing to it, provided its constituting documents meet the relevant criteria set out in CB 4 (1)(k) and it is able to demonstrate that it is a separately identifiable taxable entity. Whether an associated non-profit body can be identified as a separately identifiable taxable entity is a question of fact, and each case must be considered on its own facts. The Commissioner considers that an associated non- profit body will be a separately identifiable taxable entity if, for example: • It keeps separate financial statements; and • It keeps separate records of receipts and payments; and • Its activities are not just incidental to the national or principal body’s activities; and • It is situated in a geographical setting that is distinct from the national or principal body. In addition to these characteristics, section CB 4 (1)(k) requires that: • The associated non-profit body is not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to any proprietor, member, or shareholder; and • The constituting documents of the associated non- profit body prohibit the organisation from making any distribution, whether by way of money, property, or otherwise, to any proprietor, member, or shareholder of the organisation. GST - sale of long-term residential properties Public ruling - BR Pub 95/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section 14(d) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a GST registered person sells a residential rental prop- erty in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and the property has been rented out by the registered person for five years or more prior to the sale. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the sale of dwellings where the time of supply occurs between 1 April 1995 and 31 March 1998. The ruling For section 14(d) to apply, the property must have been: • Rented out for five years by the same person who sold it: it is not sufficient that the property has been rented out for five years but by different owners; and continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) • Used exclusively for residential rental purposes during that period. If the property has been used partly for rental purposes and partly for other pur- poses (e.g. property development purposes) it has not been used exclusively for residential rental purposes and section 14(d) does not apply. All the other requirements of section 14(d) must be satisfied before the exemp- tion will apply. This ruling is signed by me on the 15th day of August 1995. Jeffrey Tyler Director (Rulings) Analysis of the ruling This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background Generally, the sale of residential rental property is not subject to GST. As the provision of rental accommoda- tion is exempt from GST, the sale of the property is not in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. However, sometimes a residential rental property may be sold by a registered person in the course or further- ance of a taxable activity (such as the taxable activity of selling houses) and the sale is then subject to GST. When a registered person (“the vendor”) sells property in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the vendor must account for output tax on the sale. How- ever, if the vendor has rented out the property as residential accommodation for five years or more before the date of the supply, section 14(d) exempts the sale from GST. Sometimes a property is rented out for residential accommodation for five years before the sale, but the owner of the property changes during that time. A property owner may have also used the property for another purpose as well as for residential accommoda- tion during the five years. Legislation Section 14(d) states: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: ... (d) The supply, being a sale, by any registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity of- (i) Any dwelling; or (ii)The reversionary interest in the fee simple estate of any leasehold land,- that has been used by the registered person for a period of 5 years or more before the date of the supply exclusively for the making of any supply or supplies referred to in paragraph (c) or (ca) of this section: Section 14(c) exempts: (c) The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of- (i)Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy. Section 14(ca) exempts: (ca) The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommo- dation in a dwelling erected on that land. Section 14(d) was introduced for the purposes of the Housing Corporation. Because the Housing Corporation sold a high number of houses it was carrying on the taxable activity of selling houses. The reference to paragraph (ca) in section 14(d) took effect on 1 August 1990. Application of legislation In order to apply section 14(d), the vendor must satisfy all the following criteria: • The supply must be by way of sale. • The supply must be by a registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity. The sale of a house used for residential rental purposes will usually be an exempt supply. However, a registered person may sell a property in the course of a taxable activity of selling residential properties. A person will usually have a taxable activity of selling residential properties if that person sells properties continuously or regularly. (See Case S36 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,237.) • The property must have been used for residential, not commercial, rental purposes. • The property must have been used exclusively for rental purposes. If the property has been used partly for rental purposes and partly for other purposes, section 14(d) does not apply. For example, a property developer who rents out property for residential purposes while trying to sell the property does not meet this test. A property developer can only take from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) advantage of the exemption in section 14(d) if the property has been used exclusively for rental pur- poses. When the property has been used for two purposes, one a taxable supply (property development) and one an exempt supply (rental accommodation), the property has not been used exclusively for the exempt purpose, so section 14(d) cannot apply. • The vendor must have rented out the property for at least five years. It is not sufficient that the property has been rented out for a minimum of five years by different owners. Example This example does not form part of the ruling. X sold a house in May 1992 to Y Ltd, a property developer. X rented out the house for 15 years prior to the sale. This sale is exempt from GST as it was not a sale in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Y Ltd claimed a “secondhand goods” input tax deduction as the property was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Y Ltd continued to rent out the property while developing it. In February 1995 Y Ltd sold the house in the course of its taxable activity of property develop- ment. Section 14(d) does not apply to this sale for two reasons: • Y Ltd was trying to sell the property as part of the property development during the time that it was rented, therefore, it was not used exclusively for rental purposes. • Y Ltd did not rent out the house for five years. Y Ltd must account for output tax on the sale of the house. Agreed Value Plan issued by FAI Metropolitan Life Assurance Company NZ Limited Product ruling - BR Prd 95/1 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section BB 7 and section CB 5 (1)(h) of the In- come Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to a life insurance product known as an Agreed Value Plan issued by FAI Metropolitan Life Assurance Company NZ Limited (“FAI”) and set out in the policy of insurance known as the Reassure Plan Document. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumption that the Life Insured is the same person as the Plan Owner. Defined terms in this ruling have the same meaning as set out in the Reassure Plan Document. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies from 10 July 1995 to 31 March 1998. The ruling A. Agreed Value Plan Based on the assumptions stated above, under an Agreed Value Plan where the Life Insured has not contracted for any of the optional benefits: continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) • Any benefits received by the Life Insured under the Agreed Value Plan by way of the Occupational Retraining Benefit, Rehabilitation Benefit, Spouse Accommodation Benefit, and Funeral Benefit will be exempt from income tax pursuant to section CB 5 (1)(h): • All other benefits received by the Life Insured by way of a benefit under the Agreed Value Plan will be assessable for income tax in the hands of the Life Insured: • All premiums paid by the Life Insured under the Agreed Value Plan will be deductible from the income of the Life Insured. B. Agreed Value Plan with optional benefits Based on the assumptions stated above, under an Agreed Value Plan where the Life Insured has contracted for the Hospital Care Benefit, Home Care Benefit, and Living Insurance Benefit: • Any benefits received by the Life Insured under the Agreed Value Plan by way of the Hospital Care Benefit, Home Care Benefit, and Living Insurance Benefit will be exempt from income tax pursuant to section CB 5 (1)(h): • The portion of premiums paid by the Life Insured under the Agreed Value Plan for the Hospital Care Benefit, Home Care Benefit, and Living Insurance Benefit will not be deductible from the income of the Life Insured. • Any benefits received by the Life Insured under the Agreed Value Plan by way of the Occupational Retraining Benefit, Rehabilitation Benefit, Spouse Accommodation Benefit, and Funeral Benefit will be exempt from income tax pursuant to section CB 5 (1)(h): • 1.5% of premiums paid by the Life Insured for the Agreed Value Plan (ex- cluding premiums paid for the optional benefits) will not be deductible from the income of the Life Insured: • All other benefits received by the Life Insured by way of a benefit under the Agreed Value Plan will be assessable for income tax in the hands of the Life Insured: • The portion of premiums paid by the Life Insured under the Agreed Value Plan for all other benefits will be deductible from the income of the Life In- sured. Analysis of the ruling This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background A ruling has been sought on whether FAI’s Agreed Value Plan is a personal sickness or accident (“PSA”) insurance policy or a loss of earnings (“LOE”) insur- ance policy in terms of the Commissioner’s policy statement Personal sickness or accident insurance policies and loss of earnings insurance policies (indi- vidual policies only) which appeared in TIB Volume Six, No. 4 (October 1994), and in particular: • Whether the benefits under the Agreed Value Plan are assessable in the hands of the insured: • Whether the premiums paid by the insured for the Agreed Value Plan are deductible. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 7104 CB 5 (1)(h)61(40) Section CB 5 (1)(h) exempts from tax: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by that person from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: Disablement Benefit The Disablement Benefit is calculated with reference to the Life Insured’s average monthly earnings immedi- ately preceding Disablement Date. The Disablement Benefit contains a maximum cap on the benefit that can be paid, the maximum cap being the amount of the Monthly Benefit specified in the Current Schedule. It is clear from the Tax Information Bulletin that it is no longer the Commissioner’s policy that an insurance policy that contains a cap is automatically a PSA policy and not an LOE policy. The Commissioner has recog- nised that there are commercial reasons for limiting the insurer’s liability under loss of earnings policies. The Disablement Benefit is an LOE benefit. Agreed Value Plan The Agreed Value Plan contains a number of other benefits. These standard benefits (where no additional optional benefits are contracted for) are the: • Occupational Retraining Benefit: • Rehabilitation Benefit: • Spouse Accommodation Benefit: • Funeral Benefit. These benefits are periodic payments of an amount specified under the Plan, and are payable during the period of incapacity. The amounts are not calculated with reference to loss of earnings or profit, and under the Commissioner’s policy are exempt. FAI’s Agreed Value Plan is a mixed benefit policy because it contains both PSA and LOE benefits. The Commissioner accepts that under some mixed policies only a negligible amount of each premium relates to a flat sum benefit, and that the rest of the premium relates to benefits calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. If the amount of premium attributable to the flat sum benefits is two percent or less, the whole of each premium can be deducted. Applying the Commissioner’s policy to the Agreed Value Plan, the amount of premium that is attributable to the standard flat sum benefits is 1.5%. As this is less than 2%, the whole of the premium is deductible. Even though the whole of the premium in relation to the Agreed Value Plan is deductible, the PSA benefits are still exempt under section CB 5 (1)(h). These flat sum benefits continue to be exempt, despite the premiums relating to these benefits being deductible. Agreed Value Plan with optional benefits The Agreed Value Plan also provides for a number of optional benefits. A ruling is sought on the income tax situation where a Life Insured contracts for the follow- ing benefits: • Hospital Care Benefit: • Home Care Benefit: • Living Insurance Benefit. The Commissioner’s policy is that none of these benefits are calculated according to loss of earnings. An Agreed Value Plan that includes the optional benefits is a mixed benefit policy because it contains both PSA and LOE benefits. Where the Life Insured takes out the Hospital Care Benefit, the Home Care Benefit, and the Living Insur- ance Benefit the optional benefits account for 6.7% of the premium. The Life Insured will also receive the Occupational Retraining Benefit, Rehabilitation Benefit, Spouse Accommodation Benefit, and the Funeral Benefit. These benefits account for 1.5 % of the pre- mium. In this case the portion of any premium relating to flat sum benefits is over 2% (1.5% + 6.7% = 8.2%), therefore, the premiums must be apportioned on the basis of benefits payable. The amount of any premium relating to exempt benefits is non-deductible, and any benefits received are non-assessable to the Life Insured. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. GST and subdivisions - Court of Appeal decision in the Newman case Summary The Court of Appeal recently gave its judgment in Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097. This case dealt with the issue of whether a one-off subdivision consti- tutes a “taxable activity” for GST purposes. The Court of Appeal held that the one-off subdivision and sale carried out by the appellant did not constitute a taxable activity. This statement outlines the Commissioner’s interpreta- tion of the meaning of “taxable activity” in the context of subdivisions in the light of the Court of Appeal decision in Newman v CIR. The Commissioner’s policy is that: • Whether or not an activity is a taxable activity depends on the facts of each case. • A subdivision of land into two allotments, involving no development work, will not by itself amount to a taxable activity. • In other circumstances, whether or not the activity is “continuous” and amounts to a taxable activity depends on all the facts of the particular activity. The Commissioner considers that the following factors are relevant in determining the existence of a “taxable activity”: the scale of the subdivision, the level of development work, the time and effort involved, the amount of financial investment, and the commercial- ity of the transaction. (The examples at the end of this item illustrate how the Commissioner considers these factors apply in different situations.) • The one-off sale of other private assets will not in isolation constitute a taxable activity. However, the activity of constructing and selling a single commer- cial building does amount to a taxable activity. This item replaces the policy under Taxable Activity - Continuous or Regular on page 32 of PIB 164 (August 1987). All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background The subdivision of land typically consists of a number of steps undertaken over a period of months. This will usually involve arranging survey plans, engineering reports, and access to water, power and telephone lines, as well as obtaining the services of lawyers and real estate agents. Many of these steps are compulsory local authority requirements. The TRA has discussed the GST treatment of the activity of subdividing land in several cases since the introduction of GST. The general approach adopted by the TRA has been to treat almost all subdivisions as taxable activities because of the continuous nature of the background steps involved in carrying out a subdivision. The Court of Appeal in the Newman decision has now resolved the correct GST treatment of a subdivision that creates two allotments with no development work followed by the sale of one allotment. The Court of Appeal concluded that small-scale, private subdivisions of the kind carried out by the taxpayer in this case are not taxable activities. This type of activity will not generate any GST obligations for the subdivider. The correct GST treatment of other types of subdivision and development activities will depend on the facts sur- rounding each activity. Legislation Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply (other than an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Section 6(1)(a) defines “taxable activity” to mean: Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) The main features of a taxable activity are: • There is an “activity”; and • The activity is carried on “continuously” or “regu- larly”; and • The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. Court of Appeal decision Facts The taxpayer was a builder who purchased a block of land in Queenstown on which he intended to build a family home for himself. During the construction of the house he subdivided the property to fund the completion of the house. The taxpayer did not carry out the subdivi- sion in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity as a builder. The Commissioner assessed output tax on the sale of the subdivided property. The taxpayer objected to the assessment. The TRA agreed with the assessment and held that an isolated subdivision transaction could constitute a “taxable activity”. On appeal to the High Court, the Court upheld the TRA decision. The High Court concluded that the subdivision process involved a series of sequential steps carried out with a common purpose without interruption. The Court said that these steps constituted an activity carried out “continuously” and therefore fell within the definition of “taxable activity”. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Appeal. Decision The Court of Appeal held that the subdivision activity of the taxpayer did not constitute a taxable activity. In reaching this decision, the Court examined the activity as a whole. It made the general comment that the determination of whether or not a particular subdivision activity is a taxable activity will depend on the facts of each case. In relation to the taxpayer, the Court of Appeal noted that the activity was a straightforward subdivision that did not involve development work on the property. The activity involved neither repetition over time nor repeated acts. The Court of Appeal did not consider that it was necessary to break down an activity into a series of sequential steps to determine whether the activity was carried on “continuously”. On this basis, the Court considered that the activity of shopping or selling a car could arguably be broken down into a series of steps and described as carried on “continuously”. However, Justice Gault agreed with the High Court that the construction and sale of a commercial building can be a continuous activity. The Court also agreed with the High Court judgment in Tout v Cook (1991) 13 NZTC 8,053 that the “one-off” development involved in that case was not a continuous or regular activity. In Tout v Cook the taxpayer pur- chased a residential property intending to cross-lease the property into two or three allotments, build a new home for herself, and sell the original house. The High Court held that this level of activity was neither “con- tinuous” nor “regular”. Policy “Continuously” The Court of Appeal in Newman v CIR sets out general principles for interpreting the terms “continuously” and “taxable activity” in the context of subdivisions. Apply- ing this decision, the Commissioner considers that: • Whether or not a taxable activity exists depends on the particular facts of each case. • A subdivision of land into two allotments, involving no development work, will not by itself amount to a taxable activity. • In other circumstances, whether or not the activity is “continuous” and amounts to a taxable activity will depend on all the facts of the particular activity. The Commissioner considers that the following factors are relevant in determining the existence of a “taxable activity”: -the scale of the subdivision -the level of development work -the number of sales of subdivided land -the time and effort involved -the level of financial investment -the commerciality of the transaction Therefore, the greater the number of allotments created and sold, the more extensive the development work, the more time and effort involved and the higher the financial commitment to the project, the more likely that there is a taxable activity. Note that the above list of factors is not exhaustive. No particu- lar factor determines the existence of a taxable activity. The activity as a whole must be examined to see whether or not there is a taxable activity. The examples at the end of this item illustrate how the Commissioner considers these factors apply in different situations. • The one-off sale of other private assets (e.g. a car) will not in isolation constitute a taxable activity. This is the result even if the process of sale involves a number of steps. • The process of constructing and selling a commercial building is a continuous activity which falls within the definition of “taxable activity”. This is because the transaction involves substantial development work, financial investment, and time and effort. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) does not involve substantial development work, financial investment, or time and effort; and • They do not subdivide land on a regular basis. Example 2 Mr and Mrs Burton have owned and lived in their home on a three hectare property for 10 years. Their family business begins to run into financial difficul- ties and they decide to subdivide their land into four, selling three bare allotments to raise some money for the business. They continue to live in their home. The Burtons arrange for a surveyor to prepare a plan, obtain the necessary approvals from their local authority, and instruct a lawyer and a real estate agent to carry out the sale of the subdivided sec- tions. Are the Burtons carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment The Burtons’ subdivision activity is not a taxable activity. The activity as a whole is not carried on “continuously”. The subdivision is a straightforward subdivision involving minimal time and effort by the Burtons. However, this result might change if other factors were involved in the subdivision. For example, there may be a taxable activity if the Burtons had undertaken substantial earthworks, constructed roads, and made a large financial investment in developing the property before sale. Example 3 Mr Wilson is not registered for GST. He lives on a two hectare block on a main highway. He subdi- vides the section into two, and builds a building suitable as a “Devonshire tea/craft” shop. Mr Wilson sells the subdivided land and building. In the course of the subdivision, Mr Wilson ar- ranges for a surveyor to prepare a plan, obtains the necessary approvals from the local authority, and instructs a lawyer and a real estate agent to carry out the ultimate sale. He also organises (using contractors) the construction of the shop, arranges access to electrical, telephone, and water supplies and constructs a fence around the subdivided property. Is Mr Wilson carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment Mr Wilson’s activity of subdivision and construc- tion and sale of a commercial building is a taxable activity. The subdivision (and related actions) alone would not have amounted to a taxable activity. However, the whole activity is “continuous” in nature because Mr Wilson invested a significant amount of time, effort, and money to both subdivide and develop the land, and build a commercial building on the subdivided allotment. “Regularly” If an activity is carried on either “continuously” or “regularly”, that activity will satisfy the definition of “taxable activity” (provided the activity satisfies the other requirements of the section 6 definition of “tax- able activity”). Therefore, if a person carries out the process of subdivision on a regular or repeated basis, a taxable activity will exist. This is the result even if each individual subdivision is not a taxable activity in its own right. Sale of home following subdivision Under the principles set out above, it is possible that a person who subdivides land on which a residence is located may be carrying on a taxable activity. In this situation, the Commissioner considers that only the newly-subdivided allotments form part of that person’s taxable activity. The allotment containing the original home is separate from the taxable activity of subdivision and sale. Therefore, if the person later sells the residen- tial home (and curtilage), that sale is not made in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity of subdivi- sion. GST will not apply, provided that the residential home (and curtilage) do not form part of the assets of another taxable activity carried out by that person. Examples The following examples show how the Commissioner considers that the factors discussed under “Policy” apply to determine whether or not there is a taxable activity. These examples are illustrative only and do not cover the wide number of factual situations that may arise. Each case must be considered on its own facts. In each of these examples it is assumed that the sales of subdivided land made exceed $30,000. Example 1 Mr and Mrs Taylor are not registered for GST. They have owned their home (situated on a quarter hectare section) for 20 years. They subdivide this section, sell the rear section, and put the proceeds toward retirement savings. In the course of the subdivision, they arrange for a surveyor to prepare a plan, obtain the necessary approvals from their local authority, and instruct a lawyer and a real estate agent to carry out the sale of the subdivided section. The Taylors also arrange for the construction of sealed road access to the rear section to satisfy the local authority requirements. The Taylors continue to live in their home on the front section. Are the Taylors carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment The Taylors’ subdivision activity is not a taxable activity for these reasons: • They have not carried out the activity “continu- ously” under the principles in the Newman Court of Appeal case. The subdivision is a straightfor- ward subdivision into two allotments. The activity from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Example 4 Caitlin is not registered for GST. She inherits an undeveloped 20 hectare rural property with a rundown cottage on it. She subdivides the section into 6 lifestyle blocks and sells these sections over a 12-month period, retaining only a small piece of land containing the cottage with a small garden for herself. In the course of the subdivision, Caitlin arranges for a surveyor to prepare a plan, obtains the necessary approvals from the local authority, and instructs a lawyer and a real estate agent to carry out the sale of the subdivided sections. She also obtains rural planning consent, undertakes extensive contouring and landscaping, constructs roads between the sections, and arranges for electrical, telephone, sewerage, and water supplies. Caitlin refurbishes the cottage and lives there for two years before selling. Is she carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment Caitlin’s subdivision and development enterprise is a taxable activity. The activity is “continuous” as it involves extensive development work on the land, substantial time, effort, and financial investment, and six repeated sales of subdivided property. Caitlin must register for GST and account for GST on the sale of the six properties. Caitlin does not need to account for GST on the sale of the cottage. She did not sell the cottage in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity of subdivision and development. The cottage was her personal residence and it did not form part of a taxable activity. Example 5 Chris is registered for GST. He researches the property market and discovers that there are opportunities to make profits from subdividing beachfront properties. He then purchases an allot- ment of bare beachfront land which he intends to subdivide. Two months later he subdivides the section into two and sells both lots. Soon after he purchases a similar property, subdivides the prop- erty into two, and sells both lots. Chris repeats the same exercise one year later. Is Chris carrying on a taxable activity? GST treatment Chris is carrying on the taxable activity of subdivi- sion from the time of purchase of the first property. Although each individual subdivision may not amount to a separate “continuous” activity, Chris’ overall activity of subdividing is “regular” in nature because he repeats the process over time. Overseas travel expense claims Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the treatment of deductions for travel expenses of taxpayers who travel overseas. When travel relates to a group tour or conference, tour organisers may apply to their local Inland Revenue office for prior approval of tour and conference deduc- tions. (See page 6 of TIB Volume Three, No.1 - July 1991.) Regardless of prior approval of group or conference expenses, the Commissioner may review individual claims for overseas travel expenses after taxpayers file their annual income tax returns. Individual taxpayers may be entitled to a different proportion of the expendi- ture than has been approved previously for a group, because the Commissioner treats each claim on its own merits according to income tax law. Only those ex- penses that are necessarily incurred in connection with the income earning process are allowable as a deduc- tion. Employees who travel overseas for their employers are prohibited from claiming deductions for expenses incurred in producing income from employment. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background This item discusses: • the information that a taxpayer should supply when asked by Inland Revenue to support a claim for overseas travel expenses • the apportionment of private expenses • claims for a companion’s or a family member’s overseas travel expenses. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 7104 BB 8106(1) DE 1105(2) Section BB 7 states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it - (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year - continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) spends a week on holiday after finishing his or her business will not be able to claim any costs relating to accommodation and meals while on holiday. The Commissioner will take a reasonable approach and consider each case according to the individual circum- stances. In relation to airfares, when the holiday element is minor and incidental to the business purpose of the trip, the Commissioner may allow the full claim for the cost of the airfare. If there are clearly two advantages sought, an apportionment will be required for the cost of the airfare. An apportionment based on the number of days on business, over the combined number of business and private days, has been accepted as a reasonable method, although the method depends on the circumstances of the case: see TRA Case G5 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,011. The following examples demonstrate the tax treatment of different situations. Example 1 Gertrude owns a transport business. In December last year she went to Europe to visit her parents on their 50th wedding anniversary and to negotiate contracts for her business. She was overseas for 42 days, and spent 11 days on business. Gertrude would have gone to visit her parents regardless of whether she went over for business. However, Gertrude needed to go overseas at some stage during the year for business. Before she left, Gertrude contacted her business contacts overseas and arranged to meet them. Gertrude travelled overseas for two different purposes. In her income tax return, Gertrude claimed a deduction of 11/42 of the cost of the airfare, and the cost of accommodation and meals she spent for the 11 days while on business. The Commissioner would accept the deduction because in the circumstances it is an acceptable method of apportioning the expenditure. It is clear that Gertrude travelled overseas for two reasons. Example 2 Fred owns a tin can store. He was running short of stock so he went to Australia to buy some rubbish cans. While he was overseas, Fred took the opportu- nity to spend a couple of days with his old friend Bert. Fred spent a total of three days in Australia, two days on holiday and one day on business. In Fred’s tax return he claimed as a deduction the total cost of the airfare, and the cost of the accommodation and meals for the day he spent on business. In Fred’s situation the Commissioner would allow the entire deduction. The holiday aspect of the trip is incidental to the main purpose of travelling overseas for business. Fred only visited Bert because he was there for business and took the opportunity to see him. may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section BB 8 states: Notwithstanding anything in section BB 7, in calculating the assessable income derived by any person from any source, no deduction shall, except as expressly provided in this Act, be made in respect of any of the following sums or matters: Section BB 8 (b) states: Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature: Section DE 1 (1) states: Notwithstanding anything in section BB 7, in calculating the assessable income derived by any taxpayer, no deduction shall be made in respect of any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing income from employment. Policy When travel relates to a group tour or conference, tour organisers may apply to their local Inland Revenue office for prior approval of tour and conference deduc- tions (see page 6 of TIB Volume Three, No.1 - July 1991). Applications should be sent to the district office nearest the principal tour organiser’s base. However, regardless of any prior approval for group or conference expenses, any individual taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction greater or less than that previ- ously approved for groups, depending on the circum- stances of the case. The Commissioner may review individual claims for overseas travel expenses after taxpayers file their annual income tax returns. The Commissioner treats each claim on its own merits according to income tax law. Only those expenses that are necessarily incurred in connection with the income earning process under section BB 7 are allowable as a deduction. Under section DE 1 (1), taxpayers who are employees can not claim a deduction for expenses incurred while travelling overseas for their employers. Information to support individual claims Taxpayers will often combine business and holiday elements into the trip. The costs can be relatively high, and it is important to establish any private content. Inland Revenue may ask taxpayers to supply informa- tion to support a claim for overseas travel expenses. Information we may ask a taxpayer to supply includes: the itinerary, business contacts visited, business con- ducted, diversions from the business itinerary for private purposes, items of expenditure, and the total cost of the trip. Apportionment Section BB 8 (b) prohibits a deduction for any expendi- ture of a private or domestic nature. If an overseas trip contains a private element, an apportionment of some of the costs will be necessary. For example, a taxpayer who from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Example 3 Oscar had planned a holiday to America. While he was overseas, he took the opportunity to promote his tourism business at some shopping malls. In his income tax return, Oscar claimed as a deduction half the cost of the airfare and the accommodation and meal costs he spent while promoting the business. In Oscar’s situation the Commissioner would disallow the deduction for half the cost of the airfare because the holiday is the reason for travel- ling overseas. Oscar only decided to promote his business while overseas, so when he purchased the airline ticket his only purpose was to go holiday. However, the Commissioner would allow the deduction for the accommodation and meal cost while Oscar was on business. Taxpayer accompanied by family member In some situations a taxpayer may also claim travel expenses for a companion, spouse, or other family member. Examples of factors which might support such a claim are: • The companion, spouse, or family member is em- ployed full-time in the business and is actively engaged on business activities while overseas. • The taxpayer travelling on business must be accompa- nied because of ill health. In this case, the expenses of the accompanying person (even if another family member) may also be allowed. The Commissioner may request a medical certificate if necessary. • An associated overseas organisation expects that a taxpayer should be accompanied by a spouse. • The taxpayer attends a conference and the companion or spouse contributes in some integral way to the conference. Pensions payable to former employees Summary This item sets out the conditions under which a deduc- tion can be made for pensions paid to former employees or their spouses under sections DF 4 and FF 17. To briefly summarise: • A deduction from business income is only available if the specific tests of section DF 4 are met. • Section DF 4 requires that the pension arrangements be recorded by deed. • For close companies, the deductions are limited to payments made to bona fide employees. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 7104 DF 1 (b)106(1)(ma) DF 4151(1) and (2) FF 17151(1) proviso OB 1 definition of “Close company”2 Section DF 4 states: (1) Subject to this section, the Commissioner may, in calculat- ing the assessable income derived in any income year by any taxpayer from any business, allow a deduction in respect of any amount (being an amount which is not deductible otherwise than under this section and which is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, reasonable in the particular circum- stances of the case) paid by the taxpayer in that income year by way of a pension to any former employee of the taxpayer in that business, or to the surviving spouse of any such em- ployee, in consideration of the past services of that employee in that business of the taxpayer, where subject to section FF 17 the Commissioner is satisfied that - (a) The pension is receivable by the recipient as of right under a deed for a fixed period or for life, or, in the case of a pension receivable by a surviving spouse, for a fixed period or for life or until the surviving spouse remarries; and (b) Either - (i) The employee retired from that employment; or (ii)The employee ceased to be employed by the taxpayer by reason of redundancy or other similar circum- stances. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) or any other provision of this Act, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any amount paid by way of a pension (being a payment which but for this subsection would have been allowable as a deduction under this section) where the taxpayer is a close company and the former employee or a relative of that employee is or was a shareholder in the company: Provided that where the Commissioner is satisfied that the employee was employed as a bona fide employee of the company, the Commissioner may allow a deduction in accordance with subsection (1) of so much of the amount paid by way of a pension as the Commissioner determines would have been granted by the company in similar circumstances if that employee or a relative of that employee were not, or had not been, a shareholder in that company. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) From 1 July 1994, section 151(2) (now section DF 4 (2)) prohibits any deduction from being made when the taxpayer is a “close company” and the former employee or a relative of that employee is or was a shareholder in that company. However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the employee was a bona fide employee, a deduc- tion can be considered. Proprietary company A proprietary company was a company which in relation to any income year, at the end of that year, had the following characteristics: • The company was under the control of not more than four persons; or • The company was being wound up or had been wound up, and was under the control of not more than four persons at the start of the winding up; and in counting the number of persons: • All the members of any partnership were deemed to be one person; and • All trustees or beneficiaries of the estate of any deceased person were deemed to be one person. Close company From 1 July 1994 onwards, a close company is any company (excluding a special corporate entity) in respect of which at that time there are five or fewer natural persons whose aggregate voting interests (or, in the case when at the time a “market value circum- stance” exists in respect of the company, whose aggre- gate market value interests in the company) exceed 50 percent. When determining whether there are five or fewer natural persons, any natural person and all natural persons who are associated at the time with that natural person are treated as being one natural person. Policy When a taxpayer pays an amount of pension in an income year to a former employee or spouse, a deduc- tion from business income will be allowed if the specific tests in section DF 4, as stated above, have been met. Further, deductions will only be allowed when the pension arrangements are recorded by deed. For close companies, the deductions are limited to payments made to bona fide employees. Some factors that may indicate that a shareholder was a bona fide employee are: • If source deduction payments were received from the company, they were reasonably reflective of the position and responsibility held by the person as an employee; or • If the person was actively engaged in the activities of the company, the pension is reasonably reflective of that which would have been paid to an employee if that employee had not been a shareholder in the company. Section FF 17 states: For the purposes of section DF 4, where any part of the pension otherwise payable by an employer to a former employee is paid by the employer to any person other than the employee in accordance with an agreement made between the former employee and that other person under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 or in compliance with an order of the Court made under section 25 of that Act, section DF 4 (1) shall apply in the same manner and to the same extent to the amount of the part so paid as it would have applied if that amount had been, or formed part of, an amount paid by way of a pension to that former employee. Section BB 7 is the general provision which allows for the deduction of expenditure from income in the calculation of assessable income. However, generally section DF 1 (b) denies a taxpayer any deduction for expenditure in respect of bonuses, gratuities, retiring allowances, or pensions paid or payable to or for the benefit of any employee, former employee, or relative of any such employee during or on the occasion of the retirement of the employee. Expenditure on pensions can only be deducted under sections DF 4 and FF 17. In calculating the assessable income of a business for an income year, section DF 4 allows a deduction in respect of pensions paid by the taxpayer in that income year to a former employee or his or her surviving spouse. However, in summary, the Commissioner must be satisfied that: • The amount of the expenditure is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case; and • The pension is receivable by the recipient as of right under a deed for a fixed period or for life, or the pension is receivable by a surviving spouse for a fixed period, for life, or until he or she remarries; and • The employee has retired from that employment; or • The employee was made redundant or ceased employ- ment under other similar circumstances. Under section FF 17, any amount of pension paid to any person other than the former employee is still deductible when it is paid in accordance with a matrimonial property agreement made under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 or in compliance with a Court order made pursuant to section 25 of that Act. Proprietary and close companies The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 amended section 151(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the former section DF 4). Before the amendment, section 151(2) referred to a “proprietary company”. From 1 July 1994 the section refers to a “close company”. This amend- ment is incorporated into section DF 4 (2). Before 1 July 1994, section 151(2) prohibited any deduction from being made when the taxpayer was a “proprietary company” and the former employee or a relative of that employee was a shareholder in that company. However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the employee was a bona fide employee, a deduction can be considered. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Deed As indicated above, one of the requirements is for the pension to be receivable by a recipient under a deed. For these purposes, a deed is an instrument which meets all the following criteria: • It is in writing. • It is signed by the employer of the employee, and the employer intends to be bound. • It is attested to by at least one witness who must sign and (if the deed is executed in New Zealand) add his or her address and job description or calling. • It states that the employer will provide for the pay- ment of certain sums of money as a pension to the employee or in respect of that employee. Example 1 John has been employed as an engineer for XTRA Company Ltd for 25 years and will soon be retiring. The company has agreed to pay him a pension upon retirement in recognition of his long service to the company. The company has drawn up a deed specifying that it will pay John a weekly pension, being 40% of the average of the last four years’ salary which is $40,000. The pension will be payable for a period of 10 years from the date of his retirement. The deed is properly executed. The company is not a proprietary company or a close company. In this case the company will be entitled to deduct any pension payments that it makes to John. The payments are to be made after John retires from the company, are considered to be reasonable given the circumstances of the case, and will be receivable as of right under a deed. The requirements of section DF 4 will be satisfied. Example 2 Jenny has been working for PL Ltd for ten years. The company does not have any formal contracts of employment. It has agreed to pay Jenny a pension when she retires from the company. No formal documents have been drawn up. As there is no deed, the company will not be entitled to any deduction under section DF 4 for any pension that it pays to Jenny. Example 3 David is a shareholder-employee in MATEX Ltd, a clothing company. The company is a close company within the meaning of the Income Tax Act 1994. David has worked full-time in the company busi- ness for the last fifteen years, and is intending to retire in two years time with the company’s ap- proval. The company pays David a regular salary and deducts PAYE. The company agrees to pay David a pension of 50% of his current salary which is $100,000. This pension policy is also available to other employees. A deed is drawn up and is prop- erly executed. Factors that indicate that David is a bona fide employee are that he is working full-time in the company business and is paid a regular salary. It would need to be shown that the level of his salary is reasonably reflective of his position and responsi- bilities. An indicator that the pension amount is reasonable is that it is also available to other employees who are not associated with the company. If David is a bona fide employee of the company and the level of expenditure is assumed to be reasonable, and, given that the payments will be made as of right under a deed, the company will be entitled to deduct any pension payments made to him. Recovery of tax arising after estate distributed Summary This item sets out the Commissioner’s current policy on the recovery of tax arising after an estate has been distributed. The executor or administrator of an estate has a duty to ensure that the tax obligations of the deceased are satisfied. If a further tax liability of the deceased arises after the estate has been distributed, the executor or administrator is liable for that outstanding tax. How- ever, the executor may recover this tax from the benefi- ciaries of the estate. In cases of serious hardship, the administrator or executor may obtain relief from the tax liability incurred by the deceased. All legislative references in this item are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background When a person dies, he or she may have outstanding taxes to pay or may have income still to be returned. The executor or the administrator of the estate has a duty to ascertain details of the deceased’s debts, and to make provision for their payment. However, despite this obligation, some executors and administrators distribute estate assets to beneficiaries when there are outstanding taxes owing to Inland Revenue. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Section 35 of the Trustee Act 1956 provides protection against creditors for executors and administrators. Trustees who advertise their intention to distribute an estate are protected against claims of which they have no notice if they distribute the estate after the time for notice has expired. The trustee must advertise in a newspaper in each locality in which claims against the estate are likely to arise. Policy An executor or administrator is responsible for ensuring that all the tax obligations incurred by the deceased during his or her lifetime have been met. Any tax liability that is assessed after the date of death is deemed to be a liability incurred during the taxpayer’s lifetime, and the executor or administrator is responsible for paying it. An executor or administrator cannot use section 35 of the Trustee Act as protection against the Commissioner, as section 43 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives clear notice that there may be a debt owing to Inland Revenue. The Commissioner may also reopen back-year assess- ments even if an estate has been distributed. Any tax liability that arises as a result of a reassessment is the responsibility of the executor or administrator. This is subject to the four-year limitation in section 108. An executor or administrator has a right to recover from a beneficiary amounts paid by the executor to the Commissioner for debts owing by the deceased. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax owing could cause serious hardship to the beneficiaries of the estate, he may at his discretion release the executor or administrator wholly or in part from the tax liability, and alter the assessment as is necessary for the purpose. Case law In the High Court decision Public Trustee v Flower (1991) 13 NZTC 8,042, the deceased had failed to declare interest he had received during the four years prior to his death. After the executor distributed the estate, he received an assessment from Inland Revenue. The executor sought to recover the amount from the beneficiary of the estate. Justice Williamson stressed the importance of comply- ing with section 11 (now section 43). His Honour held that, based on section 11(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now 43(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994), the liability of the executor to pay the income tax was clear. Justice Williamson commented that, because of section 11 of the Income Tax Act 1976, it may be that the protection against liability that some statutes afford an executor or administrator who has paid out an estate in good faith may not avail the executor or administrator against the Inland Revenue Department. Justice Williamson further held that the executor could recover the tax payable by the deceased from the beneficiary. Legislation Cross-reference table Tax Administration Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 4311(2) 44(2)12 10825 11323 176(1)414(2) Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 defines “trustee” to include an executor or administrator. Section 43 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states: (1) The executor or administrator of a deceased taxpayer shall in respect of all income derived by that taxpayer in the taxpayer’s lifetime make the same returns as the taxpayer ought to have made or would have been bound to make if the taxpayer had remained alive; and the Commissioner may from time to time require the executor or administrator to make such further returns relative to that income as the Commis- sioner thinks necessary, and may assess the executor or administrator for income tax on that income in the same manner in which the taxpayer might have been assessed had the taxpayer remained alive. (2) The tax so assessed shall be deemed to be a liability incurred by the deceased taxpayer in the deceased taxpayer’s lifetime, and the executor or administrator of the taxpayer shall be liable for the same accordingly. Under section 44(2), the Commissioner may require the executors or administrators of a deceased taxpayer to file a tax return to cover a specified period or income from a specified transaction. The Commissioner can require this at any time during an income year or in any subsequent year. If the return is not filed, or if the Commissioner is dissatisfied with it, he may issue an assessment for a sum that he considers reasonable. Section 113 states: (1) The Commissioner may from time to time and at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure the correctness thereof, notwithstanding that the tax already assessed may have been paid. (2) If any such alteration or addition has the effect of imposing any fresh liability or increasing any existing liability, notice thereof shall be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer affected. Under section 108, the Commissioner is unable to alter an assessment if four years have passed since the end of the year in which the original assessment was issued, unless the return was fraudulent, wilfully misleading, or did not mention income of a particular nature or from a particular source. The Commissioner may release an executor or adminis- trator from liability in certain circumstances.

Section GD 3 is an anti-avoidance section which enables the Commissioner to reallocate income or losses between partners. The Commissioner’s policy is that income or losses may be reallocated having regard to the duties and responsi- bilities of each partner, the amount of capital (including assets) contributed to the partnership, and any other relevant matters. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background The Commissioner has discretion under section GD 3 to reallocate partnership profits, income or losses if, in his opinion, the allocation made by the partnership is not reasonable. Section GD 3 applies to partnerships when the partners are related. Section GD 3 also applies to partnerships and companies that employ relatives. Section DF 8 deals with payments of salary and wages to working partners. This item only deals with the allocation of profits and losses between partners who are relatives. This item sets out the matters the Commissioner will take into account in deciding whether to reallocate profits, income, or losses. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DF 8167B GD 3 (1)97(1) GD 3 (3)97(3) GD 3 (4)97(4) GD 3 (5)97(4) OB 12 When section GD 3 applies to partnership profits and losses Section GD 3 applies to partnerships in the circum- stances specified in section GD 3 (1). These can be restated as: • A partnership carries on business and two of the partners are relatives, or, if a partner is a company, a director or shareholder of the company is a relative of any partner. • A company carries on business in partnership with a relative of a director or shareholder of the company. Relative “Relative” is defined in section OB 1. A relative of someone is a person connected by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption, and includes a trustee for a relative. The definition of “relative” expands on these concepts. People are connected by blood for the purposes of the definition if they are connected within the fourth degree. This means that there are four or fewer direct connec- tions between two people. A direct connection is the relationship between a parent and child. For example, a sister and brother are connected to the second degree, and an aunt and niece are connected to the third degree. People are connected by marriage if they are married, or if a person is married to a person who is connected by a blood relationship to the other. For example, a person and his or her brother-in-law are connected by mar- riage. Finally, people are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as a child by the other, or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other. When allocation of income is unreasonable Under section GD 3 (1) the Commissioner may reallo- cate the share of profits or other income payable to or for the benefit of, or the share of losses borne by, the relative or company if he considers that the allocation is unreasonable. To determine whether an allocation is reasonable, the Commissioner must have regard to all of the following: • the nature and extent of the services rendered • the value of the contributions made by the respective partners by way of services, capital, or otherwise • any other relevant matters. If the Commissioner then forms the opinion that the amount of income or losses allocated to a relative is not reasonable, he may reallocate the profits, income or losses of the business or undertaking (before the deduc- tion of any amount payable to the relative) between the partners in such shares as he considers reasonable. Limit on Commissioner’s ability to reallocate income Section GD 3 (4) limits the Commissioner’s ability to reallocate income or losses. The Commissioner cannot reallocate income or losses if a bona fide partnership contract exists. Under section GD 3 (5), a contract is bona fide if it meets all the following criteria: • It is written and signed by all the parties to the contract or evidenced by deed signed by all the parties. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) • Capital contributions. Usually capital contributions are shown in the partnership accounts and this information will be relied on. The Commissioner may require more information if a partner has made assets available to the partnership and is not receiving rent or lease payments. • Other relevant matters. These may include any special circumstances of the partnership business. Reallocation of share of profits or loss Using this information, the Commissioner will deter- mine each partner’s proportionate share in the partner- ship, and compare the allocation of profit, income, or loss made on this basis with the actual allocation made. The Commissioner may then reallocate profit, income, or losses on a reasonable basis. A reallocation is only made if it increases the tax payable by $100 or more. A reallocation cannot be made if there is a bona fide contract, as defined in section GD 3 (5) and set out under the “Legislation” heading above. Husband and wife partnerships The question of whether a husband and wife are carry- ing on business in partnership, and - if there is a partnership - each spouse’s share of partnership profit, income, and loss, depends on the facts. The Partnership Act 1908 gives some guidance. Sec- tion 4 of that Act defines partnership as: the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit. Therefore, in terms of the statutory definition of part- nership, there are three essential elements: • a business • carried on by two or more persons in common • with a view to profit. Section 27(a) of the Partnership Act goes on to state that as a general rule profits and losses are shared equally in the absence of any partnership agreement to the con- trary: The interests of partners in the partnership property, and their rights and duties in relation to the partnership, shall be determined, subject to any agreement (express or implied) between the partners, by the following rules: (a) All the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business, and must contribute equally towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the firm. The Commissioner will take into account each spouse’s capital contribution and services performed in the business in determining whether a partnership exists, and if so, whether there is any agreement as to the spouses’ interests in partnership property. Business assets transferred by matrimonial agreement are treated as having been contributed to the partnership in the proportions contained in the agreement. • No partner was under the age of 20 when the contract or deed was signed. • The contract is binding on the parties for a term of at least three years and cannot be terminated by any party to the contract except for: -dissolution of the partnership by the death or bankruptcy of any partner, or at the option of the partners where a charge is made against a partner’s share of the partnership property, under section 36 of the Partnership Act 1908; or -dissolution of the partnership by a court as provided for in section 38 of the Partnership Act. • Each partner has real and effective control over his or her share of profits or other income to which he or she is entitled under the contract, as well as real and effective liability for his or her share under the contract of the losses incurred. • The share of profits, or other income payable to a relative, or to a company of which a director or shareholder is a relative, does not constitute a gift for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. “Gift” is defined in section 2(2) of that Act to mean: ...any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition Application Section GD 3 (3) provides that section GD 3 applies whether the partnership was entered into before or after the beginning of the income year. Policy The Commissioner may reallocate income or losses in proportions he considers reasonable. The Commissioner will exercise this discretion when he considers that the share of income or losses allocated to a relative is excessive, having regard to the value of the contribu- tions made by the partners by way of services, capital or otherwise and any other relevant matters. Section GD 3 is an anti-avoidance provision aimed at arrangements which allocate income or loss based on tax advantages, rather than on contributions to the partnership. Information required The Commissioner will consider the following informa- tion when evaluating the allocation of partnership profit, income, or loss: • The services rendered by each partner. Relevant factors are the duties and responsibilities of each partner, time spent on partnership business, and any special skills or expertise of the partners. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Cases Case B45 (1976) 2 NZTC 60,394 In this case the Commissioner reallocated income between the partners in a farming partnership. The partners were a taxpayer and the trustees of his family trust. Before the chairman A J Lloyd Martin, both parties agreed that section 106 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (the equivalent section to section GD 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994) applied. The objectors disputed the Commissioner’s method of reallocation. The chairman referred to Case 12, 2 NZTBR 90, in which the Board commented at page 93 that “It does not necessarily follow that adherence to a formula will in every case provide the answer to the question posed for determination.” And at page 94 “In concluding this determination we emphasise that varying conditions or circumstances might well warrant a different answer to a comparable problem.” In Case B45 the chairman took into account the value of land provided by the trustees, livestock bailed by the taxpayer to the trustees, and management services provided by the taxpayer. The chairman allocated five percent rental for the land and the livestock, and a higher management fee for a period of the years in question, and found that the rest of the profits should be divided equally between the partners. Case L64 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,374 Section 106 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 was also considered in Case L64. Judge Barber held that it was unreal to regard the five year old son of the tax- payer as providing services to his father’s building business for which it was appropriate for him to receive wages. Amounts paid to the child were excessive under section 106. Case S2 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,012 In a recent case, Case S2, Judge Barber upheld the Commissioner’s assessment allocating rental losses equally between a husband and wife. On the evidence, the husband and wife were equal owners and partners in respect of the rental property. Judge Barber did not accept that losses should be allocated on the basis of the husband and wife’s contri- butions of 80 percent and 20 percent to a previously owned rental property, nor did he consider it important that the husband was responsible for administration and upkeep of the property. The factors His Honour considered important were that the husband and wife were joint tenants and jointly liable under the mortgage, both were the ratepayers, contributions were made from matrimonial property, there was some muddlement in presenting partnership accounts, the wife contributed fully to the marriage, and the husband’s claim that losses should all be allocated to him could be interpreted as self-serving from a taxation point of view. Tokens, stamps and vouchers - GST on supply Summary This item states the Commissioner’s policy on how GST applies to the purchase and redemption of tokens, stamps and vouchers. “Redemption” of a token, stamp, or voucher is the conversion of the token, stamp, or voucher into goods or services. The purchase and redemption of tokens, stamps and vouchers involves two supplies. The sale of the token, stamp or voucher is the first supply. The goods and services supplied on conversion or redemption of the token, stamp or voucher is the second. Sections 10(16) and 10(17) ensure that GST is only charged once on tokens, stamps and vouchers. These provisions ensure that only the first or second supply is relevant for GST purposes, depending on whether the monetary value is stated on the token, stamp or voucher. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background The use of tokens, stamps and vouchers to pay for goods and services is well established. Examples are the use of milk tokens or bus tickets. The use of these products is increasing with changes in technology and the advent of things such as phone cards and photocopier cards. This item provides some guidance on the Commissioner’s view on the application of sections 10(16) and 10(17). Legislation Section 10(16) states: Subject to subsection (15A) of this section, where a right to receive goods and services for a monetary value stated on any token, stamp (not being a postage stamp as defined in section 2 of the Postal Services Act 1987), or voucher is granted for a consideration in money, that supply shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act, except to the extent (if any) that that consideration exceeds that monetary value. Section 10(17) states: Subject to subsection (15A) of this section, where a right to receive goods and services is granted in exchange for- (a) Any token, stamp, or voucher for a consideration in money and the monetary value of that token, stamp, or voucher is not stated thereon; or (b) A postage stamp (as defined in section 2 of the Postal Services Act 1987),- continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Policy Whether tokens, stamps and vouchers are goods or services Tokens, stamps and vouchers are choses in action and, accordingly, “services” as defined in section 2. There- fore, the supply of a token, stamp or voucher is a supply of services for GST purposes. (Section 2 defines “serv- ices” as anything which is not goods or money. Section 2 defines “goods” as all kinds of personal or real property, not including money or choses in action.) A chose in action is a personal right of property that can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession. The holder of a token, stamp or voucher is entitled to rights that cannot be enforced by taking physical possession. For example, if a retailer refused to convert a gift voucher into goods and services (when the retailer was obliged to convert the voucher), the holder of the voucher could only enforce his or her rights by legal action. What is a “token”, “stamp” or “voucher” Section 2 does not define the terms “token”, “stamp” and “voucher”. Historically “tokens” have been regarded as small coin- like objects such as a milk token or a disc used in a machine. Tokens have been used as a medium of exchange, passed to a trader in exchange for goods. “Vouchers” have been regarded as a slip of paper such as a book or record voucher. “Stamps” are understood to be small pieces of paper indicating payment of an amount or prepayment of some service, for example postage stamps. The ordinary meaning of the terms reflects this historical use of tokens and vouchers. (Note however that postage stamps, as defined in section 2 of the Postal Services Act 1987, are treated differently to other stamps. The value of supply for a postage stamp is calculated exclusively under section 10(17).) With changes in technology and the advent of new means of receiving goods and services, the ordinary meaning of these terms is much broader. The Commis- sioner accepts that the definitions of these terms are wide enough to include many products denoting an entitlement to goods and services such as phone cards, rail passes, bus tickets, courier tickets or vouchers, and gift vouchers. In the context of the modern environ- ment, the meanings of “token”, “stamp” and “voucher” in the Act should have a wider, more modern meaning. Example 1 David runs a small bookshop. As well as newspa- pers and magazines he sells bus tickets for travel on buses run by the Old Trafford City Council. The Old Trafford City Council bus tickets have no monetary value on them, but entitle the holder to ten trips per ticket. (Although each ticket has the number of sections stated on it, that does not amount to a monetary value.) the value of the supply of goods and services made upon redemption of that token, stamp, or voucher, or franking of that stamp or special stamp (as so defined) shall be nil. Application of sections 10(16) and 10(17) Sections 10(16) and 10(17) operate to ensure that GST is only charged once on the sale and redemption of tokens, stamps or vouchers. (Attached to this item is a flow chart that details how this legislation operates.) Sections 10(16) and 10(17) relate to tokens, stamps and vouchers that give a right to receive goods and services. Sections 10(16) and 10(17) do not apply to tokens, stamps or vouchers that give a right to money. When a token, stamp or voucher gives a right to receive goods and services, but may also be converted into money, sections 10(16) and 10(17) still apply, with some modifications. Section 10(16) When the monetary value is stated on a token, stamp or voucher, section 10(16) applies and the first supply (the sale of that token, stamp or voucher) is disregarded for GST purposes. That is, GST is only charged on the second supply. This is the redemption or conversion of the token, stamp or voucher. If the consideration paid by the purchaser exceeds the monetary value of the token, stamp or voucher, the first supply (the sale of the token, stamp or voucher) is not disregarded for GST purposes to the extent the consid- eration exceeds the monetary value. If the token, stamp or voucher may be, and is, converted into money instead of goods and services, no GST is charged on the second supply. Section 10(16) does not apply to postage stamps. Section 10(17) When the monetary value is not stated on a token, stamp or voucher, or a postage stamp is supplied, section 10(17) applies and the redemption or conversion of that token, stamp or voucher, or the franking of that postage stamp, has a nil value for GST purposes. That is, GST is only charged when the token, stamp, voucher or postage stamp is supplied, not when it is used. Like section 10(16), under section 10(17) there are two supplies. However, under section 10(17) the second supply has a nil value. GST will have been charged on the first supply even if the token, stamp or voucher may be converted into money or goods and services. If the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for money, no GST should have been charged on the first supply. The supplier should reverse the GST on the first supply. Section 10(15A) specifically deals with casino chips. It is dealt with in the following item in this TIB. Sections 10(16) and 10(17) do not apply to casino chips. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) David sells a ticket to Brian, a commuter within Old Trafford. The ticket costs Brian $15. David should return GST on the ticket of $1.67. When Brian uses the ticket the value of the supply is nil, so no GST needs to be returned at the time of redemption. Example 2 David also sells gift vouchers for a chain of book- shops. Each voucher entitles the holder to $20 of books or stationery, and has the monetary value stated on the voucher. David is entitled to sell the vouchers for $21 ($1 is an administration fee). David sells a voucher to Paul. At the time of sale David should only account for GST on the $1 by which the consideration exceeds the monetary value of the voucher, that is $0.11. When Paul redeems the token at a bookshop, that bookshop should return GST on the $20, that is $2.22. Example 3 David also sells stamps, including a new set of stamps issued with a face value of 50 cents, and a 5 cent surcharge to raise funds for medical research. The stamps have a 50 cent value on their face. David sells a stamp to Keith. At the time of sale David should account for GST on the full value of the stamp, that is $0.06 GST on the $0.55 stamp. Casino chips - GST on supply Summary This item describes how GST applies to casino chips. The purchase of a casino chip or the right to participate in a casino game is deemed to be for a supply of serv- ices. The value of the supply is the amount the player pays to the casino, less any amount the casino pays out as winnings or redemption of chips to the player. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Application of section 10(15A) Section 10(15A) specifically deals with casino chips. Sections 10(16) and 10(17) are not applicable to casino chips, but are dealt with in the item in this TIB entitled “Tokens, stamps and vouchers - GST on supply”. The combined effect of sections 10(15A) and 5(11B), is that the value of a supply made by a casino is the amount the casino collects from a customer, less the amount the casino pays to a customer as winnings or for the redemption of chips. Example Shar’s Palace Casino sells $1,000 of casino chips to Porson, a keen gambler. Porson has a poor night, and loses $900 of his chips. His last gamble of $100 of chips wins him $300 plus the return of his stake. At the end of the night he collects his winnings of $300 and cashes in the $100 in chips he has retained. Shar’s Palace Casino must account for GST of $66.67 on its supply to Porson, the consideration for that supply being $600 (the $1,000 of chips, less the winnings of $300, less the redemption of chips of $100). Non-resident film renters - income tax treatment Summary Section CN 2 applies to non-residents and New Zealand companies controlled by non-residents who derive income from renting films in New Zealand (all called “non-resident film renters” in this item). Section CN 2 (2) deems non-resident film renters to have derived income from renting films in New Zealand equal to 10% of the gross receipts receivable from that activity. The non-resident film renter is subject to income tax on that income. “Films” means motion picture films, television films, advertising films, slides, and videotapes. Income within section CN 2 is not assessable under any other provision of the Act. The proviso to section CN 2 (1) states that section CN 2 does not apply when the income from renting films is a minor and relatively insignificant part of the renter’s business income. Each case must be examined on its facts to establish if the income from renting films is a minor and relatively insignificant part of the business income. Where the proviso excludes film rents from section CN 2, the rents will be subject to normal income tax rules, and the provisions of relevant double tax agreements. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background Section CN 2 is a special rule for non-resident film renters, which has existed in various forms since 1928. The rule was originally enacted because of the difficul- ties non-resident film renters have in determining the amount of profit they derive in each country in which they rent films. Rather than require non-resident film renters to determine accurately the profit derived from sales in New Zealand, the Act makes 10 percent of the gross rents assessable income. Currently non-resident renters are subject to the non- resident company tax rate of 38 percent on their assess- able income, making for an effective tax rate of 3.8 percent on gross rents. (Under the proposed changes to the international tax rules, the non-resident company tax rate will fall to 33 percent of assessable income, making for an effective tax rate of 3.3 percent on gross rents). New Zealand resident companies that rent films and are under the control of non-residents are also taxed under section CN 2. They pay tax at the resident company rate of 33 percent on the 10 percent of gross rents, making for an effective tax rate of 3.3 percent on gross rents. Regardless of the rules applying to some New Zealand resident companies, this item uses the phrase “non- resident film renters”. Background A casino has recently opened in New Zealand, so it is timely to provide guidance on the GST treatment of casino chips. Legislation Section 5(11B) states: Notwithstanding anything in this Act, for the purposes of this Act where any person pays to a casino an amount in money- (a) To purchase a chip or otherwise to participate in any game played or conducted in casino premises; or (b) As commission in respect of participation in any game played or conducted in casino premises,- the money so paid shall be deemed to be for the supply of services by the casino operator. Section 10(15A) states: Notwithstanding anything in subsection (16) or subsection (17) of this section, where a supply is deemed to be made under section 5(11B) of this Act, the consideration in money for the supply shall be deemed to be the amount of money (including cheques not collected) a person pays to the casino to purchase a chip or otherwise to participate in any game played or conducted on casino premises, or as commission in respect of participation in any such game, less any amount paid out by the casino as winnings in respect of gaming or for redemption of chips. from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) There has been some misunderstanding on the applica- tion of section CN 2. Some non-resident film renters are having non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) deducted from payments for rents. Non-resident film renters have been seeking refunds of NRWT and recalculation of their income tax liability under section CN 2. (This problem has not affected New Zealand resident compa- nies, as they are obviously not subject to NRWT). Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CN 2224 NG 1310 NG 2311 OB 12 Section OB 1 defines “royalty” as: “Royalty” includes a payment of any kind, whether periodical or not and however described or computed, to the extent to which it is derived as consideration for- ... (d) The use of, or the right to use,- (i) Any motion picture film; or (ii)Any films or videotapes for use in connection with television; or (iii)Any tapes for use in connection with radio broadcast- ing ... Section CN 2 (1) states: This section shall apply to any person, being- (a) Any person not deemed to be resident in New Zealand; or (b) A New Zealand company that is under the control of persons who are not deemed to be resident in New Zealand,- in respect of the income derived by that person (whether as principal or agent or trustee) from New Zealand from renting films: Provided that this section shall not apply to any such person in any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that the income from renting films is a minor and relatively insignificant part of the income of that person from any business. Section CN 2 (5) states: In this section- “Film” means any exposed slide, strip, or motion film or any videotape; and includes- (a) Any cinematograph film, whether or not it is accompanied by reproduction of sound: (b) Any film intended for or capable of use on television: (c) Any film used for advertising purposes: (d) Any part of any film: “Rents”, in relation to films, means rents or other considera- tion for or in relation to the renting, hiring, or otherwise issuing films, or making other arrangements for their exhibi- tion; and includes (a) Any receipts from the sale or hire of film containers: (b) Any receipts from the sale or hire of cinematograph or photographic materials, equipment, or accessories other than films: (c) Any receipts from the sale or hire of advertising materials relating to any film,- and “renting” has a corresponding meaning. Section CN 2 (2) deems the non-resident film renter to have assessable income of 10 percent of the gross rents receivable by that person, and this amount is to be subject to income tax. Under section CN 2 (3), income from renting films that comes within section CN 2 is not assessable under other provisions of the Act. Section CN 2 (3) also says that when calculating income other than film renting income, no account is to be taken of expenditure or loss incurred in connection with renting films. Section CN 2 (3) does not prevent the application of provisional tax rules including the imposition of additional taxes for underestimation and late payment of provisional tax, and the imposition of use of money interest. Provisional tax simply governs the timing of taxpayers’ tax pay- ments. Additional taxes are penalties for failing to pay tax, rather than an assessment of tax on income. Additional taxes and penalties charged to non-provi- sional taxpayers are also not excluded by section CN 2 (3). Again, these do not amount to the assessment of tax on income. Section NG 1 (2) states: The NRWT rules shall apply to income (in this Act referred to as “non-resident withholding income”), being income that is deemed under this Act to be derived from New Zealand and that consists of- (a) Dividends (other than investment society dividends) or royalties that are derived by a person who is not resident in New Zealand; or ... not being income that is- ... (e) Assessable under section CN 2... Section NG 2 (1)(c) imposes NRWT of 15 percent on royalties. Double Tax Agreements (DTAs) between New Zealand and other countries tend to have a definition of royalties (in relation to films) that is similar to the relevant part of the section OB 1 definition of “royalty”. DTAs may limit the amount of NRWT that New Zealand can charge on the royalties. The limit is generally 10 percent. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) If there is a DTA, the non-resident film renter is only subject to tax on those rents (as defined in section CN 2) if the renter has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. The non-resident film renter will either be taxed under section CN 2, or, where the proviso to section CN 2 applies, as business profits. If the renter does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand, he or she is not subject to New Zealand tax on those rents. If there is no DTA between New Zealand and the non- resident film renter’s home country, the rents are subject to tax under section CN 2. If the rents come within the proviso to section CN 2, the rents are assess- able as business profits for all non-resident film renters (non-residents and New Zealand companies controlled by non-residents). Proviso to section CN 2 (1) Section CN 2 will not apply when the non-resident film renter’s income from renting films is a minor and relatively insignificant part of that person’s business income. “Minor and relatively insignificant” means that the income from renting films is minor and relatively unimportant when compared to the total business income of that non-resident film renter. The word “relatively” relates to the overall sources of business income. Income from film renting must be both minor and relatively insignificant. If the income from film renting is minor, but is not relatively insignificant, the proviso will not apply. Each case must be examined on its own facts. Many cases will be easy to decide. For example, if a large motion picture producer distributes films in New Zealand through a subsidiary, that subsidiary will not have income from renting films that is a minor and relatively insignificant part of its business. (Assuming the principal focus of the subsidiary is distributing films.) Even if the parent company distributed the films, the parent company’s income from renting would not be minor and relatively insignificant. In both cases the amount or significance of the income is more than minor and relatively insignificant. On the other hand, when a non-resident rents a film as a one-off event, it is more likely to amount to a minor and relatively insignificant part of its income. When the payer of the rental is unsure if the non-resident comes within the proviso, he or she should seek further information from the payee. If still unsure, the rental payer should contact Inland Revenue’s Masterton Office, which deals with non-resident film renters. Examples Example 1 A United Kingdom company (UK Co) distributes television films within New Zealand to a small New Zealand television network (NZ Network). UK Co Application of legislation Definition of “film” The section CN 2 (5) definition of “film” is wider in scope than motion picture or cinematograph films. It includes advertising films, slides, and videotapes and films intended for or capable of use on television. The definition requires a film to be tangible property. Therefore, “film” does not include a live telecast. Definition of “rents” The section CN 2 (5) definition of “rents” is wider than simply payments for the right to use and exhibit films. For example, also included as rents are receipts from the sale or hire of film containers. Section CN 2: Receipts that are “rents” and “royalties” When film rents also amount to royalties (as defined in section OB 1), those rents/royalties are subject to tax under section CN 2 rather than under the NRWT rules. Section NG 1 (2)(e) excludes from the NRWT rules income assessable under section CN 2, so there will be no NRWT liability. When the income from renting films is a minor and relatively insignificant part of the business income, the proviso to section CN 2 (1) applies and those rents are not subject to tax under section CN 2 but are taxed under the NRWT rules (for non-residents) or the normal rules for business income (New Zealand companies). Section CN 2 will apply whether or not the non-resident film renter’s home country has a DTA with New Zealand. If there is no DTA, New Zealand may tax the rents/royalties under domestic law in the manner described above. If there is a DTA, New Zealand may tax the rents/royalties to a maximum of (usually) 10 percent. The section CN 2 rule effectively taxes the rents/royalties at 3.8 percent (for non-resident compa- nies), complying with the obligations under a DTA. Under some DTAs, when the recipient of royalties has a permanent establishment in the source country, the royalties are to be taxed under the business profits article. This does not change the tax treatment of non- resident film renters: they are subject to New Zealand tax under section CN 2. If the rents come within the proviso to section CN 2 (1), and are subject to NRWT, the rate of NRWT New Zealand may impose will be determined by any DTA in effect. If there is no DTA, the normal NRWT rules apply for non-residents. (For New Zealand residents the income is subject to the normal rules for business income, not NRWT). Section CN 2: Receipts that are “rents” but not “royalties” When film rents do not also amount to royalties, those rents are taxable under section CN 2, subject to the relevant DTA. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. NZ Network pays UK Co a rental for each screening of a UK Co programme on NZ Network’s channels. In the 1994-95 income year, NZ Network pays $110,000 to UK Co. UK Co’s rents are taxable under section CN 2. Ten percent of the rents are assessable income, that is $11,000. At the non-resident company tax rate of 38 percent, UK Co is liable to pay $4,180 in New Zealand tax. The DTA between New Zealand and the United Kingdom will not reduce this liability, as New Zealand may tax royalties (which includes these payments) up to a maximum of 10 percent of the gross income (maximum tax of $11,000). Example 2 UK Co also sells some photographic materials in New Zealand: worth $20,000 in the 1994-95 income year. At first glance this income also appears taxable under section CN 2, being a “rent” as defined in section CN 2 (5) (paragraph (b) of the definition of “rents”). However, the New Zealand/United King- dom DTA does not allow New Zealand to tax UK Co’s income because UK Co does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. (The DTA royalty article does not apply as the sale of photographic materials is not within the definition of “royalty”.) Example 3 An Australian company (Aus Co) is a publishing and multimedia company that is involved in magazines, sound recordings, television pro- grammes, and motion picture films. It rents motion pictures in New Zealand, earning about $5,000,000. It has overall business income of NZ$150,000,000. Aus Co is subject to the section CN 2 regime. Although its film renting income is less than 5 percent of its business income, the amount of NZ$5,000,000 cannot be said to be a minor and relatively insignificant part of business income. Therefore, Aus Co is subject to New Zealand tax on 10 percent of the $1,000,000 it earns from renting films in New Zealand. That is, it is subject to New Zealand tax of 38 percent on $100,000, which amounts to $38,000. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Subscriptions deductible for tax purposes Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A stud stock farmer has asked if subscrip- tions paid to two local Agricultural and Pastoral Societies and the Automobile Association are tax deductible, and how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue views the legislation. When deciding if fees and subscriptions are allowable as a deduction, it is neces- sary to determine whether such a deduction comes within the provisions of section BB 7. Section BB 7 states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Fees and subscriptions paid to a trade or professional association are deductible when there is a sufficient connection between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s income earning process. This type of expenditure is deductible under section BB 7 (a) as it is incurred in the gaining or producing of the taxpayer’s income. In this case, subscriptions paid to the Agricultural and Pastoral Societies are deductible, because of the relationship between the farmer’s business and the holding of A & P shows where top stud stock is usually on display. Any written material put out by the society may also benefit the stud stock farmer. As to membership of the Automobile Association, the stud stock farmer would not be entitled to claim the subscription paid as a deduction, unless he can demonstrate a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and his income earning activities. Education course expenses - deductibility Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A Canadian company is in the process of setting up a New Zealand subsidiary. The subsidiary company will market a successful Canadian medical professional practice management training course. It is designed to help doctors train themselves in modern practice management techniques. The New Zealand manager has asked if an income tax deduction will be available to self-employed medical professionals who purchase the product. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Section BB 7 permits a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or produc- ing assessable income for any income year, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. In this case, the cost to self-employed medical professionals of buying the train- ing course is allowable as a deduction, as it is directly related to their business practice and is incurred in the maintenance or production of their assessable income. Loan guarantor’s loss when guarantee is called on - deductibility Section EH 4 (section 64F(8), Income Tax Act 1976) - Income and expenditure where financial arrangement redeemed or disposed of: A taxpayer acted as guarantor for a loan taken out by a company of which she was a major (60%) shareholder. The guarantee was called on when the company failed. The tax- payer has asked if she can claim a deduction for the amount she was required to pay. The guarantee provided by the taxpayer is a financial arrangement and the taxpayer/guarantor is the issuer in relation to that financial arrangement. A base price adjustment must be calculated at the time the payment is made under the guarantee. This results in expenditure or loss being incurred by the issuer. Section EH 4 sets out the method of calculating income and expenditure when a financial arrangement matures or is remitted. A “financial arrangement” is defined in section OB 1 (section 64B, Income Tax Act 1976), and includes a debt or debt instrument. Under section EH 4 (8): ...where and to the extent that a person (in this subsection called the “surety”) suffers expenditure or a loss under a security arrangement and the expenditure or loss, in whole or in part, is due to- (a) The actions of; or (b) The occurrence, or failure to occur, of an event that was potentially or actually subject to the influence of - the surety or any person with whom the surety was, during the term of the security arrangement, an associated person, no deduction shall be allowed to the surety or any person in relation to the expenditure or loss. Section OB 1 defines a security arrangement as: ...in the definition of “security payment” and in the qualified accruals rules and sections CG 3 (b) and GC 8, means a financial arrangement that secures the holder against failure of any person to perform their obligations under a secured arrangement. Section OD 7 (section 8, Income Tax Act 1976) defines when two persons are associated persons. Included as associated persons, in section OD 7 (1)(b), are: A company and any other person (other than a company) where at the time - (i) The person has a voting interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25%; or (ii) In any case where at the time a market value circumstance exists in respect of the company, the person has a market value interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25%... In this case, the taxpayer holds more than 25% of the shares in the company, and so she and the company are associated persons. Under section EH 4 (8), no deduction can be claimed for the loss if the expenditure or loss results from the actions of the taxpayer or an associated person. If the expenditure or loss did not result from the actions of the taxpayer or an associated person, a full deduction for the expenditure or loss can be claimed. continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) However, section EH 5 (3) states: Where a person receives a security payment in relation to a loss and a deduction is not allowable for the loss in calculating the assessable income of the person other than under this subsection, the person shall be allowed a deduction for the loss no greater than the amount of the security payment. This means that if the taxpayer received a guarantee fee, and has returned the fee as income, she will be entitled to a deduction for any expenditure or loss up to the amount of the fee. Values placed on exotic livestock Section EL 1 (section 86, Income Tax Act 1976) - Valuation of trading stock generally: A taxpayer plans to acquire a business described as a “farm tourist centre”. The business will own livestock of various breeds, some of them exotic. The taxpayer has asked if it is appropriate to apply the National Average Market Values to the livestock, or if the stock can be valued using other methods. The taxpayer considers that a basic value of $20,000 can be set for the total value of the livestock. Any sales, purchases, or natural increases, and the profits/losses arising from them, would show in the farm operating account. Under section EE 1 (1) (section 85(2), Income Tax Act 1976), a taxpayer carrying on a business must take into account the value of trading stock (including live- stock) at the beginning and end of each financial year to determine whether any assessable income has been derived. Section EL 1 provides the rules for valuing livestock that are not livestock used in dealing. The National Average Market Values are used as a means of determining the value of trading stock. The stock on this farm, including the exotic animals, are not trading stock. They are an asset of the farm. No depreciation is available under current legislation. Under section EL 1 (1)(c), non-specified livestock, which the stock in question are, must be valued under: (i) The market value option; or (ii) The replacement value option; or (iii) The cost price option; or (iv) The standard value option. The proposal set out by the taxpayer to adopt a basic value for the livestock, to be used as the basis for reporting each time accounts are prepared and returns submitted to Inland Revenue, is not acceptable. A value must be put on the livestock under section EL 1 (1)(c). Valuing livestock when estate continues farming activity previously carried on by deceased Section EL 1 (section 85, Income Tax Act 1976) - Valuation of livestock gener- ally: The trustees of a deceased farmer’s estate plan to continue the farming activity previously carried on by the deceased. A trustee has asked how the trustees should value the estate’s livestock at the end of their first year of trad- ing. Under section EL 1 (3), when a taxpayer is deriving income from livestock at the date of death, any livestock on hand at that date is to be valued at market value in the return of income to date of death. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) If the livestock is then transferred to the trustee of the estate to continue the farming business, as that person is a new taxpayer the estate is subject to the other provisions of sections EL 1 to EL 10 in relation to the livestock. The livestock enters the books of the estate at market value, and is valued at balance date according to the valuation scheme adopted by the trustee under section EL 1 (1)(d). FBT cost price of secondhand motor vehicle obtained from associated person Section GC 16 (section 336O(1A), Income Tax Act 1976) - Value of motor vehicle acquired from associated person: The manager of a company is consid- ering purchasing a motor vehicle from a subsidiary company, so that it can be provided to an employee. The company realises that FBT will be payable, but the manager has asked whether there are any special rules to be considered when purchasing a vehicle in these circumstances. Under section OD 7 (section 8, Income Tax Act 1976), the two companies are “associated persons”. Normally, the value of a fringe benefit that consists of the unlimited private use or enjoyment, or availability for such private use or enjoy- ment, is 6% of the cost price of the vehicle, per quarter. However, different rules apply when the vehicle is purchased from an associ- ated person within 24 months of the date on which that associated person pur- chased the vehicle. Under section GC 16, the cost price is deemed to be the highest cost price of the motor vehicle paid by either of the associated persons. Example ABC Ltd and XYZ Ltd are associated persons. ABC Ltd purchased a new car for $40,000. Eighteen months later, ABC Ltd sells the car to XYZ Ltd for $32,000. For FBT purposes, the cost price of the motor vehicle to XYZ Ltd is $40,000. Carry forward of losses incurred by deceased to the estate Section IE 1 (3) (section 188(3), Income Tax Act 1976) - Losses incurred may be set off against future profits: The trustee of a deceased’s estate has asked if losses incurred by the deceased in his lifetime are able to be set off against income of his estate. In general terms, the purpose of section IE 1 is to permit a taxpayer to carry forward losses incurred in one income year for set off against the taxpayer’s assessable income in a later income year. Under section IE 1 (3), any taxpayer who satisfies the Commissioner that he or she has incurred a loss in an income year may: • Carry forward that loss to the next income year and deduct or offset the loss from assessable income in that next income year; and • If the loss cannot be totally deducted or offset in that next income year, carry it forward to the next succeeding year and deduct or offset, and so on. When a taxpayer dies, any losses that would otherwise have been available to the deceased to carry forward are lost and cannot be carried forward for deduct- ing or offsetting against income derived by the estate. This is because, for tax purposes, the estate is a different taxpayer, and as it did not incur the loss it cannot benefit from it. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Training course - whether “remunerative work” for purposes of transitional tax allowance Section KC 3 (section 50C, Income Tax Act 1976) - Transitional tax allowance: A home executive received a training benefit from New Zealand Income Support Service whilst attending a government-approved training course on child behav- iour. She has asked if the training course constitutes “remunerative work” as this will affect the amount of rebate she is able to claim under the transitional tax allowance. Section KC 3 allows a rebate for a “full-time earner” engaged in “remunerative work” for 20 hours per week or more, when the person’s income for the income year is less than $9,880. Section KC 3 (3) defines “remunerative work” as work from, by, or through the performing of which a person derives income. Although the taxpayer may have attended the course for more than 20 hours per week, in this case the rebate is not available because she does not meet the definition of a “full-time earner” contained in section KC 3. That definition requires a person to be engaged in remunerative work for not less than 20 hours per week. Study is not “remunerative work” as defined above, as the use of the word “work” in the definition implies that the remuneration must be received in return for actual personal services performed and not merely a training benefit paid for attending a training course. Shareholder-employee salaries and liability for ACC premiums Section OB 2 (2) (section 6(2), Income Tax Act 1976) - Meaning of “source deduction payment”: A tax practitioner has asked whether shareholder-em- ployee ND (no deduction) salaries are subject to ACC premiums when the business activity of the company is “passive”, for example, rents. Shareholder employee ND salaries are subject to premiums, regardless of the business activity of the company. Section OB 2 (1) defines the term “source deduction payment”, and section OB 2 (2) contains the circumstances in which payments to shareholder-employees are not source deduction payments. Clause 2 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance (Earnings Defini- tions) Regulations 1992 defines “earnings as an employee” to include payments which are not source deduction payments under section OB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. ACC premiums are payable on all earnings as an employee, which are defined as: • all source deduction payments; and • all payments which are excluded from the definition of source deduction payments by section OB 2 (2). It follows that shareholder-employee ND salaries are “earnings as an employee” for the purposes of imposing premiums under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. Depreciation - special economic rate Income Tax (Depreciation Determinations) Regulations 1993: A tax consultant has asked for details of the difference, if any, of a special economic rate of depre- ciation and a provisional economic rate of depreciation. If these involve a deter- mination, is there a fee payable? 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) The difference between a special economic rate and a provisional economic rate is that a special rate is issued to take account of the particular circumstances of a taxpayer in relation to an asset. As a result of these special circumstances, the useful life of that asset is longer or shorter than the useful life used by the Com- missioner in setting the general economic rate of depreciation for that class of asset and, therefore, the setting of a special rate is appropriate. The special rate is set for, and can only be used by, the taxpayer who made the application. A provisional economic rate may be set when no applicable general rate has been set by the Commissioner, and may apply to all taxpayers who own that particular class of property, not just to the taxpayer who makes an application for a rate. Fees are chargeable when a taxpayer applies for a special depreciation rate, but are not charged on applications for provisional depreciation rates. Applications for a provisional depreciation rate are made on form IR 260A. Applications for a special depreciation rate are made on form IR 260B, which includes details of the fees payable. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Grants and subsidies paid by the Crown and used for financial services Section 5(6D) - Payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy: A GST registered company received a government grant which it used to acquire shares in a subsidiary company. The grant money was also used to purchase new machin- ery, by the company making a loan to its subsidiary to enable that company to purchase the machinery. An agent for the company has submitted that GST does not have to be accounted for in this instance as: • The grant was used for financial services, which are exempt from GST. • Making exempt supplies is excluded from the definition of a “taxable activity”. She has sought a ruling from Inland Revenue. Under section 5(6D): .... where any payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy is made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority to - (a) Any person (not being a public authority) in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity; or (b) Any person for the benefit and on behalf of another person in relation to or in respect of that other person’s taxable activity, - that payment shall be deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods and services by the person to whom or for whose benefit the payment is made in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. “Taxable activity” is defined in section 6(1) as: (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: Excluded from that definition, at section 6(3)(d) is: Any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. In this instance the grant was used by the registered person for two purposes. Firstly, to acquire shares in a subsidiary company. This is not an exempt activity, continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) as purchasing the shares does not involve the “making” of exempt supplies. Rather, in this case, the exempt supplies are being received by the company. Secondly, making a loan to a subsidiary would normally be considered to be a financial service, and exempt from GST. However, in determining whether the grant is subject to GST it is necessary to examine the reason for the grant being made. In this case, the grant was given to enable the company to purchase new machinery for use in its taxable activity. The company chose to purchase that machinery by loaning the money to its subsidiary, rather than purchasing the machinery itself. That does not alter the initial rationale for receiving the grant. Therefore, the grant is considered to have been received in respect of the compa- ny’s taxable activity, and the recipient must account for GST on the value of the grant received. Valuation of goods for insurance purposes Section 5(13) - Indemnity payments: A taxpayer has asked if the value of goods covered by an insurance policy should be GST inclusive or GST exclusive. The amount of the premium is calculated on the value of the goods being insured. He has also asked how GST should be accounted for in the event of a claim being made against that policy. When an insurance policy is silent on whether the indemnity value includes or excludes GST, the value of the goods to be insured and whether or not that value includes GST are matters for negotiation between the parties to the insurance contract. Such negotiations do not come within the authority of the Act. Usually, for GST purposes premiums are calculated in one of two ways: • When the value of the goods to be insured under the policy excludes GST, GST is added to the premium. • When the goods are valued on a GST inclusive basis, the premium also in- cludes GST. Example Goods are valued at $10,000 (excluding GST). If the premium is 2.5% of the specified value, the premium will be $250, plus GST of $31.25. The total pre- mium is $281.25. If the goods are valued on a GST inclusive basis, the premium will be calculated on $11,250 (including GST) at 2.5%, being $281.25 - also including GST. Under section 5(13): ...where a registered person receives any indemnity payment pursuant to a contract of insurance, that payment shall, to the extent that it relates to a loss incurred in the course of making a taxable supply, be deemed to be consideration received for a supply of services performed on the day of receipt of that indemnity payment by that registered person in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. When a claim is made against a policy, for an asset that is part of a taxable activity and for which a GST exclusive value has been specified, the insurance company will add GST to the indemnity payment. The insurance company will make an input tax claim in its relevant GST return to recover the GST portion of the payment. The policy holder will return the GST received as output tax in the return covering the time of receipt of the payment. When the value is GST inclusive, one-ninth of the payment will be GST. The insurance company will make an input tax claim, and the policy holder will return the output tax as above. from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) As already stated, the value of the goods being insured, and whether any claim should include GST, is a matter for negotiation between the insurance company and the policyholder. When taxpayers are uncertain of their position, they should check with their particular insurance company. Medical services supplied to non-resident Section 11(2)(e) - Zero-rated services: A representative of a non-resident medical insurance company has asked if the supply of surgical services, performed in New Zealand by a New Zealand resident on a non-resident patient, may be zero-rated for GST purposes. Under section 11(2)(e), the supply of services is charged at zero percent when: The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed... For this provision to apply, the services must be supplied “for and to” the non- resident. Inland Revenue considers that the word “for” means the service must be supplied for the benefit of the person to whom the supply is made. In this instance, the surgical services are being supplied for the benefit of the patient, who will be in New Zealand at the time the service is performed. The time the service is performed relates to the actual performance of the serv- ice, rather than the time of supply as defined in section 9. We advised the non-resident medical insurance company that the fee for provid- ing surgical services to a non-resident in New Zealand is not zero-rated. The supply of such services is subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5%. Power supply to farm - input tax deduction Section 20 - Calculation of tax payable: A GST registered person has purchased a block of land in an isolated area on which he will farm dry stock. He has to pay the full cost of installing power lines to the property, which will supply electric- ity for electric fencing and water pumps. In the near future he plans to erect a number of buildings on the property, including a farm residence. He has asked if he can claim an input tax deduction for the full amount of the installation cost of the power lines, and if so, whether the private use adjustment he will have to make for the private use of the power used in the residence must include the installation cost. Under section 20(3), a deduction may be made of the input tax paid or incurred by a registered person during a taxable period. “Input tax” is defined in section 2 as: Tax charged under section 8(1) of this Act on the supply of goods and services made to that person:........ being in any case goods or services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 20(2) requires the registered person to hold a tax invoice (or debit or credit note) for the supply, at the time the GST return which includes that sup- ply is filed. No tax invoice is required if the value of the goods or services sup- plied is less than $50, or the input tax claim is for secondhand goods. In this case, provided he obtains a tax invoice, the registered person can claim an input tax deduction for the full value of the costs incurred in installing the power lines to the property. continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) In calculating the private use adjustment required under section 21(1), the tax- payer need only be concerned with the power used in the residence, (plus any supply charges that may be included in the power account). He will not need to include the installation costs in the calculation. However, when building the farm residence, the cost of connecting it to the established power supply will be a private expense for which no input tax deduction may be claimed. Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Honorarium - ACC premiums payable Sections 102 and 114 - Premiums payable by earners who have earnings other than as an employee: A taxpayer who is an employee and has PAYE and ACC earner premiums deducted from her wages has recently become a Community Board member. She has asked if she must pay ACC premiums on the hono- rarium she receives. People who receive payments as Community Board members are subject to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. Under those regulations, such payments are subject to the deduction of withholding tax, rather than PAYE deductions. For ACC purposes, recipients of withholding payments are treated as being self- employed. They must calculate and pay both employer and earner ACC premi- ums when they complete their tax returns. The premiums are payable at the same time as any terminal tax, i.e., by 7 February of the following year if the taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. from page 35 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Land acquired for purpose of erecting dwellinghouses - whether exempt from stamp duty Rating:•••• Case:Howick Parklands Limited v CIR M No.1191/94 Act:Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 - section 24(1)(b) Keywords:conveyance duty, subdivision, residential sections, purpose Summary:The High Court held that a developer who acquired land for subdivision with the purpose of having dwellinghouses erected was exempt from conveyance duty. The exemption will only apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that the dwellinghouses will be erected as soon as practicable after the date the instru- ment of conveyance is signed. It does not matter who builds the dwellinghouses nor does it matter if the developer does not own the land when the dwellinghouses are built. Facts:The objector subdivided land for residential purposes and sold both vacant sections and sections with dwellinghouses erected on them prior to sale. Sale agreements of vacant sections contained a condition that purchasers start build- ing approved dwellings within a specified time limit - usually two or three years. Such conditions were inserted as a means of promoting sales and enhanc- ing sale prices. Issue:The issue in this case was whether the conveyance duty exemption under sec- tion 24 (1)(b) for land acquired “for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it” is available to developers who acquire land for residential subdivi- sion and sell vacant sections to purchasers who have agreed to erect a dwellinghouse. Decision:Justice Fisher held that the objector’s purpose when purchasing the land was the relevant purpose for the conveyance duty exemption. His Honour considered the meaning of “having a dwellinghouse erected on it” in section 24(1)(b). Justice Fisher held that the phrase was satisfied if “at the time of acquisition the taxpayer had the purpose of exercising some form of power or control over others to require them to erect a dwellinghouse on the land”. He also noted that this requirement would be satisfied if at the time of acquisition continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) the objector had “the purpose of entering into a contract which will require the other party to the contract to cause a dwellinghouse to be erected on the land, whether that other party erects it personally or in turn enters into another con- tract requiring erection by somebody else.” In considering the meaning of the word “purpose” in section 24(1)(b), Justice Fisher accepted in a revenue context, that “purpose” was concerned with the course of action proposed by the taxpayer, not the reasons for that course of action. Justice Fisher concluded that the objector acquired the land for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it, and the objector was entitled to the ex- emption from conveyance duty under section 24(1)(b). Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Whether sale of properties acquired for residential letting constitutes a taxable activity Rating:••• Case:TRA No 93/144 and 94/24 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 6, 8, 14(c) Keywords:taxable activity, residential rental properties, property investment or dealing Summary:Taxpayers who continuously and regularly sell a large number of houses which were acquired for residential property letting are not carrying on a taxable activity of property dealing or investment if they sell the properties to reduce the size of their property letting activity. In this situation the sales form part of the exempt activity of supplying residential rental accommodation. Facts:The taxpayers in this case are a husband and wife partnership and their private company. From 1984 to 1989 the taxpayers bought a large number of houses to let as rental properties and as a long term investment to provide a superannua- tion scheme for their retirement. However, once they had bought the houses the taxpayers had cashflow problems. To overcome this, they sold some of the houses to obtain cash and others to buy a clothing business. The business did not perform well so they sold more properties and put the money into the busi- ness. They sold 20 houses within a two and a half year period. The objectors submitted that the sales were part of the activity of supplying residential accommodation and therefore exempt from GST. Alternatively they argued that the sales were excluded from GST because they were part of a recreational pursuit or hobby. The Commissioner submitted that each property was sold in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of supplying dwellings to third parties for investment purposes. Decision:The taxpayers were not carrying out the taxable activity of property dealing or investment. They were carrying out the activity of domestic property letting, and in selling the houses they were reducing the size of their property letting activity. Residential property letting is an exempt supply under section 14(c). Selling the houses used for residential property letting was not a taxable activity because section 6(3)(d) excludes from the term “taxable activity” any activity to the extent to which it involves the making of exempt supplies. Judge Barber rejected the taxpayers’ submission that the sale of the properties was part of recreational activity and therefore exempt under section 6(3)(a). Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. from page 37 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Partnership income and expenditure and loan remission Rating:••• Case:Cooper v CIR M No.686/94 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 64F, 104 (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections EH 4, BB 7) Keywords:remission, capital, incurred Summary:The Court disallowed a partner’s attempted deduction for expenditure because it was of a capital nature, and because it was not incurred by the partner, but by partners of a previous partnership. On a second issue the Court ruled that a loan to the partnership was remitted when, as provided for in the loan agreement, the amount ceased to be payable by virtue of the lender’s insolvency. Accordingly, the partners had remission income under section 64F. Facts:The taxpayer was a partner in a goat and deer farming partnership. The partner- ship started before 1 October 1987, but the taxpayer did not join the partnership until September 1988. Before the partner joined the partnership the partnership incurred expenditure for: • embryo transplant work • deer and goat leasing • farming and breeding of goats and deer. The Commissioner allowed the partner a deduction for leasing, grazing and breeding of deer, as it was partially incurred after the partner joined the partner- ship. The amounts purportedly deducted were added back to the partner’s 1988 tax assessment. The partnership owed Woodstock Investments Limited (WIL) a sum of $2,600,000. The loan agreement between the partnership and WIL provided that the sum would cease to be owing in a number of situations, including WIL becoming insolvent. WIL became insolvent and the liability to pay the debt ceased immediately. The Commissioner treated the loan as remitted, and added a share of the remission income to the partner’s 1991 tax assessment. The case was a test case under section 33A of the Income Tax Act 1976. The objections of the other 37 partners in the taxpayer’s partnership are subject to the decision in this case. Decision:Justice Cartwright found for the Commissioner on both issues. The partner was not entitled to any more of a deduction for his share of partner- ship expenditure than he had already received. There were two reasons for this. • First, the partnership expenditure the partner sought to deduct was incurred before he joined the partnership. As a matter of law, the entry or exit of partners from a partnership dissolves the existing partnership and constitutes a new partnership. The expenditure of the previous partnership was not incurred by the new partnership, and was not deductible by the partners of the new partnership. • Second, Her Honour found that the expenditure the partner sought to deduct was expenditure of a capital nature, and hence non-deductible. The Commissioner also succeeded on the remission issue. The debt between the original partnership and WIL, although entered before the constitution of the new partnership, had attached to the new partnership. On the construction of the loan agreement, Her Honour found that the obligation to repay the loan continued on page 40 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) ceased on WIL becoming insolvent. That meant that the loan was remitted and the base price adjustment under section 64F(2) triggered. The remission was without fully adequate consideration. The income from the base price adjust- ment was properly attributed to the partners of the partnership. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether payments made for restraint of trade Rating:••• Case:Henwood v CIR CA 300/93 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:revenue/capital distinction, restraint of trade, apportionment Summary:Payments under a restraint of trade agreement made to an actor for television commercials were capital payments, and non-assessable. Facts:The taxpayer was a well-known actor. He had entered into an agreement that in consideration of certain payments, he would appear in the two commercials and would not be associated with the promotion of other similar products for the period during which he received payments. He received $25,000 in the first year and $17,500 in the second year. The Commissioner did not accept that these payments were of a capital nature, and a case was stated to the TRA. The TRA held that $5,000 of the fee was for acting services, and the remainder was in respect of the restraint of trade agree- ment. On appeal, the High Court held that the payments were not referable to the restraint of trade agreement. The taxpayer appealed. Decision:By a majority, the Court of Appeal held that the payments received by the taxpayer were of a dual nature. They were referable both to the performance of acting services and to the restraint of trade provision. The Court of Appeal followed the apportionment of the payment (between the acting services and the restraint of trade provision) that the TRA had made. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Flower bulbs and tubers - whether cost deductible as revenue expenditure Rating:•• Case:TRA Nos. 93/215 and 94/135 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - Sections 85, 104 and 106(1)(a) (Income Tax Act 1994 - EE 1, BB 7, BB 8 (a)). Keywords:bulbs, tubers, revenue or capital Summary:The taxpayer’s expenditure for bulbs and tubers was incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or was necessarily incurred in carrying on a busi- ness for that purpose. The expenditure was deductible as a revenue item. Facts:The taxpayer was a small company carrying on business as a flower farmer. It claimed a deduction for $32,931.80 for the purchase of flower bulbs for lilies in the year ended 31 March 1990. The taxpayer also claimed a deduction for ex- penditure on the purchase of lily bulbs of $2,424.42 for the year ended 31 March 1990 and $3,443 for the year ended 31 March 1991. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions. from page 39 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Decision:Judge Barber held that the Commissioner had acted incorrectly in disallowing the deductions for the purchase of bulbs and tubers. The expenditure for bulbs and tubers was incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or was necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. The expenditure was deductible as a revenue item. Based on the facts of the case Judge Barber concluded that: • In the context of the change in character of the bulbs and tubers, the hazards of flower growing and their short lifespan, the initial stock cannot be re- garded as representing an enduring benefit to the taxpayers, or the expendi- ture relating to a business structure. • The payments cannot realistically be regarded as being made once and for all. • The bulbs and tubers were items turned over in the course of making profits. This concept is more akin to a revenue outlay, or circulating capital or stock in trade, than fixed capital. Judge Barber considered it significant that, one way or another, the seed or bulbs or tubers or plants changed form and character each season. It was not necessary for Judge Barber to consider whether the expenditure was for trading stock or whether bulbs and tubers in the ground at balance date are included within the scope of the definition of trading stock or must be brought to account as assessable income. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Land subdivision development - whether accrual rules apply to costs Rating:•••• Case:Thornton Estates Limited v CIR Unreported CP 135/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 85, 104, 104A (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections OB 1, BB 7 and EF 1) Keywords:subdivision costs, development expenses, trading stock, used Summary:Land subdivision development expenses can be claimed as deductions but the value of the land and expenditure in developing the land must be brought into account as a revenue item for tax purposes. Facts:The objector carried on business as a property developer. In August 1991, it purchased a block of land for subdivisional development. The subdivisional development started soon after, with earthworks being physically started in September 1991. A few sections were sold in the year ended 31 March 1992, and the main sales occurred later. In its return for the year ended 31 March 1992, the objector claimed deductions for the cost of the land, development costs and other miscellaneous expenses directly attributable to using the land. The objector did not bring into account the value of the land, or any expenditure on developing the land, as a revenue item for tax purposes. Decision:The judgment dealt with the following issues: (a) Whether the cost of buying the land and of subsequent development by the objector in the income year ended 31 March 1992 was deductible in that year under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976, even though a sale of that land or part of it would not arise until a subsequent income year. continued on page 42 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) (b) If so, what impact (if any) did section 104A (the accrual regime) have on the tax deduction permitted by section 104. (c) General income tax, accountancy and commercial principles require a devel- oper to treat land as if it is trading stock, to bring the cost of the land and any associated development costs to account at balance date as a revenue item, and to hold them on revenue account until the land is sold. The question arises as to whether the general principles are overridden by the specific statutory directive contained in section 85(1) of the Act, that for the purposes of section 85, land is not trading stock. Justice Hansen first reviewed some general principles of statutory interpretation. The scheme and purpose of legislation need to be considered. Then, if the words of the Act are clear, they must be followed, even if they lead to a manifest ab- surdity. But if the words of an Act have two possible interpretations they are not clear, and if one interpretation leads to an absurdity and the other does not, the Court will adopt the one which does not lead to an absurdity. Cost of land and development deductible On the first issue, Justice Hansen found that the objector incurred expenditure in connection with the acquisition and development of the land. The objector was therefore entitled to tax deductions for that expenditure under section 104 Cost of land and development subject to accrual regime The next question was whether the cost of buying the land and subsequent development expenditure was subject to the accrual rules of section 104A. This revolved around the question of whether the expenditure could be divided into an expired portion and an unexpired portion. Once the unexpired portion was identified, sections 104A(3) and (4) provided that only the expired portion of the relevant accrual expenditure may be claimed as a deduction in a particular year. The objector contended that all the land developed by it was “used” in the production of assessable income for the year ended 31 March 1992 in the sense that it had all been actively committed to and engaged in that production. Justice Hansen held that even though this interpretation was consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word “used”, its application would defeat the scheme and purpose of the legislation. The legislation should be interpreted in accord- ance with its purpose, which was to achieve tax symmetry by the matching of income and expenditure. He ruled that the cost of purchasing the land and subsequent development expenditure was subject to the accrual rules of section 104A and should be brought into account as revenue items. Land as trading stock On the third question, the Judge agreed with Justice Tipping in Murray Darnill Ltd v TRA (1994) 16 NZTC 11,126 that section 85(1) of the Act did not mean that land should be excluded from the concept of trading stock for all purposes. The land of a developer is trading stock and should be treated as revenue rather than as a capital item. However, by definition, land is not trading stock for the pur- poses of section 104A. Comment:The taxpayer is appealing this decision. from page 41 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Management fees and entertainment expenses - whether capital or revenue expenditure Rating:•• Case:TRA 94/71 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - ss 104, 106 (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 7, BB 8) Keywords:management fees, entertainment expenditure, capital, income Summary:The Authority found as a fact that certain management fees paid by the taxpayer were in connection with the taxpayer’s business income earning process and were deductible. However, the taxpayer had not proved that certain entertain- ment expenditure was in connection with its income earning process as distinct from its activity to earn exempt income or increase an investment of capital. This expenditure was therefore not deductible. Facts:The taxpayer company was set up by two friends to undertake media ventures. One undertook the executive work while the other was a sleeping partner. The executive partner spent a considerable amount of time in creating, assessing and pursuing production ventures for the taxpayer but none came to fruition. Funds were lodged with the taxpayer so that it could better fund its projects. However, after the sleeping partner had to withdraw for financial reasons, the taxpayer effectively ceased functioning and used the funds for a takeover of shares in a radio company. Decision:Judge Barber’s findings were as follows: Management fees Management fees paid by the taxpayer to the company of the executive partner related to management time spent by the executive partner for the taxpayer in working on projects of a media nature. The work was not preliminary to and investigatory of starting a business (which would have made the expenditure of a capital nature) but work which was preliminary to and investigatory of business projects. The fact that the work ceased before it came into income made no difference. It was not necessary for a project to get past development proposals and feasibility studies for those activities to be part of an income earning process by the tax- payer. However, Judge Barber noted that income or profit resulting from the activity was a very significant factor to be taken into account in ascertaining whether a business has existed. The fees had no relationship to the executive’s work for the taxpayer aimed at deriving dividend or exempt income for the taxpayer from the radio station company. (If the fees had been so related, they would not have been deductible. This was because the income from the radio station company would have been exempt as an intercompany dividend.) Also, the management fees did not relate to the share takeover of the radio station (which would have been of a capital nature). Entertainment expenditure The taxpayer had not proved that certain entertainment expenditure was in- curred in connection with the income-earning process, and this expenditure was not deductible. Comment:Neither Inland Revenue nor the taxpayer is appealing this decision 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Whether taxpayer had a right of objection to notice issued under section 276 Rating:••• Case:Instant Finance Corporation (1987) Limited v CIR CP 325/94 Act:Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1974 - regulation 5(3) Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 2, 12, 19, 26, 266, 268, 269, 272(2) and 276 (Income Tax Act 1994 - OB 1, HK 1, HK 3, HK, 4, HK 5, HK 11 and Tax Administration Act 1994 - sec- tions 44, 92, 114) Keywords:judicial review, assessment, objection Summary:The High Court allowed the applicant’s request for a judicial review and over- turned the decision of the Taxation Review Authority in Case 65 (1992) 14 NZTC. The High Court directed that the Commissioner’s decision to disallow the objec- tion to an assessment under section 276 be reviewed. Facts:On 29 March 1990 the Commissioner gave notice to Instant Finance Corporation (1987) Limited (“the applicant”) that it was invoking section 276 to recover outstanding tax of $652,689.56. This tax had been earlier assessed to Instant Finance Co Limited (“the original company”) and the Commissioner held that the applicant was liable for the tax of the original company under section 276. The applicant objected to the assessments issued on the grounds that section 276 did not apply. The Commissioner treated the notice as a valid objection and disallowed the objection in full. On 20 November 1990 the applicant requested that the objection be considered by the TRA. The Commissioner noted the re- quest to state a case. On 27 June 1991 the Commissioner advised the applicant it had no right to object to the notice, as invoking section 276 did not amount to an “assessment”. The applicant applied to the TRA for an order allowing its objection under regulation 5(3) of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1974 on the grounds that the Commissioner had not as required by regulation 5(1), filed its case within six months of the applicant filing its case. The TRA found for the Commissioner and held that regulation 5(3) could not apply because the Commissioner was not required to issue an assessment against the applicant as the tax always remained the liability of the original company. Issue:The issue here is whether the applicant had a right of objection in its capacity as a “new company” under section 276 of the Act. Decision:The High Court found for the applicant and allowed the application for judicial review. Justice Barker directed the TRA to hear and determine the applicant’s application under regulation 5(3) for an order allowing its objection. His Honour held that the liability of the applicant, as deemed agent of the origi- nal company, was imposed by section 276. This liability must be quantified either by reference to a previous assessment or by a determination by the Com- missioner of an assessment of the original company. His Honour considered it would be illogical if under section 276(3) a new com- pany could have objection rights if the original company’s tax liability had not been assessed but, no objection rights if the original company’s tax liability had already crystallised. Justice Barker also considered justice required that the applicant be given the opportunity to challenge the Commissioner’s application of section 276. His Honour thought it would not be stretching the legislation to contend that the notice issued under section 276 is an assessment of the new company, in a limited way. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. 45 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Shareholder remuneration - whether remuneration paid is excessive Rating:••• Case:G S Matthews (Chemist) Ltd v CIR M 1542/93 Troon Place Investments Ltd v CIR M 1541/93 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 190 (Income Tax Act 1994 - section GD 5) Keywords:excessive remuneration, deemed dividend Summary:The High Court considered the issue of excessive shareholder remuneration for the purpose of section 190. The High Court found that the remuneration allocated by G S Matthews (Chem- ist) Ltd (Matthews Chemist) to the shareholder-employees was not excessive for the purpose of section 190. However, the remuneration allocated by Troon Place Investments Ltd (Troon Investments) was found to be excessive. Facts:The objector companies are related proprietary companies with common share- holders. Matthews Chemist carries on the business of retail pharmacists and chemists. In the 1990 and 1991 income years it claimed deductions for shareholder remunera- tion of $104,990 and $128,698 respectively. Troon Investments is a property investment company, leasing commercial properties. Its sole source of income is from rents. In the 1990 and 1991 income years it claimed deductions for shareholder remuneration of $27,494 and $34,062 respectively. During the periods under objection the shareholders went on an extended overseas holiday. In their absence they appointed a manager to take over the pharmacy business and gave power of attorney to their accountant. The Commissioner amended the taxable income of each company, and disal- lowed a substantial portion of the remuneration paid to the shareholders. Both companies objected to the assessments issued on the grounds that the Commis- sioner had incorrectly treated the shareholder remuneration as deemed divi- dends. Issue:The issue was whether the Commissioner acted correctly in amending the as- sessment for each company and treating the shareholder remuneration as exces- sive for the purpose of section 190. Decision:Justice Tompkins held that the proviso to section 190 did not apply to both objectors as all three of the paragraphs to the proviso had not been satisfied. He found that the shareholders were not employed substantially full time in the business of either company while they were away overseas, even though they had participated in the administration and management of each company. Justice Tompkins rejected the Commissioner’s view that remuneration should be determined by reference only to the services rendered during the period to which section 190 applied. Justice Tompkins held that the Commissioner should consider services rendered during prior periods to determine if the remunera- tion for a particular tax year is reasonable. In each case it will be a matter of fact and degree whether the remuneration reasonably reflects the services per- formed. In the case of Matthews Chemist, Justice Tompkins said that “the excellent results achieved during the two years in question, as well as the 1989 year, were the products of the time, efforts and business and entrepreneurial skills both continued on page 46 46 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) \[shareholders\] had put into the business during the preceding years, as well as their contribution during those two years.” Accordingly, Justice Tompkins found in favour of Matthews Chemist and held that the remuneration allocated to the two shareholders was reasonable. Justice Tompkins reached a different conclusion for Troon Investments. He considered that the method used by the Commissioner was appropriate in calculating a reasonable assessment of shareholder remuneration. He did not think that the shareholders’ entrepreneurial skill and judgment over the preced- ing years played a real role in the derivation of the company’s rental income in the years in dispute. Justice Tompkins confirmed that the Commissioner had acted correctly in treating shareholder remuneration as excessive for the purpose of section 190. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. from page 45 47 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995) Proposed guidelines on taxation of specific allowances The legislation setting out the tax treatment of allow- ances paid to employees was modified as of 1 April 1995. We explained the impact of these changes on page 7 of TIB Volume Six, No. 12 (May 1995). We have also drafted a TIB item outlining the general tax treatment of allowances, and hope to publish it in the near future. We plan to issue guidelines on how to calculate the tax liability of specific types of allowances paid to employ- ees. These guidelines will indicate what the Commis- sioner will generally accept as satisfying the statutory tests for: • the conditions justifying the payment of an allowance • the amount of the allowance that would be accepted as a reimbursement of expenditure without proof being provided • proof of the expenditure. Suggestions invited We are presently considering the classes of allowances for which we should provide guidelines. The proposed allowances include those relating to the following: • telephones• out of pocket expenses • transfers• cleaning • overtime meals• tools • accommodation• clothing • travel (home to work)•entertainment • travel (business)• home offices We would like to hear from you if you have any views on the types of allowances people need guidance on so that we can decide on priority areas. It would be useful if you could also provide the following details on these allowances: the rate of payment, the amount of tax free reimbursement, the number of people receiving the allowance, and the conditions under which an employer pays those allowances. We are also interested in your views on what should be the correct amount of the tax free allowance, and what conditions should justify the payment of a tax free allowance. Please send your submissions, by 24 September 1995, to: Director (Rulings) National Office Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON.

GST: Secondhand goods input tax deduction for forestry rights Public ruling - BR Pub 95/3 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (the definition of “input tax” at paragraph (c) and the definition of “secondhand goods”) and 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a GST registered person acquires a forestry right by way of sale and the sale is a non-taxable supply. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the sale of forestry rights where the time of supply occurs between 1 October 1995 and 30 September 1998. The ruling A forestry right can be a secondhand good for GST purposes, for which an input tax deduction may be available (within the section 2(1) definition of “input tax”, paragraph (c), and section 20(3)). For an input tax deduction to be available, the supply of the forestry right must be a non-taxable supply, must be by way of sale, and must be acquired by the recipient for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The forestry right must be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. To be “secondhand” the forestry right must have been used by at least one previous owner for its intrinsic purpose. If an input tax deduction is available, it is limited to the extent that a payment is made for the supply during the rel- evant taxable period. This ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of September 1995. Jeffrey Tyler Director (Rulings) Analysis starts on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Analysis of the ruling This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background We have been asked to clarify whether a GST registered person who buys a forestry right by way of a non-taxable supply may make a secondhand goods input tax deduc- tion. It has been unclear whether a forestry right can be a secondhand good. Legislation Section 2(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 defines “forestry right” (for the purposes of that Act): “Forestry right” means a right granted by the grantor of any land to any other person to- (a) Establish, maintain, and harvest; or (b) Maintain and harvest,- a crop of trees on that land, together with- (c) Any ancillary rights of access and of constructing and using such tracks, culverts, bridges, buildings, and other works and facilities as may be necessary to establish, maintain, and harvest or, as the case may be, to maintain and harvest that crop; and (d) Any provisions for charges, payments, royalties, or division of the crop or the proceeds of the crop,- whether or not such rights or provisions are coupled with an obligation; but no such right shall be capable of conferring a right of exclusive possession of that land. Section 3(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 states: Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, every forestry right shall be deemed to be a profit à prendre Section 2(1) defines “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money. Section 2(1)(c) defines “input tax” in relation to second- hand goods: “Input tax”, in relation to a registered person, means- (c) Any amount equal to the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time of supply within the meaning of section 9 or any other provision of this Act) of the consideration in money for the supply, being a supply by way of sale that is not a taxable supply, to a registered person of any secondhand goods situated in New Zealand,- being in any case goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 20(3) allows deductions from output tax. Section 20(3) states: Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period- (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- ... (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” in section 2(1) of this Act applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: ... (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(a)(a) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: Application of legislation Under sections 2(1) and 20(3), seven conditions must be met before the purchase of a forestry right by a GST registered person will permit a secondhand goods input tax deduction: • Forestry rights must be “goods” as defined in sec- tion 2(1). • The supply of a forestry right must be by way of sale. • The supply of the forestry right must be a non-taxable supply. • The sale must involve payment in the taxable period for which an input tax deduction is sought. • The forestry right must be secondhand. • The forestry right must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. • The forestry right must be situated in New Zealand at the time of sale. The following paragraphs consider some of these requirements. “Goods” The Commissioner considers that a forestry right (as defined in section 2(1) of the Forestry Rights Registra- tion Act 1983) is a “good” for GST purposes. “Goods” means all real and personal property. Section 3(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 deems forestry rights to be profits à prendre. This confirms the com- 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) mon law position that a forestry right is a profit à prendre. A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. A profit à prendre is an interest in land. It is not a chose in action because the rights under a profit à prendre are of a possessory nature, whereas a chose in action can only be enforced by action. Accordingly, a forestry right is real property and a “good” for GST purposes. “Sale” A secondhand goods input tax deduction is only avail- able where there is a supply by way of sale. Forestry rights are a form of transferable property right, like other profits à prendre, and may be sold. It will be a question of fact whether there has been a sale rather than a lease or sub-grant of a forestry right. Because of the definition of “input tax” paragraph (c), a second- hand goods input tax deduction is available only where there is a sale. The sale must be by way of a non-taxable supply for an input tax deduction to be available. “Payment” An input tax deduction is only available to the extent that there has been payment for the goods in the rel- evant taxable period. Therefore, if there is a sale by instalments, input tax deductions will be available only in the taxable period in which each instalment is paid. “Secondhand” The forestry right must be “secondhand” before an input tax deduction is available. The Commissioner considers that land is a secondhand good. This is supported by case law, for example, Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,105. The Court of Appeal decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 appears to have confirmed this view, notwithstanding obiter dicta that land may not be a secondhand good in L R McLean v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211 (CA) and King v Bennetts (1994) 16 NZTC 11,370. However, when a specific interest in land, like a forestry right, is newly created, it is a unique mix of rights distinct from the original land over which it was created. Accordingly, the original grant of a forestry right cannot be a sale of secondhand goods. The forestry right is a new item of property. Before a forestry right can be a secondhand good, at least one prior owner must have made use of the right for its intrinsic purpose, L R McLean v CIR (CA). Example The following example does not form part of the ruling. Purchaser is a GST registered person who intends to enter the forestry industry in a small way. On 1 July 1996 he buys a forestry right from Supplier, who is not registered for GST. Supplier had bought the right 18 months earlier from a farmer who had decided not to diversify into forestry. Supplier had used the right on a small scale to remove a small amount of timber. The purchase price is $20,000 payable in four quarterly instalments. The first payment is made on 1 August 1996. Purchaser is entitled to a secondhand goods input tax deduction because the forestry right was dis- posed of by sale, the seller was unregistered (non- taxable supply), the forestry right was secondhand, and Purchaser acquired the right for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In Purchaser’s next GST return (for the two months ending 31 August 1996) he should deduct as input tax the tax fraction of the amount of the first instalment ($5,000). Accordingly, he may deduct $555.55. Companies claiming an income tax deduction for gifts of money Public ruling - BR Pub 95/4 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section DJ 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a company other than a “close company” makes gifts of money to any of the organisations listed in section KC 5 (1). The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to gifts of money made during the 1996, 1997, and 1998 income years, and applies to taxpayers with standard, early, or late balance dates for these years. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Section DJ 4 applies when a company other than a “close company” makes gifts of money to any society, institution, organisation, trust, or fund of the kinds listed in section KC 5 (1). Section DJ 4 allows the company to claim a deduction for these gifts. The maximum amount that can be claimed is calculated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of section DJ 4 and is based on the company’s “assessable income”. A donation by an individual donor to a society, institu- tion, organisation, trust, or fund of the kinds listed in section KC 5 (1), entitles the donor to the charitable donations rebate, subject to the receipting requirements of section KC 5 (3) being met. Section DJ 4 superseded section 147 of the Income Tax Act 1976 with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. Section 147 was amended from 1 July 1994 as part of the taxation amendments resulting from the reform of company law. Up to 1 July 1994, section 147 applied to “public companies”. Following the amendment, section 147 applied to any company other than a “close company”. There has been some uncertainty over the operation of subparagraphs (a)(i) and (b)(ii) of section DJ 4. In subparagraph (b)(ii) it is stated that the assessable income used to calculate the maximum total deduction for all gifts is the company’s assessable income before any deduction is allowed under section DJ 4. However, there is no statement to that effect in subparagraph (a)(i) when calculating the maximum deduction for gifts made to any one donee. There has also been some uncertainty over whether the term “assessable income” means the company’s total income before or after allowable deductions. The ruling considers whether the maximum deduction available to a company other than a close company is based on the company’s “assessable income” having been calculated before or after: • The deduction for the gifts of money; and • The deduction of other allowable expenses from the total gross income. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DJ 4147 KC 5 (1)56A(2) Section DJ 4 states: Subject to this section, any company (not being a close company) shall, in calculating the assessable income derived by it in any income year, be entitled to deduct the amount of any gift of money (being an amount that is not deductible otherwise than under this section) made to any society, institution, organisation, trust, or fund of any of the kinds referred to in section KC 5 (1): Provided that the amount of the deduction under this section - (a) In respect of the aggregate of all gifts made in that income year by any company (not being a close company) to any one donee, shall not exceed the greater of - (i) One percent of the company’s assessable income; or (ii)$4,000; and (b) In respect of the aggregate of all gifts made in that income year by any company (not being a close company), shall not exceed - (i) The sum of $1,000; or (ii) 5% of the assessable income (being the assessable income before any deduction is allowed under this section) derived by the company (not being a close company) in that year, - whichever is the greater. Section OB 1 defines the term “close company”: Means, at any time, a company in respect of which at that time there are 5 or fewer natural persons (with any natural person and all natural persons who are associated at the time with the natural person being treated as one natural person for this purpose)- (i) The aggregate of whose voting interests in the company exceeds 50%; or from page 3 The ruling The “assessable income” figure used for the purposes of calculating a deduction for gifts of money by a company under section DJ 4 subparagraphs (a)(i) and (b)(ii) is the company’s total income less allowable deductions (excluding the deduction for the gifts). This ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of September 1995. Jeffrey Tyler Director (Rulings) Analysis of the ruling 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) (ii) In any case where at the time a market value circumstance exists in respect of the company, the aggregate of whose market value interests in the company exceeds 50%;- but does not include a special corporate entity. Application of legislation Section DJ 4 determines the amount that can be de- ducted with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1995-96 and subsequent income years by companies other than close companies for gifts of money to any of the organisations listed in section KC 5 (1). The maximum deduction that may be claimed is: (a) In respect of gifts to any one donee, the greater of: (i) 1% of the company’s assessable income; or (ii) $4,000. (b) In respect of the overall deduction claim, the greater of: (i) $1,000; or (ii) 5% of the company’s assessable income. Maximum deduction The Commissioner’s view is that a company’s assess- able income for the purposes of both subparagraphs (a)(i) and (b)(ii) of section DJ 4 is the assessable income before a deduction for the gifts of money is allowed. This ensures that the “assessable income” figure used to calculate the maximum deduction is the same under both subparagraphs (a)(i) and (b)(ii). Meaning of “assessable income” The Commissioner considers that the phrase “assessable income” in section DJ 4 means the total income of the company less allowable deductions. Example This example does not form part of the ruling. During the year ended 31 March 1996 Company A Ltd, which is not a close company, makes gifts of money to the following approved donee organisa- tions: • Red Cross$2,000 • Amnesty International$2,500 • Leprosy Mission $5,000 $9,500 Company A Ltd derives assessable income in the 1996 income year (after allowable deductions but before the deduction for gifts) of $150,000. The maximum amounts that can be claimed by Com- pany A Ltd for the gifts of money are: (a) In respect of donations to any one donee, the greater of: (i)$1,500 (1% of Company A Ltd’s assess- able income); or (ii) $4,000. In this case, a maximum deduction of $4,000 may be claimed in respect of each donee. (b) In respect of the overall deduction claim, the greater of: (i)$1,000; or (ii) $7,500 (5% of Company A Ltd’s assess- able income). In this case, a maximum overall deduction of $7,500 may be claimed. Company A Ltd’s deduction for the gift of $5,000 to the Leprosy Mission is limited to $4,000 under subparagraph (a)(ii). The excess of $1,000 is not deductible. The overall deduction that Company A Ltd can claim for the gifts is limited to $7,500 under subparagraph (b)(ii).

Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. Retraining payments made on employment termination - assessability Summary This item sets out the income tax treatment of retraining payments made by an employer to an employee on the termination of employment. When the employer makes retraining payments instead of a redundancy payment, the payments are assessable as monetary remuneration of the former employee and the employer must deduct PAYE. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background When an employee’s employment is terminated, an employer may agree to continue to pay the former employee’s salary while he or she attends an educa- tional institution, instead of making a redundancy payment. The Act provides an income tax exemption for scholar- ships and bursaries. If the retraining payments are paid as maintenance or allowances for attending an educa- tional institution, as a scholarship or bursary, they will be exempt from income tax. If the retraining payments are not bursaries, the exemption will not apply and the payments will be assessable under section BB 4 (b) as monetary remuneration received in respect of employ- ment. The taxation of redundancy payments is dealt with on page 2 of TIB Volume Four, No.4 (November 1992). Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 4 (b)65(2)(b) CB 9 (d)61(37) NC 2338 NC 16355 OB 1 “extra emolument”, 2 “monetary remuneration” OB 2 (1)6(1) Section OB 1 defines “salary or wages” as including: ... salary, wages, or allowances ... in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person ... The section OB 1 definition of “monetary remunera- tion” includes salary and wages received in respect of or in relation to the employment of the taxpayer. Monetary remuneration is assessable income under section BB 4 (b). Section CB 9 (d) provides a tax exemption for: Income derived by any person from any maintenance or allowance provided for or paid to that person in respect of his or her attendance at an educational institution in terms of a scholarship or bursary other than a basic grant or an independ- ent circumstances grant made under regulations made under section 193 of the Education Act 1964, section 303 of the Education Act 1989, or any enactment in substitution for those sections: Policy In the Court of appeal case Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176, 5,184 Justice Richardson stated that the essential question, in determining whether a payment is a bursary, concerns the true character of the sums re- ceived by the recipient. The Court said that the charac- ter of the payment was to be found from a consideration of all the circumstances. The Commissioner considers that the true character of retraining payments received by an employee on the termination of employment is that they are an alterna- tive to a redundancy payment and are not a bursary for the purposes of the section CB 9 (d) exemption. This policy is based on a consideration of all of the circum- stances of the payment, including the following factors: 1. The purpose of the payment The section CB 9 (d) exemption requires the payment to be made in respect of the recipient’s attendance at an educational institution. The courts have interpreted this phrase as requiring the principal purpose of the pay- ment to be for the education of the recipient. The Court of Appeal in Reid v CIR and the High Court in CIR v Drew (1988) 10 NZTC 5,060 examined the purpose of payments when determining whether they were a bursary. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) In Reid the Court of Appeal found that a student teacher allowance paid by the Wellington Education Board was a bursary. The Court stated that, in this case, the appellant received the allowances essentially for educa- tional purposes. In Drew, the High Court examined the purpose of payments made by the Post Office to an employee so that the employee could gain an accountancy qualifica- tion. It found that the employer’s principal purpose in making the payments was to ensure that it secured the services of a suitably qualified staff member. The secondary purpose of the payments was to give the employee educational assistance. Educational assistance was not the primary reason for making the payments and so the payments were not bursaries. When an employer makes retraining payments to a former employee, the circumstances of the payments (including the terms of any agreement under which the payments are made) may indicate that the principal purpose of the payments is to satisfy the employer’s obligation to pay redundancy payments to the employee. The furtherance of the former employee’s education through the provision of financial assistance may only be a secondary purpose of the payments. When this is the case, as in Drew, the primary reason for the pay- ments is not educational assistance, and the payments are not bursaries. 2. The employment relationship between the parties When the employee receives retraining payments instead of a redundancy payment, he or she receives the payments because of the termination of the employment relationship with the former employer. The employee would not have received the payments if the parties did not have this relationship. In Reid, there was no employment relationship between the parties. One of the reasons the Court in Drew distinguished the Reid decision that the payment was a bursary, and found that the principal purpose of the payment was for the employer’s benefit, was that in Drew the employment relationship between the parties continued during the term of the payments. The deci- sion in Reid can be similarly distinguished when an employer makes retraining payments to a former employee. Unlike the taxpayer in Reid, the former employee receives the retraining payments because of his or her former employment relationship with the employer. 3. Examination of the contract between the parties To establish whether the retraining payments are a bursary, the Commissioner will examine any contract under which the employer makes the retraining pay- ments, the intention of the parties in entering into that contract, the manner in which the retraining payments are made, and any other material factors. 4. Merit The Commissioner will also look at whether eligibility for the payments depends on some form of merit, effort, or achievement by each recipient. A factor which will weigh against a payment being a bursary will exist when the employee’s terms of employment determine whether or not he or she is eligible for retraining payments, rather than the payments being awarded on the basis of merit. When an employee receives retraining payments instead of a redundancy payment, the payments are not bursa- ries. The section CB 9 (d) exemption does not apply and the payments are assessable as monetary remuneration. Employer’s obligation to deduct tax at source Section NC 2 requires an employer to deduct tax from source deduction payments that it makes to employees. Section OB 2 defines “source deduction payment” as including a payment by way of salary or wages or an extra emolument. Retraining payments paid to the employee in the form of continued salary are covered by the section OB 1 definition of “salary or wages” as they are allowances in respect of or in relation to the employ- ment of the former employee. Retraining payments paid in a lump sum constitute an extra emolument. In either case, retraining payments are source deduction pay- ments. Even though the employee receives the retraining payments after the termination of his or her employ- ment, the employer must deduct PAYE from the retraining payments. When the retraining payments constitute salary or wages, the employer must deduct PAYE at the employee’s marginal tax rate. When the retraining payments constitute an extra emolument, the employer must deduct PAYE at the extra emolument rate. If the employer fails to make full PAYE deduc- tions, section NC 16 requires the employee to pay the Commissioner the tax deductions that the employer should have made. Example A government department informs an employee, Jane, that she is surplus to staffing requirements. It offers her the choice of a lump sum redundancy payment of $80,000 or a retraining package. Under the retraining package the employer will continue Jane’s salary, in fortnightly payments, for two years while she attends university (total gross payments of $80,000). Jane accepts the retraining package offer. The contract provides that the government department will deduct tax at source from the payments of the continued salary. The Commissioner considers that the payment of the continued salary is not a bursary. The agree- continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) the terms of the contract, is that the payments are a continuation of Jane’s salary. Jane’s entitlement to the payments arises out of her employment contract, rather than from an award based on merit, effort, or achievement. The retraining payments are assessable income in Jane’s hands, and the government department must deduct PAYE at Jane’s marginal tax rate. Difference between a taxable activity (GST) and a business activity (income tax) Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on when a “taxable activity” for GST purposes may constitute a “business” for income tax purposes. It sets out the differences between a taxable activity for GST purposes and a business for income tax purposes. Background We have been asked to clarify whether a taxable activity for GST purposes is a business for income tax purposes in every case. There is some uncertainty as to the differences between a taxable activity and a business. Some people have assumed that once the Commissioner accepts an activity as a taxable activity, it will also be accepted as a business. All legislative references in this item are to Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 OB 12 Section 6(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) defines the term “taxable activity” for GST purposes: For the purposes of this Act, the term “taxable activity” means - (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. Certain activities are excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3) of the GST Act. These include activities that are essentially in the nature of a private recreational pursuit or hobby. Section 6(3) states: Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person, - (a)Being a natural person, any activity carried on essen- tially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa)Not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby... Section OB 1 defines the term “business” for income tax purposes: “Business”- (a) Includes any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertak- ing carried on for pecuniary profit: (b) Is further defined in Schedule 6A for the purposes of that Schedule. Case law A person conducts a taxable activity for GST purposes when all of the following characteristics are present: • There is some form of activity. • The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. • The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for consideration. The definition of “taxable activity” specifically includes an activity carried on in the form of a business. This means that a business activity for income tax purposes will also constitute a taxable activity for GST purposes, unless it is an activity specifically excluded by section 6(3) of the GST Act. “Activity” has a wide meaning, and does not necessarily have to be an economic or commercial activity. It is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as being, amongst other things, “a particular occupation or pursuit”. It is essentially a series of acts that a person chooses to do. In the High Court case of Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229, Justice Fraser stated at page 11,233: \[Activity\] is a word of considerable breadth. The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1993 ascribes a number of varying meanings or shades of meaning, none of which is exactly apposite to the word in its context in s 6. The nearest, I think, ment to make the payments relates to the former employment relationship between the parties, and the principal purpose of the payments is to satisfy the redundancy rights and obligations of the employer and employee. The provision of educa- tional assistance to the employee is only the second- ary purpose of the payments. The intention of the parties, as evidenced by the method of payment and from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) is ‘an occupation, a pursuit’ and (in the plural) ‘things that a person, animal or group chooses to do’. In its context here I think the word means a course of conduct or series of acts which a person has chosen to undertake or become engaged in. In the Court of Appeal case of Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097, Justice Richardson added at page 12,100: The legislation is directed at a course of conduct which can fairly be described as being carried on continuously or regularly. As I see it, it is not a matter of importing any overlay of commercial dealing or of trying to draw a distinc- tion between the divestment of commercial assets and private assets. Rather it is whether the process engaged in, whatever the asset or its location or the occupation of the taxpayer, comes within the statutory language. The application of the test to the particular circumstances will necessarily involve questions of fact and degree. An activity must be carried on continuously or regularly before it can be a taxable activity. The words “carried on continuously or regularly” refer to the activity which will culminate in the supply of goods and services, rather than to the actual supply of those goods and services. In the Newman decision, the Court of Appeal considered whether the taxpayer’s activity was carried on continu- ously or regularly by examining the activity as a whole, rather than the various sequential steps or components of which the activity was comprised. The Court’s approach was to see whether the activity was carried on either continuously or regularly. An activity is “continuous” if there is no significant cessation or interruption of the activity. In other words, it is carried on all the time. Temporary interruptions in the activity for holiday or health reasons, for example, will not generally mean that the activity is not “continu- ous”. An activity is “regular” if it is repeated at reason- ably fixed intervals. It is important to note that to be a taxable activity, the activity need only be “continuous” or “regular”. Whether or not a taxable activity exists depends on the particular facts of each case. For example, a subdivision of land into two allotments, involving no development work, will not by itself amount to a taxable activity. However, the greater the number of allotments created and sold, the more extensive the development work, the more time and effort involved and the higher the financial commitment to the project, the more likely that the activity is carried on continuously. Therefore, it is more likely that there is a taxable activity. The Commissioner’s interpretation of the meaning of “taxable activity” in the context of subdivisions follow- ing the Court of Appeal’s decision in Newman is set out in TIB Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). A taxable activity does not include an activity which is clearly carried on as a private recreational pursuit or hobby for personal enjoyment and recreation. Factors which are taken into account when determining whether an activity is a taxable activity or a hobby include: • the reasons for conducting the activity • the business-like nature of the operations • the time available to devote to the activity • the level of financial investment • the structure and organisation of the activity. The factors that the Commissioner considers when deciding whether an activity is a taxable activity or a hobby are set out and discussed on page 5 of TIB Volume Six, No.14 (June 1995). These principles are established and supported by the judgments in Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 and Case P83 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,553. An activity is a business for income tax purposes if the nature of the activities is business-like, and the actions of the taxpayer indicate an intention to make a profit. The fundamental basis of a business is that it is an activity conducted in an organised and coherent way towards an end result. It is not necessary to show that the activity has a reasonable prospect of making a profit. However, a genuine intention to make a profit must be present. These principles are established and supported by the judgment in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. Policy A taxable activity for GST purposes will constitute a business for income tax purposes if the nature of the activity amounts to a business, and the actions of the taxpayer indicate an intention to make a profit. An activity’s income tax status is determined independently from its GST status. Although an intention to make a profit must be present before an activity can constitute a business for income tax purposes, it is not relevant when determining whether it is a taxable activity for GST purposes. The key element of a taxable activity is the supply of goods and services for a consideration. There can be a consid- eration for a supply even though no profit arises. Many supplies of goods and services are made without the intention of making a profit, for example, supplies by certain public sector agencies and some charities. Example Mrs Wilson operates a community newspaper designed to keep the community’s residents in- formed of important local developments. A small number of advertising spots are also sold to local businesses, etc. The sale price and advertising revenue are only sufficient to cover costs. The activity does not have to be registered for GST purposes as its turnover does not exceed $30,000. There is no intention to make a profit from the newspaper. Mrs Wilson receives no salary or other income from the venture, and, while she admits to continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) On the basis of the facts presented above, Mrs Wilson could register her newspaper activity voluntarily with Inland Revenue as a taxable activity for GST purposes. However, without an intention to make a profit in the venture the news- paper activity does not constitute a business for income tax purposes. Mrs Wilson should consider the implications of a voluntary GST registration carefully before register- ing. Even though the activity is not returning a profit, there may still be GST payable, as input tax is not a component of certain expenses, for example wages paid to employees. Additional tax - remission when taxpayer makes an incorrect interpretation Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on the application of section 178(1)(c) of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994. This section allows the Commissioner to remit the additional tax charged for underestimating residual income tax when the underestimation is caused by an incorrect interpretation of tax legislation. The additional tax charged for underestimation is commonly known as ‘underestimation penalty’. Under section 178(1)(c), the Commissioner will remit additional tax charged for underestimation only if he is satisfied that both the following conditions are met: • The taxpayer’s residual income tax was higher than the amount estimated because the taxpayer adopted an incorrect interpretation of the tax legislation when calculating the estimate. • The taxpayer’s incorrect interpretation was reasonable given the circumstances of the case. All legislative references in this item are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background Provisional tax is normally calculated by adding 5% to a taxpayer’s residual income tax for the previous income year. Alternatively, provisional taxpayers may estimate what they expect their residual income tax will be for the coming year and make provisional tax payments based on that estimate. However, if a provisional taxpayer makes an estimate and the amount of the estimate (and the amount of provisional tax paid by the final instalment date) is less than 80% of the actual residual income tax for that year, additional tax for underestimation is charged. There are a number of grounds the Commissioner can use to remit the additional tax charged for underestima- tion. One of the grounds for remission is given by section 178(1)(c). Legislation Cross-reference table Tax AdministrationIncome Tax Act 1976 Act 1994 178(1)(c)386(1)(c) 178(6)386(6) Section 178 allows for the remission of additional tax charged for the underestimation of residual income tax for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. Section 178(1)(c) deals with underestimation caused by an incorrect interpretation and states: Where the Commissioner is satisfied that any provisional taxpayer has become liable to pay additional tax under section 144 by reason of- ... (c) The adoption by the provisional taxpayer of an incorrect interpretation of any provision of this Act, being an interpretation which, although incorrect, is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case; ... the Commissioner shall remit the additional tax or any appropriate part of the additional tax. Section 178(6) imposes a further requirement of docu- mentary evidence, stating: Notwithstanding subsections (1) or (2) of this section, no person shall be entitled to a remission of additional tax under this section unless the person satisfies the Commissioner, by the production of documents or such other information as the Commissioner may require, that the requirements of this section are fulfilled in relation to that person and that additional tax. For the 1994-95 income year, remissions were allowed by section 386 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The requirement for documentary evidence was introduced deriving enjoyment from her labours, the operation is clearly not essentially a hobby or recreational pursuit for these reasons: • The main aim of the newspaper is to benefit the community. • The newspaper has planned continuity. • The newspaper’s operation is regular and it is published frequently. • Mrs Wilson runs the newspaper in a business-like manner. • Mrs Wilson devotes considerable time to the newspaper’s activities. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) with effect from the 1994-95 income year by section 386(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Policy The Commissioner may remit additional tax charged for underestimating residual income tax when the underes- timation resulted from an incorrect interpretation of tax legislation. To remit additional tax in these circum- stances, the Commissioner must be satisfied that both the following conditions are met: • The taxpayer’s residual income tax was higher than the amount estimated because the taxpayer adopted an incorrect interpretation of the tax legislation when calculating the estimate. • The taxpayer’s incorrect interpretation was reasonable given the circumstances of the case. To meet the first of these conditions, the taxpayer must explain the incorrect interpretation and demonstrate how it was incorporated into the estimate. The taxpayer must also have documentary evidence or other informa- tion to support the claim. To satisfy the second condition, the taxpayer must demonstrate that reasonable care was taken in attempt- ing to interpret the law. In determining what is reason- able, the Commissioner will consider how a reasonable taxpayer of the same type and size would have inter- preted the law in similar circumstances. Larger, more sophisticated taxpayers are expected to exercise a higher standard of care than smaller, less sophisticated taxpay- ers. Example 1 Mrs E is a self-employed professional. She expects her business turnover to decline, so estimates her 1994-95 residual income tax to calculate her 1994- 95 provisional tax. In estimating her 1994-95 residual income tax, Mrs E makes certain assump- tions about what expenses are deductible for tax purposes. She keeps supporting documentation. When Mrs E’s 1994-95 residual income tax is determined, the estimate is found to be within the tolerances allowed. However, when Mrs E is later investigated by Inland Revenue it is found that she wrongly claimed an expense because of the way she interpreted the legislation. Mrs E’s 1994-95 re- sidual income tax is adjusted upwards accordingly, and she is charged additional tax for underestima- tion. Mrs E has become liable for underestimation additional tax because she interpreted the legisla- tion incorrectly when calculating the estimate. Mrs E can produce documentary evidence to show that her estimate was based on, amongst other things, the disallowed expense claim being deductible. The additional tax charged can therefore be remitted if Mrs E can satisfy the Commissioner that her interpretation of the legislation (which flowed into the estimate of her residual income tax) was reasonable for a person in her circumstances. The Commissioner would consider whether a reasonable self-employed business person could have adopted the same interpretation. Example 2 New Co made a small loss in the 1994-95 income year, its first year of operation, so it was not asked to pay provisional tax for the 1995-96 income year. However, in the 1995-96 income year New Co expected to make a substantial profit, but did not tell its tax adviser. The tax adviser had not previ- ously told New Co that if it expected its residual income tax to be over $300,000, it must estimate its residual income tax and pay provisional tax based on the estimate. New Co, therefore, made no estimate and paid no provisional tax in the 1995-96 income year. New Co’s 1995-96 residual income tax was $500,000. Since this was over $300,000, New Co was deemed to have made an estimate equal to the amount of provisional tax paid - which was nil. New Co was therefore charged additional tax for underestimation. New Co’s tax adviser argues that the penalty should be remitted under section 178(1)(c) because New Co made no deliberate error. The penalty cannot be remitted. New Co did not incorrectly estimate its residual income tax by misinterpreting the legislation. In fact, New Co made no estimate at all because the legislation was completely disregarded. Section 178(1)(c) cannot be used to remit the penalty when the estimate is deemed to have been made because the residual income tax exceeded $300,000. Even if New Co deliberately made an estimate of nil on the basis that it made a loss in the previous income year, the penalty could still not be remitted. The Commissioner considers that a company taxpayer with residual income tax of $500,000 should know that the legislation requires any estimate to be fair and reasonable. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Employer premium rate - partnership earnings other than as an employee Summary This item states the correct employer premium rate applicable to a taxpayer’s earnings from a partnership other than as an employee. When a partner’s earnings other than as an employee are solely from the partnership business, the employer premium rate is determined by the business activity of the partnership. When a partner engages in two or more business activities, the employer premium on all the partner’s earnings other than as an employee is calcu- lated using the rate for the business activity with the highest premium rate. Background Employer premium is payable by: • employers on earnings paid to their employees; and • self-employed people on their earnings other than as an employee. A taxpayer in his or her capacity as a partner is self- employed and must pay employer premium on all earnings other than as an employee. ACC has produced a schedule of employer premium classification units. These units cover a wide range of industrial, trade, business, and professional activities. Each unit description is based on what is produced or the service being offered. The premium for each activity is set at a basic rate to reflect the risk level of the particular industry. Legislation The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insur- ance (Earnings Definition) Regulations 1992 define “earnings other than as an employee”: “Earnings other than as an employee”, in relation to any person and any income year, means the amount of assessable income (if any) derived by the person in the income year for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976 which - (a) Is dependent on the personal exertions of the person; and (b) If the person were to suffer any incapacity, the person would cease to derive as a consequence of such incapacity, - after deducting all amounts allowable as deductions to the person for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976 which are allowable by virtue of the person deriving the income referred to in this clause; but does not include any earnings as an employee. The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insur- ance (Employment Premiums) Regulations 1994 state: 3. Classification of earners for premiums purposes For the purposes of calculation and payment of premiums under the Act- (a) Earners shall be classified into their respective categories of - (i) Persons who have earnings other than as an employee; and (ii)Employees; and... (c) Except as provided in regulations 5 and 7 of these regulations, persons who have earnings other than as an employee shall be also classified according to the description or division of classification unit, as set out in the Schedule to these regulations, which most accurately describes their classification unit. 5. Classification where person who has earnings other than as an employee engaged in 2 or more classification units- Where a person who has earnings other than as an employee is engaged in 2 or more classification units, that person shall, for the purpose of calculation and payment of premiums, be classified in the description or division of those classification units for which the highest rate of premium is prescribed. Application of legislation The item “Self-Employed Accident Compensation Levy” in PIB 178 (February 1989) at page 16 stated that: The industrial activity class applicable to each member of the partnership depends upon the industrial activity of the individual self-employed person, not the industrial activity of the partnership. That statement referred to the self-employed levy that has now been replaced by the employer premium under the Regulations. We explain the current position below. The rate of employer premium payable by a partner depends on the source or sources of earnings other than as an employee in the partner’s personal tax return. When a partner’s earnings other than as an employee are solely from the partnership business, the premium is calculated using the employer premium classification unit description that best reflects the business activity of the partnership. However, when a partner engages in two or more business activities (i.e. has earnings other than as an employee both outside and from the partnership), the premium is calculated on all earnings other than as an employee using the highest rate of the classification units in which the partner is involved. Example Margo and Hone are partners in a retail furniture store. Margo works in the shop and Hone does the book work and other administrative tasks. The employer premium rate applicable to Margo and Hone’s partnership income is determined by the 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) business activity of the partnership. The most accurate description for that activity is Furniture- Retailing (unit no. 52310) which has a premium rate of $1.53. In her individual tax return Margo has further self- employed income from her bricklaying business. The premium rate for this activity is $5.55 (unit no. 42220). Hone has other income from his employ- ment-agency business. The premium rate for this activity is $1.10 (unit no. 78610). ACC premium treatment: Margo has the premium rates of $1.53 and $5.55. She pays the employer premium at the higher rate of $5.55 on all her self-employed income, including her income from the partnership. Hone has the premium rates of $1.53 and $1.10. He pays the employer premium at the higher rate of $1.53 on all his self-employed income, including his income from the partnership. The higher rate applies to Margo and Hone because they have earnings other than as an employee both in their own right and from the partnership. When a taxpayer is involved in two or more activities, the premium rate of the highest rated activity is applied to all the activities. Sleeping partners A sleeping partner is a partner who has capital in a business and shares in its profits without taking any part in the management or day to day running. A sleeping partner is not liable for employer premium on his or her share of the partnership income. Sleeping partners are excluded from the definition of “earnings other than as an employee” for these reasons: • Their share of the partnership income does not depend on their personal exertion. • Their share of partnership income would not cease if they suffered an incapacity. Zero-rating goods and services for GST - where to enquire Summary This item clarifies Inland Revenue’s and New Zealand Customs’ roles in dealing with public enquiries on zero- rating goods and services tax (GST). Inland Revenue is responsible for answering all enquiries relating to section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the zero-rating section). NZ Customs is responsible for answering enquiries relating to sections 12 and 13 of the Act. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background Section 11 provides for the zero-rating of goods and services. Some paragraphs in sections 11(1) and 11(2) refer to the Customs Act 1966. Customers who have enquiries on a part of section 11 that refers to the Customs Act are sometimes unsure whether to contact NZ Customs or Inland Revenue for advice. Legislation Section 1(3) states: Sections 12 and 13 of this Act, and also section 42 of this Act in so far as it applies to the Comptroller of Customs, shall be deemed to be one of the Customs Acts. Section 12 refers to the imposition of GST on imports, and section 13 refers to the imposition of GST on goods liable to excise duty and supplied at “in bond” prices. Goods and services are zero-rated under section 11. Section 11(1) lists the goods that can be zero-rated. Seven of the paragraphs in section 11(1) refer to the Customs Act. They are (a), (aa), (ac), (ad), (ae), (af), and (b). These paragraphs refer to: • goods entered for export pursuant to the Customs Act • goods whose supplier is licensed under the Customs Act either as an export warehouse (i.e., a duty free shop), or an export warehouse and a sealed bag operator. Section 11(2) lists the services that can be zero-rated. Paragraph (ca) refers to the Customs Act. It states that services directly connected with goods referred to in sections 47(2) or 181 of the Customs Act may be zero- rated. Section 47(2) of the Customs Act refers to ships’ stores and goods whose destination is outside the territorial limits of New Zealand. The proviso applies to stores and goods that are not removed from the ship or aircraft while it is in New Zealand. Section 181 of the Customs Act refers to goods which are temporarily imported. Roles of Inland Revenue and NZ Customs Customers are often unsure whom to contact when they have a query on a part of section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act which refers to the Customs Act. In this situation the customer should contact Inland Revenue. If the Inland Revenue officer who is handling the enquiry is unsure about any of the provisions of the Customs Act that section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act refers to, he or she will research the matter, and if necessary contact NZ Customs for clarification. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) • The relevant services are supplied in connection with goods for which a temporary import entry is needed before the services can qualify for zero-rating. NZ Customs is responsible for granting the temporary import entry for the goods. NZ Customs is fully responsible for administering sections 12 and 13 of the Goods and Services Tax Act. These sections relate to imported goods and goods liable to excise duty. If the enquiry relates to either of these sections, the customer should contact NZ Customs. GST registration - effective date when applicant requests backdated voluntary registration Summary This item sets out the Commissioner’s policy on voluntary GST registration when the applicant requests registration to be effective from a date in the past under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. People who make taxable supplies of less than $30,000 may register voluntarily under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Commissioner has a broad discre- tion to set an effective date of registration. He normally exercises this discretion by registering the person from the date of the application, or from a date in the future if the taxpayer intends to carry on a taxable activity from a specified date. In exceptional circumstances the Commissioner may register the person effective from a past date. The Commissioner will consider the individual factors of each case in determining whether the circumstances justify backdating the registration date. Some of the factors that the Commissioner may consider and weigh up when exercising the discretion are: • the reason why the applicant did not request registra- tion at the time that registration was first desirable • whether the applicant proceeded in business in the belief that he or she was ineligible to be registered • whether the applicant considered that he or she had been registered automatically • whether the applicant can substantiate the amount of output tax payable • the amount of time between the date of application and the date the applicant wishes to be registered from • the possible effect on the administration of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This is not an exhaustive list. The Commissioner will consider other factors that the applicant can show are relevant to the backdating of the registration. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background Some people have applied for voluntary registration and have sought to have the registration effective from a date in the past. They have then sought to claim input tax deductions for those past periods. These applications have resulted in queries as to how the Commissioner applies his discretion in determining the effective date of registration. Legislation Section 51 sets out the rules for registering for GST. Sections 51(3) and 51(4) relate to voluntary registration, and state: Section 51(3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, every person who satisfies the Commissioner that, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, - (a) That person is carrying on any taxable activity; or (b) That person intends to carry on any taxable activity from a specified date, - may apply to the Commissioner in the prescribed form for registration under this Act, and provide the Commissioner with such further particulars as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of registering that person. Section 51(4) Where any person has- (a) Made application for the registration pursuant to subsec- tion (2) or subsection (3) of this section, and the Commis- sioner is satisfied that that person is eligible to be registered under this Act, that person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from such date as the Commissioner may determine; or (b) Not made application for registration pursuant to subsec- tion (2) of this section, and the Commissioner is satisfied In some situations the Inland Revenue officer may need to refer the customer to NZ Customs. These situations may arise when: • The goods need to be entered for export to qualify for zero-rating. NZ Customs handles the process of entering goods for export. • The supplier needs to obtain a licence to operate either an export warehouse, or an export warehouse and a sealed bag system, for the goods to qualify for zero-rating. NZ Customs is responsible for issuing licences. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) that that person is liable to be registered under this Act, that person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from the date on which that person first became liable to be registered under this Act: Provided that the Commissioner may, having regard to the circumstances of the case, determine that person to be a registered person from such later date as the Commis- sioner considers equitable. Policy Application of legislation The Commissioner will consider each request for backdated registration according to the facts of that particular case. Generally, the Commissioner will select the date of application or a date in the future to be the date of registration, unless there are circumstances that justify registering the person effective from a date in the past. The Commissioner will only register a person retrospec- tively when the circumstances show that it would be unfair on the taxpayer for the registration not to be retrospective. When considering whether to backdate the registration, the Commissioner may consider and weigh up the following factors: • The reason why the applicant did not seek voluntary registration at the time that he or she is requesting to be registered from. The person must have been carrying on a taxable activity at that date and intend- ing to register from that date, but circumstances prevailed that prevented registration. Persuasive circumstances are: absence overseas, illness, or personal tragedy. Ignorance of obligations over a long period of time, or failure to register are not persuasive reasons. • Whether the applicant proceeded in business in the belief that he or she was ineligible to be registered. For example, the person’s business activity might easily appear at first sight to be an exempt activity, but the applicant later discovered from a reliable source that the activity was a taxable activity. • Whether the applicant has proceeded in business on the reasonable belief that he or she had automatically been registered. Evidence of this belief might be demonstrated by the applicant mistakenly charging GST on the goods and services supplied. • Whether the applicant can substantiate the amount of output tax payable on the supplies made during that period. The applicant must have accurate accounting records to be able to establish the supplies that were made over the period and to whom. • The amount of time between the date of application and the requested registration date will be a signifi- cant factor. The longer the time between the applica- tion date and the requested registration date, the less likely it will be that the Commissioner will exercise the discretion. • The effect that this would have on the administration of the Act. This considers the effect that the backdat- ing of the registration would have on other registered persons. The above factors are not an exhaustive list; other factors particular to an applicant’s circumstances may influence the Commissioner’s decision. Consequences of the Commissioner agreeing or declining to backdate the applicant’s registration When the Commissioner does backdate the registration, the applicant must do both of the following: • return the output tax that should have been charged on past supplies made • issue GST tax invoices to the recipients of the sup- plies made since the date of registration so that the recipients can claim GST input deductions in the current period. The applicant may also reduce the output tax by the amount of input tax paid for goods and services ac- quired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies for that period, provided that the applicant has the relevant tax invoices. When the Commissioner does not backdate the registra- tion, the person must account for GST from the date that the person is registered. From the registration date, the applicant will be able to claim input tax deductions for goods acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Example A retailer has been selling beauty products for the past year. During that year the value of his supplies has not exceeded $30,000 in any 12-month period, and he has not registered for GST. He has not charged GST on the goods sold during this period. Following advice from his accountant, he decides to apply for voluntary registration. He has requested that the registration is effective from the date that he started selling beauty products. The relevant circumstances of this case are: • The applicant has asked the Commissioner to register him for GST retrospectively once he became aware of the tax consequences of registra- tion. The reason why he did not register initially is that he had not sought professional advice at that time. The delay in requesting registration is not due to external circumstances over which he had no control. • The applicant has not proceeded in business in the belief that he was registered or liable to be registered. • The applicant’s accounting system is poor. It does not provide a reliable record of the number of continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Commissioner retrospectively registered the retailer. Because of the poor accounts and records that have been kept, the applicant will not be able to issue GST tax invoices for those supplies. In this case, the Commissioner would decline to backdate the retailer’s GST registration, because on balancing the above factors it would be fair to decline to register the retailer retrospectively. Conveyances involving intermediaries - conveyance duty Summary This item discusses the application of conveyance duty when an intermediary is involved in the conveyance of property. In these cases, section 16 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 may apply for the purposes of assessing conveyance duty. If section 16 applies, conveyance duty must be paid on the transfer from the vendor to the intermediary as well as on the transfer from the intermediary to the ultimate purchaser. This is the case even if the two (or more) transfers are effected by the one instrument of conveyance. Whether or not section 16 applies will depend on the circumstances of each case. Generally speaking, if the transfer of property is from a vendor to a “true” nomi- nee or agent, and then to a principal, conveyance duty is payable only once on the transaction. However, if the transfer of property is from a vendor to an intermediary to a third party by way of sale, assignment, or novation, conveyance duty is payable twice - once on the transfer from the vendor to the intermediary, and once on the transfer from the intermediary to the third party. All legislative references in this item are to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Background Stamp duty is generally payable on instruments for conveyances and leases of commercial land and build- ings (including conveyances of shares in flat or office owning companies) executed on or after 17 March 1988. Stamp duty that is payable on an instrument of convey- ance is referred to as “conveyance duty”. Conveyance duty is assessed on the value of the property conveyed. There are various ways in which property may be transferred. In some cases, property may be transferred from the vendor to a person other than that named as purchaser. In this case there is an intermediate transac- tion (or several intermediate transactions). Section 16 may operate to ensure that conveyance duty is payable on each of the intermediate transactions involved, and not only the transfer to the last purchaser. Legislation Section 16 states: (1) This section applies to every instrument of conveyance whereby property is conveyed - (a) By the direction, at the request, or with the consent of an intermediary who by any means whatsoever has the right to call for a conveyance of the property to himself or to any other person; or (b) Pursuant to any derivative title obtained by the person to whom the property is conveyed from or through an intermediary by any means whatsoever. (2) Every instrument of conveyance to which this section applies shall recite the fact of the direction, request, consent, or derivative title. (3) Every instrument of conveyance to which this section applies shall, for the purposes of assessing conveyance duty, be deemed to be an instrument of conveyance of the property from the person conveying the property to the intermediary and to be also an instrument of conveyance of the property from the intermediary to the person to whom the property is conveyed. (4) Every person who executes an instrument of conveyance to which this section applies, but which does not contain the recital required by subsection (2) of this section, commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000. Application of legislation Section 16 applies when these two conditions apply: 1. There is an instrument of conveyance that conveys property. 2.Either the property is conveyed by the direction, at the request, or with the consent of an intermediary who has the right to call for a conveyance of the property to himself or herself or to any other person; or the property is conveyed under any derivative title obtained by the person to whom the property is conveyed from or through an intermediary. Essentially, the question of whether an instrument of conveyance falls within section 16 is one of fact. This will be determined primarily by the documents evidenc- ing the conveyance, as well as by the surrounding facts. sales nor to whom they were made, during that period. • The applicant has sought registration effective from the date that he commenced selling beauty products. One year has passed since then. • The length of time the applicant has been selling beauty products suggests that a number of other registered persons would be affected if the from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) The general question to ask is, has there been one or more than one transaction? If there has been more than one transaction, section 16 is likely to apply. Factors that suggest that section 16 may apply are: • a relationship between the intermediary and the ultimate purchaser which suggests an assignment or sale • consideration passing from the ultimate purchaser to the intermediary. If section 16 applies, the instrument of conveyance must recite the fact of the direction, request, consent, or derivative title. If the instrument of conveyance does not contain the recital, the person who executes the docu- ment commits an offence and can be fined up to $2,000. For the purposes of assessing conveyance duty, the instrument of conveyance is deemed to be an instrument of conveyance of the property from both: • the person conveying the property to the intermediary; and • the intermediary to the person to whom the property is conveyed. Case law The High Court decision of Eastern Bay Builders Ltd and Eastland Construction Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,014 discussed the distinction that arises between the situation when there is truly an on-selling of property (and two transactions) and the situation when there is a true nomination (where there is one transaction only). In that case, Eastern Bay Builders Ltd (“Eastern Bay”) entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of property with the vendors. One month later, a memo- randum of transfer was executed between the vendors and Eastland Construction Ltd (“Eastland”) for the property described in the sale and purchase agreement. The consideration in both documents was the same. The issue for consideration by the Court was whether a transfer by direction had taken place under section 16, and whether duty was payable on both the agreement and on the transfer. On page 6,015 of the judgment, Justice Gallen com- mented on the various ways in which property in a transaction may be transferred from the vendor to some person other than that named as purchaser: Assignment - In the case of an assignment, as between the vendor and purchaser, the original contract remains in existence. There is clearly a second transaction involving a contract between the purchaser and the assignee. Novation - In the case of novation, there is a new and substitutionary contract involving the parties. There is, by its very nature, a second transaction. Nomination - In the case of nomination, the purchaser may simply direct that the property is to be transferred into the name of the nominee without there being any contractual relationship or transaction between the purchaser and the nominee at all. Alternately, there may genuinely be a second transaction between the purchaser and the nominee. Justice Gallen noted on page 6,015 that section 16 was designed to ensure that duty may be recovered on one or more separate sales of the same piece of land. In this case the facts did not show separate sales of property between the vendor and Eastern Bay and between Eastern Bay and Eastland. The situation was one of a true nomination and there was nothing in the relation- ship between the purchaser and the nominee which indicated an assignment or sale, nor was there any question of consideration passing between the purchaser and the nominee. Examples Both examples assume that instruments of conveyance referred to are subject to conveyance duty. Example 1 An agreement for the sale and purchase of land is entered into between Derek as vendor, and Basil or his nominee as purchaser. A document executed by Basil before settlement gave notice to Derek that Basil’s nominee was B Ltd on whose behalf Basil was acting as agent. The related memorandum of transfer shows Derek as vendor and B Ltd as purchaser. Section 16 does not apply in this case. B Ltd is not purchasing the property from Basil. The facts establish that there is no sale from Basil to B Ltd, nor is there any consideration passing between the parties. B Ltd is in the position of an original purchaser. Conveyance duty is only payable once on the transaction. Example 2 An agreement for the sale and purchase of land is entered into between Moana as vendor, and Tina or her nominee as purchaser. After the agreement is signed, but before the settlement date, Tina offers to sell the property to a third party for $5,000 more than she had agreed to pay Moana. It is Tina’s intention to make the new purchaser her nominee under the original contract with Moana. In this case, section 16 applies. There are two distinct transfers in this case and each of the transfers is a sale for consideration. Conveyance duty is payable twice (on the instrument of convey- ance from Moana to Tina and on the instrument of conveyance from Tina to the third party). The use of the words “or her nominee” do not affect the liability to conveyance duty. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates.

This determination sets three new general deprecia- tion asset classes for wool combing machinery. These new asset classes clarify the existing asset classes, but they do not change the depreciation rates that apply to the machinery. Wool bins The Commissioner believes that the applicable asset class for live bottom wool storage bins is “Blowing systems (for wool)” with an estimated life (“EUL”) of 15.5 years. To clarify this, the Commissioner has set a new asset class “Bin (wool storage, live bottom)” with an EUL of 15.5 years. Combing machines Combing machines are not specifically listed in the depreciation table. The Commissioner believes that the rate that applies to combing machines is the default class of the “Textile, Garment and Carpet Manufactur- ing” industry category. The default class has an EUL of 15.5 years. To clarify this, the Commissioner has set a new asset class “Combing machines” with an EUL of 15.5 years. Gill machines The Commissioner believes that the applicable asset class for bump presses, preparers, finishers, and gill machines is “Sliver package machine” with an EUL of 20 years. To clarify this, the Commissioner has set a new asset class “Gill machines” with an EUL of 20 years. The determination is reproduced below.

Virginia Flaus Manager (Rulings) 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 German pension received by New Zealand resident - whether assessable Section BB 3 (section 242, Income Tax Act 1976) - Liability to tax of income derived from New Zealand and abroad: A taxpayer who is resident in New Zealand receives a pension from the German Bundesversicherungsanstalt (equivalent to New Zealand Income Support Service). She has received a letter from the German Embassy stating that the pension is not taxable in New Zea- land, and has asked Inland Revenue to confirm this. Section BB 3 (a) states: All income derived by any person who is resident in New Zealand at the time when the person derives that income shall be assessable for income tax, whether it is derived from New Zealand or from elsewhere. Section CH 1 (1) (section 65(2)(j), Income Tax Act 1976) states: Without in any way limiting the meaning of the term, the assessable income of any person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to include all pensions, save so far as express provision is made in this Act to the contrary. However, under The Double Taxation Relief (Federal Republic of Germany) Order 1980, Article 18(2): Periodic or non-periodic social security pensions and other similar allowances received from a Contracting State, a “Land”, a political sub-division, a local authority or a governmental instru- mentality thereof, shall be taxable only in that State. A double tax agreement overrides the domestic law of the contracting states, so the pension received is not taxable in New Zealand. Any taxpayer who has been assessed with tax in New Zealand on his or her pension from the German Bundesversicherungsanstalt, should apply to the local Inland Revenue office for a reassessment. Deductibility of costs incurred in obtaining a limited (restricted) driving licence Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A self-employed taxpayer has incurred court costs and lawyers’ fees amounting to $1,200 in a successful application to obtain a limited driver’s licence for six months. The taxpayer lost her full licence when she was recently disqualified from driving. Her adviser has asked if the costs and fees are deductible as the taxpayer needs the licence for her business, and whether the success of the application is relevant to that deductibility. We had to contact the adviser to ascertain the conditions on which the limited licence was issued. These were: • The licence only applied to business use in the taxpayer’s business vehicle. • It was restricted to the taxpayer’s business hours of 0800 - 1700 hours. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) • It covered a restricted area of travel, i.e. a radius of 25 kilometres from the taxpayer’s home, enabling her to service her clients. Section BB 7 states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it - (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year - may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. In this case, the taxpayer did not attempt to recover her full licence, but sought only to obtain a licence that would allow her to continue her business. The expenditure was incurred to preserve the taxpayer’s income earning capacity, and as such was deductible. Deductibility hinges on the connection between the expenditure and producing assessable income or carrying on a business. There- fore, provided the criteria in section BB 7 are satisfied, the success or otherwise of the application is irrelevant. Farm vendor mortgage income Section CB 1 (1)(d) (section 61(52), Income Tax Act 1976): The trustee of a de- ceased person’s estate is receiving income from a farm vendor mortgage. The trustee is aware that the income was exempt when received by the deceased, and has inquired if it is exempt when derived by the estate. Section CB 1 (1)(d) exempts up to 50% of the income derived by a “person” from any farm vendor mortgage. However, for the purposes of the exemption, the term “person” does not include: ... a trustee assessable and liable to income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, and HZ 2. Therefore, any income from a farm vendor mortgage is taxable and the exemp- tion does not apply. A “farm vendor mortgage” is a mortgage which meets all the following criteria: • It secures a loan provided by the vendor or vendors of a farm. • It was approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand for the purposes of the exemption mentioned above. • The Corporation has sent a written notice of approval to Inland Revenue. Goodwill charged on granting of a sublease - whether assessable income Section CE 1 (1)(e) (section 65(2)(g), Income Tax Act 1976) - Investment income: A taxpayer who is the lessee of a parcel of land wishes to grant a sublease. Included in the charge for the sublease will be an amount for “site goodwill”. The taxpayer has sought confirmation that, because he is not the owner of the land, section CE 1 (1)(e) will not apply. Section CE 1 (1)(e) deems any payments of goodwill derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land to be assessable income. The term “owner of land” includes any person with any right to the possession of the land. Therefore, in this situation the lessee is an “owner of land” for the purposes of the section, and consequently the amount received for goodwill from subleasing the land is assessable income. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) The goodwill payment is treated as rental income “derived in anticipation”. Under section EB 2 (section 80, Income Tax Act 1976), such income may be apportioned between the income year and up to five subsequent years. If appor- tionment is required, the taxpayer must apply to Inland Revenue within the year following payment of the goodwill. Interest earned overseas - when assessable in New Zealand Section EB 1 (section 75, Income Tax Act 1976) - Income credited in account or otherwise dealt with: A New Zealand resident taxpayer who is a cash basis holder under the accruals rules has on-call deposits of NZ$250,000 with an overseas bank. She plans to withdraw the funds, including accrued interest, when exchange rates are in a favourable position, and acknowledges that at that time she will need to account for any realised gains. She has asked when she will become liable for income tax on the interest earned. Section BB 3 (a) (section 242(a), Income Tax Act 1976) creates a liability for in- come tax: All income derived by any person who is resident in New Zealand at the time when the person derives that income shall be assessable for income tax, whether it is derived from New Zealand or from elsewhere: Section EB 1 (1) (section 75(1), Income Tax Act 1976) deems income to have been derived: ... every person shall be deemed to have derived income although it has not been actually paid to or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, but has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf. Section BB 1 (section 38, Income Tax Act 1976) imposes income tax: (1) Subject to this Act, there shall be levied and paid for the use of the Crown, for the year com- mencing 1 April in each year, a tax in this Act referred to as income tax. (2) Subject to this Act, income tax shall be payable by every person on all income derived by that person during the year for which the tax is payable. The taxpayer must pay income tax on the interest in the year that it is credited to her overseas deposit account. She will become subject to tax on any realised gains or losses at the time she makes a cash base price adjustment, assuming she meets the criteria of a cash basis holder contained in section EH 3 (section 64D, Income Tax Act 1976). This means that she will be taxed on realised foreign exchange gains or losses when she sells or otherwise transfers the financial arrangement. Depreciable asset purchased and sold in same income year - loss deduction Section EG 19 (3) (section 117(3), Income Tax Act 1976) - Gain or loss from disposition of depreciable property: A taxpayer has asked if she can claim a deduction for a loss on a depreciable asset purchased and sold in the same income year. Section EG 19 (3) allows a deduction when any depreciable property (other than a building) is disposed of by a taxpayer for a consideration less than its “ad- justed tax value” at the time of disposition. The amount by which the adjusted tax value exceeds the consideration received can be deducted from the assess- able income in the year in which the disposition occurs. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Adjusted tax value is defined in section OB 1. The definition includes this for- mula: bv (base value) - ad (aggregate deductions) Note that under section EG 1 (2), no deduction for depreciation is allowed for the income year in which the property is sold, except when the property is a build- ing or “schedule depreciable property”. Schedule depreciable property is deprec- iable property that is one of these: • a petroleum drilling rig • a support vessel for an offshore petroleum drilling rig • a support vessel for an offshore petroleum production platform. In this case, the taxpayer was able to claim for the loss incurred on the sale of the depreciable property. Donations placed in donation boxes - rebate Section KC 5 (section 56A, Income Tax Act 1976) - Rebate in respect of gifts of money: A taxpayer has asked whether payments made in a donation box at a church or other location qualify for a section KC 5 rebate. Section KC 5 allows a rebate for a donation of $5 or more, paid during the year to specified donee organisations. The maximum rebate is $500 or 33 1 / 3 cents in the dollar of the donations made, whichever is the lower. To claim the rebate, the taxpayer must produce receipts or be able to satisfy Inland Revenue that the payment has been made. A taxpayer who has a receipt or other proof of payment (such as a letter of acknowledgment) may claim a rebate. The organisation to which the donation is being made must be a qualify- ing organisation. Confirmation of an organisation’s qualifying donee status may be obtained by contacting an Inland Revenue district office. When the payment is made in a donation box at a church or elsewhere, a receipt may not be issued. In these cases, if the donor wishes to claim a rebate, he or she should put the donation in an envelope with a note containing the donor’s name and address and asking for a receipt. As an alternative, payment can be made direct to the donee organisation so that it can issue a receipt. In situations when a couple has made a joint contribution, the donation may be split between the two people and a claim made of their share, up to the maxi- mum rebate of $500. In these cases only one receipt need be obtained. The re- ceipt should be included with one return, and a note to that effect should be attached to the other person’s return. Qualifying company with five or fewer shareholders Section OB 3 (3) (section 393B(3), Income Tax Act 1976) - Special rules for shareholding: A married couple are shareholders in a manufacturing company that is a qualifying company. They know that, being married, they count as a single person for the purposes of the “five or fewer shareholder” test. As the couple are about to divorce they have asked if this test will continue to be satis- fied. There are four other shareholders. Special rules are used to determine the number of taxpayers in a company for qualifying company purposes. Under section OB 3 (3)(b), shareholders who are from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) natural persons, and who are related by blood or marriage to within one degree of relationship are deemed to be one shareholder. Examples of the one degree of relationship test are parent/child and husband/wife. Section OB 3 (3)(c) further provides that, as long as the person remains a share- holder, death or dissolution of a marriage does not break the one degree test, provided the company is a qualifying company at the time of the death or disso- lution. Secondary employment earnings - why taxed at a flat rate Schedule 19 (Second Schedule, Income Tax Act 1976) - Basic tax deductions: A taxpayer has asked why secondary employment earnings have PAYE deducted at the flat rate of 28.6 cents in the dollar. Under schedule 19, secondary employment earnings are subject to a basic tax deduction of 28 cents in the dollar. This is increased by the ACC earner premium of 0.6 cents in the dollar, giving a total deduction of 28.6 cents in the dollar. The deduction rate of 28 cents in the dollar is based on the effective marginal tax rate of a person earning an annual income between $9,500 and $30,875. Taking into account the low income rebate, the following effective marginal tax rates apply in New Zealand: Income $0-$9,50015 cents in the dollar Income $9,501-$30,87528 cents in the dollar Income over $30,87533 cents in the dollar. The “marginal tax rate” is the rate of tax that applies to the next dollar. For example, the tax on an income of $20,000 is not all at 28 cents in the dollar. The first $9,500 is taxed at an effective marginal rate of 15 cents in the dollar, while the balance is taxed at 28 cents in the dollar. These are the rates that generally apply, but they will alter depending on the type of income received, the indi- vidual’s Family Support entitlement, and if the person receives New Zealand Superannuation. The secondary tax rate is designed to suit most cases when a person is earning secondary income. In most cases, if a secondary tax code is not used (e.g. a taxpayer uses two “primary” tax codes, such as “G”), an underpayment of PAYE will occur. However, when a person’s total taxable income is less than $9,500, use of the secondary tax code results in too much tax being paid. Simi- larly, when a person’s primary income is more than $30,875, the secondary tax rate is insufficient to cover that person’s tax liability. In such cases, the affected person may wish to apply for a “special tax code” from Inland Revenue. For details of the use and application of a special tax code, see page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995), or the IRD booklet “Special Tax Codes” (IR 23G). Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Unwanted wedding gifts - whether “secondhand goods” Section 2 - definition of “secondhand goods”: A GST registered dealer in secondhand goods sometimes acquires unwanted wedding gifts that she buys in response to newspaper advertisements. She has asked if these goods are “secondhand goods” for GST purposes. In Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142, the Taxation Review Authority said at page 3,147: continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) The word “secondhand” as an adjective to “good” or “goods” means, in my view, that in some way or another the item has been used or treated or stored by a previous owner in such a manner that it can no longer be regarded as new. Items in a retail shop are regarded as new, but they have quite possibly passed through a number of hands prior to being available at retail. Items in the shop of a secondhand dealer are regarded as secondhand, because they have been used for their intrinsic purpose by at least one prior owner; and even items which are in new condition will then be regarded as secondhand. The goods in this situation have not been used for their intrinsic purpose, but may well have been “treated or stored by a previous owner in such a manner” so as to be no longer regarded as new. For example, they may have been stored for a number of years after the wedding, and may not be a current model. A secondhand dealer may be unaware as to whether certain goods have been used intrinsically. Even though the unwanted wedding presents are unused they are still regarded as secondhand goods, both generally and for the purposes of the section 2 defi- nition of “secondhand goods”. However, in the event that they were goods specifically excluded from being secondhand goods as defined in section 2, (for example, a solid gold ring), no input tax deduction would be available. The item GST - the definition of secondhand goods on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.5 (November 1994) considers the subject in greater detail. Making a supply in the course of a taxable activity Sections 5 and 6 - Meanings of “supply” and “taxable activity”: A self-em- ployed taxi driver also has a 25% share in a partnership which operates a wines and spirits outlet. Each business is separately registered for GST purposes; the partnership is registered for the wines and spirits business. The partnership sometimes uses the taxi in its business, usually to provide free delivery of cli- ents’ purchases. In order to cover the taxi’s costs, there is an informal arrange- ment under which the partnership makes a regular cash payment to the taxi driver. The taxi driver has asked whether GST is payable, and what documenta- tion is required. The taxi driver is making a supply to the partnership. That supply is the deliv- ery service that is being provided and for which consideration is being charged, i.e., the regular payment. The supply is being made in the course of the taxi driver’s taxable activity, so the consideration is treated as being GST inclusive and output tax must be accounted for in the normal manner. Similarly, the partnership can claim an input tax deduction. As a supply is being made, the taxi-driver must give the partnership a tax in- voice. However, a tax invoice does not have to be issued if the consideration for the supply is less than $50. Prefunding - time of supply Section 9 - Time of supply: A GST registered importer is occasionally asked to make a part-payment for services still to be performed. Sometimes the advance part-payment is 10% of the total cost. On other occasions, where the total cost has not been established, the advance part-payment appears to be an arbitrary sum. The importer has asked how she should account for GST in these situa- tions. Under section 9(1), the normal time of supply rule is: from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) ... a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. A practice, prevalent in the shipping and port services industry, is known as prefunding. In this situation, the provider of a service requires payment before performing the service. Such a payment creates a time of supply under section 9(1) above. The value of that supply is not always certain. When the pre-payment is expressed as a percentage of the ultimate considera- tion, Inland Revenue considers the full consideration has been determined and a time of supply has occurred. GST is payable on the full value of the service at the earlier of the time the invoice requesting prepayment is issued, or payment is received. The importer may claim an input tax deduction provided she holds the necessary tax invoice. This applies when the supplier and the recipient account for the tax using the invoice basis of accounting, or when the supplier accounts using the hybrid basis. If they both account for the tax on the payments basis (or the recipient on the hybrid basis), GST must be accounted for to the extent that payment is made or received in the relevant taxable period. When the final consideration has not been determined, and cannot reasonably be determined, GST is only payable on the amount of the part-payment invoiced or paid. GST is payable on the balance of the supply when the final consideration is established, and an invoice is issued or payment received. Credits from wholesaler to retailer not a financial service Section 25 - Credit and Debit notes: A wholesaler gives a supermarket manager a list of grocery lines that are to be sold as “specials” - often below cost. The wholesaler gives the supermarket a credit of an amount that restores the super- market’s usual profit margin on these goods. The supermarket has been advised that the wholesaler is treating the credit amount as a financial service and not subjecting it to GST. The supermarket, believing the amount not to be a financial service, is accounting for GST on the credit, but considers that it might be out of pocket as a result. The manager has asked for clarification of the issue. Financial services are defined in section 3. This definition does not include arrangements as detailed above. In this instance, the issuing of a credit note is not a financial service. Section 25 (1) requires a supplier who is a registered person to provide a credit or debit note when both of these conditions are met: • The previously agreed consideration for a supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise. • The supplier has already provided a tax invoice for that supply and, as a result of the circumstances above, the tax charged on that supply is incorrect. The supermarket manager is correct, and must continue to account for GST on the credit by including the gross amount of the credit in the total sales at Box 5 of the appropriate return - usually for the taxable period in which the credit note is received. If the credit note and the tax invoice relate to the same taxable pe- riod, the manager can simply reduce the amount of the total purchases for the taxable period by the amount of the credit note. The wholesaler will be able to deduct the input tax by including the GST inclu- sive amount of all the credit notes issued during the taxable period in the total purchases (Box 12) of the relevant return. Alternatively, when the credit note is issued in the same taxable period as the tax invoice it relates to, the wholesaler can reduce the total sales (Box 5) by the amount of the credit note. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Company and receiver - liability to register for GST Section 51(1) - Liability to register: A tax practitioner is acting for the receivers of a company that has gone into receivership. The company’s major asset is a block of land from which it has derived rental income of less than the GST registration threshold of $30,000 in any previous period of 12 consecutive months. The receivers are endeavouring to sell the land for $150,000 and to wind up the company. The tax practitioner believes that section 51(1)(c), which ex- empts registration when the threshold is exceeded solely as a consequence of the cessation of a person’s taxable activity, will act to exempt the company from registering, and as a result the receivers will not need to comply with the regis- tration requirements of section 58. She has asked for confirmation of this. Applied to this particular situation, section 51(1)(b) would render the company liable to register when firm arrangements existed for the sale of the land. How- ever, section 51(1)(c) negates that liability when the Commissioner is satisfied that the registration threshold will be exceeded: ...solely as a consequence of- (c) Any cessation of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person... In this instance, the activity is being reduced and ultimately ceased, and the value of supplies will exceed the threshold for that reason. The company will not be liable to register for GST as a result of the land being sold. Section 58 deems a “specified agent” to be a registered person during the “agency period” in which the taxable activity of an “incapacitated person” is being carried on by the “specified agent”. Section 58(1) defines a “specified agent” as: ...a person carrying on any taxable activity in a capacity as personal representative, liquidator, or receiver of an incapacitated person, or otherwise as agent for or on behalf of or in the stead of an incapacitated person. This would appear to bring the receivers within the deeming registration provi- sions of the section, but for the section 58(1) definition of “incapacitated person” which states: “Incapacitated person” means a registered person who dies, or goes into liquidation or receiver- ship, or becomes bankrupt or incapacitated: Since the company in receivership is not a registered person (defined in section 2 as: ...a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under this Act:) and is not liable to be registered because of section 51(1)(c), it is not an “incapacitated person” under section 58. The receivers therefore do not have to register under the deeming provisions of that section. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Whether student loan deductions will be made from ACC payments Section 17 - Repayment deductions from salary and wages: A taxpayer has recently been involved in a serious vehicle accident and is now unable to work. She is receiving compensation payments under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. She is also in the process of repaying a stu- dent loan, and has asked if loan repayments must be deducted from the com- pensation payments, and if so, how are they dealt with. Her compensation payments will total $20,000 per annum. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) The amount of a Student Loan to be repaid in any year depends on the borrow- er’s assessable income. In the 1995-96 income year, people with student loans will repay 10 cents in every dollar they earn over $13,884. Section 14(1) provides the authority for the repayment of student loans by resi- dent borrowers. A borrower who receives “salary and wages”, as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and whose assessable income is over the repayment threshold, must have repayment deductions made from his or her wages. Com- pensation payments are expressly included in the definition of “salary or wages”. A borrower who is liable to have repayment deductions made must notify an employer that repayment deductions are to be made from wages, by using a “G ED” and/or “SEC ED” code on his or her IR 12 form. This ensures that the repayment deduction is made in addition to the normal PAYE deductions. Alternatively, a borrower may apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code certificate (IR 23). The IR 23 replaces the tax code declaration part of the IR 12. Inland Revenue will calculate a rate that incorporates the Student Loan repay- ment. The employer will then be required to deduct tax at the specified rate shown on the special tax code certificate. In this case, assuming the borrower does not have a special tax code certificate, she must notify the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Cor- poration (ACC) of her tax code - “G ED”. This will ensure that the appropriate rate of 10 cents in every dollar over $13,884 is deducted by ACC each pay period along with PAYE. 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Bad debts - deductibility Rating:••• Case:Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR HC M.338/94 and M.761/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 104 and 106(1)(b) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 7 and DJ 1(a)) Keywords:bad debts, remitted or extinguished, deductible Summary:The High Court found that: (i) a deed agreeing not to pursue the debt against the debtor did not remit or extinguish the debt; (ii) the debt did not have to be written off in the income year the debt became bad; and (iii) the debt was de- ductible and a loss was available to be carried forward from the 1991 income year to the 1992 income year. Facts:Budget Rent A Car Ltd (“Budget”) carried on business in New Zealand as a motor vehicle rental company. In 1989, BRACS, a subsidiary company, owed Budget approximately $2.7 million. BRACS subsequently went into liquidation. As a result of the liquidation, in July 1990 Budget entered into a deed of cov- enant with BRACS providing that among other things, Budget would not pur- sue the debt of $2.7 million owed by BRACS. Budget then wrote off the debt in its books in November 1990, and sought to claim the debt as a deduction in its income year ended 30 September 1991. In making the assessment for the year ended 30 September 1991, the Commis- sioner disallowed the claim for the deduction of the debt and as a result, also disallowed the carrying forward of a loss from the 1991 income year to the 1992 income year. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction for the debt on the grounds that the deed of covenant remitted or extinguished the debt. There was no debt in existence to write off in the 1991 income year. Decision:Justice Tompkins considered the issues under two broad headings: (i) was the debt remitted or extinguished by the deed of covenant; and (ii) could Budget write off the debt in the 1991 income year? 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) On the first issue, Justice Tompkins accepted the Commissioner’s submission that for a taxpayer to deduct from its assessable income the amount of a bad debt written off there must at the time of the write off be a debt in existence. If a debt has been effectively released, the effect is to extinguish it or put an end to its existence. The question therefore was whether the parties, when they entered into the deed of covenant, intended to extinguish the debt. Justice Tompkins found, when having regard to the words the parties used, viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances, that the intention of the parties was to keep the debt in existence. Budget was entitled to write off the debt as bad. Although no action can be brought to recover the debt, the debt remains in existence and can be pleaded as a defence by way of set off. Therefore if the liquidators of BRACS brought a claim against Budget, the latter company would be able to set off the amount due to it as a defence to that claim. On the second issue, His Honour considered whether the write off of a bad debt had to occur in the same income year in which the debt became bad. In relation to bad debts, there was a connection between sections 104 and 106(1)(b). The requirements of both sections had to be satisfied. A bad debt is not normally deductible. It becomes a deductible debt if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income and is written off. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt to be writ- ten off in the year the debt became bad. Justice Tompkins held that Budget was entitled to write the debt off during the 1992 income year, even though the debt became a bad debt during the 1991 income year. As a result, Budget was entitled to carry forward a loss from the 1991 income year to the 1992 income year. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Share write-off - loss deductible Rating:••• Case:TRA 93/235 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(e), 104(a) and 106(1)(a) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 4(c),BB 7(a) and BB 8(a)) Keywords:share of shares, deduction of loss, purpose for resale Summary:The Taxation Review Authority established on the facts that the objectors had purchased shares for the purpose of resale and that the loss incurred on the write-off of the shares was deductible under section 65(2)(e). The Commissioner had acted incorrectly in disallowing the objectors’ claim for a deduction for the write-off of shares. Facts:The objectors were trustees of a family trust (“the trust”) which was established on 26 October 1979. The trust was intended to be an investment trust acquiring a balanced portfolio of property and other investments. It was the trustees’ inten- tion that the trust actively trade in shares in order to make gains. On 2 November 1987 the trust purchased 250,000 discounted Equiticorp shares for $867,500. The trust intended to turn over the shares quickly in order to take advantage of the expected short term gains on such shares. Shortly after the trust acquired the shares the sharemarket crashed. continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Acting on the advice of its accountant the trust decided to hold all the shares until the share price recovered. The share price did not recover and in January 1989 Equiticorp went into statutory management. The trust wrote off the shares for accounting purposes in the 1989 income year. The trust’s accountant was of the view that the shares could not be written off for tax purposes until the loss was certain. Certainty was not determined until Equiticorp was delisted in May 1989. An amended 1990 income tax return was filed claiming a deduction of $867,500 for the write-off of Equiticorp shares. The issues was whether the Equiticorp shares were acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of them within section 65(2)(e). Decision:Judge Barber found in favour of the trust and held that the loss on sale of Equiticorp shares was deductible under section 65(2)(e). Judge Barber found that the trust succeeded on the ground that the shares were acquired on revenue account as circulating capital by virtue of the second limb of section 65(2)(e), in terms of CIR v Inglis \[1992\] 14 NZTC 9,180. Judge Barber said that the essential issue arising in this case was whether or not there was a purpose of resale of the Equiticorp shares by or on behalf of the trust at the time of purchase. His Honour stated that in his view the decision would in effect turn on his findings as to the credibility of the evidence heard by him. Looking at the evidence before him, Judge Barber found that as a matter of fact the trust had purchased the shares for short term investment and for resale and that was the dominant purpose at the time of the purchase. His Honour ac- cepted that the trust’s intention was to take advantage of the discounted price at which the shares were offered, wait for the price to move back up, and realise the gain by selling. Judge Barber did not think that the trustees and their advisers could be blamed for thinking at some time that the loss was not deductible. He said that when the loss took place it was understandable for the accountant and the trust to think that it was doubtful that the loss was deductible, given that section 65(2)(e) was then a grey area of law.

Retirement village development - GST input credits not claimable Rating:••• Case:Norfolk Apartments Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212. Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 2(1), 14, 20(3) Keywords:retirement village, principal purpose, common areas, dwelling Summary:The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court, which had decided that the Commissioner had acted correctly in disallowing the taxpayer’s objec- tion to an assessment. The objection related to disallowed claims for input tax deductions or refunds of GST associated with the purchase of land and the costs of construction of a retirement village. Facts:The taxpayer acquired land and constructed a retirement village. Residents purchased a licence to occupy a particular unit and a garage, and an ancillary right to use common areas, such as corridors, stairwells, parking areas, the grounds and recreation areas. from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) The right to use and enjoy the common areas was provided by an ancillary company, Norfolk Apartments Management Limited, to which the residents paid an apartment service fee. The taxpayer claimed an input tax deduction on the costs of acquiring the land and of construction. The Commissioner disal- lowed the claim. In the High Court, Justice Robertson held that the taxpayer’s principal purpose in purchasing the land, and developing and constructing the apartments was to supply accommodation to residents in a retirement village. This is an exempt supply under section 14. There was an associated supplementary intention to carry on a taxable activity by the provision of additional services, but this was an ancillary or incidental purpose. The building was not a commercial dwelling. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the land was ac- quired and the construction costs incurred in order to create a retirement village complex. This amounted to the provision of a package to the residents, which included the common facilities. It claimed that there were two purposes and two supplies - exempt supplies of apartments and taxable supplies of the common areas and facilities. The taxpayer submitted that its principal purpose was not the provision of retirement accommodation. In support of this argument, the taxpayer pointed to the fact that two thirds of the land purchased was not re- quired for the erection of the apartment building. It also argued that the defini- tion of “dwelling” did not include the land surrounding the building. Decision:The Court rejected the taxpayer’s submission that its principal purpose was not the provision of retirement accommodation. The taxpayer’s principal purpose in acquiring and developing the land was to be able to provide accommodation in dwellings situated within a retirement village. That was an exempt supply. No input tax deduction was available. The defini- tion of “dwelling” meant not only the building or premises, but also “any appur- tenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it”. The common areas, including the grounds, were appurtenances to the dwellings. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Reopening assessments - limitation periods Rating:••• Case:Hutchinson Brothers Limited v CIR, HC 216/94,26 July 1995 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 25(1) and 76(1) (Tax Administration Act 1994 - section 108; Income Tax Act 1994 - section EC 1) Keywords:adjustment, assessment, preceding period Summary:Section 25 prohibits an adjustment under section 76 for understatements of income for any income year more than four years before the adjustment is made. An adjustment is in effect an alteration of an assessment. In terms of section 25 that alteration occurs when the Commissioner’s decision to make the adjustment is conveyed to the objector, rather than the date on which the notice of assess- ment giving effect to that decision is issued. Facts:In 1992, Inland Revenue advised the taxpayer that its income for the 1991 in- come year (the year of adjustment) would include amounts of rebates to which it was entitled in the years 1987 to 1991. The taxpayer did not object to the inclu- sion of the rebates for the years 1989 to 1991, but contended that the rebates for the years 1987 and 1988 were statute-barred by section 25. This was on the basis that although the Commissioner notified the taxpayer of his decision to include continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) these rebates in 1992, he did not issue a notice of assessment until 1993 and therefore was statute-barred from doing so for the 1987 and 1988 years. The parties accepted that • Section 76 entitles the Commissioner to add to the assessable income in the year of adjustment, the understatements of assessable income in previous years. The amount of that understatement becomes part of the assessable income in the year of adjustment. • Section 25 bars the Commissioner from altering an assessment after four years have expired from the end of the year in which the original assessment was issued. The Commissioner contended that section 25 did not apply to an adjustment by the Commissioner under section 76. This was because such an adjustment did not require the Commissioner “to alter the assessment” made in respect of the earlier year. On the contrary section 76 authorised the Commissioner to adjust the assessable income in the year of adjustment so that what was being altered was the assessment for that year, not the assessment for the earlier year. The taxpayer contended that the Commissioner was using section 76 as a “back door” route to avoid section 25. Decision:Justice Tompkins considered the scheme of the Act, and noted that when the legislature had intended that the four year limitation imposed by section 25 was not to apply in respect of specific provisions of the Act, it had said so. This was not the case in respect of section 76. His Honour concluded that when the Commissioner makes an adjustment under section 76, he is in effect altering the assessments relating to the earlier years. He held that the Commissioner was barred by section 25 from making an adjust- ment to include in the assessable income for the year of adjustment, amounts in respect of income years more than four years before the making of the adjust- ment. As for the point of time when the limitation period started running, he consid- ered three possible times: first, the time when the Commissioner decided to make the adjustment, second, the time when that decision was conveyed to the objector, and third, the time when the notice of assessment giving effect to that decision was issued. He followed authorities which stated that an assessment is not a piece of paper, it is an official act or operation. Neither the paper sent nor the notification it gives is the assessment, which is and remains the act or opera- tion of the Commissioner. He concluded that the Commissioner in effect altered the assessment at the time when, having arrived at the decision to make the adjustment, he conveyed that decision to the objector. The consequence of this was that the 1987 rebate should not have been included in the 1991 year. Comment:Neither the Commissioner nor the taxpayer have yet decided whether to appeal this decision. from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Judicial review - issuing of an amended income tax assessment Rating:••• Case:Golden Bay Cement Company Ltd v CIR Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 25, section 191(8) (Tax Administration Act 1994 - section 108, Income Tax Act 1994 - section OF 2(2)). Keywords:judicial review, single joint assessment, amended assessments Summary:The applicant sought a judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision to issue an amended assessment. The applicant challenged the validity of the assessment on the basis that it was issued outside the four years permitted under section 25. The High Court found in favour of the Commissioner. Justice Fisher considered that the amended assessment could be regarded as five distinct assessments for the purposes of section 25. Accordingly, Justice Fisher held that the amended assessment was invalid insofar as it related to Golden Bay Concrete and Gravel Limited. Facts:The applicant, Golden Bay Cement Company Ltd (“Golden Bay”), had four wholly-owned subsidiaries consisting of Waitomo Portland Cement Ltd (“Waitomo”), Wilsons NZ Portland Cement Ltd (“Wilsons”), Golden Bay Con- crete and Gravel Ltd (“Gravel”) and Delta Petroleum Ltd (“Delta”). These five companies constituted a group of companies for the purposes of section 191. In 1984, the companies applied to the Commissioner for a joint assessment under section 191(8). The Commissioner allowed the request and the application was treated as a standing arrangement for the succeeding years. For the financial year ended 31 March 1987 each of the five members of the group filed separate returns. Inland Revenue’s practice was to enter a zero in the computerised ledger for the individual member when that member’s return was received and considered. The zero assessment was an internal processing arrangement and notification was not given to the member concerned. The assessable incomes and losses of all members of the group would be aggregated and a single joint assessment issued to a nominated member of the group. Inland Revenue’s practice was not adhered to for the 1987 year and notices of assessment were individually issued to three of the members of the group. On 22 August 1988 the Commissioner issued a joint assessment for the whole group to the nominated member, Golden Bay. In 1992 the Commissioner learned that there has been a major change in the group’s shareholding and subse- quently issued an amended joint assessment. Golden Bay objected to the validity of the amended assessment and filed judicial review proceedings. Issue:The High Court considered two issues: • whether the individual assessments made in 1987 for Waitomo, Wilsons and Gravel were valid assessments for the purposes of section 19 and section 25 • whether it was competent for the Commissioner to make an individual as- sessment for an individual member when there was a standing arrangement between the group and the Commissioner that there would be joint assess- ments. continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) Decision:Justice Fisher held that the individual notices of assessment made in 1987 would be valid provided they were “assessments” for the purpose of section 19 and section 25. His Honour referred to Justice Richardson’s statutory interpretation of “assessment” in CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,150 to determine whether the individual notices amounted to an assessment. Based on the principles in that case Justice Fisher considered that to constitute an assess- ment four elements would normally be required: • The Commissioner’s consideration of the facts then in his possession concern- ing the relevant financial affairs of the taxpayer. • The Commissioner’s exercise of judgment to determine the taxpayer’s taxable income and consequent tax liability. • The Commissioner’s identification of the specified sum of money due and payable as tax. Justice Fisher found that the “zero” assessments issued to Waitomo and Wilsons were not “assessments” for the purpose of section 19 and section 25. He said that “it is not the form of the documentation that matters but its substance”. There was no evidence to suggest that the elements of an “assessment” existed. Justice Fisher held that the first assessments for the 1987 income year were made as part of the single joint assessment of 22 August 1988 and accordingly the amended assessment, in relation to Waitomo and Wilsons, was made within the pre- scribed four year period. Justice Fisher reached a different conclusion for Gravel. He found that there was a genuine attempt to assess Gravel’s actual tax liability and that the steps actu- ally followed by the Commissioner amounted to an actual assessment. He held that the individual notice of assessment was a valid assessment and conse- quently the 1992 amended joint assessment was out of time insofar as it related to Gravel. On the second issue, Justice Fisher held even though the Commissioner had accepted the request for a joint assessment this did not nullify the Commission- er’s statutory discretion to determine otherwise for subsequent years. Justice Fisher found that it was competent for the Commissioner to make an individual assessment for an individual member of the group. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. When transactions by superannuation scheme trustees constitute “dealing in shares” Rating:••••• Case:Trustees of Alexander and Alexander Pension Plan v CIR, Auckland High Court M1048/94 M531/95 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(a), 65(2)(e) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 4(a), BB 4(c)) Keywords:dealing in shares Summary:Whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business of dealing in shares is “a question of fact and degree.” The issue had to be decided objectively, not subjectively, and the frequency of share dealing transactions is often decisive. A superannuation scheme which has 176 share transactions in a three year period (i.e., an average of more than one a week) is in the business of dealing in from page 35 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) shares for the purposes of section 65(2)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. This is despite the fact that the transactions were carried out in order to comply with a weightings investment system rather than for the purpose of making a profit. Facts:The trustees of a superannuation scheme employed a professional fund manager to manage its investments. The fund was for an indefinite duration. The trustees invested on a long term basis. Part of the capital was always to be invested in shares which they bought with the intention of retaining as part of the fund. Having decided what proportion of the fund was to be invested in the sharemarket, the manager decided regularly what shares were to be acquired, what shares were to be sold, what rights were to be sold, etc. These decisions were within strict parameters and in accordance with previously-decided weightings. The overall purpose was to manage and supervise the assets in order to ensure that there were no more losses than were inevitable in trading in the sharemarket and that the fund was prudently managed so that the trustees’ statutory and fiduciary obligations were properly discharged. The superannua- tion scheme had 176 share transactions in a three year period i.e., an average of more than one a week. Decision:Justice Temm held that during those years it was in the business of dealing in shares for the purposes of s.65(2)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. He followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in CIR v Rangatira Ltd (184/94, 24 May 1995), covered on page 29 of TIB Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995). No doubt the trus- tees did not wish to trade in shares, and no doubt also their intentions through- out were to meet their obligations to act prudently, to protect the fund from erosion and to comply with a weightings investment system rather than for the purpose of making a profit. But the many share transactions made on their behalf during the period in question led to the conclusion that the fund was dealing in shares within the meaning of s 65(2) (e) during that period. In holding that the taxpayer was in the business of dealing in shares, he rejected a number of arguments made on behalf of the trustees, that: • The weighting system dictated the need to sell shares even on a rising mar- ket, whereas a trader would not sell until the market had reached or neared its peak; • Shares were sold at times because of a significant change in the market, such as the offering of shares by an important new company, which might necessi- tate a selling of other shares in order to retain the weightings. • The weighting system caused sales to be made to keep the prescribed balance between the various share investments and that such sales were not made for the purpose of making a profit; • Many of the sales were dictated by the need to comply with the weightings system and that some of these sales were of parts only of a shareholding. • Some sales took place at a loss because prudent management dictated liqui- dating the investment in some companies. He also dismissed alternative arguments by the Commissioner, that: • The trustees’ equity investments were assessable under section 65(2)(a) as part of their “business activity.” They were not in business at all. They had no customers, they were not trading in the ordinary business sense, and their sole purpose was to discharge their statutory and fiduciary obligations to act prudently in managing the fund. • For the purposes of s 65(2)(a), a superannuation fund is in business in a similar sense to a life insurance company. continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.3 (September 1995) • The profits were assessable under the “second and third limbs” of s 65(2)(e) as being derived from property acquired for the purpose of selling or other disposal, or from the carrying on of an undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit. He held that the activities of the trustees were for investment purposes and not for the purpose of taking a profit. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision.
