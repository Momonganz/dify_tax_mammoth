Signature Employer name Please read the notes on the back of this form. If details for more than two employees need amending for this pay date, attach additional amendment forms and show the pay date on each form. Use a separate form for each pay date that needs amendment. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Example After checking their wage records, an employer notices that Tony Lee was paid an extra $100 backpay from which $22.20 PAYE was deducted. This was paid separately from his normal pay and missed from the employer schedule sent in. An amendment is required to Tony's gross earnings and PAYE details for that month. As the backpay was taxed at the lowest rate, the lump sum payment circle also needs to be ticked. Underpayment or overpayment of deductions Use these boxes to work out whether the changes made for this period result in an under or overpayment of deductions. Original total deductions (A) New total deductions (B) Difference (A-B) If B is greater than A, the changes result in an underpayment-please make your payment electronically for the additional amount. If A is greater than B, you have overpaid - please show how you want the overpayment treated by ticking one of the circles on the front of this form. If you want the overpayment transferred to another tax type, please complete the panel below detailing the other tax type and period and the amount to be transferred. Tax type Period ending Amount Please provide a brief explanation to support the changes you have made. Notes Use this form to tell us about changes that need to be made to an Employment information - IR348 you've already sent in. The form can only be used for amendments to one pay period details. If changes cover more than one pay period, please use a separate form for each pay date. Alternatively, to correct an Employment information - IR348 you have already sent in, call us on 0800 377 772 and we will do it for you. You have 4 years from the date you originally send an Employment information – IR348 form to make any changes. After 4 years, your assessment becomes final and changes can only be made to student loan or child support deductions. ESCT Amendments If you're required to amend your ESCT, please complete the ESCT (Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax) amendment field. Please add your amendment figures for 'Original details sent" and "Changed to" under the category that describes the amendment. If the amendment is due to: • a n employee opting out or closing their KiwiSaver account, we’ll refund these amounts to you if you have no amounts owing. • a n overpayment, this will be used firstly to offset any outstanding amounts you owe Inland Revenue otherwise we will refund this to you. Student loan deduction changes If an employee had more than one type of student loan deduction made for the month, eg, M SL and SLCIR, and the deduction amount for one of these needs amending, please complete the field requiring adjustment. You need to complete extra deductions separately in either SLCIR or SLBOR. Amendments to employee's details If an amendment is required to an employee's pay details or tax code, please give us their name and IRD number with the original figures or tax codes sent in and what these should be changed to. Do not use this form to add a finish date for an employee. Please do this on your next Employment information - IR348. If all an employee's details were missed off your schedule, complete the "changed to" lines only. If the missed details are for a new employee, please show their tax code and start date. We only need to know the figures or tax codes that require changing and the changes that need to be made, so the details we hold match those in your wage records. Please keep details of any amendments as we may need to see them at a later date. Note: We may charge you use of money interest for under payments of $100 or more. Underpaid Overpaid(tick one)

The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in someone else's home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, eg, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. IR56 taxpayers aren't self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 1 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 2 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 6 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 3 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 4 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. ird.govt.nz 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 8 4 Send in your New employee details - IR346 form You’ll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don’t receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don’t need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 25. Note ird.govt.nz 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 20. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SB SL, S SL, SH SL or ST SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, eg, $374 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, ie, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self- calculating method see page 13. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $85.59.

self-calculating and secondary tax code options Based on the examples on the previous pages, by using the self-calculating method, you'd pay $85.59 less than you would if you used an S tax code, but almost the same amount as if you used the SB tax code. Option Tax to pay Self-calculating method $85.59 Secondary code $136.00 Difference $50.41 Self-calculating method $85.59 SB code (use only if your expected income from all sources will be less than $14,000 a year) $85.60 Difference $0.01 Completing the Tax code declaration - IR330 When you've worked out which tax code to use, you need to complete an IR330 tax code declaration form. You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. ird.govt.nz 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee details - IR346 form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE.

Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (eg, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families Tax Credits • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you don't meet the criteria for any part of a month you won't qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we’ll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. ird.govt.nz 21 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, ie home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand based representatives of overseas companies and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can’t opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount at box 7 of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can’t opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 22 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note ird.govt.nz 23 Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You’ll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. To find out more about online filing you can attend one of our employer workshops/seminars being run throughout the country - ird.govt.nz/contact-us When to make payments You must pay PAYE monthly. PAYE deducted in one month is due by the 20th of the following month. Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 25. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 24 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you’re paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to “employer deductions” and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT. Example Particulars100100100Your IRD number Payee code0 00TAXDEDPayee code must be 000 space TAX space DED Reference3 0042016 Your return period end date with no spaces or dashes By post If you post us a cheque for payment: • • make your cheque payable to Inland Revenue • • cross it "Not transferable" • • post it with the payment slip • • never send cash. When sending a cheque, write the following on the reverse side: • • your IRD number • • tax type • • the month the payment is for. Example 100-100-100-PAYE-30/04/2016 Note ird.govt.nz 25 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren’t paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you’ll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You’ll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it’s overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you’ll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 26 End-of-year responsibilities IR56 taxpayers whose only income is from IR56 income, salary or wages, Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends and we are satisfied we have all your income details we will automatically complete your end-of-year income tax assessment and advise you of the result. If you received any other type of income apart from IR56 income, salary or wages (with PAYE deducted), Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends, you must file an IR3 return.

The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in someone else's home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, eg, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. IR56 taxpayers aren't self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 1 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 2 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 6 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 3 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 4 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. ird.govt.nz 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 8 4 Send in your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form You'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don't receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don't need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 25. Note ird.govt.nz 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 20. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SA, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, eg, $390 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, ie, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self- calculating method see page 13. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $85.59.

You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. ird.govt.nz 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE.

Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax. Student loans If you have a student loan you must use the "SL Loan ded" column that corresponds to your tax code to calculate your repayment amount. Remember that your tax code must be one of the following: • • M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL if you have a student loan.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (eg, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families Tax Credits • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you don't meet the criteria for any part of a month you won't qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we'll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. ird.govt.nz 21 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, ie home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand based representatives of overseas companies and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount at box 7 of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 22 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note ird.govt.nz 23 Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. To find out more about online filing you can attend one of our employer workshops/seminars being run throughout the country - ird.govt.nz/contact-us When to make payments You must pay PAYE monthly. PAYE deducted in one month is due by the 20th of the following month. Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 25. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 24 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you're paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to "employer deductions" and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT.

If you are a: • salary and/or wage earner, press '1' (salary and wages) then '5' (credit/debit card payment) • self-employed individual or non-individual, press '2' (business enquiries) then '4' (credit/debit card payment). Payments you make using your credit card or debit card will incur a fee. ird.govt.nz 25 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren't paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you'll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You'll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it's overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you'll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 26 End-of-year responsibilities IR56 taxpayers whose only income is from IR56 income, salary or wages, Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends and we are satisfied we have all your income details we will automatically complete your end-of-year income tax assessment and advise you of the result.

The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in their employer’s home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, eg, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. A person cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if they are self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 1 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 2 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 6 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 3 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 4 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. ird.govt.nz 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 8 4 Send in your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form You'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don't receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don't need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 25. Note ird.govt.nz 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 20. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SA, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, eg, $409 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, ie, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self- calculating method see page 13. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $86.10.

Option Tax to pay Self-calculating method $86.10 Secondary code $136.51 Difference $50.41 Self-calculating method $86.10 SB code (use only if your expected income from all sources will be less than $14,000 a year) $86.11 Difference $0.01 Completing the Tax code declaration - IR330 When you've worked out which tax code to use, you need to complete an IR330 tax code declaration form. You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. ird.govt.nz 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE. Note ird.govt.nz 15 Example - IR56 summary form April 2022 Earnings as an IR56 taxpayer with NO PAYE deducted Payer's name Gross earning (with no PAYE deducted) Transfer to "gross earnings and/or schedular payments" box on your Employment information - IR348 form. Total gross A Earnings with PAYE deducted (salary and wages) Payer's name Gross earning (before PAYE deducted) PAYE deducted by employer BC Total grossTotal PAYE Total combined gross earnings Add Box A and B D PAYE (from PAYE tables) on combined total gross earnings in Box D E Total PAYE paid from Box C F PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. This is your balance of PAYE to pay. G Transfer to Box 3 on your Employment information - IR348 form. Keep the IR56 summary for your records - don't send the form to us. Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (eg, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families Tax Credits • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you don't meet the criteria for any part of a month you won't qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we'll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. ird.govt.nz 21 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, ie home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand based representatives of overseas companies and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount at box 7 of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 22 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note ird.govt.nz 23 Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. To find out more about online filing you can attend one of our employer workshops/seminars being run throughout the country - ird.govt.nz/contact-us When to make payments You must pay PAYE monthly. PAYE deducted in one month is due by the 20th of the following month. Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 25. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 24 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you're paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to "employer deductions" and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT.

If you are a: • salary and/or wage earner, press '1' (salary and wages) then '5' (credit/debit card payment) • self-employed individual or non-individual, press '2' (business enquiries) then '4' (credit/debit card payment). Payments you make using your credit card or debit card will incur a fee. ird.govt.nz 25 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren't paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you'll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You'll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it's overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you'll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 26 End-of-year responsibilities IR56 taxpayers whose only income is from IR56 income, salary or wages, Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends and we are satisfied we have all your income details we will automatically complete your end-of-year income tax assessment and advise you of the result.

The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in their employer’s home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, for example, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. A person cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if they are self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. George who lives in New Zealand, is employed by a US based architecture company. George participates in virtual meetings and completes all of his work in New Zealand which is sent back to the US electronically. If the US company does not have sufficient presence in NZ for an obligation to deduct PAYE, George would have to account for his own tax through the New Zealand tax system as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information on ‘sufficient presence’ go to: taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04 Example 1 Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 2 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 6 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 3 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 4 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 5 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. ird.govt.nz 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/irdnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 8 4 Send in your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form You'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don't receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don't need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 26. Note ird.govt.nz 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 21. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SA, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, for example, $439 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, that is, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self-calculating method see page 13. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $86.10.

You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. ird.govt.nz 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. Employees of overseas employers will need to keep records of non-cash benefits received and employer superannuation contributions to include in your Employment Information - IR348 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE.

Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax.

REVENUE 18 Completing your Employment information - IR348 Every month you must complete and send in an Employment information - IR348 form. The due date is within 10 working days from the end of the month. The form needs to be completed with the following details: • • pay day date - this the last day of the month (for example, 30th) • • employment start (the date you started as an IR56 taxpayer) or finish date (the date you finished being an IR56 taxpayer) these only need to be shown once, in the month they occur • • enter MT in the pay frequency box • • pay period start and finish - this is the first and last days of the month • • gross earnings • • PAYE deducted (this is the tax you have calculated for your IR56 income) • • student loan deductions (if applicable) • • KiwiSaver deductions (if applicable) - see page 22. If you file by paper you need to write your name, IRD number and tax code on the first couple of forms. After that this information will be pre-printed on them. Electronic filing You might prefer to file your forms online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. Student loans If you have a student loan, you're required to use one of the SL tax codes - M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL - to determine the student loan repayment deductions from your earnings. You also need to show a tax code with the "SL" student loan repayment code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Child support Inland Revenue assesses and collects child support from parents who don't live with their children or have shared care. For more information on how to make child support payments, go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call us on 0800 221 221. ird.govt.nz 19 Employees of an overseas employer If you live in New Zealand and your overseas employer does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand, you have an obligation to register as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information on ‘sufficient presence’ go to: taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04 You will not need to register as an IR56 taxpayer if your employer registers as an employer with Inland Revenue or arranges for another person to undertake employment-related tax obligations for you. Our proposed changes (from 1 April 2023), mean that if you are a New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and received non-cash benefits (also known as a fringe benefit), you will have to include these benefits as gross income in your Employment Information – IR348 (EI) return. You will also need to include any employer superannuation contributions. Calculating non-cash benefits from your employer If you receive any kind of non-cash benefit, for example health insurance, you must include the value of the benefit as part of your gross income in the EI return. If the non-cash benefit is paid regularly, for example monthly, simply include the value of the non-cash benefit as gross income in the EI return and tax accordingly. You can use the PAYE calculator to do this, go to ird.govt.nz/self-calculate-ir56 If it is a lump sum, you will need to calculate the PAYE on it separately to your salary. Then you will need to combine these in your EI return, go to ird.govt.nz/calculate-lump-sum-paye If you receive a Working for Families entitlement and receive any kind of non-cash benefit, you will need to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form. Any non-cash benefits received are not adjustable in your student loan obligation, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/eoy-adjustments Calculating superannuation If your employer contributes to a superannuation scheme or fund, you need to account for Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT). There are two options: • • Add this in the EI ESCT field, go to ird.govt.nz/esct or • • opt for it to be taxed as PAYE. This means your income is increased and now included for Working for Families, child support, independent earner tax credit and any student loan payments, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/paye-esct-deductions IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 20 IR348 April 2020 DeclarationI declare that the information given in this return is true and correct.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (for example, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you do not meet the criteria for any part of a month you will not qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we'll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 22 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, that is, home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount in the ‘Net KiwiSaver employer contributions’ box of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • cannot opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. ird.govt.nz 23 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register.

PAYE deducted in one month is due by the 20th of the following month. Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 26. ird.govt.nz 25 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you're paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to "employer deductions" and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT.

IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 26 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren't paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you'll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You'll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it's overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you'll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). ird.govt.nz 27 End-of-year responsibilities IR56 taxpayers whose only income is from IR56 income, salary or wages, Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends and we are satisfied we have all your income details we will automatically complete your end-of-year income tax assessment and advise you of the result. If you received any other type of income apart from IR56 income, salary or wages (with PAYE deducted), Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends, you must file an IR3 return. If you have made any donations of $5 or more to an approved donee organisation you can claim tax credits on the donation. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/donations If you have donated through payroll giving you have already received the credit and can't claim for it again.

The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in their employer’s home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, for example, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. A person cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if they are self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. George who lives in New Zealand, is employed by a US based architecture company. George participates in virtual meetings and completes all of his work in New Zealand which is sent back to the US electronically. If the US company does not have sufficient presence in NZ for an obligation to deduct PAYE, George would have to account for his own tax through the New Zealand tax system as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information on ‘sufficient presence’ go to: taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04 Example 1 Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 2 ird.govt.nz 6 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 3 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 4 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 5 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/irdnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/register-ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. ird.govt.nz 8 4 Send in your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form You'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don't receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don't need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 26. Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 21. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SA, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, for example, $464 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, that is, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self-calculating method see page 13. ird.govt.nz 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $87.58.

You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. Employees of overseas employers will need to keep records of non-cash benefits received and employer superannuation contributions to include in your Employment Information - IR348 ird.govt.nz 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE.

This is your balance of PAYE to pay. G Transfer to Box 3 on your Employment information - IR348 form. Keep the IR56 summary for your records - don't send the form to us. Note ird.govt.nz 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax. Student loans If you have a student loan you must use the ‘SL Loan ded’ column that corresponds to your tax code to calculate your repayment amount.

The due date is within 10 working days from the end of the month. The form needs to be completed with the following details: • • pay day date - this the last day of the month (for example, 30th) • • employment start (the date you started as an IR56 taxpayer) or finish date (the date you finished being an IR56 taxpayer) these only need to be shown once, in the month they occur • • enter MT in the pay frequency box • • pay period start and finish - this is the first and last days of the month • • gross earnings • • PAYE deducted (this is the tax you have calculated for your IR56 income) • • student loan deductions (if applicable) • • KiwiSaver deductions (if applicable) - see page 22. If you file by paper you need to write your name, IRD number and tax code on the first couple of forms. After that this information will be pre-printed on them. Electronic filing You might prefer to file your forms online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. Student loans If you have a student loan, you're required to use one of the SL tax codes - M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL - to determine the student loan repayment deductions from your earnings. You also need to show a tax code with the "SL" student loan repayment code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Child support Inland Revenue assesses and collects child support from parents who don't live with their children or have shared care.

IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 19 Employees of an overseas employer If you live in New Zealand and your overseas employer does not have an obligation to register as an employer in New Zealand, you have an obligation to register as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information refer to ird.govt.nz/ir56 You will not need to register as an IR56 taxpayer if your employer registers as an employer with Inland Revenue or arranges for another person to undertake employment-related tax obligations for you. From 1 April 2023, if you are a New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and received non-cash benefits (also known as a fringe benefit), you will have to include these benefits as gross income in your Employment Information – IR348 (EI) return. You will also need to include any employer superannuation contributions. Calculating non-cash benefits from your employer If you receive any kind of non-cash benefit, for example health insurance, you must include the value of the benefit as part of your gross income in the EI return. If the non-cash benefit is paid regularly, for example monthly, simply include the value of the non-cash benefit as gross income in the EI return and tax accordingly. You can use the PAYE calculator to do this, go to ird.govt.nz/self-calculate-ir56 If it is a lump sum, you will need to calculate the PAYE on it separately to your salary. Then you will need to combine these in your EI return, go to ird.govt.nz/calculate-lump-sum-paye If you buy or are given shares/share options from your employer for free or below market value, that is considered employment income as employee share scheme (ESS) benefit. You must include the taxable value of the ESS benefit in your EI return. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/essfiling If you receive a Working for Families entitlement and receive any kind of non-cash benefit, you will need to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form. Any non-cash benefits received are not adjustable in your student loan obligation, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/eoy-adjustments Calculating superannuation If your employer contributes to a superannuation scheme or fund, you need to account for Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT). There are two options: • • Add this in the EI ESCT field, go to ird.govt.nz/esct or • • opt for it to be taxed as PAYE. This means your income is increased and now included for Working for Families, child support, independent earner tax credit and any student loan payments, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/paye-esct-deductions ird.govt.nz 20 IR348 April 2020 DeclarationI declare that the information given in this return is true and correct.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (for example, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you do not meet the criteria for any part of a month you will not qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we'll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. ird.govt.nz 22 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, that is, home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount in the ‘Net KiwiSaver employer contributions’ box of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • cannot opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 23 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. To find out more about online filing you can attend one of our employer workshops/seminars being run throughout the country - ird.govt.nz/seminars ird.govt.nz 24 When to make payments You must pay PAYE monthly.

Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 26. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 25 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you're paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to "employer deductions" and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT.

Payments you make using your credit card or debit card will incur a fee. ird.govt.nz 26 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren't paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you'll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You'll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it's overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you'll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 27 60-day grace period If you are required to deduct tax and have not done this yet, you may have a 60-day grace period to either register as an IR56 taxpayer and/or pay the tax without penalties being applied.

If you have made any donations of $5 or more to an approved donee organisation you can claim tax credits on the donation.

The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in their employer’s home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, for example, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. A person cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if they are self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. George who lives in New Zealand, is employed by a US based architecture company. George participates in virtual meetings and completes all of his work in New Zealand which is sent back to the US electronically. If the US company does not have sufficient presence in NZ for an obligation to deduct PAYE, George would have to account for his own tax through the New Zealand tax system as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information on ‘sufficient presence’ go to: taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04 Example 1 Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 2 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 6 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 3 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 4 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 5 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. ird.govt.nz 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/irdnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 8 4 Send in your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form You'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don't receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don't need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 26. Note ird.govt.nz 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 21. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SA, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, for example, $439 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, that is, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self-calculating method see page 13. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $86.10.

Option Tax to pay Self-calculating method $86.84 Secondary code $137.01 Difference $50.17 Self-calculating method $86.84 SB code (use only if your expected income from all sources will be less than $14,000 a year) $86.61 Difference $0.23 Completing the Tax code declaration - IR330 When you've worked out which tax code to use, you need to complete an IR330 tax code declaration form. You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. ird.govt.nz 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. Employees of overseas employers will need to keep records of non-cash benefits received and employer superannuation contributions to include in your Employment Information - IR348 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE. Note ird.govt.nz 15 Example - IR56 summary form April 2023 Earnings as an IR56 taxpayer with NO PAYE deducted Payer's name Gross earning (with no PAYE deducted) Transfer to "gross earnings and/or schedular payments" box on your Employment information - IR348 form. Total gross A Earnings with PAYE deducted (salary and wages) Payer's name Gross earning (before PAYE deducted) PAYE deducted by employer BC Total grossTotal PAYE Total combined gross earnings Add Box A and B D PAYE (from PAYE tables) on combined total gross earnings in Box D E Total PAYE paid from Box C F PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. This is your balance of PAYE to pay. G Transfer to Box 3 on your Employment information - IR348 form. Keep the IR56 summary for your records - don't send the form to us. Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax. Student loans If you have a student loan you must use the ‘SL Loan ded’ column that corresponds to your tax code to calculate your repayment amount. Remember that your tax code must be one of the following: • • M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL if you have a student loan.

REVENUE 18 Completing your Employment information - IR348 Every month you must complete and send in an Employment information - IR348 form. The due date is within 10 working days from the end of the month. The form needs to be completed with the following details: • • pay day date - this the last day of the month (for example, 30th) • • employment start (the date you started as an IR56 taxpayer) or finish date (the date you finished being an IR56 taxpayer) these only need to be shown once, in the month they occur • • enter MT in the pay frequency box • • pay period start and finish - this is the first and last days of the month • • gross earnings • • PAYE deducted (this is the tax you have calculated for your IR56 income) • • student loan deductions (if applicable) • • KiwiSaver deductions (if applicable) - see page 22. If you file by paper you need to write your name, IRD number and tax code on the first couple of forms. After that this information will be pre-printed on them. Electronic filing You might prefer to file your forms online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. Student loans If you have a student loan, you're required to use one of the SL tax codes - M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL - to determine the student loan repayment deductions from your earnings. You also need to show a tax code with the "SL" student loan repayment code on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Child support Inland Revenue assesses and collects child support from parents who don't live with their children or have shared care. For more information on how to make child support payments, go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call us on 0800 221 221. ird.govt.nz 19 Employees of an overseas employer If you live in New Zealand and your overseas employer does not have an obligation to register as an employer in New Zealand, you have an obligation to register as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information on ‘sufficient presence’ go to: taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04 You will not need to register as an IR56 taxpayer if your employer registers as an employer with Inland Revenue or arranges for another person to undertake employment-related tax obligations for you. From 1 April 2023, if you are a New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and received non-cash benefits (also known as a fringe benefit), you will have to include these benefits as gross income in your Employment Information – IR348 (EI) return. You will also need to include any employer superannuation contributions. Calculating non-cash benefits from your employer If you receive any kind of non-cash benefit, for example health insurance, you must include the value of the benefit as part of your gross income in the EI return. If the non-cash benefit is paid regularly, for example monthly, simply include the value of the non-cash benefit as gross income in the EI return and tax accordingly. You can use the PAYE calculator to do this, go to ird.govt.nz/self-calculate-ir56 If it is a lump sum, you will need to calculate the PAYE on it separately to your salary. Then you will need to combine these in your EI return, go to ird.govt.nz/calculate-lump-sum-paye If you receive a Working for Families entitlement and receive any kind of non-cash benefit, you will need to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form. Any non-cash benefits received are not adjustable in your student loan obligation, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/eoy-adjustments Calculating superannuation If your employer contributes to a superannuation scheme or fund, you need to account for Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT). There are two options: • • Add this in the EI ESCT field, go to ird.govt.nz/esct or • • opt for it to be taxed as PAYE. This means your income is increased and now included for Working for Families, child support, independent earner tax credit and any student loan payments, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/paye-esct-deductions IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 20 IR348 April 2020 DeclarationI declare that the information given in this return is true and correct.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (for example, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you do not meet the criteria for any part of a month you will not qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we'll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 22 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, that is, home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can't opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount in the ‘Net KiwiSaver employer contributions’ box of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • cannot opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. ird.govt.nz 23 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register.

Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 26. ird.govt.nz 25 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you're paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to "employer deductions" and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT.

IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 26 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren't paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you'll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You'll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it's overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you'll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). ird.govt.nz 27 End-of-year responsibilities IR56 taxpayers whose only income is from IR56 income, salary or wages, Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends and we are satisfied we have all your income details we will automatically complete your end-of-year income tax assessment and advise you of the result. If you received any other type of income apart from IR56 income, salary or wages (with PAYE deducted), Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends, you must file an IR3 return. If you have made any donations of $5 or more to an approved donee organisation you can claim tax credits on the donation. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/donations If you have donated through payroll giving you have already received the credit and can't claim for it again.

An IR56 taxpayer is a worker required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary. They are not self-employed. Examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers include: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in their employer’s home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • do not regularly work full-time, for example, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. You cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if you are self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. George who lives in New Zealand, is employed by a US based architecture company. George participates in virtual meetings and completes all of his work in New Zealand which is sent back to the US electronically. If the US company does not have sufficient presence in NZ for an obligation to deduct PAYE, George would have to account for his own tax through the New Zealand tax system as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information on ‘sufficient presence’ go to: taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-04 Example 1 Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for 8 hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 2 ird.govt.nz 6 Liz cleans houses for 5 different people. She averages around 8 hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she is not working full-time for any 1 employer – she works in the employers’ homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 3 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to 4 hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 4 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for 7 children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She’s not an IR56 taxpayer because she does not fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy’s staff are her employees, so they aren’t IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees’ PAYE. Example 5 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/irdnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply in myIR at ird.govt.nz/register-ir56 or send us a IR56 taxpayer registration - IR359 What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 12 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 15. ird.govt.nz 8 4 Send in your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form You’ll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form in myIR or send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete a Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. You can do this in myIR or if filing by paper, send it to us. If you do not receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you do not need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we do not receive your employment information returns (IR348) and payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 24. Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 9 Selecting your tax code Fill in your personal details and choose your tax code on the Tax code declaration - IR330. Keep this for your records. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 19. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are 3 options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code SB, S, SH, ST, SA or if you have a student loan a SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $15,600 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, for example, $464 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show STC as your tax code on your IR330. For more information see page 12. ird.govt.nz 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of salary, wages or benefit income. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. Monthly PAYE using the self-calculating method is $87.15. This is the amount to pay.

You do not need to fill in a new IR330 each year, unless you need to change it. Apply the new code from the start of the pay period you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records – do not send it to us. ird.govt.nz 12 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for 7 years. They must be in English or Māori, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than 1 source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 28-39 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. Employees of overseas employers will need to keep records of non-cash benefits received and employer superannuation contributions to include in your Employment Information - IR348 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 13 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay.

Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 15 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables online – go to ird.govt.nz/forms-guides 4-weekly and monthly PAYE deductions tables IR341 or use our PAYE calculator – go to ird.govt.nz/PAYEcalculator You can order PAYE tables by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you’re using M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax. Student loans If you have a student loan you must use the ‘SL Loan ded’ column that corresponds to your tax code to calculate your repayment amount. Remember that your tax code must be one of the following: • • M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL if you have a student loan. Secondary tax codes If you’re using a secondary tax code on your IR330 use the SB, S, SH, ST or SA columns at the back of the PAYE tables. The PAYE you calculate goes in column 3 of the IR348 - see page 18. Note ird.govt.nz 16 Completing your Employment information return - IR348 Every month you must complete your Employment information return. The due date is within 10 working days from the end of the month. You can do this in myIR or if filing by paper, send it to us. The form needs to be completed with the following details: • • pay day date - this the last day of the month (for example, 30th) • • employment start (the date you started as an IR56 taxpayer) or finish date (the date you finished being an IR56 taxpayer) these only need to be shown once, in the month they occur • • enter MT in the pay frequency box • • pay period start and finish - this is the first and last days of the month • • gross earnings • • PAYE deducted (this is the tax you have calculated for your IR56 income) • • student loan deductions (if applicable) • • KiwiSaver deductions (if applicable) - see page 20.

Electronic filing You might prefer to file your forms online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. Student loans If you have a student loan, you must use one of the SL tax codes - M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL - to work out the student loan repayment deductions from your earnings. You also need to use one of the SL tax codes on your Tax code declaration - IR330. Child support Inland Revenue assesses and collects child support from parents who do not live with their children or have shared care. For more information on how to make child support payments, go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport or call us on 0800 221 221. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 17 Employees of an overseas employer If you live in New Zealand and your overseas employer does not have an obligation to register as an employer in New Zealand, you have an obligation to register as an IR56 taxpayer. For more information refer to ird.govt.nz/ir56 You will not need to register as an IR56 taxpayer if your employer registers as an employer with Inland Revenue or arranges for another person to undertake employment-related tax obligations for you. If you are a New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and received non-cash benefits (also known as a fringe benefit), you will have to include these benefits as gross income in your Employment Information – IR348 return. You will also need to include any employer superannuation contributions. Calculating non-cash benefits from your employer If you receive any kind of non-cash benefit, for example health insurance, you must include the value of the benefit as part of your gross income in the employment information return. If the non-cash benefit is paid regularly, for example monthly, simply include the value of the non-cash benefit as gross income in the employment information return and tax accordingly. You can use the PAYE calculator to do this, go to ird.govt.nz/self-calculate-ir56 If it is a lump sum, you will need to calculate the PAYE on it separately to your salary. Then you will need to combine these in your employment information return, go to ird.govt.nz/calculate-lump-sum-paye If you buy or are given shares/share options from your employer for free or below market value, that is considered employment income as employee share scheme (ESS) benefit. You must include the taxable value of the ESS benefit in your employment information return. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/essfiling If you receive a Working for Families entitlement and receive any kind of non-cash benefit, you will need to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form. Any non-cash benefits received are not adjustable in your student loan obligation, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/eoy-adjustments Calculating superannuation If your employer contributes to a superannuation scheme or fund, you need to account for Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT). There are 2 options: • • Add this in the employment information ESCT field, go to ird.govt.nz/esct or • • opt for it to be taxed as PAYE. This means your income is increased and now included for Working for Families, child support, independent earner tax credit and any student loan payments, for more information, go to ird.govt.nz/paye-esct-deductions ird.govt.nz 18 IR348 April 2020 DeclarationI declare that the information given in this return is true and correct.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you do not have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (for example, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see the ACC website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $70,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families • • you’re not receiving a Work and Income main benefit, NZ Super, Veteran’s Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you do not meet the criteria for any part of a month you will not qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we'll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. ird.govt.nz 20 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into 2 groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers (home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers). 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • You can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • You cannot opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • You can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • You can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • You must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with the PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount in the ‘Net KiwiSaver employer contributions’ box of your Employment information - IR348.

IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 21 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33% for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you are not able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note Electronic filing You can complete and file your employment information returns (IR348) online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You'll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. To find out more about online filing you can attend one of our employer workshops/seminars being run throughout the country - ird.govt.nz/seminars ird.govt.nz 22 When to make payments You must pay PAYE monthly.

Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for 5 days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 24. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 23 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You do not have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you're paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to "employer deductions" and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT.

Payments you make using your credit card or debit card will incur a fee. ird.govt.nz 24 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 is not filed by the due date. The late filing penalty is $250. You have 30 days to pay the penalty after the end of the month in it is charged in. If the late filing penalties are not paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you’ll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We’ll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We’ll also charge you interest if you do not make your tax payment by the due date. Interest is applied to amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month is not paid by the due date, we’ll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount is not paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we’ll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You’ll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we’ll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you have not paid in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be reduced to 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you cannot pay your tax by the due date, we may agree to an arrangement payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it’s overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you’ll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we may consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable).

IR56 taxpayers are responsible for paying their own PAYE and are not self-employed. Some examples of IR56 taxpayers are: – private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, attendant caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers (see below for more information) – embassy staff – New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer – United States Antarctic Program personnel. Private domestic workers Private domestic workers are people who: – work in their employer’s home – do work for their employer that's not related to the employer's business – are paid direct by their employer, and – don't regularly work full-time. Inland Revenue considers ‘part-time’ employment for private domestic workers to be employment of no more than 30 hours per week, on average, for each employer. If you're one of the above workers and work part-time you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, the employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loans and child support (if any). What happens next? Once we receive your registration we'll send you: • an Employment information - IR348 form • a New Employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form.

The unique situation of each property transaction needs to be considered when working out any tax implication. This guide gives an overview of possible tax issues related to property transactions, but isn't a comprehensive property tax resource. We recommend you talk to a tax professional if your situation isn't covered in this guide or you're unclear about anything. Any of these situations could apply to a property transaction. You: make a gain or loss from property speculating or dealing move from property investment into property dealing when prices are rising are a property dealer and you hold and rent properties during a downturn are a first-time landlord and don't think about the tax implications of renting your property are a shareholder or an owner of an interest in a look-through company (LTC) or partnership that owns a rental property buy an investment apartment with a managed lease and later change the rental arrangements or sell it sell a rental property you've claimed depreciation on become a dealer because you've made a number of purchase and sale transactions apply for GST registration when you buy property for dealing or speculation purchase a property on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sell it within two years purchase a property on or after 29 March 2018 and sell it within five years. Note Property means land (including a bare section) and buildings, options or interests in "off-the-plan" properties. Purchase means any form of acquisition of the property including transfers or gifts. Sale means any form of disposal of the property including transfers or gifts. If you're in any doubt concerning your property dealings, we strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing.

However, they're each treated very differently under tax law. In this guide we refer to speculators, dealers and investors and the bright-line test. Four main factors can determine your status as a property buyer for tax purposes: your intention when you buy a property the patterns of your previous property transactions your association to a builder, property dealer or developer the bright-line test for residential property. An investor – buys a property to generate ongoing rental income and not with any firm intention to resell it. The property is a capital asset and any profit or loss from selling the property is capital and not taxable (apart from clawing back any depreciation, which is now recoverable). The rules may be different if you've been associated with a person or entity involved in the business of building, dealing, developing or subdividing land. However, if you purchased the property and sell it within five years (two years for properties purchased on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive) the sale may be taxable under the bright-line test. The bright-line test only applies to properties purchase on or after 1 October 2015. What kind of property buyer are you? A speculator – buys a property always intending to sell it. The property is treated like "trading stock" and any profit or loss from selling the property is taxable. Speculating can be a one-off purchase and sale of a property. Speculators may also receive rental income from the property before they sell it. A dealer (also referred to as a trader) – similar to a speculator buying properties for resale. The difference is there's an established regular pattern of buying and selling properties. The category you fall into isn't determined by what the property is called or how the activity is described. For example, it may be marketed as a "rental investment" with strong "capital gain" potential, but your firm intention or prior pattern is the factor that determines its tax treatment if you're involved in or associated with someone in the business of building, dealing, developing or subdividing land. It's important to note that only one of your firm intentions needs to be resale for you to be potentially classified as a speculator or dealer. For example, buying a property as an "investment" with a plan of holding it for now and selling it in a few years would likely put you into the speculator or dealer category. Simply renting a property doesn't automatically exclude you from paying tax on the sale. Investors, dealers and speculators may all rent out their properties from time to time. 6ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Under the bright-line test, any purchase and sale of a property within five years (two years for properties purchased on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive) may be taxable, even if it's not taxable as part of your property business. Understanding your property investment strategy will help you decide your status. For example, the "buy and hold" approach most likely means you're a property investor for tax purposes. Or there's the "buy and flick" strategy. This approach most likely means you're a property speculator or dealer for tax purposes. Investors investigate and analyse future revenue streams, and any gain made on the sale of the property is incidental. Their investment is soundly based on a return from the rental income. Property dealers or speculators try to predict the property's future price movements because that's what the deal rests on. Any rental income is secondary. Your status may differ between properties and it may change over time as the property market rises and falls. You may have bought a property described as a good investment when your intention was actually related to property trading. If you're not clear about your reasons for buying a property, and any possible tax issues involved, read our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313 or talk to a tax professional. Bright-line test for residential land If you buy a property on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sell it within two years, or you buy a property on or after 29 March 2018 and sell it within five years, you may have to pay tax on any profit, no matter what your reason was for buying the property. This is called the bright-line test for residential land. If your property isn't taxable under any of the information in pages 7 to 22 of this guide, it may still be taxable under the bright-line test for residential property (see page 23). 7ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Property speculation If you're buying and selling property other than a private family home, we recommend you get advice from a tax professional. You might think profits from selling property are always capital gains so you don't have to pay tax on them. But this isn't always true. If one of your reasons for buying a property is to resell it, whether you live in it or rent it out, you're speculating in property and your profit is likely to be taxable. And, if you sell that property at a loss, the loss may be tax-deductible. Your family/private home Buying and selling your family/private home usually has no tax consequences. If you buy a family home intending to resell it, and do this regularly to earn income or you have a regular pattern of buying and selling your family home, this could be seen as property dealing or speculation for tax purposes. Holding onto a property for capital gain If you buy a property with the firm intention of resale, it doesn't matter how long you hold it – the gain on resale will be taxable (and any loss may be tax-deductible). For example, you buy a property with a firm plan to resell it for a profit. The property market falls and you decide to hold onto it instead. You rent it out for 15 years and then sell it when the prices are again rising rapidly. Any gain on that sale 15 years later is likely to be taxable. Number of properties to be considered taxable There's no set number of properties you can have before they become taxable. In some cases the first property bought and sold may be taxable if you bought it for resale. In other cases there could be a number of factors, such as having a regular pattern of buying and selling property, before property income is taxable. The factors looked at will vary because each taxpayer's circumstances are different. For example, buying one property every two years may be considered a regular pattern for one individual and not another. 8ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Income tax For income tax, the purchase price is treated like trading stock, except the purchase price may only be claimed in the same income year as the resale of the property. GST If you're in the business of property speculation and you're registered for GST for that activity, you're entitled to claim GST on the purchase of properties used in your property speculation activity. For more detail, read our GST guide : Working with GST - IR375. Some confusion can arise when GST is claimed on the first property purchased for speculation. This is because you usually have to demonstrate a regular and continuous activity. Often, buying a single property won't satisfy this test. There may be times when you can't claim GST on a property – see page 20. If your intention at the time you buy a property is to resell it, talk to a tax professional about any tax consequences. You may need to file an Individual tax return - IR3 and declare any profit from the sale as income, or work out the tax implications if you sell the property at a loss. If you think you should have paid income tax on the sale of a property but didn't, please read our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313 or get advice from a tax professional. And if you've filed an incorrect tax return, it's best to tell us about it. Please read our guide Putting your tax returns right - IR280 to find out how to make voluntary disclosures. Speculators claiming the deduction for the purchase of a property 9ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Working out if you can claim a loss from a property transaction is similar to working out if a profit is income or not. If you're a speculator and buy property with the firm intention of selling it, but then make a loss on it, the loss is likely to be tax deductible. You'll need to take into account other general rules covering the deductibility of expenses or losses. You can only claim the loss on a property when you sell it. If you're a dealer, the loss is also likely to be deductible, provided you buy the property for the dealing activity. Some people, who didn't see themselves as property dealers or speculators when they made profits from their property transactions, may take a different view when they make losses. However, we don't just look at a one-off transaction when considering losses claimed. We review all your past property transactions to see how the profits or losses were treated for tax purposes. If you're considering claiming a loss on a property transaction, we strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional. Claiming a loss from property dealing or speculation 10ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Owning rental property doesn't automatically exclude you from paying tax when you sell it. Depending on the reason you bought the property or on other factors, like carrying on a property-related business, you may be a speculator or dealer. When housing prices are on the rise, "get rich quick" property schemes are often described as property investment, when they're really property dealing or speculating schemes. Some property schemes are described as producing capital gains, which aren't taxable, rather than producing income, which is. You need to consider several factors to work out if profit from property sales is capital gains or income: your intentions when you bought the property what you actually used the property for if you have a regular pattern of buying and selling property who you're associated with. If you change from investor to dealer your tax situation changes too. Properties bought before this change may not be affected. Different outcomes An investor buys a rental property to generate rental income. A dealer or speculator buys a rental property with a firm intention to make a gain from the increase in its value. A dealer is anyone with a regular pattern of buying and selling properties. This includes rental properties. To be a speculator, you need buy only one property, firmly intending to resell it. Investors pay income tax on their net rental income but generally, not on the eventual sale proceeds of the property. Dealers and speculators must pay income tax on any gain they make from reselling their property. If they have a loss, it may be tax deductible. They must also pay tax on the net rental income they may earn from the properties. If you're counting on the rental of your property to provide a positive return on your investment (even if expenses may at first be greater than the rent you get), you're likely to be an investor. But, if you buy a property intending to resell it, or if you intend to sell it after making improvements to it, you're likely to be a speculator. Renting your property temporarily doesn't change your tax treatment either – you're still a dealer. When rental property investment becomes rental property dealing 11ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Still can't decide? Ask yourself, "Is the property going to give me a return on my investment, or will it only give me a positive return when I sell it at a profit?". You may receive some income from renting the property but if, from the outset your real reason for buying the property was to sell it at a profit, you're a speculator. Some investors may find the returns from buying and selling rental properties are much higher than the actual rental income those properties can provide, so they switch from being investors to dealers. If you start dealing in rental properties, any profits on your sales from the time you become a dealer are taxable. This probably won't affect the sale of any rental properties you owned before becoming a dealer, assuming you bought them to provide rental income, not for resale. Special rules for dealers and builders Properties sold as part of a property dealing or building business are taxable in the same way trading stock of a business is. Property dealers and builders (and those associated with them), should also take extra care when dealing with properties that weren't bought as part of their business activities if those properties are sold within 10 years. Once you're a dealer (or associated with one), special rules apply. Any profit may be taxable if you own any properties whether or not for the purpose of dealing, and: sell any property that is part of the assets of the activity of dealing, or sell any other property within 10 years of buying it. This applies to all properties you buy from the time you begin dealing to the time you cease dealing, and includes rental properties. There are exceptions for some private residences and business premises. Rental properties don't qualify as a business for this exclusion. Depreciation Changing from rental property investment to rental property speculation or dealing can also affect depreciation on your properties. Rental investors can claim annual depreciation on the cost price of their property buildings, fitout and furniture, but investors who hold property as trading stock can't claim annual depreciation – see page 21. From the 2012 income year you can no longer claim depreciation on rental property buildings. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non-residential buildings has been reintroduced. Refer to our guide Depreciation - IR260. Note 12ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Switching back to property investment from speculation or dealing Properties you bought as a dealer, builder or developer are treated like trading stock and are taxable when you sell them, regardless of any change in your status. For example, if you buy a rental property when you're a dealer but decide to hold it and rent it during a market downturn, any later gain on the sale will still be taxable, even if you're no longer a dealer. If you intended to resell your rental property when you bought it, talk to a tax professional. You may have to file an Individual tax return - IR3. 13ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions As a speculator or dealer, you may decide the time isn't right to sell a property, so you rent it out instead. If you do this, there are implications for income tax, and GST (if you're registered). Income tax You'll have to include rental income in your income tax return. You may claim costs or expenses associated with the rental. New residential property deduction rules apply to most residential rental properties from the start of the 2019-20 income year, which for most people ends on 31 March 2020. See our Rental income - IR264 guide for more detail. GST GST-registered speculators or dealers, who claim a GST refund on the property when they buy it and then rent the property to a residential tenant, need to make an adjustment in their GST return to reflect this. If you buy a property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (in this case, property dealing/speculation, or commercial rents), but then use it for another purpose other than making taxable supplies (eg, residential rental), you must make a GST adjustment. For details about making adjustments, see page 18 of our GST guide - IR375. We advise you to talk to a tax professional before renting out your property if it's a part of your normal dealing, especially if you're a first-time renter. Unplanned rental income 14ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Special tax rules may apply to you if you own property and you or an associate are involved in dealing in land, building and construction work, or in subdividing or developing land. For example, the amount of time you've owned your property becomes an important consideration for tax purposes. Any profit from a sale maybe taxable if you or an associated person undertake any of the above activities and: sell any property that is part of the assets of the activity of dealing, building etc, or sell any other property within 10 years of buying it or (for builders) completing improvements to it, that was not used in your business. These rules may apply to any properties bought during the period of your property-related business activities, even if you sell a property after you cease these business activities. There are exceptions to these special rules, eg, where the property you sell was used primarily as your family/private home, or if you used it as your business premises, other than for rental activities. Special tax rules for those in property-related activities Example Trent started buying and selling residential houses in 2008. By the end of 2008, he had established a regular pattern of buying and selling and was a dealer for tax purposes. Trent co-owns Trent Rentals Ltd, a company that buys residential rental investment properties. In January 2010 the company buys a rental property to hold and rent. In December 2014, rentals in the area are falling and it sells that property. Income tax would not normally be due on the profits from the sale, because the company bought it as an investment. But, because Trent Rentals Ltd is associated with Trent, who established himself as a dealer before this property was bought and it was sold within 10 years, Trent Rentals Ltd must pay tax on the sale regardless of the company's original intention to hold it as a rental investment. To understand the special tax rules that apply when you or an associate are dealing in property related activities, we strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional. You should get advice before selling any property you have held for less than 10 years, if it isn't part of your or your associate's business. 15ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions If you have an association with people in certain property-related industries, there may be a tax impact on all or some of your property transactions, even if you're not personally a property dealer, developer or builder. These impacts could mean the difference in the gain from the sale of a property being treated as taxable income or as a non-taxable capital gain. The example on page 16 shows how the associated person rules could affect you when you wouldn't have even considered such an association. So, if you're considering investing in property or selling your private residence, it's important you talk to a tax professional. Particularly if you think there is any possibility of an association applying to you. Associated person rules may make a property sale taxable when there's an association with: a property dealer when the property was bought a property developer when the property was bought a builder when significant improvements started on a property. Associated person rules changed for land acquired on or after 6 October 2009, widening some associations. Note How individuals can be associated There are a number of tests used to work out if two persons are associated for land transactions. Under the basic rules you are, for example, associated with: your spouse, civil union or de facto partner your children (under 20 years old) a company you hold 25% or more market interest in (company and individual test) a company your spouse or children hold 25% or more market interest in (the aggregation rule) a company where the combined holdings under all these rules totals 25% or more market interest in (the aggregation rule) a partnership, if you're a partner. If you're a trustee you're associated with: any settlor of the trust (and vice versa) a trustee of another trust where the trusts have a common settlor a person with power to appoint or remove a trustee. Property transactions and associated person rules 16ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Extended associations You can be associated to a third person, where you're already associated to a second person under the above rules, and that second person is associated to the same third person under a different rule from the rule that associates you to the second person. This is called the "tripartite" test and usually means that if person A is associated with person B, and B with C, person A is also associated with person C. There are exceptions, particularly in relation to the company tests, so it's important to talk to a tax professional if you're in doubt. Example Kim is married to Bruce, a property developer. Kim is settlor and trustee of a trust, which owns all the shares in Kim's family company. So, Bruce is associated to Kim under the two relatives test. Kim is associated to Kim's trust under the trustee and settlor test. Bruce is now also associated to Kim's trust because of his association to Kim as spouse and Kim's association to the trust as settlor. Bruce is considered to hold what Kim's trust holds, which is 25% or more of Kim's company. So, Bruce is associated to Kim's company. Any land transactions Kim's company makes would be treated as if it were being made by a property developer (Bruce's occupation). For more information on the associated persons rules read Tax Information Bulletin Part II, Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009). You should talk to a tax professional if you think any of the association rules may affect you. 17ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Some people buy or transfer a family home using a limited liability company, such as a look-through company (LTC) or trust or partnership, including a limited partnership. This guide focuses on LTCs but the information applies equally to trusts or partnerships. Using an LTC for residential rental investment can be a perfectly valid structure. However, we consider some LTC arrangements are made to avoid tax. Problems arise when an LTC buys an LTC shareholder's family home, and shareholders continue to live in the home and claim deductions (eg, interest, insurance, rates and maintenance) for the property. In most instances this is considered tax avoidance. Expenses in relation to your private residence, whether owned by you, a company in which you're a shareholder, a trust in which you're a beneficiary or a partnership you're a partner in, are not deductible. You may think that if you continue to pay market rent to the company you can continue to claim these LTC expenses against your income. However, we may still consider the arrangement to be tax avoidance. Penalties might apply Tax avoidance carries penalties of up to 100% of the tax shortfall, and in some cases, such as deliberately misleading Inland Revenue about how the arrangement is set up, there's a shortfall penalty of 150% for tax evasion. We may also consider prosecution. Living in a property owned by your LTC, company, partnership or trust The new residential property deduction rules apply whether you hold the property yourself, or in a partnership, look-through company, or close company. The rules also apply to trustees of a trust who earn taxable income from a residential rental property. Now, you can generally only deduct expenses for residential property up to the amount of income you earn from the property for the year. Any deductions over your income from the property are called excess deductions, must be carried forward to the next income year you earn income from the property (or other residential property). This means that rental property losses cannot be used to reduce your tax liability for other income, such as salary and wages or business income. 18ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Living temporarily in a property owned by your LTC From time to time a shareholder will move into a home owned by their LTC which they previously rented to tenants. There may be good reasons why they do this. For example: inability to find tenants relationship breakdown relationships formed with tenants renovating or building your own home. But, if you live in the property and you're a shareholder, you generally can't continue to claim what would otherwise be private expenses. Whether or not this structuring and claiming of resulting losses is considered tax avoidance depends on a number of factors. For example, whether the arrangement is permanent or temporary, and whether there are commercial factors driving the decision to live in the property. Living with your tenants in a property owned by your LTC The situation around tax avoidance is less clear when both a shareholder/owner and other tenants live in an LTC-owned home. The shareholder/owner's proportion of the expenses is generally not considered deductible. We look at these arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Asset protection Some people claim the main reason for holding their personal residence in a limited liability company is for asset protection rather than to minimise tax. In reality, these structures provide little or no asset protection. For shareholders to make use of LTC losses, they must hold the shares in their own name. The market value of the shares of an LTC company that owns residential investment property is equal to the market value of the property and represents an asset to the shareholder, less the mortgage. A creditor claim equal to the current value of the property is possible. We look closely at the reasons for such arrangements, but usually disregard the asset protection argument when considering if an LTC arrangement is tax avoidance. If you're considering setting up an LTC to own your family/private home for tax loss claim purposes, be aware that we consider these types of arrangements to be tax avoidance. If you're moving into your LTC-owned property over the long-term, consider taking the home out of your LTC. If you're moving into an LTC-owned property on a temporary basis, be careful not to claim a deduction for private expenses for the period you're in the home. We strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional with expertise in this area if you're considering any of the above arrangements. 19ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Why do people register for GST when they buy property, particularly apartments? If an apartment is being used for short-term stay accommodation (ie, less than four weeks) the rental income may be taxable supplies for GST purposes. Many apartments are sold as "going concerns" with management leases and guaranteed rental arrangements in place at the time of purchase. No GST is paid or can be claimed on a property sold as a going concern, provided certain conditions are met, ie, both parties are GST-registered and the management leases and rental arrangements remain in place. The transaction is defined as "zero-rated" for GST. However, the future sale will be subject to GST unless it too is zero-rated as a going concern. Zero rating Buying an apartment that's been zero-rated for GST may seem like a good idea because you don't have to pay GST on the purchase price. There's no hassle with tenants because the management company takes care of renting the apartment, and you may also have a guaranteed source of income. There are conditions attached to this type of transaction. You need to know what they are or you might get an unexpected GST bill. GST on apartment purchases and sales Unexpected GST to pay If you sell your apartment with the original or an appropriate replacement management agreement still in place, to a buyer who is also registered for GST, your apartment may still be a going concern. In this case you probably don't have to pay GST on the sale. But, if you change the apartment use, you may have to pay GST. For example: if you or a member of your family move into the apartment if you rent it to residential rental tenants. You may also have to pay GST if you sell your apartment and the original management agreement has expired and you haven't negotiated another lease with them. We strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional before committing to any property deal involving GST or a going concern arrangement. For more information about tax on zero-rated apartments, read our leaflet Thinking of selling your leased apartment? - IR498. 20ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions You must check if GST affects your property transactions in these situations. Buying residential rental properties to rent If you buy a residential rental property as an investor you can't claim a GST credit on the purchase because renting residential accommodation is a GST-exempt activity. Buying residential rental properties to trade If you buy residential rental property as a dealer you may be able to claim a GST credit when you buy a property. You'll have to include GST in the sale price when you sell that property and pay the GST to us, unless the sale is zero-rated. GST on property sales If you claim a GST credit when you buy a property, you'll probably need to include GST in the sale price when you sell that property and pay the GST to us, unless the sale is zero-rated. Before committing to any property deal involving GST we strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional. GST claims on property purchases 21ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Before the 2012 income year you could claim depreciation on a rental property, but if you sell the property for more than the depreciated (book) value, you'll probably repay most (or all) of the depreciation you claimed previously. This depreciation recovery is taxable income. Depreciation recovered on rental properties If you sell the property for less than you paid for it, you may only have to declare a portion of the depreciation you've claimed as income. Example You buy a rental property for$400,000 (excluding the land value\*) You claim total depreciation of$ 20,000 The property's book/adjusted tax value is$380,000 Outcome 1 You sell the property for $400,000 (excluding land value\*) Difference between sale price and book value $ 20,000 Depreciation recovered $ 20,000 Include this amount as income in your tax return for the year the property was sold Outcome 2 You sell the property for $425,000 (excluding land value\*) Difference between sale price and book value $ 45,000 Depreciation recovered $ 20,000 Include this amount as income in your tax return for the year the property was sold \* Land isn't a depreciable asset. 22ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Outcome 3 You sell the property for $390,000 (excluding land value\*) Difference between sale price and book value $ 10,000 Deprecation recovered $ 10,000 Include this amount as income in your tax return for the year the property was sold Outcome 4 You sell the property for $350,000 (excluding land value\*) Difference between sale price and book value ($30,000) Depreciation recovered Nil \* Land isn't a depreciable asset. If the property is sold, you can only claim depreciation for the months the property was owned in that tax year. You can't claim a loss as a deduction after that. You must include any depreciation you've recovered as taxable income when you sell your property. If you don't, you'll be understating your income. It's important you consider and account for any historical depreciation claimed when you're selling the property. We strongly recommend you talk to a tax professional. Note 23ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions In addition to the usual intent rules, from 1 October 2015 residential property sales may be taxable if you buy then sell within a certain amount of time, even if you didn't intend to sell the property when you purchased it. This won't generally apply to your main home. The bright-line test looks at whether the property: was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, and sold within two years, or was purchased on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. You need to clearly identify when this period starts and finishes. You may be required to have residential land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted at the time of sale if you are an offshore RLWT person. This includes all residential property sales where the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015, not just those that fall under the bright-line test. For more information on RLWT go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt Note Purchase and sale dates For most people the purchase date for the bright-line test is the date property ownership was registered with Land information New Zealand (LINZ) until the date you sign a sale and purchase agreement to sell. If the property is in another country, then it's the date the transfer was registered under that country's laws. If the purchase or sale occurs before the change in title is registered with LINZ or if you have subdivided the property you should consult a tax professional. Example Marie signs an agreement to buy an investment property on 5 April 2018. The transfer to Marie is registered on the title with LINZ on 17 May 2018. She decides to sell the property and signs a sale and purchase agreement on 25 February 2020. The transfer is registered on the title on 3 March 2020. The start date for the bright-line test is 17 May 2018 (the day the transfer is registered) and the sale date is 25 February 2020 (the day the sale and purchase agreement is entered into). Because the sale date is within five years of the purchase date the bright-line test applies and the sale of the property will be taxable. When a sale is not taxable The sale will be taxable unless one of the following exclusions apply: it's your main home (see below) you have inherited the property the property has been transferred under a relationship property agreement the property was transferred on the death of a person to the executor or administrator of the estate. Bright-line test for residential property 24ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions How do I tell if the property is my main home? You need to have lived in the property for more than 50% of the time you owned it. You must actually live in the home. Having family members using the property as their main home is not sufficient. What about the area of land usage? More than 50% of the area of the land must have been actually used for the home, including such things as the yard, gardens and garages. The test is based on your actual use of the property and not your intended use of the property. Example Bill buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Bill sells the apartment block to a third party. Bill can't use the main home exclusion because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominantly as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property. What if I own more than one home? If you have two or more houses that you live in, you'll need to decide which house is your main home. This is determined by considering which of the properties you have the greatest connection with. Various factors may decide which property you have the greatest connection with, including: the time you occupied the home where your immediate family lives where your social ties are strongest your use of the home your employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the home is located whether your personal property is in the home. What if my home is owned by a trust? The Trust can use the main home exclusion if the property is the main home of a beneficiary of the Trust, but only if the settlor who contributed the most to the trust doesn't have another main home. 25ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions How many times can I use the main home exclusion? The main home exclusion for the bright-line test can't be used if either: you've used the main home exclusion twice within the last two years, or you've engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling of residential properties. What if I make a loss on sale? If your residential property sale is taxable only under the bright-line test and you make a loss on the sale you won't be able to claim the loss against your other income. The loss amount can only be claimed against any other taxable property sales net income in the same year. Otherwise you'll need to claim it in a future year when you have net income from another taxable property sale. If, however, the loss is part of property trading activity different rules apply. Example In June 2017 Zac sells residential property (taxable under the bright-line test). Zac purchased the land for $600,000 and sold it for $540,000, meaning he has a loss of $60,000. In the same year he had wages of $80,000. As Zac didn't have another taxable property sale in the same year he can't claim the $60,000 loss in his tax return. He needs to keep a note of this in case he can use it in a future year. In August 2019 Zac sells land (taxable under the intention test), making a profit of $100,000. In this year's tax return Zac can use the $60,000 loss from the bright-line sale in 2017. This means he only has to pay tax on $40,000 of the profit, rather than the full $100,000. How do I show income from property sales in my tax return? If you're showing your income from property sales in your tax return, you may also need to complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold. This form explains when to use it and what information is required. 26ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Income tax As an individual buying and selling property, a partner in a partnership, or an owner in a look-through company, you need to complete and send us an Individual tax return - IR3 each year, or an Individual tax return – non-resident - IR3NR if you live overseas. Partnerships and look-through companies also have to file an Income tax return – partnerships - IR7. You can submit your return online in myIR. Include enough information to show how you worked out the amount of property income you've calculated after deducting expenses. If you have made a loss from a residential property, you will need to consider if the residential property deduction rules apply. Check our website ird.govt.nz for more information about the rules. Refer to the income tax return guide to find out where in the tax return you need to provide us the information. You may also want to use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help you calculate the amounts. If you're showing property sale income in your tax return, you may also need to complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold, if you haven't already done this. You can then work out the tax on your total taxable income. Tax credits, such as PAYE, are deducted from the tax on your total taxable income. Tax on property transactions For most people the tax year ends at 31 March. Tax to pay is due by 7 February the following year (or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). If you don't already send us a tax return each year, you can complete an IR3 return using our online services ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, you can call us on 0800 227 774 and we'll send you a form at the end of the year. The number for overseas callers is 64 4 978 0779. Provisional tax Taxpayers with annual tax to pay of more than $5,000 ($2,500 in 2019/20 and earlier years) are required to pay provisional tax. Provisional tax isn't a separate tax – it's another way of paying tax as you earn your income. You usually pay three instalments throughout the year to cover your expected end-of-year income tax. For more details read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) If you're an offshore RLWT person you may have RLWT deducted from your residential property sale/disposal. If you're including a taxable property sale in your end-of-year income tax return then you're entitled to claim the RLWT deducted as a tax credit - reducing your tax to pay. 27ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Property partnerships A partnership of two or more people will need an IRD number by completing an IRD number application – resident non-individual - IR596 form. If the partnership is a non-resident partnership or meets the definition of an offshore person, it needs to complete the IRD number application – non-resident/offshore non-individual - IR744 form. The partnership will only need to keep one set of accounts to record its income and expenses and file an Income tax return – partnerships - IR7 each year. This return will show how the income was calculated and the amount of each partner's share. If you're a couple (ie, husband and wife, civil union or de facto partners) buying and selling property, you don't need a partnership IRD number or IR7. Each partner includes a copy of the accounts in their individual tax returns and includes their share of the profit from the property activities. Companies A company needs its own IRD number. Complete and send us an IRD number application – resident non-individual - IR596 form. Companies (other than a look-through company) file an Income tax return – companies - IR4 each year. GST GST is a tax on the supply of most goods and services in New Zealand. GST can apply to people who buy and sell property. You must register for GST if your annual turnover in the previous 12 months was more than $60,000 (or is likely to be in the next 12 months). Turnover is the total value of supplies made for all your taxable activities, excluding GST. 28ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Putting your tax affairs right You have an obligation to assess your own tax liability and pay the tax you owe. To do this you'll need to know your basic tax obligations. You must: correctly calculate the amount of tax you have to pay (unless you don't have to file a return) deduct or withhold the correct amount of tax from payments or receipts (when required) pay tax on time keep all necessary information (including books and records) and maintain all necessary accounts or balances disclose all information needed by us in a timely and useful way cooperate with us as required by the Inland Revenue Acts correctly respond to an income tax assessment, if you receive one tell us if you should have received an income tax assessment but didn't receive one comply with other specific tax obligations. Entering false information in a tax return or knowingly not showing all your income are examples of not meeting your tax obligations. Penalties may be lighter if you tell us about your tax situation before we find out some other way. It's a good idea to talk to a tax professional to find out if you do have a tax obligation that should be disclosed. Voluntary disclosure A voluntary disclosure is when you tell us if there's something wrong with your tax return(s) before we find out in some other way, eg, through routine checking or an audit. If you've made a mistake or filed an incorrect tax return, volunteering this information means any penalties may be reduced. If you think you need to make a voluntary disclosure, we recommend you talk to a tax professional first.

Property investor is often used as a collective term for property speculators, dealers, and investors. However, they're each treated very differently under tax law. Even if you’re not a property investor, a sale of residential property you own may be taxable. In this guide we refer to speculators, dealers, and investors: ySpeculator – when a speculator buys a property with the intention to sell, the property is treated like trading stock. Any profit or loss from selling the property is taxable. Speculation can involve a one-off purchase or multiple property sales. Speculators may also earn income from the property before they sell it. yDealer – a dealer, also known as a trader and like a speculator, acquires properties for resale, with a key difference being the establishment of a regular pattern of buying and selling properties. yInvestor – an investor buys a property to generate continuous rental income without a definite plan or intention to resell it, the property is considered a capital asset. A profit or loss from selling the property is treated as capital and is not taxable (apart from depreciation recovered) unless the property is taxable under the bright-line test. The rules may vary if you're associated with a person or entity involved in the business of building, dealing, developing, or subdividing land. The property taxing rule that may apply is not determined by what the property is called or how the activity is described. For example, a property may be marketed as a rental investment with strong capital gain potential, but your intention or prior pattern may determine the tax treatment. Only one of your intentions needs to be resale for you to be potentially classified as a speculator or dealer. For example, buying a property as an investment with a plan of holding it for now and selling it in a few years would likely put you into the speculator or dealer category. Simply renting out a property does not automatically exclude you from paying tax on the sale. Investors, dealers, and speculators may all rent out their properties from time to time. Property taxing rules overview If you make a profit from the sale of a property, it may be taxed like any other income from carrying on a business or profit-making activity. Your liability to pay tax on the profit from a property sale depends on: ythe purpose of purchase ysubsequent actions ytransaction structure ywho you are associated with. There are some exclusions in the property taxing rules where you may not have to pay tax on the profit. Exclusions can be complex and require careful consideration. If you're not sure, we recommend you seek advice from a tax advisor. 7ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions When a property is acquired In a typical sale and purchase, a property is acquired when there is a binding sale and purchase agreement between the vendor and purchaser. This includes when the vendor accepts an offer with standard conditions still to be satisfied, such as obtaining finance or a building report. For tax purposes the property is acquired by the purchaser at the date the vendor accepts the offer, and not on a later date when those conditions are satisfied, or settlement occurs. For more information about when a property is acquired and guidance on the rules, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz yQuestion we've been asked (QB) 16/06: Income Tax – Land acquired for a purpose or with an intention of disposal yQuestion we've been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land and start date for 2-year bright-line test Property tax decision tool Our property tax decision tool may help you work out if the property you are buying and selling is taxable under any of the property rules. Go to ird.govt.nz/bright-line 8ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Property taxing rulesExclusions Bright-line test 9ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Intention or purpose Intention or purpose rule When a property has been acquired with the intention of resale, you may have to pay tax on any profit from the sale. An intention to sell does not need to be the main reason for buying the property - it could be 1 of several reasons. Your intention when you first acquire a property determines your tax liability when you sell it. It does not matter how long you hold the property for, if the property was acquired for a purpose of, or with an intention of selling it, any gain made when it is sold will be taxable. There must be a positive purpose or intention rather than a vague possibility the property will be sold, it is not enough the property could be sold or otherwise disposed of at some future date. Intention usually does not apply to selling your main home, or if you bought a property as a long-term rental investment, then sell it later. If you have not decided to sell all or part of the property when you acquire it, the intention rule does not apply. You may acquire the property with no particular purpose except for a general expectation it will be a good investment. If your intention is to sell part of the property and keep the rest, you’ll only be taxed on the part acquired to sell. You’ll need satisfactory evidence to show how much of the property was not acquired for a purpose or intention of selling. We review what your purpose or intention was when the property was acquired. We’ll consider your explanations and look at your activities, including a history of buying and selling properties. For example, if you have bought and sold several properties over a period, or at regular intervals. We’ll also consider your statements to a bank manager or advisor when you bought the property, and any plans made or discussed at the time. For example: yarrangements and discussions with your bank ydiscussions with your real estate agent yif you rent out the property, how long has it been rented yany plans drawn up for the property ynotes made on council documents ypower and other utility arrangements you made yyour actual or planned involvement in the community, for example, attendance at schools, membership of clubs etc ythe terms of the financial arrangements yis the property providing you with a living. The actions you take before and after the purchase can also help to determine your intent. 10ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions If you have purchased land for private or investment purposes, we recommend you keep documentation to support your intention, such as correspondence with your lawyer, bank, and other advisors. If you inherit property or receive a property as part of a relationship agreement, the previous owner’s intentions for that property are transferred to you. This means, if they would have been liable to pay tax when they sold it, then you will be too. You do not have to pay tax when the property is transferred to you. However, you may need to pay tax when you sell it. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/buying-and-selling-situations Exclusions to intention or purpose There are exclusions to intention or purpose. If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale of a residential or non-residential property may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion page 23 yBusiness premises exclusion (non-residential land) page 25. Business purpose – dealing, developing, subdividing land, or building houses Who this applies to If you, or an associated person acquire land for the purposes of business relating to: ydealing in land ydeveloping land or subdividing land into lots ybuilding houses. If you undertake several property transactions or complete work relating to dealing, developing, subdividing land, or building houses, then you may be carrying on a business. Any profits from selling residential or non-residential properties will be taxable. Dealing in land Dealing in land means you have bought and sold multiple properties without materially changing the land characteristics. There needs to be a reasonable frequency of transactions and some continuity of effort to buy and sell property. If the property is purchased as part of the business of dealing in land, any profit made when the property is sold will be taxable. Developing land or subdividing land into lots Developing or dividing land means you’ve bought and sold property, made physical changes to the land for development, or divided it into separate lots for business purposes. The business of developing or dividing land does not include the construction of houses. 11ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions If the property is purchased as part of the business developing or dividing land, any profit made when the property is sold will be taxable. Building houses Your business must be involved in most aspects of building houses. You do not need to undertake the actual construction work yourself - engaging others to complete the work is sufficient to be considered in the business of building houses. However, being an employee of a building company and not doing the work independently does not qualify as being in the business of building houses. If the property is purchased as part of the business of building houses, any profit made when the property is sold will be taxable. Carrying on a business The number of transactions or the amount of work completed is not used to determine if you’re carrying on a business. The following considerations are used to determine if you’re in the business of property dealing, developing, or subdividing land or building houses: ythe nature of the activity and your intention ythe period you have engaged in the activity ythe scale of operations and the volume of transactions ythe commitments of time, money, and effort ythe pattern of activity ythe financial results. If you are associated to someone in a property business, there are different categories depending on what work is undertaken, and in some cases how long the property was owned. For more information about associated persons, go to page 19. Exclusions to business purpose There are exclusions to business purpose. If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale of a residential or non-residential property may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion page 23 yBusiness premises exclusion (non-residential land) page 25. 12ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Dealing in land – sale within 10 years Dealing in land means You’re in the business of buying and selling properties without materially altering their characteristics. There is a reasonable frequency of transactions and a consistent effort to buy and sell property. Any profit made when the properties are sold will be taxable when: yat the time you purchased a property you carried on a business of dealing in land or you were associated to someone who carried on a business of dealing in land, and ythe property was sold within 10 years of the date it was acquired. This is regardless of whether the property was acquired for your business or your associate’s business. Example Trent started buying and selling residential houses in 2022. By the end of 2022, he had established a pattern of buying and selling and is a dealer for tax purposes. Trent co-owns Jayton Rentals Limited, a company that buys residential rental investment properties. In January 2023 the company buys a rental property. In December 2025, rentals in the area are falling and the company sells the property. Generally, Trent is not liable for Income tax on the profits from the sale of rental property, because the company bought it as an investment. However, because Jayton Rentals Limited is associated with Trent who was an established dealer before the property was bought, and it was sold within 10 years, Jayton Rentals Limited must pay tax on the sale regardless of the company's original intention to hold it as a rental investment. For more information about associated persons, go to page 19. Exclusions to dealing in land There are exclusions to dealing in land. If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale of a residential or non-residential property may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion page 23 yBusiness premises exclusion (non-residential land) page 25. 13ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Developing or subdividing land – sale within 10 years Developing or subdividing land means You’re in the business of buying and selling property, making physical changes to the land for development, or subdividing into separate lots for business purposes. It does not include building houses. Any profit made when the properties are sold will be taxable when: yat the time you, or an associated person carried on a business of developing or subdividing land when the property was purchased, and ythe property was sold within 10 years of the date it was acquired. This is regardless of whether the property was acquired for your business or your associate’s business. Subdividing co-owned land when you are associated to a property developer If you’re associated to a property developer at the time you acquired a property and you subdivide (partition) the land with no substantial change in ownership, you may not have to pay tax on the profit. If there is a substantial change in ownership, you will be required to pay tax on the profit if it is disposed of within 10 years. Example – partitioning of land co-owned with a land developer Alfred has owned a property for 11 years. He decides to subdivide the land to build townhouses, keeping 1 for himself and his family to live in. Alfred starts a company Theodore Limited to carry out the subdivision and land development and transfers 80% of the land interest to the company at market value. The land is subdivided into 5 lots. Alfred’s intention is to own 1 lot (20% of the land) and Theodore Limited to own the other 4 lots (80% of the land). However, at subdivision, Alfred owns a 20% interest in 5 lots and Theodore Limited owns an 80% interest in 5 lots. To achieve what Alfred intended (owning 1 lot exclusively and Theodore Limited owning the other 4 lots): yTheodore Limited must transfer 80% interest of the 1 lot Alfred will retain ownership of, and yAlfred must transfer his 20% interest in the other 4 lots to Theodore Limited. Both Alfred and Theodore Limited retain their original interest shares. If Alfred decides to sell his townhouse 4 years later, he will not pay tax on any profit made as there was no substantive change to his original interest in the subdivided land (even though it is within 10 years of acquiring the 80% of lot 1 from Theodore Limited). 14ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Exclusions to developing or subdividing land There are exclusions to developing or subdividing land. If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale of a residential or non-residential property may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion page 23 yBusiness premises exclusion (non-residential land) page 25. Building houses – sale within 10 years of improvements Being in the business of building houses requires you or your associated person’s involvement in various aspects, even if you or your associated person do not personally perform the construction work. Engaging others to complete the work is enough to be considered in the business of building houses. This is regardless of whether the property was acquired for your business or your associate’s business. Any profit made when the properties are sold will be taxable when: yat the time you began the improvements you carried on a business of building houses, or you were associated to someone who carried on a business of building houses, and ythe property was sold within 10 years of the date of completing improvements to the land. If you fit out an existing building you later sell, and you or a person you’re associated with are in the business of building houses, any profit made will be taxable. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz - Question we've been asked (QB) 18/01: Can a fit out of an existing building be “improvements” for the purposes of CB11?   For more information about associated persons, go to page 19.

Development or subdivision scheme begun within 10 years An undertaking or scheme is commonly considered a plan, design, or programme of action such as a project or enterprise. It does not need to be a business or trade venture. The sale of a property may be taxable when: ythe undertaking or scheme involving the development of land, or subdividing land into lots is carried on, and yyou, or another person on your behalf, carries on the development or subdivision work on, or relating to the land, and ythe development or subdivision work was not minor, and ythe undertaking or scheme was commenced within 10 years of the date you acquired the land. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz yQuestion we’ve been asked (QB) 15/04: Income Tax – Whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies yInterpretation Statement (IS 20/08): Income Tax – When is development or division work “minor” 16ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Exclusions to development or subdivision schemes If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion – developing or subdividing residential land page 25 yBusiness exclusion – development, subdivision, or improvement for carrying on a business page 26 yFarmland exclusion page 26 yInvestment exclusion page 26. Major development or subdivision The sale of property which is part of major development or subdivision where there is significant expenditure may be taxable. This applies when income from the development of land or subdivision into lots is from: ycarrying on any undertaking or scheme regardless of whether there is a venture of a business nature ywork involving significant expenditure on channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading, or any other amenity, service or work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects developing land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes ythe development or subdivision work has been carried out in relation to the land by you, or on your behalf. You can claim a deduction for the value of the land at the time the undertaking or scheme commenced. When the major development or subdivision rule does not apply This property taxing rule does not apply if you have already returned (or will return) the income under one of the following property rules: yIntention or purpose page 9 yBusiness purpose – dealing, developing, subdividing land or building houses page 10 yDealing in land – sale within 10 years page 12 yDeveloping or subdividing land – sale within 10 years page 13 yBuilding houses – sale within 10 years of improvements page 14 yDevelopment or subdivision scheme begun within 10 years page 15 yRezoning of land page 17 yBright-line test for residential land page 18. 17ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Exclusions to major developments If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion – developing or subdividing residential land page 25 yBusiness exclusion – development, subdivision, or improvement for carrying on a business page 26 yFarmland exclusion page 26 yInvestment exclusion page 26. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz yQuestion we’ve been asked (QB) 15/02: Income Tax – Major development or division – what is “significant expenditure” for section CB 13 purposes yQuestion we’ve been asked (QB) 15/04: Income Tax – Whether it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division will not give rise to income, even if no exclusion applies yInterpretation Statement (IS 20/08): Income Tax – When is development or division work “minor”. Rezoning of land The sale of property is taxable if the property is sold within 10 years of acquiring it for an amount more than the cost of the land, and at least 20% of the gain is due to any 1 or more of the following: ythe land was changed, or likely to be changed, under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) yany consent granted under the RMA, or the likelihood of any consent being made ya decision of the Environment Court made under the RMA, or the likelihood of a decision being made ythe removal of any type of condition, covenant, designation, heritage order, obligation, prohibition, or restriction or the likelihood of the removal of any such restriction yany change or occurrence of a similar nature to those referred to above or the likelihood of such a change or occurrence. The time for determining whether any of these factors apply is when the property is sold. If the sale takes place more than 10 years after acquiring the land, any profit made will not be taxable. If the sale is taxable, the total excess profit is taxable and not just the excess profit caused by the above factors. 18ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions If the property has been owned for less than 10 years, a proportionate deduction (based on the length of ownership) is allowed. The deduction is 10% of the profit for every 12 months from the date the land was acquired. When the rezoning of land rule does not apply This property taxing rule does not apply if you have already returned (or will return) the income under one of the following property rules: yIntention or purpose page 9 yBusiness purpose – dealing, developing, subdividing land or building houses page 10 yDealing in land – sale within 10 years page 12 yDeveloping or subdividing land – sale within 10 years page 13 yBuilding houses – sale within 10 years of improvements page 14 yDevelopment or subdivision schemes begun within 10 years page 15 yBright-line test for residential land page 18. Exclusions to rezoning of land If an exclusion applies, the profit from a sale may not be taxable. For more information on exclusions go to: yResidential exclusion – rezoning profits from land sales page 26 yFarmland exclusion – rezoning profits from land sales page 27. Bright-line test for residential land Under the bright-line test, any profit on the sale of residential land may be taxable if it is sold within a set period of time (the bright-line period). This also applies to New Zealand tax residents who sell residential land overseas. For residential land sold on or after 1 July 2024, the bright-line test looks at whether your bright-line end date (usually the date you entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell) is within 2 years of your bright-line start date (usually the date the property’s title is transferred to you). For residential land sold before 1 July 2024, your profit may be taxable if it was acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and is sold within 5 years. When the bright-line test does not apply This bright-line test does not apply if you have already returned (or will return) the income under one of the following property rules: yIntention or purpose page 9 yBusiness purpose – dealing, developing, subdividing land or building houses page 10 yDealing in land – sale within 10 years page 12 19ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions yDeveloping or subdividing land – sale within 10 years page 13 yBuilding houses – sale within 10 years of improvements page 14 yDevelopment or subdivision schemes begun within 10 years page 15. Bright-line test exclusions and rollover relief There are several exclusions from the bright-line test. Rollover relief may also apply to certain types of ownership transfers. For more information read our guides Bright-line property tax – IR1229 for property sold from 1 July 2024 and Bright-line property tax – IR1227 for property sold before 1 July 2024. Associated persons If you have an association with people in certain property-related industries, this can affect the tax implications of your property transactions. This is even if you're not personally or directly involved in the business of property dealing, developing, subdividing land, or building houses. There are several tests used to work out if 2 persons are associated for land transactions. These association rules for land transactions can differ from other taxing provisions. Under the simplified rules, you are associated with: yyour spouse, civil union, de facto partner, and children under the age of 20 ya company you hold 25% or more voting interest in (company and individual test) ya company your spouse or children hold 25% or more voting interest in (the aggregation rule) ya look through company (LTC) you hold 25% or more voting interest in y2 companies when a group of persons total voting interests in each company are 50% or more or who control both companies by any other means ya partnership if you're a partner. 20ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions If you're a trustee you're associated with: yany settlor of the trust (and vice versa) ya trustee of another trust where the trusts have a common settlor ya person with power to appoint or remove a trustee. Tripartite test The ‘tripartite’ test usually means if person A is associated with person B, and B with C, person A is also associated with person C. There are exceptions in relation to the company tests. We recommend discussing this with a tax advisor. For more information on how degrees of association are determined in family situations go to: yird.govt.nz/forms-guides - A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620 ytaxtechnical.ird.govt.nz - Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Part II, Vol 21, No 8 (October/ November 2009) page 75. Transactions between associated persons Special tax rules apply when a transfer of property occurs between associated persons. There is no time frame for how long the person holds the property. The profit made on a sale may be taxable to the person who receives the property if: ya property sale would have been taxable under any of the property taxing rules, other than the bright-line test, to the original purchaser ythe original purchaser transfers the property to an associated person at more than the cost ythe person who receives the property for more than what they purchased it for. 21ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Example Property developer Mel purchases a bare section for her development business. The property is transferred 3 years later to Mel’s husband, Maurice. Any profit made on this property is taxable as it was part of Mel’s development business. A year later, Maurice builds a house on the property, and they move in. Maurice sells the property after 4 years and makes a profit. The profit on the sale is taxable because: ythe property was bought from Mel who is an associated person yMel’s development business would have been taxed on the sale of the property if it hadn’t been transferred to Maurice yMaurice sold the property for more than the price it was transferred at from Mel’s development business ynone of the exclusions apply such as the residential exclusion even though Maurice lived in the property, as this does not apply to Mel’s property development business. Maurice’s intentions of what he was going to do with the property, or how long he held the property are not relevant. Maurice can claim expenses relating to any capital improvements made to the property.

Subdividing co-owned land Sometimes people pool resources to purchase land, becoming co-owners. Co-owners may then subdivide and allocate the land based on their original ownership interests. This is known as partitioning. In some circumstances the subdivision may be treated as a disposal of land at market value under the property taxing rules. The property taxing rules do not apply if the value of the partitioned land matches the interests you and your co-owners had in the undivided land. The value includes your contributions as co-owners to development and building costs.  If the land of a co-owner's partitioned interest after subdivision is more than their original co-ownership interest in the undivided land, the difference may be taxable. When a change is not taxable  If the difference in allocations is less than 5% of the smallest co-owner’s original interest, the difference is not taxable. A difference could happen because of the land topography (landscape). 22ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Example – allocation not proportional to original shares Maggie and Jordan are co-owners in a residential property purchased for $1 million. Maggie contributed $750,000 (holding 75% interest) and Jordan contributed $250,000 (holding 25% interest). They subdivide the land in 2 and allocate the parcels to themselves. Due to the landscape, Maggie’s land allocation changes to 74% and Jordan’s to 26%. Because the difference between Jordan’s original holding and the new allocation is less than 5% the transaction is not taxed under the property taxing rules (5% of 25% is 1.25%). When a change is taxable  If the difference is 5% or more of the smallest co-owner’s original interest, the full difference is taxed under the property taxing rules.

Property taxing rule exclusions This table shows exclusions that might apply to the property taxing rule categories. Some transactions may also have GST implications, this is covered later in this guide. Property taxing rule categories Whether exclusions may apply Residential or main home Business premises FarmlandInvestment land Speculation – intention or purpose  Business purpose  Associated persons and 10 years  Development commenced within 10 years  Major development  Rezoning of land  Bright-line test for residential land  23ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Residential exclusion Buying and selling your family home usually has no tax consequences if it meets the residential exclusion. The profit from a property sale may not be taxable if: yyou acquired the land with a house on it, or you built a house on the land ythe house was lived in by you and your family mainly as your residence or if you’re a trustee of a trust, 1 or more trust beneficiaries lived in the house and used it mainly as a residence ythe property is more than 4,500m2, the land has been used for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house yyou have no regular pattern of buying and selling as an individual or part of a group. Incidental occupation or residing in the property for a short period of time may not be enough for the house to be mainly considered as your residence. When the residential exclusion does not apply The residential exclusion does not apply if you (alone or with a group or persons) have a regular pattern of buying or building and selling houses. If the purpose or intention is to resell, this may be considered as property dealing or speculation for tax purposes. The sale of the property will be taxable, and you will need to pay income tax on any profit made. A group of persons are treated together if: yall the people occupy all the properties together as their residence, and ywhere a property is owned by a trustee or other entity, at least 1 of the people who occupies all the properties has significant involvement in, or control of, the trust or other entity. This prevents groups of people structuring regular patterns by using different people or entities to carry out separate transactions, or by varying what is done to the land in each transaction so that there is no pattern. For example, where a first property is bought, lived in, and sold, the second is renovated while lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold. 18 Residential exclusion Buying and selling your family home usually has no tax consequences if it meets the residential exclusion. The profit from a property sale may not be taxable if: • you acquired the land with a house on it, or you built a house on the land • the house was lived in by you and your family mainly as your residence or if you’re a trustee of a trust, 1 or more trust beneficiaries lived in the house and used it mainly as a residence • the property is more than 4,500m2, the land has been used for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house • you have no regular pattern of buying and selling as an individual or part of a group. Incidental occupation or residing in the property for a short period of time may not be enough for the house to be mainly considered as your residence. When the residential exclusion does not apply The residential exclusion does not apply if you (alone or with a group or persons) have a regular pattern of buying or building and selling houses. If the purpose or intention is to resell, this may be considered as property dealing or speculation for tax purposes. The sale of the property will be taxable, and you will need to pay income tax on any profit made. A group of persons are treated together if: • all the people occupy all the properties together as their residence, and • where a property is owned by a trustee or other entity, at least 1 of the people who occupies all the properties has significant involvement in, or control of, the trust or other entity. This prevents groups of people structuring regular patterns by using different people or entities to carry out separate transactions, or by varying what is done to the land in each transaction so that there is no pattern. For example, where a first property is bought, lived in, and sold, the second is renovated while lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold. Example Ownership information • Ben Smith bought property 1 in January 2020 and sold it in January 2022 • Sally Smith bought property 2 in January 2022 and sold it in January 2024 24ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Example Ownership information yBen Smith bought property 1 in January 2020 and sold it in January 2022 ySally Smith bought property 2 in January 2022 and sold it in January 2024 ySmith Family Trust bought property 3 in January 2024 and sold it in January 2026 ySmith Family Trust 2 bought property 4 in January 2026 and sold it in January 2028. Ben and Sally Smith lived in all the properties together as their residence and have significant involvement or control of the trusts that own 2 of the properties (Ben, Sally, Smith family trust 1 and Smith family trust 2). They will be treated as a group of persons who undertake buying and selling activities together. Because all the properties were acquired with an intention of resale and the group have formed a regular pattern of buying and selling properties at regular intervals, they will not be entitled to the residential exclusion. Determining a regular pattern can be complex. If you have bought and sold several properties, we recommend seeking advice from a tax advisor.

The business exclusion will apply if: yyou substantially carried on your business on the property acquired (either with an existing building, or one you built) ythere is no regular pattern of buying and selling as an individual or part of a group. Property includes land reserved with the premises, for use in carrying on the business and is an area no greater than required for the reasonable occupation of the premises. When the business premises exclusion does not apply The business premises exclusion does not apply if you alone or with a group or persons have a regular pattern of either buying and selling or building and selling premises for business. This means you will need to pay income tax on any profit made. A group of persons will be treated as undertaking buying and selling activities together where: yall persons in the group occupy the premises mainly to carry on a substantial business, irrespective of the nature of any business carried on, and ya person, whether or not they also occupy land as a business premises, has significant involvement in, or control of, the activities of all those in the group.

Claiming a loss from property dealing or speculation If you’re a property speculator or dealer and you make a loss on a property you bought as part of your activity, with an intention to resell, the loss is likely to be tax deductible. You'll need to consider other general rules covering the deductibility of expenses or losses. You can only claim the loss on a property when you sell it. When we are considering claims for losses, we review all your past property transactions to see how the profits or losses were treated for tax purposes. You need to keep all your records to show you were a property dealer or speculator as these may be requested to support the claiming of any losses. Forfeited deposits from cancelled property sales If you receive a deposit from an agreement to sell a property, but the sale does not go ahead due to the buyer defaulting, the deposit may be forfeited (you get to keep it). A forfeited deposit will be income if any of the following apply: ythe property was part of an ordinary business, and the sale would have been taxable ythe property was from a profit-making scheme ythe profit from the sale of the property would have been taxable under any of the property taxing rules, for example the bright-line test. The forfeited income will need to be included in your income tax return. You can deduct expenses relating to the cancelled agreement, such as agent commissions, legal and marketing fees. 28ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Example Katco Limited is a property developer and purchased a bare section on 8 April 2021 and constructed a house. On 11 January 2022 Katco Limited entered into an unconditional contract to sell the property to Nancy for $1,000,000. Nancy paid a $100,000 deposit and the balance was due on 10 March 2022. Nancy ran into financial difficulty and could not pay the balance of the purchase price on the due date. Katco Limited cancelled the agreement and retained the forfeited deposit. The forfeited deposit of $100,000 is business income to Katco Limited as the sale of the property was part of their ordinary business operation. Katco Limited can claim a deduction for the expenses relating to the cancelled agreement.

Rental investors can claim annual depreciation on chattels, but speculators and dealers who hold property as trading stock cannot claim depreciation as the properties have been purchased to sell. Depreciation on non-residential buildings From 2012 income year depreciation was removed for rental property buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. From the 2021 income year depreciation on non-residential buildings was reintroduced. You must include any depreciation you've claimed as taxable income when you sell your property. If you’ve claimed building depreciation for a non-residential property and you sell it for more than the depreciated (book) value, you’ll probably have to repay most (or all) of the amount claimed. This depreciation recovery is taxable income. If you sell the property for less than you paid for it, you may only have to declare a portion of the depreciation you've claimed as income. For more information about depreciation, go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation ird.govt.nz/forms-guides yRental income – IR264 yDepreciation – IR260 29ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Changing from property speculating or dealing to property investment Properties you acquire as a dealer, builder or developer are treated as trading stock (revenue account) and they are taxable when you sell them. This is regardless of any change in your status from speculating or dealing to property investment. For example, if you buy a rental property when you're a dealer but decide to hold it and rent it during a market downturn (investment), any later gain on the sale will still be taxable, even if you're no longer a dealer. When property held on revenue account is transferred to capital account, the transfer is a deemed transaction at market value. Any increase in the value of property between the date of the original acquisition and the date when the property is deemed to be transferred from capital account to revenue account is not taxable. This also applies to any increase or decrease in value between the date the property is deemed to be transferred from revenue account to capital account and the date when it is disposed, is not taxable. Living in a property owned by your company, trust, or partnership You can acquire a property or transfer a family home using a limited liability company, look-through company (LTC), trust, partnership, or limited partnership. These are all valid structures. However, we may consider some arrangements have been entered into to avoid tax. Expenses such as interest, insurance, rates and maintenance in relation to your family home, whether owned by you, a company or LTC you're a shareholder for, a trust in which you're a beneficiary or a partnership you're a partner in, are not deductible. We’ve used a LTC as an example in this section, but the following information applies to all of these structures. Living temporarily in a property owned by your LTC You may have moved into a property previously rented to tenants, owned by your LTC. This may be because of: yinability to find tenants yrelationship breakdown yrelationships formed with tenants yrenovating or building your own home. If you’re a shareholder in a property you live in, generally you cannot claim private expenses for the property. Living with your tenants in a property owned by your LTC If you’re living in a property along with tenants, your shareholder/owner's proportion of the expenses is generally not deductible. 30ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Asset protection Sometimes the reason for holding a personal residence in a limited liability company is for asset protection rather than to minimise tax. To make use of LTC losses, you must hold the shares in your own name. The market value of the shares of an LTC company owning residential investment property is equal to the market value of the property and represents an asset to the shareholder, less the mortgage. A creditor claim equal to the current value of the property is possible. If you're moving into your LTC owned property over the long-term, you should think about taking the home out of your LTC. If you're moving into an LTC owned property on a temporary basis, do not claim a deduction for private expenses for the period you're in the home. We recommend you seek advice from a tax advisor with expertise in this area if you're considering any of the above arrangements. Income and deductions The income year for returning the profit from a property sale is usually determined by the date of settlement. If you sell a property where the profit is taxable, you can claim a deduction for expenses. Property costs and evidence Property costs include: ythe purchase price paid when you acquired the property yexpenses related to the acquisition, for example lawyers, valuers, surveyors and real estate agent fees yany capital improvements to the property made after acquisition, such as renovations yexpenses related to the property disposal, for example lawyers, real estate agent fees. Examples of evidence to a claim for a deduction for the cost of the property include: ysigned copies of the sale and purchase agreements for the property purchase and sale of the property ysettlement statements issued for both the purchase and the sale of the property yother costs incurred on the purchase and on sale, for example invoices for lawyers, valuers, surveyors or real estate agent fees ydocuments supporting capital improvements to the property made after acquisition such as renovations (for example fees for resource consents, architects and engineers, invoices for labour and building materials). 31ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Holding costs You may incur costs related to holding the property during the period you owned it. These costs are expenses relating to the ownership of land, such as interest, rates, property insurance, repairs and maintenance, and body corporate levies (provided they are revenue expenses). Holding costs do not include capital improvement costs. Repairs and maintenance and body corporate levies can be deducted in some circumstances if they are revenue expenses. For more information see the Interpretation Statement (IS 12/03): Income Tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – General principles (Inland Revenue, June 2012) For more information on holding costs for land, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Interpretation Statement (IS 23/10): Deductibility of holding costs for land and the (IS 23/10 Fact sheet): Deductibility of holding costs for land For additional information on deductions for rental properties go to ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Rental income – IR264 We have a calculator to help you work out the net profit or loss on a taxable property sale. Go to ird.govt.nz/property-income-tax Goods and services tax (GST) Registering for GST If you are, or intend to be in the business of buying, selling, developing, or building residential or commercial properties, you may need to register for GST. You may also need to register for GST if you have a pattern of buying or selling residential properties, or undertaking a subdivision project where the activity is carried on continuously or regularly. This may depend on the: ynumber of properties purchased and sold ytime and effort involved ylevel of financial investment. You must register for GST if your annual turnover (sales from taxable activities): ywas over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or yis expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. Taxable activity A business must have a taxable activity to register for GST. A taxable activity is an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods or services to another person for consideration. If you have a taxable activity, you can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. 32ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions If you’re not sure if you need to register for GST, we recommend you seek advice from a tax advisor. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/form-guides yGST – do you need to register? – IR365 yGST guide – IR375 GST on property purchases yBuying residential rental properties to rent - If you’re an investor you cannot claim GST on the purchase of the property because long-term renting of residential accommodation is a GST exempt activity. yBuying residential rental properties to trade - If you buy residential rental property as a dealer or speculator, you may be able to claim GST if the seller is not GST registered or if they are registered, the transaction is not part of their taxable activity (for example the vendor has a plumbing business, but they are selling their private home). You cannot claim GST if the sale is zero-rated. GST on property sales If you claim a GST credit when you buy a property, you'll probably need to include GST in the sale price when you sell the property, unless the sale is zero-rated. Compulsory zero-rating of land rules The compulsory zero-rating of land rules treats certain sales between GST registered persons as zero-rated. When a land sale occurs between 2 GST registered persons, the sale may be zero-rated. This means the vendor (seller) does not charge GST on the sale and the purchaser does not pay any GST. Under the compulsory zero-rating land rules, if you’re GST registered, you must charge GST at the rate of 0% when: yyou sell land to a purchaser who is GST registered ythe sale of the land is part of your taxable activity ythe purchaser intends using the land for the purpose of making taxable supplies ythe purchaser (or a relative of the purchaser) does not intend using the land (or any part of it) as their principal place of residence. Agreement for sale and purchase Whether you’re the vendor selling the land or the purchaser buying it, you need to make sure the Agreement for sale and purchase of real estate is completed with the correct information. This can prevent issues such as denied secondhand goods claims and incorrect zero-rating and makes sure both the vendor and purchaser are aware of any GST tax implications. 33ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Vendor requirements You must confirm if you are GST registered (or will be at the date of settlement), and the land transaction is in relation to your taxable activity. This is on page 1 of the ADLS / Law Association agreement form: The vendor is registered under the GST Act in respect of the transaction and/or will be so registered at settlement: If “Yes”, Schedule 1 must be completed by the parties. Yes/No If you answer yes, you must also complete Schedule 1 (GST information) - Section 1 Vendor, with all the relevant information relating to the sale (1a and 1b). You do not need to complete schedule 1 if your answer is no because you’re: yGST registered but the land is not in relation to your taxable activity, or ynot GST registered and do not intend to register prior to settlement. Payment of purchase price Whether you are the vendor or the purchaser, you need to make sure the purchase price is correctly recorded in the agreement This is on page 1 of the ADLS / Law Association agreement form. Delete whichever option does not apply: yPlus GST (if any), or yInclusive of GST (if any). If neither option is deleted, the purchase price includes GST (if any). Purchaser requirements In addition to your purchaser details on page 1 of the ADLS / Law Association agreement form, if the vendor has indicated yes, they are or will be registered for GST at the date of settlement, and the land transaction is in relation to their taxable activity: The vendor is registered under the GST Act in respect of the transaction and/or will be so registered at settlement: If “Yes”, Schedule 1 must be completed by the parties. Yes/No yyou are required to notify the vendor if you’re registered for GST, or intend to register, on or before the date of settlement yyou must complete the purchaser details in Schedule 1 (GST information), section 2 Purchaser, and section 3 Nominee, if you’re intending to direct the vendor to transfer title to another party.

Example – taxable activity delayed commencement Katrina registers for GST and purchases a property from a non-GST registered seller. GST is claimed on the purchase as Katrina’s intention is to demolish the existing house and build 5 townhouses. When time allows, Katrina works on planning the project and realises it will take some time and effort to finalise and arrange consents. Katrina decides to rent out the house for 12 months. Residential rental income is an exempt supply for GST. This means Katrina should not have registered for GST when she purchased the property, and the GST claimed will need to be repaid. After about 6 months Katrina steps up the amount of work required to get the property development underway. Katrina engages surveyors and architects to draw up plans, arranges finance, and begins applying for resource consents. Katrina can register for GST now that the taxable activity (the development) work is being carried on continuously or regularly. Katrina can claim GST for the cost of the property under the GST adjustment rules. Example – taxable activity commenced immediately Jen registers for GST and purchases a property from a non-GST registered seller. Jen claims GST on the purchase as their intention is to demolish the existing house and build 4 townhouses. Jen immediately starts the work required to develop the land. This will take about 6 months. Jen rents out the house for some income during this time. Jen worked continuously over this 6-month period on the development, paying for surveyors and architects to draw up plans, arranges finance, and begin the process of applying for resource consents. Jen is considered to have started the taxable activity of property development when the land was purchased, as the work began immediately, and it has been carried out continuously and/ or regularly. Jen will need to apportion expenses between taxable and non-taxable activities as the residential rental income is an exempt supply for GST and the property development is a taxable supply for GST. For more information go to Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011) page 38. 35ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions GST on apartment purchases and sales, including properties used for Airbnb If you own an apartment being used for short stay accommodation (for example less than 4 weeks) the rental income may be taxable supplies for GST purposes. Many apartments are sold as ‘going concerns’ with management leases and guaranteed rental arrangements in place at the time of purchase. No GST is paid or can be claimed on a property sold as a going concern, provided certain conditions are met, for example both parties are GST-registered, and the management leases and rental arrangements remain in place. The transaction is zero-rated for GST. However, the future sale may be subject to GST unless it too is zero-rated as a going concern. Zero-rating Buying an apartment that’s been zero-rated for GST may seem like a good idea because you do not have to pay GST on the purchase price. There’s no hassle with tenants because the management company takes care of renting the apartment, and you may also have a guaranteed source of income. There are conditions attached to this type of transaction. You need to know what they are, or you might get an unexpected GST bill. If you sell your apartment with the original or an appropriate replacement management agreement still in place, to a buyer who is also registered for GST, your apartment may still be a going concern. In this case you probably will not have to pay GST on the sale. Changing the property’s use If you change the apartment use, you may have to pay GST, for example: yif you or a member of your family move into the apartment yif you rent it for long term residential rental. You may also have to pay GST when you sell your apartment if the original management agreement has expired, and you have not negotiated another lease with them. For more information about tax on zero-rated apartments go to ird.govt.nz/forms-guides - Thinking of selling your leased apartment? - IR498 Backdating GST registration when you acquire a property GST registrations fall under 2 categories, required and voluntary. Required registration If your taxable supplies are expected to go over the $60,000 threshold, you’re required to register for GST. Your GST registration start date is when you first became liable to register. This may mean your registration has to be backdated. 36ird.govt.nz Tax and your property transactions Example – required backdated registration The Harris family trust purchased a commercial property that included a lease of $60,000 per annum plus GST. The trust confirmed with the GST registered seller they were going to register for GST by the settlement date. Settlement for the property took place on the 15 October 2023 and the transaction was zero-rated on the basis the Harris Family Trust was registered for GST. The GST application was overlooked. This was discovered when the trust went to file the first GST return 2 months later. As the trust was requirement to be registered for GST due to the lease, the backdated registration of 15 October 2023 was approved. Voluntary registration If you have a taxable activity, you can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover (the value of your taxable supplies) is less $60,000. Your GST start date is usually the date you apply to register for GST. If you request the registration to be backdated, we may ask you to provide copies of taxable supply information charging GST, bank statements, or other documents for us to consider approving a backdated GST registration. Example – request to backdate GST registration declined Shreeford Limited purchased a residential property on 15 March 2022 (settlement date). They rented the property from 1 April 2022 to a residential tenant. Shreeford Limited was not registered for GST and did not need to be as residential rental income is an exempt supply for G ST. Shreeford Limited started to explore opportunities to subdivide and develop the property. They engaged property experts, council, planners, designers, and architects. Their plan was to demolish the original house on the property and build 5 townhouses to sell. They estimated the project would take up to 3 years to complete, with the first sales likely to be June 2024. Shreeford Limited applied to register for GST on 1 February 2023, with a backdated GST start date of 15 March 2022. The application to backdate the GST registration was declined for several reasons including: yShreeford had no taxable activity when the property was purchased in March 2022 yno taxable supplies were made, or expected to be made exceeding the 12-month $60,000 threshold between the purchase date and the date they applied to register. The GST registration start date is the date they applied – 1 February 2023. Under exceptional circumstances Inland Revenue can back date a voluntary application.

For more information about GST go to www.ird.govt.nz/gst/ \* What is a taxable activity? Any activity carried out continuously or regularly by a business, trade, manufacturer, professional person, association or club. It includes any activity that supplies, or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for consideration (money, compensation or reward) but not necessarily for profit. It doesn't include: working for salary and wages, being a company director, hobbies or any private recreation pursuit, private transactions such as the occasional sale of household or domestic items, making exempt supplies. # How is turnover calculated? The total value of taxable supplies in all your business activities, including grants and subsidies you receive or barter transactions, excluding any GST. This is not your profit as your expenses are not deducted when determining your turnover. Do you charge GST in your prices (even if your turnover is less than $60,000)? Is your turnover # for the last 12 months more than $60,000? Do you expect your turnover to exceed $60,000 for the next 12 months? You're not required to be registered for GST Are you carrying out a taxable activity?\* You're required to register You're required to register You're required to register You can't register Keep an eye on your turnover—as soon as you're aware it may go over $60,000 (average $5,000 per month) you'll need to register.

It also applies to most imported goods, and certain imported services. GST of 15% is added to the price of taxable Note: Not sure if you charge GST in your prices? If you're part of an organisation or company, check with them to see if GST is included, eg, taxi drivers. If not, do you show GST on receipts etc or tell your customers they're paying GST? goods and services. If you're a GST-registered business, you pay GST on your supplies and collect GST on your sales. The difference between these two is what you pay to Inland Revenue. GST – do you need to register? IR365 | October 2018 STEP 1 Deciding to register www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Accounting basis The way you choose to claim and pay your GST is called an accounting basis. There are three methods of accounting for GST. The two most used methods are the payments basis and the invoice basis. Accounting basisWho can use it Payments basisA registered person can use this basis if the total amount of sales: • was $2 million or less in the last 12 months, or • is unlikely to be more than $2 million in any 12-month period beginning on the first day of any month. A registered person with turnover of more than $2 million may be able to use this basis. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: GST-registered). Invoice basisAny registered person can use this basis. Hybrid basisAny registered person can use this basis, but it's not commonly used by small businesses. Payments basis Using the payments basis you account for GST at the end of the taxable period that you make or receive the payment in. The payments basis is a good way to help businesses manage their cash flow. You only pay GST to us after you've received payment from your customers and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you've paid for. Note: Around 78% of businesses choose the payments basis for their GST accounting basis. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis you claim GST when you receive an invoice and you account for GST at the earlier of issuing an invoice or receiving payment. This means if you've issued or received an invoice during a taxable period then: • you pay us the amount of GST shown on the invoices you've given to your customers (regardless of whether you've received a payment or not), or • you pay us the GST included in a payment you've received (even if you haven't raised an invoice), and • you claim a credit for the amount of GST shown on tax invoices you've received from your suppliers (regardless of whether you've paid your supplier). Hybrid basis A less frequently used method is the hybrid basis, which is a combination of the invoice and payments bases. GST on sales and income is accounted for using the invoice basis and GST on expenses and purchases is accounted for when payment is actually made. This method can be complicated and is not commonly used by small businesses. Taxable periods/filing frequency A taxable period is how often you file your GST returns, ie, monthly, two monthly or six monthly. This may also be known as your filing frequency. Taxable periodWho can use it MonthlyAny registered person. If taxable supplies\* exceed or are likely to exceed $24 million in any 12 months you must use a monthly period. Two monthlyAny registered person provided they don't meet the criteria for having to use the monthly period. Six monthlyA small business whose turnover hasn't exceeded $500,000 in the last 12 months and is unlikely to exceed this in the next 12 months. \* Taxable supplies are goods and services you provide in your business. Monthly Anyone can choose to file GST returns monthly. You may choose monthly returns if you're entitled to frequent GST refunds, such as exporters. Two monthly You can choose to file your returns on odd or even months. Preparing your GST accounts every two months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements. Many businesses say that completing GST returns every two months helps them keep in touch with business progress. Six monthly Preparing your GST accounts every six months may be an option for smaller businesses with fewer transactions. You can apply to file your returns six-monthly if the value of your total sales: • was not more than $500,000 in the last 12 months, or • is unlikely to be more than $500,000 in the next 12 months. GST and provisional tax—if you're liable for provisional tax your taxable period will need to be aligned with your balance date.

Voluntary registration If your turnover is less than $60,000 and you don't charge GST in your prices, you don't have to register for GST. You may wish to voluntarily register. Advantages • You can claim back GST on purchases, including capital items. • You can claim back GST on secondhand goods purchased from someone who isn't registered that you've bought to use in your business. • You can claim GST on business set-up costs. • Completing regular returns helps keep your records up to date and accurate. Disadvantages • You need to account for GST on all of your taxable supplies. • Complying with GST requirements takes time, as you need to file returns and make payments on time to avoid late filing and payment penalties. • You can't claim GST paid on exempt supplies. • You need to pay GST on the current market value of assets when you sell them or deregister. Non-profit bodies Non-profit bodies can apply in writing to have each branch and division registered separately. However, each branch or division must maintain its own accounting system and: • be in a separate location, or • carry out different activities. Branches and divisions with a turnover of: • more than $60,000 for any 12-month period must register • less than $60,000 for any 12-month period may voluntarily register. What is a non-profit body? Any society, association or organisation: • that is not operated for profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules prevent the distribution of money or property to any of its members, proprietors or shareholders. Examples include charitable organisations, sports clubs, parent-teacher associations (PTAs), churches, social clubs.

IR365 | April 2023 STEP 1 Deciding to register ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Accounting basis There are 3 ways of accounting for GST; payments, invoice or hybrid. You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you do not choose an accounting basis when you register, we’ll put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis after you’ve registered, you can do this in myIR. Accounting basis Who is eligibleWhat you need to do Payments basis If your total sales are: • $2 million or less in the last 12 months • likely to be $2 million or less in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of a month. In your GST return for the period include: • amounts you’ve been paid by customers • amounts you’ve paid to suppliers. Under the payments basis, account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps manage cash flow because you only pay us GST after you’ve received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you’ve paid for. You must have taxable supply information to support the expenses in your return. Invoice basis AnyoneIn your GST return for the period include: • amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet • the full sale price if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them • amounts you’ve been invoiced by suppliers, even if you have not paid them yet. Using the invoice basis, you will account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you provided an invoice to your customers or received an invoice from your supplier. You must have taxable supply information to support the expenses in your return. Hybrid basis Anyone Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. In your GST return: • use the invoice basis for your sales • use the payments basis for your expenses. Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. You must have taxable supply information to support the expenses in your return. Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). Note: Around 78% of businesses choose the payments basis for their GST accounting basis.

Taxable periods/filing frequency Your taxable period for your GST returns is also known as your filing frequency (how often you file). You can choose your taxable period – monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. Taxable periods for 2 or 6 monthly returns must align to your balance date for income tax. If you do not choose a taxable period when you register, we’ll put you on the 2-monthly option aligned with your balance date. Monthly • You must file monthly returns if your sales are over $24 million in any 12-month period. Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you’re entitled to frequent GST refunds. 2-monthly • Anyone with sales under $24 million in any 12-month period. You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months aligned to your balance date. Filing returns every 2 months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements and in touch with your business’s progress. 6-monthly • Anyone with sales under $500,000 in any 12-month period. You only need to file 2 GST returns a year, but it can be a big job for 6 months’ worth of trading in one go. This option is more suitable if your business does not have a large volume of transactions. myIR registration It's easy to complete the online GST registration.

If a creditor repossesses and then resells goods that were used in a taxable activity, the GST must be accounted for on the sale, unless either: • the debtor advises the creditor in writing that the sale would not be taxable if they had sold the goods themselves, and the reasons why such a sale would not be taxable, or • the creditor holds enough reasonable information to conclude that a sale by the debtor would not have been taxable. If the debtor and purchaser are both registered for GST then the zero-rated rules may apply. Please refer to the GST guide (IR375). The creditor’s responsibility to file a special GST return is not affected by whether or not they are registered for GST. Registration number Print the GST registration number for the person selling the goods (creditor) in Box 1 and the person whose goods were sold (debtor) in Box 4. If the creditor or the debtor is not GST-registered, please provide their IRD numbers instead. Month of sale Show the last day of the month when the sale(s) were made. This is the basis for when your return and payment will be due. Schedule Show a clear description of the goods sold. Continue on a separate sheet if you need more space. Selling price For each of the items listed, show the total amount the goods were sold for. This amount is GST-inclusive. GST content Multiply the selling price by 3 and divide by 23 equals or show 0.00 if zero-rated. Refer to GST guide IR 375 for further details on the zero-rated rules. Filing • The creditor must complete a separate return for each person whose goods were sold, and for each month of sale. • The creditor must send the special return and payment to Inland Revenue and keep the bottom copy for their records. • For any sales from March 2007 onwards you must file this special return and account for the GST by the 28th of the month following the month of sale. There are two exceptions to this, the month of November, the special return is due on the 15th of January and the month of March, the special return is due on the 7th May. For any sales up to February 2007 you must file this special return and account for the GST by the last working day of the month following the month of sale. • The creditor must also provide the information shown on the return to the debtor by this date.

This guide tells you how GST works and tells you how the majority of businesses manage their GST obligations. Read our GST plus (IR546) guide for information on infrequent and/or complex GST issues which will only apply to a limited number of registered persons, or will only occur under certain conditions. GST registration If you're reading this guide we assume you've already registered for GST. You'll fall into one of these two groups: • your business turns over, or is expected to turn over $60,000 or more a year (turnover is your total income before expenses and GST), or • you've decided to register voluntarily for GST. When you registered you would have received a letter giving: • your GST number (which may be the same as your IRD number) • your registration start date • your accounting basis (the way you claim and pay your GST) • your taxable period (how often you need to file returns). If you voluntarily registered for GST, and after reading this guide you decide that registering was a mistake, you may de-register. See Part 3 of this guide for more information about ending your GST registration. If you haven't registered for GST but you're considering it, we advise you to read our factsheet GST - do you need to register? (IR365) first. GST added to myIR secure online services If you complete your GST registration through your myIR account, in most cases you'll receive immediate confirmation of your GST number and registration details (which you can save for your own records). Then, each time your return is due for filing we'll advise when the return is available in myIR for you to complete and submit by the due date. GST filing through accounting software You can file your GST return directly to us through your accounting software. If you use accounting software to prepare your GST return, check with your software provider to see if they offer this service. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: accounting software). Non-resident GST rules The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. Non-resident GST business claimants Non-resident businesses that don't carry out a taxable activity in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for and claim GST. Non-resident businesses supplying remote services Non-resident businesses that supply remote services, including online services, from outside New Zealand to customers who are residents in New Zealand may be required to register for GST if they meet certain conditions. For full details go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident GST). 5 www.ird.govt.nz Key points • If you're registered for GST you must add 15% to the sale price. • When you receive GST from your customers, you hold this money to pass on to us. What GST is charged on GST is a 15% tax on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Supplying or making a supply is your taxable activity. A taxable activity includes these goods and services: • services such as graphic design, hairdressing, mechanical building, painting • products such as clothing or cars, fish and chips • experiences such as bungee jumping, skiing, kayaking, going to the movies • professional services such as legal advice. Adding GST to your goods or services When adding GST to the price of goods and services, multiply the amount by 15% (or 0.15) to get the GST-inclusive price. If the price already includes GST, multiply it by 3 then divide by 23 to find out the GST amount. Subtract this to get the GST-exclusive amount. Example Adding GSTSubtracting GST Product$ 100 × 15% Product $ 115 x 3 ÷ 23 GST amount$ 15GST amount $ 15 Product Plus GST amount $ 100 $15 Product Less GST amount $ 115 $ 15 GST-inclusive total$ 115GST-exclusive amount $ 100 You can also calculate the GST component by dividing the GST- inclusive price by 7.66666666. You must use at least 8 decimal places to calculate the correct GST component as using fewer decimal places can result in an incorrect answer. Using the fraction method (multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 23) will always provide you with an accurate answer. Part 1 - Explaining GST What happens to the GST I collect from my customers and pay on my purchases? There are two sides to the GST equation: • You collect GST through the sale of goods and services. • You pay GST through purchases and business expenses. When you file your GST return, you work out the difference between the amount of GST you've collected and the amount of GST you've paid. • If you've paid out more GST than you've collected, you'll receive a GST refund. • If you've collected more GST than you've paid, you'll need to pay the balance to us by the due date. You can only charge GST on your sales and income or claim it back on purchases and expenses if you're registered. When you receive GST from your customers, you hold this money to pass on to us. GST is not income for the business and needs to be paid to us when you file your GST return. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE6 Understanding your basic GST requirements Filing GST returns You're required to file regular GST returns. You can choose how often you do this - monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly. The period you choose is your "taxable period" or "filing frequency". If you didn't choose a taxable period when you registered we'll put you on the two-monthly option matching your balance date. You can apply to change your taxable period if this doesn't suit. Write and tell us which filing frequency you prefer. If we approve the change, we'll tell you when to start using your new taxable period - don't change until you hear from us. If you're registering for GST and you're also liable for provisional tax, you'll need to match your GST taxable period with your balance date. For example, if you file your GST returns two-monthly and have a March balance date your taxable periods are April/May, June/July, August/ September, October/November, December/January, February/March. Monthly Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you're entitled to frequent GST refunds. Two-monthly You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months. Preparing your GST accounts every two months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements. Completing GST returns every two months helps keep in touch with your business's progress. Six-monthly If your business has just a few transactions, this could be an option for you. You can apply for a six-monthly filing frequency if the value of your total sales: • was less than $500,000 in the last 12 months, or • is unlikely to be more than $500,000 in the next 12 months. When to file your returns You must file your GST return along with any payment due by the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period. There are two exceptions to this. If your taxable period ends on: • 30 November, your return and payment will be due on 15 January of the following year • 31 March, your return and payment will be due on 7 May. If the due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, the due date is the next working day. What are my options for claiming and paying GST? When you registered for GST you may have already chosen an accounting basis for claiming and returning your GST. The options are the invoice, payments or hybrid basis. If you didn't choose one we'd have put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis, put your request in writing, telling us which one you'd like to change to. Accounting basisWho can use it Payments basisA registered person can use this basis if: • the total amount of sales in the last 12 months was $2 million or less, or • the total amount of sales is unlikely to be more than $2 million in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of any month. Invoice basisAny registered person can use this basis. Hybrid basisAny registered person can use this basis - although it's not commonly used. Payments basis Under the payments basis you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps you manage your cash flow because you only pay us GST after you've received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you've paid for. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you issued an invoice to your customers or received an invoice from your supplier. You will: • pay us the amount of GST shown on the invoices you've given to your customers (whether you've received a payment or not), and • claim a credit for the amount of GST shown on tax invoices you've received from your suppliers (regardless of whether you've paid your supplier or not). Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. This method isn't used as much as the other two because it can get complicated. 7 www.ird.govt.nz What GST isn't charged on Some goods and services don't have GST added to them. These are: • sales by an unregistered person • sales of private property (eg, a car or home not used for business) • exempt supplies. Exempt supplies GST is not charged on exempt supplies, and they're not included in your GST return. These include: • financial services such as interest payments on loans or bank fees • donated products and services which are sold by not-for- profit organisations • rent paid on a private home • penalty interest. You can't claim expenses relating to exempt supplies. You don't show income from the exempt supply in your GST return. Zero-rated supplies Some goods and services aren't exempt supplies, but GST is charged at 0%. For example: • exported goods • sales of going concerns (selling or buying a business that will continue to run as the same type of business) • sale of land. If you have zero-rated supplies you can claim GST on your expenses. Include all zero-rated supplies in Box 5 of your return with your total taxable supplies. You also show these zero-rated supplies in Box 6 of your return. Example Joe's taxable activity is growing and selling apples. He exports some to America. Joe can claim the full cost of fertilisers and sprays used in the business. GST isn't charged on the apples Joe sells to America. He enters the income as part of his sales in his GST return and then makes an apportionment between the zero rated supplies and taxable supplies. For further information on zero-rated supplies see page 37. Record keeping Records must be in English or Māori, unless Inland Revenue has given written authority to keep records in another language. Key points • Keep all the paperwork that supports and explains your GST figures. • Keep business records for seven years. • Complete records save you time. • Make sure your business GST number is clearly visible on all your business tax invoices. Good record keeping ensures that your GST return process runs smoothly. You'll need all the relevant information to complete your return. You should keep: • copies of all business invoices you've sent out for payment • copies of business receipts for items such as petrol and stationery • copies of all till tapes (received or given). For tax records kept in te reo Māori there are some exceptions: • Certain phrases in the GST Act eg “tax invoice” must be in English • Numerals must be in Arabic eg 1, 2, 3 etc. Decide on a record keeping system that suits you, for example: • a software programme that will let you enter all your financial information electronically and apply formulas to calculate your GST • a cashbook to develop your own records for your income, expenses and GST - see example on page 8. Make sure you have all the relevant invoices, receipts and bank statements for your business. This will help you find items quickly. You could set up a system by: • date order • supplier • taxable period • accounting basis (eg, if you use the payments basis, file your paperwork in the month you made the payment). At some stage we may audit your business. During an audit we look at your GST records and systems. How you document GST on your paperwork and maintain your records is very important. For example, keeping your zero-rated invoices separate from your other invoices is a good idea because they go in a separate box on your GST return.

As a GST-registered person you'll need to give your customers tax invoices. The information you put on a tax invoice depends on the value of the goods or services being sold. • If a sale is less than $50 you can issue or receive a receipt instead of a tax invoice, eg, a till receipt. • If you make a sale or purchase of $50 or more you'll need to give or keep a tax invoice.

You need to adjust your GST return to reflect this. In some instances, you may need to calculate a GST adjustment to either pay GST, eg, for a business asset used privately, or claim back GST that's already been paid, eg, for a private asset used for business. See part 4 of this guide. You may also need to make adjustments for certain late claims and credit or debit notes that include GST at the old rate of 12.5%. For other adjustments, you'll need to work out the private or exempt portion of various income and expenses. Many small businesses get help from their accountant/tax agent for adjustments. If you don't have an accountant/tax agent, see page 25 for more information, go to www.ird.govt.nz/gst or call us on 0800 377 776. Credit and debit notes You may have to include credit and debit notes in your calculations when you're making an adjustment. • Credit notes are issued when the price of a supply has reduced after a tax invoice was issued, eg, the return of faulty goods. • Debit notes are issued when the price increases after a tax invoice has been issued. Example 19 www.ird.govt.nz GST adjustments calculation sheet (IR372) The IR372 helps you calculate your GST adjustments. It lists the items which you need to make an adjustment for. Use the sheet to record the adjustments you need to make, then: • transfer the figures to your GST return • attach the sheet to your copy of the GST return • keep full details on how you calculated the items. Example: IR372 GST adjustments calculation sheet IR 372 August 2010 • Use this sheet to calculate the GST on your adjustments for your GST return. • Please use the GST guide (IR 375) to help you work out your adjustments. • Keep this sheet and full details on how these items have been calculated.

File your GST return, then call us on 0800 377 774 to discuss your payment options. Can I get an extension to the GST return due date? You can't get an extension of time to file a GST return. If you're unable to file by the due date, you can delegate your tax agent or an employee to file for you.

If you don't file your return,or file it late Key points • Late returns may get a late filing penalty. • You may have to pay a default assessment if you don't file your return. Late filing penalties If you don't file your return by the due date you may have to pay a late filing penalty. These are: • $50 for each return filed on the payments basis • $250 for each return filed on the invoice or hybrid basis. We'll send you a statement advising you of the late filing penalty and the due date for paying it. Late payment penalties and interest are charged on late filing penalties not paid by the due date. See page 21. 21 www.ird.govt.nz Default assessments If you don't send us a return, we estimate the amount of tax we think you should pay - a default assessment. In most cases, this amount will be higher than what you actually owe. You still have to file the overdue return, even if you pay the default assessment. When we get your completed return, we'll calculate the actual amount you need to pay, plus any penalties and interest. If you make a combined payment for GST and provisional tax but don't file your return, we'll use it to pay any GST default assessment and late filing penalty first. If you don't make your payment, or pay late Key points • Late payments will be charged late payment penalties and interest. Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it's late. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. If you can't pay your tax by the due date, please call us. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: managing penalties) for more information. Correcting an error in your GST return If you realise you've made an error or errors in a GST return you've filed that results in an under or overstatement of your tax liability, you can correct it in: • the next taxable period and calculate the adjustment, or • the same taxable period by writing to us with the details. But, if you've chosen a particular tax position and then change your mind about it, you can't correct it. Instead, you must use our disputes process, which means completing a Notice of proposed adjustment (IR770) and sending it to us no later than four months after the due date of the GST return it relates to. For more information on disputing an assessment, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment (IR778). Making the correction in the next taxable period The error or errors can be corrected in the next taxable period, when: • you provided the return which contains one or more errors in the assessment of their liability for GST, and • the total discrepancy in the assessment that is caused by the error is $1,000 or less. So, if you haven't claimed an expense for GST in one taxable period you can claim it in a following taxable period, provided you meet the above criteria. You can also correct an error made in calculating the amount of GST you’ve collected in the next taxable period, provided the purpose isn’t to delay the payment of tax, when the total discrepancy is equal to or less than both: • $10,000 of the GST collected, and • 2% of the GST collected. GST collected refers to the amount of GST you’ve collected on sales and income only, not your net GST to pay. Record keeping You must record these details in your GST paperwork and make the information available to us if we ask for it: • what GST return period the error occurred in • the GST amount involved • the type of error • which GST return period you made the correction in. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE22 Making the correction in the same taxable period In some instances, you may be able to request us to amend an assessment to correct the error. Send us the following details: • The GST taxable period the error occurred in. • The GST amount involved and what the amended figures should be. • The type of error and why the change is needed. We'll then amend your original GST assessment and send you a statement of account. Or you can include a GST input tax deduction not claimed in an earlier return period in a later return period. In most cases, claim the GST within two years of being entitled to claim it. Please do not send us an amended GST return. Interest If the reassessed GST is an amount to pay and it's over $100 we'll charge you use-of-money interest. But, if the amount of reassessed GST is a refund over $100, we'll pay you use-of-money interest. Penalties We may ask for more information to decide whether we'll charge a shortfall penalty. No No Ye s Ye s Ye s No Ye s Ye s No No We recommend you stay registered for GST. But you must keep filing your GST returns even if they're nil. Are you planning to restart your business or start a new business within the next 12 months? Has your turnover dropped below $60,000? Have you stopped trading/ceased your business? Your GST registration is not compulsory. You could deregister for GST. Advantages in staying registered • You can claim GST on items you buy for your business • Keeping a GST cashbook is a good way to keep track of how your business is going • You can claim GST on business costs • When you cancel your GST registration you have to pay GST on any current assets you keep. • Disadvantages in staying registered • You still have to file GST returns regularly • If your business is making a profit you have to pay GST. You've decided to stay registered. But you must keep filing your GST returns even if they are nil. Note: If you remain registered after 12 months but you're not carrying out a taxable activity, you'll need to deregister and you must let us know within 21 days. • You can cancel your registration through myIR secure online services when you file your final GST return or send us a completed IR315 form. • When filing your final return, account for any assets kept or sold • Pay your last GST return assessment • Keep your records for seven years. For more information about your obligations go to www.ird.govt.nz/gst Remember, you can re-register for GST if you want to restart your current business or start a new one. Do you want to deregister from GST? You must stay registered for GST. Is GST automatically included in your prices, eg, taxi fares? 23 www.ird.govt.nz Key points • There are 3 reasons for cancelling your GST registration. • You'll need to file a final GST return when you deregister. • Your provisional tax due dates will change if you filed GST six-monthly or calculated your provisional tax using the ratio method. Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration You can cancel your GST registration if: • you're closing down or selling your business • you expect your turnover to drop below $60,000 - and stay there for a while • you realise you aren't required to be registered. When you cancel you'll no longer: • have to charge GST on prices to customers • be able to issue receipts and invoices showing your GST number • have to file a GST return • be able to claim GST back from us. But, before you get the deregistration process under way, check the flowchart below. You may only have to suspend your GST activities. Should I deregister from GST? Start GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE24 What you need to do If you decide to deregister, you must let us know within 21 days of the date you close down or sell your business. You can cancel your registration through myIR when you file your final GST return (up to your date of cancellation, which may not be the end of your normal taxable period) or send us a completed Business Cessation (IR315) form. Remember to account for GST on any business assets you keep. Make a note of these assets and their values on the IR315. For more information about your obligations go to www.ird.govt.nz/gst What we'll do We'll send you notice of your actual cancellation date, which will normally be the last day of a taxable period. This may not be the end of your normal taxable period. Example Martin's next GST return is for the period 1 June to 31 July 2017. On 5 June 2017 Martin tells us he's sold his business. We tell Martin his cancellation date is 30 June 2017. Martin completes a final return for the period 1 June to 30 June 2017 which is due on 28 July 2017. If you're liable to pay provisional tax the due dates will change if you were registered on a six-monthly basis or you use the GST ratio method to calculate your provisional tax. For more information see our Provisional tax (IR289) guide. 25 www.ird.govt.nz Adjustments for capital or asset items You are required to apportion your input tax deductions in line with the actual use of your goods and services. The rules operate as follows: • The amount of input tax deduction you can claim must correspond with the portion of the asset's use that is intended for taxable purposes. • In subsequent years, you may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the actual use for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. • There is a maximum number of adjustment periods required based on the value of your goods or services, excluding GST. These are as follows: - $5,001 to $10,000 - two adjustments - $10,001 to $500,000 - five adjustments - $500,001 or more - ten adjustments. You may also select the maximum number of adjustments based on the estimated useful life of the asset. • There is no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land. • Special "wash-up" rules apply when goods and services that have been subject to the apportionment rules are sold or the person deregisters. • Special rules apply to the concurrent use of land for taxable and non-taxable purposes. For help calculating your adjustments use our online calculator at www.ird.govt.nz "Work it out" Adjustments on purchases and expenses You can claim a deduction of the purchase of goods and services to the extent to which those goods and services are used for making taxable supplies. You must estimate on acquisition how you intend to use the goods or services and choose a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result, which will be expressed as a percentage of the total use. The estimate could be made on the basis of any available records, previous experience, business plans or other suitable methods. The method of working out the extent of intended taxable use will largely depend on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, if the asset is a car which is intended to replace an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of stipulating the intended use of the purchased car provided patterns of use are largely unchanged. Example John buys a car for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000) to replace his existing car. The car will be used both in John's business as a sole trader and for private purposes. Part 4 - Adjustments The logbook kept by John for his old car shows that in the previous year he used the car 70% of the time for business purposes. Since John does not expect this ratio to substantially change in the future, he estimates that he will use the new car 70% for taxable purposes. Consequently, on acquisition John claims 70% of the available input tax: $3,000 × 70% = $2,100 The new rules aim to achieve as much "first instance" accuracy as possible by requiring taxpayers to make fair and reasonable estimates on the intended taxable and non-taxable uses of acquired goods and services. In an "adjustment period" following the initial input tax deduction claim, you may, however, be required to make further adjustments if the actual taxable use of an asset is different from its intended taxable use. Exclusions (where no adjustments are required) de minimis provision In a similar way to the current rules, recipients will not be required to apportion input tax if they make both taxable and exempt supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe the total value of their exempt supplies in the first adjustment period will be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies. This is known as the de minimis provision which relieves you from the obligation to apportion input tax in certain circumstances. Example A corner dairy spends $6,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations. The major part of the dairy's business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors' account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made, the dairy isn't required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations. Value of supply No subsequent change-in-use adjustment will be required for goods and services acquired for the GST-exclusive value of $5,000 or less. Example Sherry, a graphic designer, buys a computer for $3,999 (including GST of $522) to use both for business and private purposes. She estimates she will use the computer 80% for taxable purposes and claims a deduction of $418 (80% of $522). Since the GST-exclusive value of the computer is less than $5,000, Sherry will not be required to make any adjustments for change in use in any of the subsequent adjustment periods. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE26 Less than 10% If the percentage of actual use of goods or services differs from the percentage of intended use or previous actual use, you will be required to make an adjustment in an adjustment period only if the difference between the amounts is 10 percentage points or more, or the value of the adjustment is more than $1,000. Example Tim buys a new car for $25,000. Tim calculates the GST content (the amount of input tax) as $3,260.87. He calculates this as follows: $25,000 × 3 ÷ 23 = $3,260.87 Tim predicts he will use the car 60% for taxable purposes and claimed 60% of the input tax. He calculates this as follows: $3,260.87 × 60% = $1,956.52 First adjustment - after one year After a year, Tim reviews his business records and notes that he actually used the car in his business 64% of the time. When the percentage of actual use is compared with the estimated use it shows a 4% difference (64% − 60% = 4%). $3,260.87 × 4% = $130.43 As the 10% threshold has not been exceeded and the monetary value is less than $1,000, Tim is not permitted to make an adjustment in this taxable period. If Tim had purchased a more expensive car such as a Mercedes valued at $200,000 the calculation would be: $200,000 × 3 ÷ 23 = $26,086.96 (GST content) $26,086.96 × 60% = $15,652.18 (percentage of business use) $26,086.96 × 4% = $1,043.48 (percentage difference) The 10% threshold has not been exceeded. However, the monetary value is more than $1,000 so Tim is required to make an adjustment in this taxable period of $1,043.48. Adjustment period An "adjustment period" is normally 12 months, ending on your balance date. The most common balance date is 1 April to 31 March. The first adjustment period is a period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on either: • the first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition or • the first balance date that falls after at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. All subsequent adjustment periods will be done annually, ie, 12 months ending on your balance date. Example Mary buys a car on 1 February 2017. Her balance date is 31 March. Mary can choose when her first adjustment period ends. The options are: • from 1 February 2017 to 31 March 2017, or • from 1 February 2017 to 31 March 2018. If Mary has chosen the first option as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. If Mary has chosen the second option as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. As mentioned earlier there are a maximum number of adjustment periods depending on the value of goods or services. However, there is no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land. You must compare the percentage actual use of goods or services with: • the percentage intended use of the goods or services (if no previous adjustment has been made), or • the previous actual use (if the goods or services have been subject to a previous adjustment). Example Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/ previous actual use. Peter acquires a luxury boat for $500,000 plus GST. When he bought it, Peter estimated the boat would be used 100% for chartering - a taxable purpose - and claimed the full input tax deduction. However, in later periods Peter uses the boat partly for private purposes. Based on the value of the boat, Peter determines there will be five adjustment periods. In those adjustment periods, Peter uses the boat as follows: • in the first adjustment period - 100% for taxable purposes • in the second adjustment period - 80% for taxable purposes • in the third adjustment period - 83% for taxable purposes • in the fourth adjustment period - 50% for taxable purposes, and • in the fifth adjustment period - 90% for taxable purposes. The first adjustment period is a period of six months. All subsequent adjustment periods are periods of 12 months. None of the exclusions apply to this situation. The question is: what are the use percentages Peter has to compare at the end of each adjustment period? First adjustment period Percentage intended use - 100% Percentage actual use - 100% 27 www.ird.govt.nz Second adjustment period Previous actual use - 100% In this adjustment period it was used 80% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 18) + (80% × 12 ÷ 18) = 33.3 + 53.33 = 86.6% Percentage actual use - 86.6% In the above calculations, figures "6" and "12" represent, respectively, the length of the first and second adjustment periods expressed in months. The figure "18" represents the total number of months since the acquisition of the boat. Third adjustment period Previous actual use - 86.6% In this adjustment period it was used 83% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 30) + (80% × 12 ÷ 30) + (83% × 12 ÷ 30) = 20% + 32% + 33.2% = 85.2% Percentage actual use - 85.2% Fourth adjustment period Previous actual use - 85.2% In this adjustment period it was used 50% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 42) + (80% × 12 ÷ 42) + (83% × 12 ÷ 42) + (50% × 12 ÷ 42) = 14.3% + 22.9% + 23.7% + 14.3% = 75.2% Percentage actual use - 75.2% Fifth adjustment period Previous actual use - 75.2% In this adjustment period it was used 90% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 54) + (80% × 12 ÷ 54) + (83% × 12 ÷ 54) + (50% × 12 ÷ 54) + (90% × 12 ÷ 54) = 11.1% + 17.8% + 18.4% + 11.1% + 20% = 78.4% Percentage actual use - 78.4% Peter will be required to account for adjustments to us in the second, third, fourth and fifth adjustment periods because in each of those periods either the percentage difference is more than 10 percentage points or the monetary value of the adjustments is more than $1,000. The following example pulls everything together and shows typical adjustments over four adjustment periods with the asset being sold in the final adjustment period. This example details the adjustments that are required on disposal of goods and services. Example John, a sole trader bought a vehicle for $20,000 plus $3,000 GST. On acquisition, John claimed 70% of the input tax - $2,100. Since the GST-exclusive value of the car falls between $10,001 and $500,000, he has to monitor the use of the car for five adjustment periods. In the first adjustment period (12 months), John's logbook entries show he used the car 55% for business (taxable use). In the second adjustment period (12 months), John used the car 65% for business. In the third adjustment period (12 months), John withdrew the car from use in the business and used it solely for private purposes. In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car for $10,000 inclusive of GST. First adjustment period At the end of the first adjustment period, John has to determine whether he may rely on the exclusions (minimal exempt supplies) or (the value of the supply) to avoid any change-in-use adjustments. John determines that the exclusion does not apply. John has to determine whether the use of the car in the first adjustment period corresponds to the intended taxable use of the car as estimated when he bought it. To do this he must compare the percentage actual use of the car with the percentage intended use of the car. The car logbook John kept showed the taxable use of the car accounted for 55% of its total use. On acquisition, John predicted he would use the car 70% for taxable purposes. Since the difference between the intended taxable use and the actual taxable use is more than 10%, John may not rely on the exclusion and has to make an adjustment for change in use. John calculates the amount of the deduction he has to return to us as output tax: $3,000 × 15% = $450. Second adjustment period For the second adjustment period, the percentage actual use must be calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. John used the car for taxable purposes 55% in the first adjustment period of 12 months and 65% in the second adjustment period of 12 months. Overall, over two years, John used the car 60% for taxable purposes calculated as follows: (55% × 12 ÷ 24) + (65% × 12 ÷ 24) = 60% John needs to compare the percentage actual use with "previous actual use" where an adjustment has been made. For John, the previous actual use will be 55%, as this was the actual use of the car at the end of the first adjustment period. Since the difference between the percentage actual use (60%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is less than 10 percentage points, John will not be required to account for the amount of the adjustment if the value of the adjustment is less than $1,000. John calculates the value of the adjustment is less than $1,000 as follows: $3,000 × 5% = $150 (no adjustment is required). GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE28 Third adjustment period John calculates the percentage actual use of the car after three adjustment periods as follows: On acquisition John estimated the use of the car as 70%. In the first adjustment period the car was used 55% for taxable purposes. The adjustment period was 12 months. The total number of months since acquisition was 36. (55% × 12 ÷ 36) = 18.3% In the second adjustment period the car was used 65% for taxable purposes. (65% × 12 ÷ 36) = 21.7% In the third adjustment period the car was used privately with zero business use (0% × 12 ÷ 36) = 0% The percentage actual use since acquisition is 40%. 18.3% + 21.7% + 0% = 40% This percentage has to be compared with the previous actual use. Since John did not make an adjustment in the previous (second) adjustment period, the "previous actual use" will be the percentage actual use in a period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. John made an adjustment in the first adjustment period when his percentage actual use was 55%. This percentage will become John's previous actual use for the purposes of the adjustment in the third adjustment period. Since the difference between the percentage actual use (40%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is more than 10 percentage points, John has to account to us for the over-claimed amount of the deduction. The amount of the output tax to be accounted for is: $3,000 × 15% = $450. Wash-up rule When there's a change of use to either total taxable or total non-taxable use, there needs to be a wash-up adjustment made. This should occur when the use changes and remains unchanged for a further full adjustment period and even if the change is within the 10% or $1,000 threshold. This will eliminate the need for continual adjustments. The wash-up adjustment uses the following calculation: Full input tax deduction − Actual deduction Full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply, after taking into account any nominal GST component charged (on zero-rated land transactions). Actual Deduction is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments already made. Adjustment on disposal When you dispose of goods or services in the course of a taxable activity and you have not claimed a full input tax deduction you may claim an additional deduction. You'll need to know the: • "Tax fraction". For the purposes of the 15% GST rate, the tax fraction is 3 ÷ 23. • "Consideration" is the amount received, or treated as received, for the supply. • "Actual deduction" is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the date of disposal. The amount of deduction available on disposal of goods or services will be calculated under the formula: tax fraction × consideration × (1 − actual deduction/full input tax deduction) Example John, the sole trader in previous examples, has now sold his c ar. Fourth adjustment period In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car in the course of his taxable activity for $10,000. Because John has not claimed the full deduction for the car, he may claim an additional amount of the adjustment on its disposal calculated as follows: 3 ÷ 23 × $10,000 × (1 − $1,200 ÷ $3,000) = $783 The calculation is broken down as follows: 1. John calculates the GST on the amount received for the car ($10,000 × 3 ÷ 23 = $1,304.34). 2. John then calculates the actual amount claimed ($2,100 less $450 less $450 = $1,200). 3. The original GST on acquisition was $3,000. John has already claimed 40% of the original GST. 4. John then divides the amount claimed by the full amount of input tax that could be claimed ($1,200 ÷ $3,000 = 40%). 5. The amount of $10,000 (100% of the sale) will need to be returned as income. John can claim a "wash-up" of the percentage difference, ie, 60% calculated on the GST received on the sale price of the car (60% × $1,304.34 = $783). 6. John may claim a deduction of $783 for the taxable disposal of the car. The amount calculated under the formula, when added to any deduction already claimed, must not be more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply (or the nominal GST component, if the supply was zero-rated). 29 www.ird.govt.nz Example: Appreciating asset Sandy, a property developer, built two similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The total input tax on the construction costs that relate to house A is $30,000. Sandy claimed 64.8% of the total input tax - $19,440. At the beginning of the third adjustment period, Sandy sold the house to Nigel for $320,000 inclusive of GST. Since Sandy has not claimed the full input tax for the construction cost incurred for the property, she may make a final adjustment of the input tax: 3 ÷ 23 × $320,000 × (1 − $19,440 ÷ $30,000) = $14,692 The resulting amount of $14,692, when added to the deduction already claimed ($19,440), is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($30,000). So the amount of the adjustment that may be claimed by Sandy will be limited to $10,560. Example: Depreciating asset Charles bought a car for $46,000 (inclusive of GST of $6,000) and claimed 70% of the input tax ($4,200). Having used the car for the intended purpose for three years, Charles sells it for $30,000 inclusive of GST. Since Charles has not claimed the full input tax for the car and the car was sold in the course of the taxable activity, he may make a final adjustment of the input tax: 3 ÷ 23 × $30,000 × (1 − $4,200 ÷ $6,000) = $1,174 The amount of the adjustment to be claimed for the taxable disposal of the vehicle is $1,174. Special rule for concurrent use of land Under the new apportionment approach, the portion of a deduction a person should be entitled to claim must correspond with the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one particular time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used by a person for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking the person's children to school - but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same time, eg, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. For the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). The following formula will help you in apportioning between concurrent uses of land: consideration for taxable supply × 100% = (percentage of taxable use) total consideration for supply The "consideration for taxable supply" is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The "total consideration for supply" is the sum of the amount of the "consideration for taxable supply" described above, and: • the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired, and • if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non- taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged. You may apply for an alternative approach if this formula doesn't fit your circumstances. The market value must be used in determining consideration for taxable supply and/or total consideration for supply if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm's-length amounts. If the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value. Example Sandy, a property developer, built two similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction. Sandy is unable to sell the properties immediately on completion. So, while still advertising the houses for sale, she: • rents out house A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period, and • moves into house B and lives there rent free. At the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells house B for $360,000. House A - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and exempt purposes (supplying a residential dwelling), she needs to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of house A, but ascertains the market value of the house is approximately the same as for house B ($360,000). GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE30 The total consideration for supply is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired ($386,000). Sandy's taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 As Sandy had originally claimed 100% on acquisition she has therefore claimed 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 House B - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Because Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and private purposes (residential) , she has to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is the amount derived on a disposal of the house ($360,000). Because Sandy did not rent out house B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the total consideration for supply. is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates she would have received $26,000 of rental income. Her taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 Sandy has deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this amount to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 In both cases, Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity. An additional formula estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is: months × result\* total months • "Months" is defined as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies. • "Total months" is defined as the total number of months since acquisition. • "Result" from calculation to establish the percentage of taxable use. Example The facts are the same as in the previous example and the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months. In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out house A and advertising it for sale. However, six months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising house A for sale because she decides to permanently rent it out. In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of house A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000. At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy identifies the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the total consideration for supply is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired (360,000 + 26,000 + 30,000 = $416,000). $360,000 × 100% = 86.5% $416,000 However, because the house has been used for six months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to calculate the percentage actual use: 18 × 86.5% = 64.8% 24 Sandy's percentage actual use of house A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the "previous actual use", ie, with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. So Sandy has deducted 28.2% (93% − 64.8% = 28.2%) more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 28.2% = $8,460 31 www.ird.govt.nz Adjustment for mixed-use assets You can claim a deduction when mixed-use assets are acquired, and when you acquire goods or services that relate to both income-earning and private use of a mixed-use asset (mixed- use expenses), to the extent that they will be used for making taxable supplies. The estimate of how you intend to use the goods or services should take into account the formula for the adjustment for mixed-use expenses below. Then, for the first adjustment period and subsequent adjustment periods, an adjustment is required for mixed-use expenses if the actual use of the mixed-use asset is different from the intended use. A new formula is used to calculate the adjustment for mixed- use expenses. It is similar to the calculation used to determine your deduction for income tax, based on income-earning days and private use days of the asset. The formula to calculate the adjustment is: total amount of input tax × income-earning days income-earning days + private days Formula definitions • "Input tax" is the total input tax for the mixed-use expenses, including the cost of the asset (excludes input tax relating solely to non-taxable and taxable use) • "Income-earning days" is the total number of days when rent or a fee is paid for the use of the asset, regardless of the amount paid. Includes consideration received from family, non-associated persons, and when the asset is being repaired or relocated • "Private days" is the total number of days the asset is used with no amount of rent or fee paid. Using alternatives to "days" You can use other measures in the formula if they reflect the time use of the asset more accurately. For example: • flying hours for an aircraft • nights for a holiday home. Example Regan purchases a charter boat on 1 April 2017 for $450,000 (GST inclusive) which is used both to earn income and for private use. He accounts for GST input tax for the year as follows: Fully deductible expenses Annual Maritime NZ survey fees $700 Charter advertising $400 Food/drinks (charter guests only) $500 Regan claims the full input tax and no adjustment is made as the expenses relate solely to income-earning. Not deductible $250 for family fishing licenses is a private expense, so no GST input tax is claimed. Apportioned (mixed-use) expenses There are apportioned (mixed-use) expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use, so Regan needs to work out how much GST he can claim. Mooring fees $2,000 Fuel $1,200 Insurance $2,450 General repairs $300 Total expenses $5,950 When Regan acquired the boat he estimated that the taxable use would be 50%. He claimed input tax on the mixed-use expenses of $29,735.86 (credit) as follows: ExpenseCostGST value50% input tax claimed Purchase of boat$450,000$58,695.65$29,347.82 Mooring fees, insurance, fuel $5,950$776.09$388.04 Total input tax $29,735.86 Income-earnings days Days fully chartered to the public 102 Days chartered at 50% market rate 20 to Regan's local fishing club Total 122 Private days Days the family used the charter boat 30 without making any payment income-earning + private days = 152 Total input tax (boat $58,695.65 + mixed-expenses $776.09) = $59,471.74 The calculation is: $59,471.74× 122 =$47,733.90 input tax 152 Regan claimed input tax of $29,735.86 during the year. He is entitled to claim a further amount $17,998.04 (credit) as an adjustment for input tax in Box 13 of his final GST return of the year. The calculation is: $47,733.90− $29,735.86=$17,998.04 If the amount of input tax calculated for the actual use of the asset was less than the input tax claimed during the year, the difference would be a debit adjustment added in Box 9 of the GST return for further GST to pay. For more information on what mixed-use assets are, please visit www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: holiday homes). You can find out more on the adjustment rules in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 9 (October 2013, page 21) at www.ird.govt.nz GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE32 Other adjustments Barters You can also exchange goods and services for other goods or services, or a combination of goods, services and money - this is b ar ter. If the exchange is for other goods and services, you must account for 3 / 23 of the open (current) market value of whatever you received in return for your supply. When part of the exchange is money, you must include: • 3 / 23 of the open (current) market value of the goods and services you received, as an adjustment in Box 9 of your GST return, and • the money received in Box 5 of your GST return. Use this rule whichever accounting basis you're on. You might also receive goods and services in full (or part- exchange) for your supplies from another person. Between you, work out a dollar value for the exchange, eg, a trade-in. You must include this agreed value, plus any money involved, in Box 5 of your GST return. Bad debts recovered If you've had a GST deduction for a bad debt written off and you later recover all or part of the debt, you must make an adjustment for the amount recovered. Include 3 / 23 of the amount recovered in Box 9 of your GST return. Example Manu, who uses the invoice basis, wrote off a bad debt of $2,500 and later recovered $1,600. He must make an adjustment of $208.70 ($1,600 × 3 ÷ 23) at the time of recovery, even if he's changed his accounting basis since then. Insurance payments received If you receive an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, include the GST content as an adjustment in the GST return that covers the time you received the payment. For example, an insurance company issues a cheque to cover equipment damaged in a fire. GST shown on New Zealand Customs invoices The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects GST when: • goods are imported into New Zealand. Customs charges GST on the landed value (including insurance , freight and duties) for the goods. • excisable goods (ie, alcohol, fuel and tobacco) manufactured in New Zealand are removed from a licensed manufacturing area for home consumption. Customs collects any applicable levies and any GST on those levies. Documents issued by Customs (such as a Customs import entry form C4, a Deferred payment of duty statement or Broker account statement) don't have to meet all the tax invoice requirements. These documents can be used to support a claim for a GST credit. Remember, you must hold these supporting documents to make a claim. Don't include imported goods under Box 11 on your GST return. When to account for GST paid to Customs The table below explains when to account for GST paid to Customs, depending on your accounting basis. For more information about GST on imported goods go to the New Zealand Customs Service www.customs.govt.nz (search keyword: importers) or call 0800 428 786. If you use the...you... invoice basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document in Box 13 of the GST return for the period you receive the invoice or make a payment, whichever is earlier. payments or hybrid basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document in Box 13 of the GST return for the period you make the GST payment. Home office expense It's common for businesses to use an area in the family home for work. If you do this you could claim GST on part of the running costs of your home. You don't have to have an area specifically set aside for business. You must keep full records of all expenses you want to claim. If there isn't a separate area for the business the apportionment will need to take into account criteria such as the amount of time spent on income-earning activities and the area used at home. No deduction is permitted for any private or domestic expenditure. Calculate your GST adjustment by working out the percentage of the area you use for work against the total area of your home. You can claim the adjustment either annually or on a period-by- period basis. 33 www.ird.govt.nz StepWhat to do 1Take the total taxable value of all fringe benefits from your FBT return. (This is the amount of the benefits, not the FBT itself.) 2Subtract the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common ones are: • low-interest loans • other financial services • international travel • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. The result is the fringe benefits liable for GST. 3Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 then divide by 23. This is the GST adjustment to include in your FBT return. Include this adjustment in: • Box 7 of the quarterly FBT return (IR420) for quarterly filers • Box 6 of the annual FBT return (IR422) for annual filers • Box 6 of the income year FBT return (IR421) for income year filers. Example: Taxable benefits for FBT quarter ended 31 March 2017 Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Low-interest loans $ 425 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Subsidy on employee's honeymoon trip to Fiji $ 600 Total $ 3,682 Benefits liable for GST are: Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Total $ 2,657 The low-interest loan and subsidy for the Fiji honeymoon aren't included because loans are exempt supplies and international travel is a zero-rated supply. The amount of the GST adjustment is $346.57 ($2,657 × 3 ÷ 23). Enter this in Box 7 for the FBT return for the quarter ended 31 March 2017. Pay the adjustment when your FBT for the March quarter is due. If an employee makes a payment direct to the employer towards a fringe benefit, this is a separate supply and is liable for GST. Include this payment as income in Box 5 of the GST return. The time of supply is the same as for any other sale by the business. Example An employee has paid $100 cash direct to the employer. Add the $100 to the sales in Box 5 of the GST return. The GST to pay on the $100 is $13.04. FBT (fringe benefit tax) Companies and employers registered for FBT don't need to make a private use adjustment. But, they will need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Sole traders, partnerships and trusts registered for FBT may still have to make a private use adjustment if the owner, partners, trust members or associated persons use business assets privately. They also need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Make the adjustment in the FBT return period you provide the benefits in. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE34 If you...you make the adjustment in the GST return that covers... don't have a tax agentthe date your income tax return is due or filed, whichever is the earlier date. Example If your 2017 income tax return is due on 7 July 2017 and you don't have a tax agent, you need to make your GST adjustment in the GST return which includes that date. have a tax agentthe earlier of: • the date your income tax return is filed, or • 31 March after the due date for your income tax return. have a tax agent who has an extension of time to file your income tax return the date your income tax return is actually filed. If an employee contributes to the expense, treat this as a separate supply for GST. Include the total expense amount in Box 11 on your GST return as usual and show the employee contribution in Box 5. Because the GST adjustment is based on the amount which isn't deductible for income tax, organisations that aren't liable for income tax, eg, non-profit organisations and charities, don't need to make this adjustment. Calculating the adjustment for entertainment expenses The table below explains how to calculate the adjustment for an entertainment expense using the example on the right. StepWhat to doExample 1To work out the GST, multiply the expense by 3 then divide by 23.$230 × 3 ÷ 23 = $30 2Subtract GST from the entertainment expense. $230 − $30 = $200 3Work out the amount that is not deductible for income tax (50%).$200 × 50% = $100 4Multiply the non-deductible amount by 15% (or 0.15). This is your GST adjustment. Show this GST adjustment on your GST adjustments calculation sheet (IR372) under "Entertainment expenses". Transfer the total amount to Box 9 of your GST return for the period ending 31 October 2018. $100 × 15% = $15.00 Before 1 April 2018 the GST component was calculated by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 23 (eg, $100 × 3 ÷ 23 = $13.04) at step 4. Example XYZ Ltd's only entertainment expense in the 2018 tax year was a business lunch for clients. The lunch cost $230 including GST. The income tax return for the year ending 31 March 2018 is filed on 7 July 2018, and the company files six-monthly GST returns for the periods April and October. XYZ makes the adjustment in the GST return for the six months ending 31 October 2018. The full $230 would have been included in Box 11 of an earlier GST return to claim the GST credit. Entertainment expenses Business entertainment expenses are related to taxable income, and are incurred in the course of running a business. Usually, only 50% of business entertainment expenses are deductible for income tax. Read our Entertainment expenses (IR268) guide for details. You'll need to make a GST adjustment of 15% of the GST-exclusive nondeductible amount once a year. You can't claim GST on private entertainment expenses, eg, a restaurant lunch with friends. During the year, keep showing your total business entertainment expenses on your GST return. The table below explains exactly when to make the adjustment depending on whether a tax agent prepares your income tax return. 35 www.ird.govt.nz Telephone expenses Cellphones If you have a business cellphone, you can claim GST on the total set-up cost. If you use the same cellphone for private use, you can claim GST on these running costs: • total fixed cost of running the phone • business calls. How to claim for telephone line rental See the table below. If you...you... have a commercial and domestic line rentalcan claim the GST on the full cost of the commercial line. Include the commercial rental cost in Box 11 on your GST return. You can't claim any part of the domestic rental. have only one telephone line rental and use it for business and private purposes can claim GST on 50% of the cost. Show 50% of the rental in Box 11 on your GST return. The line can be commercial or domestic. want to claim more than 50% of your rentalmust show that the actual business use of your telephone is greater than 50%. The proportion of business toll calls to private toll calls may be one factor in working out the overall business use. You'll need to consider other factors, eg, your type of business and how many people live in the house. are a farmermay claim the full cost of telephone rental used for business and private purposes. Include the full rental in Box 11 on your GST return. make business-related callsmay claim the full amount of GST on these calls. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE36 Bad debts written off If you supply goods or services and put them through the books, but later write off all or part of the consideration as a bad debt, you can make a credit adjustment in the period you write it off. How you do this depends on your accounting basis - see the table below. If you use the...you... invoice or hybrid basisaccount for a sale when you issue an invoice. If you've already included the GST on the sale in a previous return, and then later write off the debt, you'll use this adjustment. payments basiswon't account for the GST on a sale until you actually receive it. If you don't receive payment and write the debt off, you can't claim a deduction, because you haven't included the GST on the sale in any GST return. You may make an adjustment for door-to-door sales and hire purchase agreements if you use the payments basis - see page 40 and 41. Calculating a credit adjustment Show 3 / 23 of the full amount you've written off on the calculation sheet and include it in Box 13 of your GST return. You don't need to send in any documents supporting the write-off, but you do need to keep a record of the steps you took to recover the debt. For example: • a debtor's ledger showing the date you issued the invoice • letters from a solicitor/debt collector trying to recover the debt • a bad debts ledger showing the write-off. You must write off the debt(s). You can't claim for provision for bad debts. Example Brent, who uses the invoice basis, issues Chris with an invoice dated 26 October 2016 for electrical goods worth $115 including GST. Brent accounts for the sale in the return for the period ending 31 October. In the following March, Brent gives up hope of receiving payment from Chris and writes off $115 as a bad debt. Brent shows $115 × 3 ÷ 23 on his GST adjustments calculation sheet (IR372) under "Bad debts written off" and includes it in Box 13 of his GST return for the taxable period ending 30 April 2017. GST not charged on the full price If the bad debt was for goods or services where GST wasn't charged on the full price (eg, the fifth week of a hotel stay, or a hire purchase sale), the GST adjustment is not simply 3 / 23 of the bad debt. Use this formula to calculate the adjustment: bad debt written off ÷ total consideration × GST included in consideration = GST adjustment Example Sue stayed at the Holiday Hotel for six weeks. Her total bill was $6,005.57. Sue leaves, still owing $1,000. After some time, the hotel writes off the $1,000 as a bad debt. The amount of GST included in the total bill is $602.57. The hotel must make an adjustment in its return which covers the period of the write-off: $1,000 ÷ $6,005.57 × $602.57 = $100.33 37 www.ird.govt.nz Part 5 - Supplies Exempt supplies Some goods and services are exempt from GST so you don't include them in your GST return. These include: • penalty interest • renting a dwelling for use as a private home • residential accommodation under a head lease. Penalty interest Interest charged on overdue accounts is treated as an exempt supply. Example If you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90-day account basis, and that account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment shouldn't be included in your GST return because it's exempt. You don't pay GST on fines and penalties you get for a statutory offence, eg, parking penalties or infringement fees issued by courts or local authorities. Renting a residential dwelling The rent for a residential dwelling is exempt from GST. A landlord can't claim GST on any expenses, such as maintenance, rates and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least five years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents that property out, a change of use adjustment may be required. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 5, No 8 (January 1994) for more information. Residential accommodation under a head lease In most cases, if a property is leased as residential accommodation under a head lease, it's an exempt supply. But this rule doesn't apply if: • the buyer and seller agree the exemption doesn't apply • the supplier has, before 16 May 2000, treated the supply under the lease as being a taxable supply. Zero-rated supplies Some supplies are zero-rated for GST and taxed at 0%. Restraint of trade Any payment you receive in return for not conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand is zero-rated. Internet sales A registered New Zealand-owned entity that sells goods or services through the internet to customers in New Zealand will charge GST at the usual rate. But, a New Zealand-owned entity that sells goods or services through the internet to overseas buyers will generally charge GST at 0%. We expect sellers to take reasonable steps to check where the customer lives and where the goods or services are going. Sale of a going concern A going concern is a business sold "lock, stock and barrel" or is part of a business that can operate independently. The business must be a going concern at the time of sale, right up to the time of the transfer to the buyer. A supply of goods or services must meet these criteria to be a going concern: • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • It must be the supply of all the necessary goods and services for the activity to continue. • Both parties must agree in writing that there is a supply of a going concern. • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the buyer. The sale is zero-rated for GST if it meets all these criteria. Example Pat, a dairy farmer, sells his dairy farm (including land, herd, all buildings and all machinery) to another GST-registered farmer. This qualifies as the sale of a going concern, if both parties agree. If Pat had sold the land and buildings but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not qualify as a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated, see Land transactions. But, if he'd sold parts of the farm that could have been operated separately as a going concern, the sale would be zero-rated. Land transactions A GST-registered person must zero rate a supply, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • is made to another registered person, and • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE38 To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply will be taxed at 15%. Refer to www.ird.govt.nz (key words: zero rated). Not eligible for zero-rating Services performed in New Zealand for a third party Services performed under contract to a non-resident who lives outside New Zealand, which are delivered to a third party in New Zealand, and where it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract is entered into the services will not be received by the third party in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies, are not eligible for zero-rating. GST is charged at the standard rate of 15% if supplied to non- residents, but the supply is received in New Zealand. Example A Singaporean family wants their child to receive a year's education in New Zealand. The parents contract a New Zealand school to supply the tuition. The supply of the tuition is not zero-rated because the child will receive the tuition in New Zealand, and it was reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into that the child will not receive the tuition in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Example A non-resident tour operator buys accommodation from New Zealand hotels and puts them into travel packages for tours of New Zealand. The travel packages are then sold to non-resident tourists. The supply of accommodation contracted between New Zealand hotels and the non-resident tour operator isn't zero-rated because it's reasonably foreseeable another person (the non-resident tourist) will receive the services in New Zealand, and will not receive the accommodation in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Special supplies There are special rules for accounting for supplies which are different from normal business sales or purchases. Accommodation The supply of residential accommodation in a dwelling is exempt from GST. However, GST may be included for accommodation in a commercial dwelling. Commercial dwellings include: • hotels, motels, homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, inns, hostels or boarding houses • some service apartments • convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes or hospice • camping grounds • other commercial dwellings. Commercial dwelling doesn't include a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when it is supplied with the right to occupy. If your taxable activity is running a commercial dwelling, you can calculate the GST on the accommodation in two ways. Four-week rule Commercial dwellings For the first four weeks' stay, charge GST on the full value of accommodation in the dwellings. After four weeks, charge GST only on 60% of the value of the domestic goods or services, usually the right to occupy the premises, which may include any of the following: • cleaning and maintenance • electricity, gas, air-conditioning or heating • telephone (not tolls), television, internet, radio or similar chattels. Example Lauren stays for six weeks at the Comedy Hotel. The GST-exclusive costs are: 42 nights at $104 per night $4,368 Food and laundry $1,035 Comedy Hotel TAX INVOICE Lauren Hardie GST No. 987-654-321 71 John Street Christchurch 08 April 2017 28 days (first four weeks) at $104 per night$2,912.00 GST (15% of $2,912.00)$436.80 $3,348.80 14 days (after four weeks) at $104 per night$1,456.00 60% of $1,456.00$873.60 GST at 15%$131.04$131.04 $1,587.04 Food and laundry$1,035.00 GST at 15% $155.25 $1,190.25 Total due$6,126.09 Main Street PO Box 36 363 Phone: (04) 333 6666 WELLINGTON WELLINGTON FAX: (04) 333 6663 39 www.ird.govt.nz This is what Comedy Hotel needs to show in its GST return: first 28 days $ 436.80 next 14 days $ 131.04 food and laundry $ 155.25 total GST charged $ 723.09 $723.09 × 23 ÷ 3 = $5,543.69 which should be shown in Box 5. If a joint charge covers all supplies for bed and breakfast, the fully taxable supplies (breakfast) must be identified separately from the domestic goods or services (bed). Residential establishment, eg, boarding hostels, resthomes If you and the guest agree the stay is for longer than four weeks, you must charge GST on 60% of the value of domestic goods or services from the beginning of their stay. Advance payments A supplier who receives advance or progress payments must account for the GST on the payments. These are inducements for a supply of goods, not financial services (which are exempt supplies). Example Tina is a fruit grower. She receives an advance payment from her marketing board and accounts for it like this: She includes the advance payment in total sales in Box 5 of her GST return in the same period she receives it. If, for some reason, Tina has to pay back all or part of the advance she received from the marketing board it will be treated as a loan. As a loan, the advance will be exempt from GST because it's a financial service. Tina should ask us to reassess the return that included the advance payment. The marketing board may claim a GST credit for the advance payment made, as long as they hold the necessary tax invoice. If the advance is later repaid, it must be included in the total sales (Box 5). Any interest is exempt, because it's a financial service. A GST-registered agent who is involved in the transaction must account for GST on any commission or fee they charge. Auctions and auctioneers Ownership of goods under auction never passes to the auctioneer. Auctioneers sell goods on behalf of others (principals). An auctioneer may not know whether the principals are registered for GST, or whether to charge GST on a particular lot. The sale of goods on behalf of a non-registered principal isn't taxable. The sale of a registered person's private assets is generally not taxable. The auctioneer can charge and account for GST as though making the taxable supply, as long as both the principal and the auctioneer agree to this arrangement. If the principal is registered, the GST-inclusive sale price, less commission, is passed on to the principal who must account for GST. If the principal isn't registered, the auctioneer will pass the GST-exclusive sale price, less commission, on to the principal. An auctioneer who is registered for GST must account for the GST on fees or commissions. Auctions may be held on either a GST-inclusive or a GST-exclusive basis. The auctioneer should state this clearly at the beginning of the auction, so the bidders know whether or not their bids include GST. Price changes (credit and debit notes) Sometimes, the price of goods or services will change after you've prepared an invoice or made a payment. Here's what you need to do. Reduction of the agreed price If you supply goods and services and reduce the price of the supply after issuing an invoice or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the reduction in the taxable period you made it. This is usually the taxable period when the credit note was issued. If you've already issued a tax invoice, you must always issue a credit note. The buyer must include the reduction shown on the credit note in the return for the period covering the time of reduction. This is usually the period when the credit note was received. Note that if you purchased second-hard goods and the terms are varied (for example a discount being subsequently offered) you won’t receive a credit note but you must still include the reduction in the return for the period covering the time of the reduction. Example Angela sells cleaning goods to David for $1,000. David pays Angela $900 because some goods were damaged. Angela issues a credit note for $100. Both David and Angela use the invoice basis. Angela includes $1,000 in Box 5 (sales). She claims $100 in Box 11 (purchases) in the return covering the time when the reduction was made. If the invoice and credit note were issued in the same period, Angela could have shown the net amount of $900 in Box 5 instead. David claims $1,000 in Box 11 (purchases). He includes $100 in Box 5 (sales), in the return covering the time when he made the reduction. If the invoice and credit note were received in the same period, David could claim the next $900 in Box 11. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE40 Increase of the agreed price If you supply goods or services and increase the price of the supply after issuing an invoice or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the increase in the taxable period which you made it in. This is usually the taxable period when you issued the debit note. If you've already issued a tax invoice, you must issue a debit note for any price increase. The buyer must include the increase in the return covering the time the increase was made. This is usually the taxable period when the debit note was received. Example Mary sells goods worth $1,100 to Keith for $1,000 by mistake. Mary issues a debit note to Keith for $100. Both Mary and Keith use the invoice basis. Mary includes $1,000 in Box 5 (sales). She includes the extra $100 in Box 5 in the return covering the period the increase was made. Keith includes $1,000 in Box 11 (purchases). He claims $100 in Box 11 in the return covering the time the increase was made. Delayed settlement transactions If you're a GST-registered vendor and you enter into a property transaction with a delayed settlement date, you must account for GST using the invoice basis when the price of the property exceeds $225,000 including GST. You do this for any accounting basis. So, if you're on a payments basis you account for the GST when an invoice is issued or when payment is received, whichever happens earlier settlement is required within a 12-month period. These exceptions apply if: • the supply is made under a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property - under one year • the supplier is a non-profit body and at the time of supply, the recipient is not a registered person and is either: - not intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity, or - intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity but only after the full amount for the supply is paid to the supplier. Dishonoured cheques If a cheque is dishonoured, it's as though the payment wasn't made and you don't account for it. But, if you've already filed your return and it includes a dishonoured cheque and you use the payments basis, please contact us about correcting it - see page 48. If you use the invoice or hybrid basis, you can only make the correction when it's written off as a bad debt. Door-to-door sales The time of supply is the first day after the period in which the purchaser may cancel the sale. If you're a door-to-door salesperson, your buyers have either seven days or one month to cancel the sale depending on the cancellation period. You account for the supply in the taxable period covering the day after the final date for cancellation. Example Selena Wares, a door-to-door salesperson, sells an item on 31 May, the last day of the taxable period. The eighth day after the sale is 8 June. She includes the full price for the supply in the taxable period covering 8 June. If you purchase from a door-to-door salesperson, you can claim a credit in the taxable period that covers the first day after the cancellation period (provided you hold a tax invoice). This applies even if you get an invoice or make payment before that date. Full price not known at the time of supply Sometimes, a final price isn't settled until after the goods or services are physically supplied. If you're supplying goods or services like this and you use the invoice or hybrid basis you include the GST in the earliest period of when you: • issued an invoice for any part of this supply, or • have a payment due, or • received a payment. If you use the payments basis, you account for the supply when you receive payments. Example Andy sells produce to an exporter for a down payment plus an end-of-season catch-up, based on export prices. Andy accounts for the down payment immediately. He accounts for the catch-up payment when it's due, received, or when an invoice is received - whichever is earlier. However if you buy goods or services when you don't know the full price and you use the invoice basis, you claim a credit in the earliest taxable period you: • receive a tax invoice, or • make a payment, or • have a payment due. For purchases under the payments or hybrid basis, claim a credit when you make a payment. Gaming machines Gaming machine operators must register for and pay gaming machine duty. They must also pay GST on the value of the gaming machine revenue. This is the difference between: • the increase in metered turnover • less the increase in metered total wins during a return period. 41 www.ird.govt.nz The amount of any jackpots won during that return period is also deducted from total turnover, if the jackpot figure isn't included in the metered total wins. When accounting for GST, gaming machine revenue is calculated from the records you're required to keep for the Department of Internal Affairs. Where your monthly machine analysis reports or cashless gaming machine analysis reports are prepared to coincide with the last day of your taxable periods, you can use them to calculate the gaming machine revenue. You also pay problem gambling levy (PGL) on gaming machine profits. You can claim back the GST on PGL. For more information read our Gaming machine duty (IR180) guide. Grants and subsidies Any grant or subsidy you receive from the Crown or a public authority, is considered to include GST if you're registered for GST. Include the full grant or subsidy in Box 5 of your return. Example Helen employs 10 staff. She gets a $200 wage subsidy each week for eight weeks. The GST content is $208.69. $200 × 8 (weeks) $ 1,600.00 $1,600 × 3 ÷ 23 $ 208.69 Helen includes $1,600 as sales in Box 5 of her return. There is an exception for grants intended for international overseas development. You have to return GST on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand. If you receive a government grant or subsidy, you don't normally need to issue a tax invoice. However, if you receive a grant or subsidy, eg, a research grant, from another registered person, they will probably ask you for a tax invoice. If you pay a grant or subsidy in exchange for taxable supplies, you may request a tax invoice and claim a GST credit. Hire purchase agreements You must account for all hire purchase sales in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement, for all accounting bases. If you buy goods on hire purchase, you may claim a deduction in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement, for all accounting bases. Example Kay buys a carpet on hire purchase from Supreme Floorings on 7 June. The cash price is $1,100, which includes GST. The agreement is for 36 monthly payments of $46, totalling $1,656. Supreme Floorings accounts for the sale on the cash price of the goods ($1,100) in the period covering 7 June. Kay also claims for her purchase on the cash price in the period covering 7 June. The difference of $556 is the finance charge, which is an exempt supply. Insurance If you get an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, you must include the GST content as an adjustment in Box 9 of the return which covers the time you received the payment. Example Damien's distilling equipment was damaged by fire on 20 January 2017. An insurance company issued a cheque on 18 March 2017 for $4,500 to cover the damage. Damien includes $586.95 ($4,500 × 3 ÷ 23) in Box 9 of the return for the taxable period covering 18 March. You don't need to account for any insurance or compensation payment received for loss of earnings, eg, accident compensation. The insurer will still charge GST on their premiums for this type of cover. You don't account for any payment received under a life insurance contract, because the insurer can't charge GST on the premiums. Some types of insurance premiums are liable for GST (eg, fire and general insurance). A registered insurer may claim deductions for payments to policy holders when they are made. A tax invoice isn't needed. The insurer will need a tax invoice to deduct any other payments for claims on policies, eg, a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle. Insurers can't claim for payments made under life insurance policies. Lay-by sales The time of supply is the date the buyer gets legal possession of the goods. If the sale is cancelled and the seller keeps part of the money, the time of supply is the cancellation. Include the full cost of a lay-by sale in the taxable period in which the buyer takes ownership of the goods. This is the time of the final payment. Don't account for the lay-by payments as you receive each one, but wait until you receive the final payment, even if you use the payments basis. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE42 Example Sue buys a DVD player on lay-by from The Vision Shop in January 2017. The full price is $560. Sue pays $160 as a deposit, and instalments of $200 in February and March. The DVD player is delivered in April 2017. The Vision Shop accounts for GST in the taxable period covering March, because that's when Sue became the owner. If a lay-by sale is cancelled and the retailer keeps some of the payments already made (or receives any later payments), they account for this amount in the taxable period which the sale was cancelled in. GST is calculated on the full amount kept, or received later, and it must be included in the return. Example Sue cancels the agreement with The Vision Shop in February 2017 and gets a $300 refund. She loses $60 for doing this, which The Vision Shop accounts for in the taxable period covering February. If you buy goods on lay-by, you may claim a deduction when you have fully paid for them, and you have a tax invoice. When you cancel a lay-by sale, you may claim 3 / 23 of any cancellation charge made by the supplier, in the same period you cancel the sale, as long as you have a tax invoice. Local authority rates Local authorities are the only GST-registered organisations which charge rates. They use the invoice or hybrid basis to account for rates charged in full. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment, or • the due date for payment, or • the date when payment is received. Using the payments basis, local authorities account for all rates payments when they're received, whether they are paid in one instalment or several. Registered people may claim GST for rates payments for premises used in a taxable activity. If you use the invoice basis and you pay your rates in one lump sum, you may claim a GST credit when you make the payment or receive an invoice, whichever comes first. If you pay rates in instalments, you may claim a credit when each instalment is due or paid, whichever comes first. For the payments and hybrid basis, you claim a credit for rates when you make payment, if you hold a tax invoice. Periodic payments and hire agreements Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Private dwellings as part of taxable activity If a registered person buys a taxable activity that includes a dwelling, it may be treated as a separate supply (exempt). If the dwelling is treated as a separate supply, to claim a GST credit, the purchaser must prove the principal use of the dwelling is part of the taxable activity. If it isn't, the purchaser can't claim for it. Repossessions When a buyer doesn't keep up their payments in a hire purchase arrangement (debtor), the seller will usually repossess the goods and resell them. The original buyer (not the repossessor) is considered to supply the goods to the new purchaser if there is a forced sale. If the goods sold are used in a taxable activity, the repossessor must account for GST on goods sold after repossession, unless the repossessor has: • a written statement from the debtor, or • reliable information, eg, from the debtor's accountant or solicitor, that the goods wouldn't be a taxable supply if the debtor sold them. The repossessor will need to file a Goods and services tax return for goods sold in satisfaction of a debt (IR373). Example Brett sells a $1,200 fridge on hire purchase to Maria for her restaurant. Brett accounts for GST of $156.52 ($1,200 × 3 ÷ 23) in the return covering the period in which the agreement was made. Maria doesn't keep up the payments. Brett repossesses the fridge and sells it again. He then files an IR373. The sale after repossession, and the GST to be accounted for on it, is considered to be made by Maria. Sale of interest in a taxable activity In an unincorporated body, eg, a partnership, joint venture or trust, the body is the registered person, not the individual members. So, if a member sells an interest in the body, it's a private transaction between two people and not a taxable supply and there's no GST to account for. Secondhand goods For GST, secondhand goods are goods previously used and paid for by someone else, as in the common definition. It doesn't include: • new goods • primary produce - unless previously used • goods supplied under a lease or rental agreement • livestock 43 www.ird.govt.nz • secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal of any degree of purity (except to the extent that a good is composed of gold, silver, or platinum manufactured for sale to the public). Land is secondhand goods. The same rules for GST and tax invoices apply to secondhand goods as for all other goods liable for GST. For more information on how and when to account for GST see page 6. Secondhand goods if seller is not GST-registered If the seller isn't registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there will be no tax invoice or GST charged. If the purchaser is GST-registered they can claim a credit for GST purposes. To do this the purchaser must record: • the name and address of the supplier • the date of the purchase • a description of the goods • the quantity of the goods • the price paid. You'll also need to keep details of the transaction if you're going to make a claim for income tax purposes. It doesn't matter which accounting basis you use, you must make a payment before you can claim the credit for the purchase. Successive supplies and progress payments The "time of supply" is when a progress payment was made or when an invoice was issued, whichever came first. Goods or services must be either: • supplied progressively or periodically, and paid for in the same way, or • supplied directly in constructing, manufacturing or extending a building, or civil engineering work, with payments made periodically as the work progresses. If you get progress payments and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, account for the GST in the earliest taxable period a payment is due or received, or when you issue an invoice for that payment only. For the payments basis, account for GST when you receive payments. If you're making progress payments under the invoice basis, you may claim a GST credit in the earliest taxable period a payment is due, when you make a payment, or when you get a tax invoice for that instalment. You claim a credit in the taxable period you make a payment in if you're using the payments or hybrid basis. Supplies to associated persons Special rules apply if you make certain supplies to people closely associated with you, eg, relatives, closely connected associated companies or trusts. See page 2 for a definition of associated persons. Supply to registered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can claim a GST credit for the purchase, you account for GST on the amount received. Example Jones, Smith and Brown, a GST-registered partnership, sells a piano to Lee, a sister of one of the partners. Lee is registered for GST and can claim a GST credit on the purchase. The open (current) market value of the piano is $2,000, but the sale goes through for $1,500. The partnership accounts for GST of $195.65 ($1,500 × 3 ÷ 23). Supply to unregistered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can't claim a deduction, you must determine the open (current) market value of the supply and account for the market value, or the amount you charged, whichever is the larger amount. Enter this in your return. In the previous example, if Lee wasn't registered for GST, the partnership would account for GST of $260.87. This is the $2,000 market value multipled by 3 then divided by 23. Include transactions with associated persons in the return for the taxable period when the supply was made. If you get a payment or issue an invoice before the last date for filing that return, use either the payment date or invoice to work out which taxable period the supply falls in, depending on your accounting basis. Example A partnership has a two-month taxable period. The return for the period ended 30 April is due on 28 May. The partnership supplies goods with an open (current) market value of $135 to a non-registered brother of one of the partners on 24 April, and receives payment of $100 on 16 June. The partnership will account for $17.61 GST (on the market value of $135) in the return for the taxable period ended 30 April, because this is the period when the supply was made. If the partnership had issued an invoice or received payment during May (before the April return was due to be filed), the $17.61 GST would be included in the return for the taxable period ended 30 June because the invoice or payment would fall in the June period. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE44 Time of supply between associated persons Claim a deduction in your return for the taxable period when the supply is made available, removed or performed. However, if you make a payment or receive an invoice before the last date for filing the return for that taxable period you should instead claim the deduction in the taxable period: • in which you make any payment or an invoice is issued (whichever is the earlier), if you are an invoice basis taxpayer; or • in which, and to the extent, you make payment, if you are a cash basis or hybrid basis taxpayer. Tenders A GST-registered person may call tenders for a future supply of goods or services. The advertisement should state whether the tenders need to include GST. Occasionally, the person making a tender will have to pay a deposit. There isn't usually any GST on a deposit unless all or part of it is kept for some reason. Tokens, stamps and vouchers There are special rules for the sale of tokens, postage stamps and gift vouchers. The supplier should treat tokens, stamps and vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer buys them. GST can be accounted for when the customer actually exchanges the voucher for the monetary value of the goods or services bought, if both suppliers agree. Example A petrol station owner sells an oil company's $20 petrol voucher to a customer. The petrol station owner collects the $20 for the oil company and forwards it to them. The customer gives the voucher to a friend who buys petrol at another petrol station. Because there's an agreement between the petrol stations to return the GST on redemption of the voucher, the second petrol station tells the oil company they have sold petrol (goods) in exchange for a $20 petrol voucher. The oil company reimburses the second petrol station owner for the sale, who accounts for the GST on the $20 by including the total amount of the sale in Box 5 of their GST return. This option doesn't apply to postage stamps and vouchers sold to a non-resident for services performed in New Zealand. The supplier has to account for GST on these items when the customer buys them. Buying tokens, stamps and vouchers You can claim tokens, stamps and vouchers as an expense when you buy them, according to your accounting basis. 45 www.ird.govt.nz Part 6 - Your rights and obligations If you have a complaint about our service We're committed to providing you with a quality service.

Read our GST Plus - IR546 guide for information on infrequent and/or complex GST issues which will only apply to a limited number of registered persons, or will only occur under certain conditions. Non-resident GST rules The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. Non-resident businesses that do not carry out a taxable activity in New Zealand, but receive goods or services here, may be able to register for and claim GST. If you’re a non-resident business that supplies from outside New Zealand to consumers in New Zealand • • low-value goods (physical goods valued at NZ$1,000 or less each) • • remote services (such as legal and accounting advice) and digital products (such as e-books, software downloads and streamed movies and music) go to ird.govt.nz/gst/gst-for-overseas-businesses GST registration If you're reading this guide we assume you've already registered for GST. You'll fall into one of these two groups: • • your business turns over, or is expected to turn over $60,000 or more a year (turnover is your total income before expenses and GST), or • • you've decided to register voluntarily for GST. When you registered you would have received a letter giving: • • your GST number (which may be the same as your IRD number) • • your registration start date • • your accounting basis (the way you claim and pay your GST) • • your taxable period (how often you need to file returns). If you voluntarily registered for GST, and after reading this guide you decide that registering was a mistake, you may de-register. See Part 3 of this guide for more information about ending your GST registration. If you have not registered for GST but you're considering it, we advise you to read our factsheet GST - Do you need to register - IR365 first. Filing in myIR You can file GST returns in your myIR account. The benefits of filing in myIR include: • • instant confirmation you have filed your return • • faster processing. Filing in accounting software You can file GST returns with us through some accounting software. The benefits of filing through accounting software include: • • your GST return is pre-populated so you do not need to copy figures into your myIR or paper return • • instant confirmation you have filed your return. Your software provider can confirm if this filing feature is available as part of their software package. 5 What GST is charged on GST is a 15% tax on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Supplying or making a supply is your taxable activity. A taxable activity includes these goods and services: • • services such as graphic design, hairdressing, mechanical building, painting • • products such as clothing or cars, fish and chips • • experiences such as bungee jumping, skiing, kayaking, going to the movies • • professional services such as legal advice. Adding GST to your goods or services When adding GST to the price of goods and services, multiply the amount by 15% (or 0.15) to get the GST-inclusive price. If the price already includes GST, multiply it by 3 then divide by 23 to find out the GST amount. Subtract this to get the GST-exclusive amount. Example Adding GSTSubtracting GST Product$ 100 × 15% Product $ 115 x 3 ÷ 23 GST amount$ 15GST amount $ 15 Product Plus GST amount $ 100 $15 Product Less GST amount $ 115 $ 15 GST-inclusive total$ 115GST-exclusive amount $ 100 You can also calculate the GST component by dividing the GST- inclusive price by 7.66666666. You must use at least 8 decimal places to calculate the correct GST component as using fewer decimal places can result in an incorrect answer. Using the fraction method (multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 23) will always provide you with an accurate answer. Part 1 - Explaining GST What happens to the GST I collect from my customers and pay on my purchases? There are two sides to the GST equation: • • You collect GST through the sale of goods and services. • • You pay GST through purchases and business expenses. When you file your GST return, you work out the difference between the amount of GST you've collected and the amount of GST you've paid. • • If you've paid out more GST than you've collected, you'll receive a GST refund. • • If you've collected more GST than you've paid, you'll need to pay the balance to us by the due date. You can only charge GST on your sales and income or claim it back on purchases and expenses if you're registered. When you receive GST from your customers, you hold this money to pass on to us. GST is not income for the business and needs to be paid to us when you file your GST return. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE6 Understanding your basic GST requirements Filing GST returns You're required to file regular GST returns. You can choose how often you do this - monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly. The period you choose is your "taxable period" or "filing frequency". If you did not choose a taxable period when you registered we'll put you on the two-monthly option matching your balance date. You can apply to change your taxable period if this does not suit. Write and tell us which filing frequency you prefer. If we approve the change, we'll tell you when to start using your new taxable period - do not change until you hear from us. If you're registering for GST and you're also liable for provisional tax, you'll need to match your GST taxable period with your balance date. For example, if you file your GST returns two-monthly and have a March balance date your taxable periods are April/May, June/ July, August/September, October/November, December/ January, February/March. Monthly Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you're entitled to frequent GST refunds. Two-monthly You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months. Preparing your GST accounts every two months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements. Completing GST returns every two months helps keep in touch with your business's progress. Six-monthly If your business has just a few transactions, this could be an option for you. You can apply for a six-monthly filing frequency if the value of your total sales: • • was less than $500,000 in the last 12 months, or • • is unlikely to be more than $500,000 in the next 12 months. When to file your returns You must file your GST return along with any payment due by the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period. There are two exceptions to this. If your taxable period ends on: • • 30 November, your return and payment will be due on 15 January of the following year • • 31 March, your return and payment will be due on 7 May. If the due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, the due date is the next working day. What are my options for claiming and paying GST? When you registered for GST you may have already chosen an accounting basis for claiming and returning your GST. The options are the invoice, payments or hybrid basis. If you did not choose one we'd have put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis, put your request in writing, telling us which one you'd like to change to. Accounting basisWho can use it Payments basisA registered person can use this basis if: • • the total amount of sales in the last 12 months was $2 million or less, or • • the total amount of sales is unlikely to be more than $2 million in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of any month. Invoice basisAny registered person can use this basis. Hybrid basisAny registered person can use this basis - although it's not commonly used. Payments basis Under the payments basis you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps you manage your cash flow because you only pay us GST after you've received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you've paid for. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you issued an invoice to your customers or received an invoice from your supplier. You will: • • pay us the amount of GST shown on the invoices you've given to your customers (whether you've received a payment or not), and • • claim a credit for the amount of GST shown on tax invoices you've received from your suppliers (regardless of whether you've paid your supplier or not). Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. This method is not used as much as the other two because it can get complicated. 7 What GST is not charged on Some goods and services do not have GST added to them. These are: • • sales by an unregistered person • • sales of private property (eg, a car or home not used for business) • • exempt supplies. Exempt supplies GST is not charged on exempt supplies, and they're not included in your GST return. These include: • • financial services such as interest payments on loans or bank fees • • donated products and services which are sold by not-for- profit organisations • • rent paid on a private home • • penalty interest. You can not claim expenses relating to exempt supplies. You do not show income from the exempt supply in your GST return. Zero-rated supplies Some goods and services are not exempt supplies, but GST is charged at 0%. For example: • • exported goods • • sales of going concerns (selling or buying a business that will continue to run as the same type of business) • • sale of land. If you have zero-rated supplies you can claim GST on your expenses. Include all zero-rated supplies in Box 5 of your return with your total taxable supplies. You also show these zero-rated supplies in Box 6 of your return. Example Joe's taxable activity is growing and selling apples. He exports some to America. Joe can claim the full cost of fertilisers and sprays used in the business. GST is not charged on the apples Joe sells to America. He enters the income as part of his sales in his GST return and then makes an apportionment between the zero rated supplies and taxable supplies. Record keeping Records must be in English or Māori, unless Inland Revenue has given written authority to keep records in another language. Key points • • Keep all the paperwork that supports and explains your GST figures. • • Keep business records for seven years. • • Complete records save you time. • • Make sure your business GST number is clearly visible on all your business tax invoices. Good record keeping ensures that your GST return process runs smoothly. You'll need all the relevant information to complete your return. You should keep: • • copies of all business invoices you've sent out for payment • • copies of business receipts for items such as petrol and stationery • • copies of all till tapes (received or given). For tax records kept in te reo Māori there are some exceptions: • • Certain phrases in the GST Act eg “tax invoice” must be in English • • Numerals must be in Arabic eg 1, 2, 3 etc. Decide on a record keeping system that suits you, for example: • • a software programme that will let you enter all your financial information electronically and apply formulas to calculate your GST • • a cashbook to develop your own records for your income, expenses and GST - see example on page 8. Make sure you have all the relevant invoices, receipts and bank statements for your business. This will help you find items quickly. You could set up a system by: • • date order • • supplier • • taxable period • • accounting basis (eg, if you use the payments basis, file your paperwork in the month you made the payment). At some stage we may audit your business. During an audit we look at your GST records and systems. How you document GST on your paperwork and maintain your records is very important. For example, keeping your zero-rated invoices separate from your other invoices is a good idea because they go in a separate box on your GST return.

You need to keep the tax invoice for your GST records. When you buy supplies worth $50 or less it’s still a good idea to get a receipt. If you want to claim the GST on these purchases you will need a record of the: • • date • • description • • cost • • s ell er. Selling goods or services You should issue tax invoices when you sell goods or services. If the sale is worth $50 or less including GST, you can issue a receipt instead. Regardless of the amount of the sale, you must issue a tax invoice to another GST-registered entity if they ask you for one. You must do this within 28 days. It is an offence not to do this and we may charge you a penalty. What every tax invoice must show Every tax invoice you get or issue must show this standard information: • • the words 'tax invoice' in a prominent place • • the name (or trade name) and GST number of the seller • • the date of issue • • a description of the goods or services. Tax invoices must be in New Zealand currency. A tax invoice can only be issued once. If the buyer loses theirs you can give them another one but you must put the words 'copy only’ on it. Tax invoices for $1,000 or less If you get or issue a tax invoice for supplies, goods or services worth $1,000 or less including GST, it must show the standard information plus: • • the total amount payable • • a statement that the total amount payable includes GST. Tax invoices for more than $1,000 If you get or issue a tax invoice for goods or services worth more than $1,000 including GST, it must show the standard information plus the: • • name and address of the buyer • • quantity or volume of the goods or services, for example how many hours of labour, how many litres of petrol. The tax invoice must also show one of these: • • The GST-exclusive amount, the GST amount and the GST- inclusive amount. • • The GST-inclusive amount and a statement that GST is included if GST is charged at the standard rate for all the goods or services listed.

GST 970 / / Date 17 Example: Page 2 GST103B GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE18 Adjustments Key points • • There is often a crossover between personal and business use of goods and services. You need to adjust your GST return to reflect this. In some instances, you may need to calculate a GST adjustment to either pay GST, eg, for a business asset used privately, or claim back GST that's already been paid, eg, for a private asset used for business. See part 4 of this guide. You may also need to make adjustments for certain late claims and credit or debit notes that include GST at the old rate of 12.5%. For other adjustments, you'll need to work out the private or exempt portion of various income and expenses. Many small businesses get help from their accountant/tax agent for adjustments. If you do not have an accountant/tax agent, go to ird.govt.nz/gst or call us on 0800 377 776. Credit and debit notes When they’re used A seller must issue a credit or debit note if the price of goods or services changes after they’ve issued a tax invoice or filed a return. • • If the price goes down, the seller issues a credit note. • • If the price goes up, the seller issues a debit note. It does not matter whether the buyer has already paid for the goods or services. A seller can combine a credit or debit note with a tax invoice. But the invoice must be for different goods or services than the credit or debit note. The seller must include the credit or debit note in the GST return that covers the period the credit or debit note was issued. Examples A seller issues a credit note when a buyer: • • cancels an order • • returns faulty goods and the seller agrees to give them a credit. A seller issues a debit note when: • • a seller undercharges by mistake • • a buyer adds more items to their order. What they must show A credit or debit note must show: • • the words ‘credit note’ or ‘debit note’ in • • a prominent place • • the name (or trade name) and GST \*number of the seller • • the name and address of the buyer • • the date it was issued • • a brief explanation of why it was issued • • the words ‘copy only’ if it’s a duplicate credit or debit note • • the information in list A or list B. List A • • price of goods or services shown on the original tax invoice (including GST) • • correct price of goods or services (including GST) • • difference between the two prices • • GST on the difference. List B • • where the original price included GST, show the differences between the original and the correct prices • • statement that the difference includes GST. 19 CREDIT NOTE Hello Electronics Limited GST Number: 555-555-555 P.O.

You still have to file the overdue return, even if you pay the default assessment. When we get your completed return, we'll calculate the actual amount you need to pay, plus any penalties and interest. If you make a combined payment for GST and provisional tax but do not file your return, we'll use it to pay any GST default assessment and late filing penalty first.

Instead, you must use our disputes process, which means completing a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770 and sending it to us no later than four months after the due date of the GST return it relates to. For more information on disputing an assessment, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. Making the correction in a later taxable period Option 1 The error or errors can be corrected in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, when: • • you provided the return which contains one or more errors in the assessment of their liability for GST, and • • the total discrepancy in the assessment that is caused by the error is $1,000 or less. 21 Option 2 You can correct an error in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, provided the purpose is not to delay the payment of tax, when the total discrepancy is equal to or less than the lower of: • • $10,000, and • • 2% of the GST collected. Option 3 You can include an unclaimed GST input tax deduction in a later return if it is within 2 years of when the claim was left out, or the error relates to: • • an inability of the registered person to get a tax invoice • • a dispute over the proper payment amount for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates • • a mistaken understanding on the part of the registered person that the supply to which the deduction relates was not a taxable supply • • a clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person. Record keeping You must record these details in your GST paperwork and make the information available to us if we ask for it: • • what GST return period the error occurred in • • the GST amount involved • • the type of error • • which GST return period you made the correction in. Interest If the reassessed GST is an amount to pay and it's over $100 we'll charge you use-of-money interest.

Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration When you cancel you'll no longer: • • have to charge GST on prices to customers • • be able to issue receipts and invoices showing your GST number • • have to file a GST return • • be able to claim GST back from us. But, before you get the deregistration process under way, check the flowchart below. You may only have to suspend your GST activities. Should I deregister from GST? 23 What you need to do If you decide to deregister, you must let us know within 21 days of the date you close down or sell your business. You can cancel your registration through myIR when you file your final GST return (up to your date of cancellation, which may not be the end of your normal taxable period) or send us a completed Business Cessation - IR315 form. Remember to account for GST on any business assets you keep. Make a note of these assets and their values on the IR315. For more information about your obligations go to ird.govt.nz/gst What we'll do We'll send you notice of your actual cancellation date, which will normally be the last day of a taxable period. This may not be the end of your normal taxable period. Example Martin's next GST return is for the period 1 June to 31 July 2021. On 5 June 2021 Martin tells us he's sold his business. We tell Martin his cancellation date is 30 June 2021. Martin completes a final return for the period 1 June to 30 June 2021 which is due on 28 July 2021. If you're liable to pay provisional tax the due dates will change if you were registered on a six-monthly basis or you use the GST ratio method to calculate your provisional tax. For more information see our Provisional tax guide - IR289 guide. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE24 Adjustments for capital or asset items You are required to apportion your input tax deductions in line with the actual use of your goods and services. The rules operate as follows: • • The amount of input tax deduction you can claim must correspond with the portion of the asset's use that is intended for taxable purposes. • • In subsequent years, you may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the actual use for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. • • There is a maximum number of adjustment periods required based on the value of your goods or services, excluding GST. These are as follows: - $5,001 to $10,000 - two adjustments - $10,001 to $500,000 - five adjustments - $500,001 or more - ten adjustments. You may also select the maximum number of adjustments based on the estimated useful life of the asset. • • There is no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land. • • Special "wash-up" rules apply when goods and services that have been subject to the apportionment rules are sold or the person deregisters. • • Special rules apply to the concurrent use of land for taxable and non-taxable purposes. Adjustments on purchases and expenses You can claim a deduction of the purchase of goods and services to the extent to which those goods and services are used for making taxable supplies. You must estimate on acquisition how you intend to use the goods or services and choose a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result, which will be expressed as a percentage of the total use. The estimate could be made on the basis of any available records, previous experience, business plans or other suitable methods. The method of working out the extent of intended taxable use will largely depend on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, if the asset is a car which is intended to replace an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of stipulating the intended use of the purchased car provided patterns of use are largely unchanged. Example John buys a car for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000) to replace his existing car. The car will be used both in John's business as a sole trader and for private purposes. Part 4 - Adjustments The logbook kept by John for his old car shows that in the previous year he used the car 70% of the time for business purposes. Since John does not expect this ratio to substantially change in the future, he estimates that he will use the new car 70% for taxable purposes. Consequently, on acquisition John claims 70% of the available input tax: $3,000 × 70% = $2,100 These rules aim to achieve as much "first instance" accuracy as possible by requiring taxpayers to make fair and reasonable estimates on the intended taxable and non-taxable uses of acquired goods and services. In an "adjustment period" following the initial input tax deduction claim, you may, however, be required to make further adjustments if the actual taxable use of an asset is different from its intended taxable use. Exclusions (where no adjustments are required) de minimis provision You will not be required to apportion input tax if you make both taxable and exempt supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe the total value of your exempt supplies in the first adjustment period will be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies. This is known as the de minimis provision which relieves you from the obligation to apportion input tax in certain circumstances. Example A corner dairy spends $6,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations. The major part of the dairy's business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors' account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made, the dairy is not required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations. Value of supply No subsequent change-in-use adjustment will be required for goods and services acquired for the GST-exclusive value of $5,000 or less. Example Sherry, a graphic designer, buys a computer for $3,999 (including GST of $522) to use both for business and private purposes. She estimates she will use the computer 80% for taxable purposes and claims a deduction of $418 (80% of $522). Since the GST-exclusive value of the computer is less than $5,000, Sherry will not be required to make any adjustments for change in use in any of the subsequent adjustment periods. 25 Less than 10% If the percentage of actual use of goods or services differs from the percentage of intended use or previous actual use, you will be required to make an adjustment in an adjustment period only if the difference between the amounts is 10 percentage points or more, or the value of the adjustment is more than $1,000. Example Tim buys a new car for $25,000. Tim calculates the GST content (the amount of input tax) as $3,260.87. He calculates this as follows: $25,000 × 3 ÷ 23 = $3,260.87 Tim predicts he will use the car 60% for taxable purposes and claimed 60% of the input tax. He calculates this as follows: $3,260.87 × 60% = $1,956.52 First adjustment - after one year After a year, Tim reviews his business records and notes that he actually used the car in his business 64% of the time. When the percentage of actual use is compared with the estimated use it shows a 4% difference (64% − 60% = 4%). $3,260.87 × 4% = $130.43 As the 10% threshold has not been exceeded and the monetary value is less than $1,000, Tim is not permitted to make an adjustment in this taxable period. If Tim had purchased a more expensive car such as a Mercedes valued at $200,000 the calculation would be: $200,000 × 3 ÷ 23 = $26,086.96 (GST content) $26,086.96 × 60% = $15,652.18 (percentage of business use) $26,086.96 × 4% = $1,043.48 (percentage difference) The 10% threshold has not been exceeded. However, the monetary value is more than $1,000 so Tim is required to make an adjustment in this taxable period of $1,043.48. Adjustment period An "adjustment period" is normally 12 months, ending on your balance date. The most common balance date is 1 April to 31 March. The first adjustment period is a period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on either: • • the first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition or • • the first balance date that falls after at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. All subsequent adjustment periods will be done annually, ie, 12 months ending on your balance date. Example Mary buys a car on 1 February 2017. Her balance date is 31 March. Mary can choose when her first adjustment period ends. The options are: • • from 1 February 2017 to 31 March 2017, or • • from 1 February 2017 to 31 March 2018. If Mary has chosen the first option as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. If Mary has chosen the second option as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. As mentioned earlier there are a maximum number of adjustment periods depending on the value of goods or services. However, there is no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land. You must compare the percentage actual use of goods or services with: • • the percentage intended use of the goods or services (if no previous adjustment has been made), or • • the previous actual use (if the goods or services have been subject to a previous adjustment). Example Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/ previous actual use. Peter acquires a luxury boat for $500,000 plus GST. When he bought it, Peter estimated the boat would be used 100% for chartering - a taxable purpose - and claimed the full input tax deduction. However, in later periods Peter uses the boat partly for private purposes. Based on the value of the boat, Peter determines there will be five adjustment periods. In those adjustment periods, Peter uses the boat as follows: • • in the first adjustment period - 100% for taxable purposes • • in the second adjustment period - 80% for taxable purposes • • in the third adjustment period - 83% for taxable purposes • • in the fourth adjustment period - 50% for taxable purposes, and • • in the fifth adjustment period - 90% for taxable purposes. The first adjustment period is a period of six months. All subsequent adjustment periods are periods of 12 months. None of the exclusions apply to this situation. The question is: what are the use percentages Peter has to compare at the end of each adjustment period? First adjustment period Percentage intended use - 100% Percentage actual use - 100% GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE26 Second adjustment period Previous actual use - 100% In this adjustment period it was used 80% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 18) + (80% × 12 ÷ 18) = 33.3 + 53.33 = 86.6% Percentage actual use - 86.6% In the above calculations, figures "6" and "12" represent, respectively, the length of the first and second adjustment periods expressed in months. The figure "18" represents the total number of months since the acquisition of the boat. Third adjustment period Previous actual use - 86.6% In this adjustment period it was used 83% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 30) + (80% × 12 ÷ 30) + (83% × 12 ÷ 30) = 20% + 32% + 33.2% = 85.2% Percentage actual use - 85.2% Fourth adjustment period Previous actual use - 85.2% In this adjustment period it was used 50% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 42) + (80% × 12 ÷ 42) + (83% × 12 ÷ 42) + (50% × 12 ÷ 42) = 14.3% + 22.9% + 23.7% + 14.3% = 75.2% Percentage actual use - 75.2% Fifth adjustment period Previous actual use - 75.2% In this adjustment period it was used 90% since acquisition. (100% × 6 ÷ 54) + (80% × 12 ÷ 54) + (83% × 12 ÷ 54) + (50% × 12 ÷ 54) + (90% × 12 ÷ 54) = 11.1% + 17.8% + 18.4% + 11.1% + 20% = 78.4% Percentage actual use - 78.4% Peter will be required to account for adjustments to us in the second, third, fourth and fifth adjustment periods because in each of those periods either the percentage difference is more than 10 percentage points or the monetary value of the adjustments is more than $1,000. The following example pulls everything together and shows typical adjustments over four adjustment periods with the asset being sold in the final adjustment period. This example details the adjustments that are required on disposal of goods and services. Example John, a sole trader bought a vehicle for $20,000 plus $3,000 GST. On acquisition, John claimed 70% of the input tax - $2,100. Since the GST-exclusive value of the car falls between $10,001 and $500,000, he has to monitor the use of the car for five adjustment periods. In the first adjustment period (12 months), John's logbook entries show he used the car 55% for business (taxable use). In the second adjustment period (12 months), John used the car 65% for business. In the third adjustment period (12 months), John withdrew the car from use in the business and used it solely for private purposes. In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car for $10,000 inclusive of GST. First adjustment period At the end of the first adjustment period, John has to determine whether he may rely on the exclusions (minimal exempt supplies) or (the value of the supply) to avoid any change-in-use adjustments. John determines that the exclusion does not apply. John has to determine whether the use of the car in the first adjustment period corresponds to the intended taxable use of the car as estimated when he bought it. To do this he must compare the percentage actual use of the car with the percentage intended use of the car. The car logbook John kept showed the taxable use of the car accounted for 55% of its total use. On acquisition, John predicted he would use the car 70% for taxable purposes. Since the difference between the intended taxable use and the actual taxable use is more than 10%, John may not rely on the exclusion and has to make an adjustment for change in use. John calculates the amount of the deduction he has to return to us as output tax: $3,000 × 15% = $450. Second adjustment period For the second adjustment period, the percentage actual use must be calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. John used the car for taxable purposes 55% in the first adjustment period of 12 months and 65% in the second adjustment period of 12 months. Overall, over two years, John used the car 60% for taxable purposes calculated as follows: (55% × 12 ÷ 24) + (65% × 12 ÷ 24) = 60% John needs to compare the percentage actual use with "previous actual use" where an adjustment has been made. For John, the previous actual use will be 55%, as this was the actual use of the car at the end of the first adjustment period. Since the difference between the percentage actual use (60%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is less than 10 percentage points, John will not be required to account for the amount of the adjustment if the value of the adjustment is less than $1,000. John calculates the value of the adjustment is less than $1,000 as follows: $3,000 × 5% = $150 (no adjustment is required). 27 Third adjustment period John calculates the percentage actual use of the car after three adjustment periods as follows: On acquisition John estimated the use of the car as 70%. In the first adjustment period the car was used 55% for taxable purposes. The adjustment period was 12 months. The total number of months since acquisition was 36. (55% × 12 ÷ 36) = 18.3% In the second adjustment period the car was used 65% for taxable purposes. (65% × 12 ÷ 36) = 21.7% In the third adjustment period the car was used privately with zero business use (0% × 12 ÷ 36) = 0% The percentage actual use since acquisition is 40%. 18.3% + 21.7% + 0% = 40% This percentage has to be compared with the previous actual use. Since John did not make an adjustment in the previous (second) adjustment period, the "previous actual use" will be the percentage actual use in a period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. John made an adjustment in the first adjustment period when his percentage actual use was 55%. This percentage will become John's previous actual use for the purposes of the adjustment in the third adjustment period. Since the difference between the percentage actual use (40%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is more than 10 percentage points, John has to account to us for the over-claimed amount of the deduction. The amount of the output tax to be accounted for is: $3,000 × 15% = $450. Wash-up rule When there's a change of use to either total taxable or total non-taxable use, there needs to be a wash-up adjustment made. This should occur when the use changes and remains unchanged for a further full adjustment period and even if the change is within the 10% or $1,000 threshold. This will eliminate the need for continual adjustments. The wash-up adjustment uses the following calculation: Full input tax deduction − Actual deduction Full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply, after taking into account any nominal GST component charged (on zero-rated land transactions). Actual Deduction is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments already made. Adjustment on disposal When you dispose of goods or services in the course of a taxable activity and you have not claimed a full input tax deduction you may claim an additional deduction. You'll need to know the: • • "Tax fraction". For the purposes of the 15% GST rate, the tax fraction is 3 ÷ 23. • • "Consideration" is the amount received, or treated as received, for the supply. • • "Actual deduction" is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the date of disposal. The amount of deduction available on disposal of goods or services will be calculated under the formula: tax fraction × consideration × (1 − actual deduction/full input tax deduction) Example John, the sole trader in previous examples, has now sold his c ar. Fourth adjustment period In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car in the course of his taxable activity for $10,000. Because John has not claimed the full deduction for the car, he may claim an additional amount of the adjustment on its disposal calculated as follows: 3 ÷ 23 × $10,000 × (1 − $1,200 ÷ $3,000) = $783 The calculation is broken down as follows: 1. John calculates the GST on the amount received for the car ($10,000 × 3 ÷ 23 = $1,304.34). 2. John then calculates the actual amount claimed ($2,100 less $450 less $450 = $1,200). 3. The original GST on acquisition was $3,000. John has already claimed 40% of the original GST. 4. John then divides the amount claimed by the full amount of input tax that could be claimed ($1,200 ÷ $3,000 = 40%). 5. The amount of $10,000 (100% of the sale) will need to be returned as income. John can claim a "wash-up" of the percentage difference, ie, 60% calculated on the GST received on the sale price of the car (60% × $1,304.34 = $783). 6. John may claim a deduction of $783 for the taxable disposal of the car. The amount calculated under the formula, when added to any deduction already claimed, must not be more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply (or the nominal GST component, if the supply was zero-rated). GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE28 Example: Appreciating asset Sandy, a property developer, built two similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The total input tax on the construction costs that relate to house A is $30,000. Sandy claimed 64.8% of the total input tax - $19,440. At the beginning of the third adjustment period, Sandy sold the house to Nigel for $320,000 inclusive of GST. Since Sandy has not claimed the full input tax for the construction cost incurred for the property, she may make a final adjustment of the input tax: 3 ÷ 23 × $320,000 × (1 − $19,440 ÷ $30,000) = $14,692 The resulting amount of $14,692, when added to the deduction already claimed ($19,440), is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($30,000). So the amount of the adjustment that may be claimed by Sandy will be limited to $10,560. Example: Depreciating asset Charles bought a car for $46,000 (inclusive of GST of $6,000) and claimed 70% of the input tax ($4,200). Having used the car for the intended purpose for three years, Charles sells it for $30,000 inclusive of GST. Since Charles has not claimed the full input tax for the car and the car was sold in the course of the taxable activity, he may make a final adjustment of the input tax: 3 ÷ 23 × $30,000 × (1 − $4,200 ÷ $6,000) = $1,174 The amount of the adjustment to be claimed for the taxable disposal of the vehicle is $1,174. Special rule for concurrent use of land The portion of a deduction you should be entitled to claim must correspond with the extent to which you use the asset for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one particular time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking your children to school - but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same time, eg, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. For the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). The following formula will help you in apportioning between concurrent uses of land: consideration for taxable supply × 100% = (percentage of taxable use) total consideration for supply The "consideration for taxable supply" is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The "total consideration for supply" is the sum of the amount of the "consideration for taxable supply" described above, and: • • the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired, and • • if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non- taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged. You may apply for an alternative approach if this formula does not fit your circumstances. The market value must be used in determining consideration for taxable supply and/or total consideration for supply if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm's-length amounts. If the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value. Example Sandy, a property developer, built two similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction. Sandy is unable to sell the properties immediately on completion. So, while still advertising the houses for sale, she: • • rents out house A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period, and • • moves into house B and lives there rent free. At the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells house B for $360,000. House A - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and exempt purposes (supplying a residential dwelling), she needs to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of house A, but ascertains the market value of the house is approximately the same as for house B ($360,000). 29 The total consideration for supply is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired ($386,000). Sandy's taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 As Sandy had originally claimed 100% on acquisition she has therefore claimed 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 House B - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Because Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and private purposes (residential) , she has to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is the amount derived on a disposal of the house ($360,000). Because Sandy did not rent out house B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the total consideration for supply. is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates she would have received $26,000 of rental income. Her taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 Sandy has deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this amount to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 In both cases, Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity. An additional formula estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is: months × result\* total months • • "Months" is defined as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies. • • "Total months" is defined as the total number of months since acquisition. • • "Result" from calculation to establish the percentage of taxable use. Example The facts are the same as in the previous example and the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months. In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out house A and advertising it for sale. However, six months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising house A for sale because she decides to permanently rent it out. In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of house A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000. At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy identifies the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the total consideration for supply is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired (360,000 + 26,000 + 30,000 = $416,000). $360,000 × 100% = 86.5% $416,000 However, because the house has been used for six months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to calculate the percentage actual use: 18 × 86.5% = 64.8% 24 Sandy's percentage actual use of house A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the "previous actual use", ie, with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. So Sandy has deducted 28.2% (93% − 64.8% = 28.2%) more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 28.2% = $8,460 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE30 Adjustment for mixed-use assets You can claim a deduction when mixed-use assets are acquired, and when you acquire goods or services that relate to both income-earning and private use of a mixed-use asset (mixed- use expenses), to the extent that they will be used for making taxable supplies. The estimate of how you intend to use the goods or services should take into account the formula for the adjustment for mixed-use expenses below. Then, for the first adjustment period and subsequent adjustment periods, an adjustment is required for mixed-use expenses if the actual use of the mixed-use asset is different from the intended use. A new formula is used to calculate the adjustment for mixed- use expenses. It is similar to the calculation used to determine your deduction for income tax, based on income-earning days and private use days of the asset. The formula to calculate the adjustment is: total amount of input tax × income-earning days income-earning days + private days Formula definitions • • "Input tax" is the total input tax for the mixed-use expenses, including the cost of the asset (excludes input tax relating solely to non-taxable and taxable use) • • "Income-earning days" is the total number of days when rent or a fee is paid for the use of the asset, regardless of the amount paid. Includes consideration received from family, non-associated persons, and when the asset is being repaired or relocated • • "Private days" is the total number of days the asset is used with no amount of rent or fee paid. Using alternatives to "days" You can use other measures in the formula if they reflect the time use of the asset more accurately. For example: • • flying hours for an aircraft • • nights for a holiday home. Example Regan purchases a charter boat on 1 April 2017 for $450,000 (GST inclusive) which is used both to earn income and for private use. He accounts for GST input tax for the year as follows: Fully deductible expenses Annual Maritime NZ survey fees $700 Charter advertising $400 Food/drinks (charter guests only) $500 Regan claims the full input tax and no adjustment is made as the expenses relate solely to income-earning. Not deductible $250 for family fishing licenses is a private expense, so no GST input tax is claimed. Apportioned (mixed-use) expenses There are apportioned (mixed-use) expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use, so Regan needs to work out how much GST he can claim. Mooring fees $2,000 Fuel $1,200 Insurance $2,450 General repairs $300 Total expenses $5,950 When Regan acquired the boat he estimated that the taxable use would be 50%. He claimed input tax on the mixed-use expenses of $29,735.86 (credit) as follows: ExpenseCostGST value50% input tax claimed Purchase of boat$450,000$58,695.65$29,347.82 Mooring fees, insurance, fuel $5,950$776.09$388.04 Total input tax $29,735.86 Income-earnings days Days fully chartered to the public 102 Days chartered at 50% market rate 20 to Regan's local fishing club Total 122 Private days Days the family used the charter boat 30 without making any payment income-earning + private days = 152 Total input tax (boat $58,695.65 + mixed-expenses $776.09) = $59,471.74 The calculation is: $59,471.74× 122 =$47,733.90 input tax 152 Regan claimed input tax of $29,735.86 during the year. He is entitled to claim a further amount $17,998.04 (credit) as an adjustment for input tax in Box 13 of his final GST return of the year. The calculation is: $47,733.90− $29,735.86=$17,998.04 If the amount of input tax calculated for the actual use of the asset was less than the input tax claimed during the year, the difference would be a debit adjustment added in Box 9 of the GST return for further GST to pay. 31 Other adjustments Barters You can also exchange goods and services for other goods or services, or a combination of goods, services and money - this is b ar ter. If the exchange is for other goods and services, you must account for 3 / 23 of the open (current) market value of whatever you received in return for your supply. When part of the exchange is money, you must include: • • 3 / 23 of the open (current) market value of the goods and services you received, as an adjustment in Box 9 of your GST return, and • • the money received in Box 5 of your GST return. Use this rule whichever accounting basis you're on. You might also receive goods and services in full (or part- exchange) for your supplies from another person. Between you, work out a dollar value for the exchange, eg, a trade-in. You must include this agreed value, plus any money involved, in Box 5 of your GST return. Bad debts recovered If you've had a GST deduction for a bad debt written off and you later recover all or part of the debt, you must make an adjustment for the amount recovered. Include 3 / 23 of the amount recovered in Box 9 of your GST return. Example Manu, who uses the invoice basis, wrote off a bad debt of $2,500 and later recovered $1,600. He must make an adjustment of $208.70 ($1,600 × 3 ÷ 23) at the time of recovery, even if he's changed his accounting basis since then. Insurance payments received If you receive an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, include the GST content as an adjustment in the GST return that covers the time you received the payment. For example, an insurance company issues a cheque to cover equipment damaged in a fire. GST shown on New Zealand Customs invoices The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects GST when: • • goods are imported into New Zealand. Customs charges GST on the landed value (including insurance , freight and duties) for the goods. • • excisable goods (ie, alcohol, fuel and tobacco) manufactured in New Zealand are removed from a licensed manufacturing area for home consumption. Customs collects any applicable levies and any GST on those levies. Documents issued by Customs (such as a Customs import entry form C4, a Deferred payment of duty statement or Broker account statement) do not have to meet all the tax invoice requirements. These documents can be used to support a claim for a GST credit. Remember, you must hold these supporting documents to make a claim. Do not include imported goods under Box 11 on your GST return. When to account for GST paid to Customs The table below explains when to account for GST paid to Customs, depending on your accounting basis. For more information about GST on imported goods go to the New Zealand Customs Service www.customs.govt.nz (search keyword: importers) or call 0800 428 786. If you use the...you... invoice basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document in Box 13 of the GST return for the period you receive the invoice or make a payment, whichever is earlier. payments or hybrid basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document in Box 13 of the GST return for the period you make the GST payment. Home office expense It's common for businesses to use an area in the family home for work. If you do this you could claim GST on part of the running costs of your home. You do not have to have an area specifically set aside for business. You must keep full records of all expenses you want to claim. If there is not a separate area for the business the apportionment will need to take into account criteria such as the amount of time spent on income-earning activities and the area used at home. No deduction is permitted for any private or domestic expenditure. Calculate your GST adjustment by working out the percentage of the area you use for work against the total area of your home. You can claim the adjustment either annually or on a period-by- period basis. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE32 StepWhat to do 1Take the total taxable value of all fringe benefits from your FBT return. (This is the amount of the benefits, not the FBT itself.) 2Subtract the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common ones are: • • low-interest loans • • other financial services • • international travel • • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. The result is the fringe benefits liable for GST. 3Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 then divide by 23. This is the GST adjustment to include in your FBT return. Include this adjustment in: • • Box 7 of the quarterly FBT return (IR420) for quarterly filers • • Box 6 of the annual FBT return (IR422) for annual filers • • Box 6 of the income year FBT return (IR421) for income year filers. Example: Taxable benefits for FBT quarter ended 31 March 2021 Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Low-interest loans $ 425 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Subsidy on employee's honeymoon trip $ 600 Total $ 3,682 Benefits liable for GST are: Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Total $ 2,657 The low-interest loan and subsidy for the honeymoon are not included because loans are exempt supplies and international travel is a zero-rated supply. The amount of the GST adjustment is $346.57 ($2,657 × 3 ÷ 23). Enter this in Box 7 for the FBT return for the quarter ended 31 March 2021. Pay the adjustment when your FBT for the March quarter is due. If an employee makes a payment direct to the employer towards a fringe benefit, this is a separate supply and is liable for GST. Include this payment as income in Box 5 of the GST return. The time of supply is the same as for any other sale by the business. Example An employee has paid $100 cash direct to the employer. Add the $100 to the sales in Box 5 of the GST return. The GST to pay on the $100 is $13.04. FBT (fringe benefit tax) Companies and employers registered for FBT do not need to make a private use adjustment. But, they will need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Sole traders, partnerships and trusts registered for FBT may still have to make a private use adjustment if the owner, partners, trust members or associated persons use business assets privately. They also need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Make the adjustment in the FBT return period you provide the benefits in. 33 If you...you make the adjustment in the GST return that covers... do not have a tax agentthe date your income tax return is due or filed, whichever is the earlier date. Example If your 2020 income tax return is due on 7 July 2020 and you do not have a tax agent, you need to make your GST adjustment in the GST return which includes that date. have a tax agentthe earlier of: •• the date your income tax return is filed, or •• 31 March after the due date for your income tax return. have a tax agent who has an extension of time to file your income tax return the date your income tax return is actually filed. If an employee contributes to the expense, treat this as a separate supply for GST. Include the total expense amount in Box 11 on your GST return as usual and show the employee contribution in Box 5. Because the GST adjustment is based on the amount which is not deductible for income tax, organisations that are not liable for income tax, eg, non-profit organisations and charities, do not need to make this adjustment. Calculating the adjustment for entertainment expenses The table below explains how to calculate the adjustment for an entertainment expense using the example on the right. StepWhat to doExample 1To work out the GST, multiply the expense by 3 then divide by 23.$230 × 3 ÷ 23 = $30 2Subtract GST from the entertainment expense. $230 − $30 = $200 3Work out the amount that is not deductible for income tax (50%).$200 × 50% = $100 4Multiply the non-deductible amount by 15% (or 0.15). This is your GST adjustment. Show this GST adjustment on your GST adjustment calculation sheet - IR372 under "Entertainment expenses". Transfer the total amount to Box 9 of your GST return for the period ending 31 October 2018. $100 × 15% = $15.00 Before 1 April 2018 the GST component was calculated by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 23 (eg, $100 × 3 ÷ 23 = $13.04) at step 4. Example XYZ Ltd's only entertainment expense in the 2018 tax year was a business lunch for clients. The lunch cost $230 including GST. The income tax return for the year ending 31 March 2018 is filed on 7 July 2018, and the company files six-monthly GST returns for the periods April and October. XYZ makes the adjustment in the GST return for the six months ending 31 October 2018. The full $230 would have been included in Box 11 of an earlier GST return to claim the GST credit. Entertainment expenses Business entertainment expenses are related to taxable income, and are incurred in the course of running a business. Usually, only 50% of business entertainment expenses are deductible for income tax. Read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide for details. You'll need to make a GST adjustment of 15% of the GST-exclusive nondeductible amount once a year. You can not claim GST on private entertainment expenses, eg, a restaurant lunch with friends. During the year, keep showing your total business entertainment expenses on your GST return. The table below explains exactly when to make the adjustment depending on whether a tax agent prepares your income tax return. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE34 Telephone expenses Cellphones If you have a business cellphone, you can claim GST on the total set-up cost. If you use the same cellphone for private use, you can claim GST on these running costs: • • total fixed cost of running the phone • • business calls. How to claim for telephone line rental See the table below. If you...you... have a commercial and domestic line rentalcan claim the GST on the full cost of the commercial line. Include the commercial rental cost in Box 11 on your GST return. You can not claim any part of the domestic rental. have only one telephone line rental and use it for business and private purposes can claim GST on 50% of the cost. Show 50% of the rental in Box 11 on your GST return. The line can be commercial or domestic. want to claim more than 50% of your rentalmust show that the actual business use of your telephone is greater than 50%. The proportion of business toll calls to private toll calls may be one factor in working out the overall business use. You'll need to consider other factors, eg, your type of business and how many people live in the house. are a farmermay claim the full cost of telephone rental used for business and private purposes. Include the full rental in Box 11 on your GST return. make business-related callsmay claim the full amount of GST on these calls. 35 Bad debts written off If you supply goods or services and put them through the books, but later write off all or part of the consideration as a bad debt, you can make a credit adjustment in the period you write it off. How you do this depends on your accounting basis - see the table below. If you use the...you... invoice or hybrid basisaccount for a sale when you issue an invoice. If you've already included the GST on the sale in a previous return, and then later write off the debt, you'll use this adjustment. payments basiswill not account for the GST on a sale until you actually receive it. If you do not receive payment and write the debt off, you can not claim a deduction, because you have not included the GST on the sale in any GST return. You may make an adjustment for door-to-door sales and hire purchase agreements if you use the payments basis. Calculating a credit adjustment Show 3 / 23 of the full amount you've written off on the calculation sheet and include it in Box 13 of your GST return. You do not need to send in any documents supporting the write-off, but you do need to keep a record of the steps you took to recover the debt. For example: • • a debtor's ledger showing the date you issued the invoice • • letters from a solicitor/debt collector trying to recover the debt • • a bad debts ledger showing the write-off. You must write off the debt(s). You can not claim for provision for bad debts. Example Brent, who uses the invoice basis, issues Chris with an invoice dated 26 October 2016 for electrical goods worth $115 including GST. Brent accounts for the sale in the return for the period ending 31 October. In the following March, Brent gives up hope of receiving payment from Chris and writes off $115 as a bad debt. Brent shows $115 × 3 ÷ 23 on his IR372 under "Bad debts written off" and includes it in Box 13 of his GST return for the taxable period ending 30 April 2017. GST not charged on the full price If the bad debt was for goods or services where GST was not charged on the full price (eg, the fifth week of a hotel stay, or a hire purchase sale), the GST adjustment is not simply 3 / 23 of the bad debt. Use this formula to calculate the adjustment: bad debt written off ÷ total consideration × GST included in consideration = GST adjustment Example Sue stayed at the Holiday Hotel for six weeks. Her total bill was $6,005.57. Sue leaves, still owing $1,000. After some time, the hotel writes off the $1,000 as a bad debt. The amount of GST included in the total bill is $602.57. The hotel must make an adjustment in its return which covers the period of the write-off: $1,000 ÷ $6,005.57 × $602.57 = $100.33 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE36 Part 5 - Supplies Exempt supplies Some goods and services are exempt from GST so you do not include them in your GST return. These include: • • penalty interest • • renting a dwelling for use as a private home • • residential accommodation under a head lease. Penalty interest Interest charged on overdue accounts is treated as an exempt supply. Example If you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90-day account basis, and that account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return because it's exempt. You do not pay GST on fines and penalties you get for a statutory offence, eg, parking penalties or infringement fees issued by courts or local authorities. Renting a residential dwelling The rent for a residential dwelling is exempt from GST. A landlord can not claim GST on any expenses, such as maintenance, rates and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least five years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents that property out, a change of use adjustment may be required. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 5, No 8 (January 1994) for more information. Residential accommodation under a head lease In most cases, if a property is leased as residential accommodation under a head lease, it's an exempt supply. But this rule does not apply if: • • the buyer and seller agree the exemption does not apply • • the supplier has, before 16 May 2000, treated the supply under the lease as being a taxable supply. Zero-rated supplies Some supplies are zero-rated for GST and taxed at 0%. Restraint of trade Any payment you receive in return for not conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand is zero-rated. Internet sales A registered New Zealand-owned entity that sells goods or services through the internet to customers in New Zealand will charge GST at the usual rate. But, a New Zealand-owned entity that sells goods or services through the internet to overseas buyers will generally charge GST at 0%. We expect sellers to take reasonable steps to check where the customer lives and where the goods or services are going. Sale of a going concern A going concern is a business sold "lock, stock and barrel" or is part of a business that can operate independently. The business must be a going concern at the time of sale, right up to the time of the transfer to the buyer. A supply of goods or services must meet these criteria to be a going concern: • • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • • It must be the supply of all the necessary goods and services for the activity to continue. • • Both parties must agree in writing that there is a supply of a going concern. • • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the buyer. The sale is zero-rated for GST if it meets all these criteria. Example Pat, a dairy farmer, sells his dairy farm (including land, herd, all buildings and all machinery) to another GST-registered farmer. This qualifies as the sale of a going concern, if both parties agree. If Pat had sold the land and buildings but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not qualify as a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated, see Land transactions. But, if he'd sold parts of the farm that could have been operated separately as a going concern, the sale would be zero-rated. Land transactions A GST-registered person must zero rate a supply, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • • is made to another registered person, and • • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and • • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. 37 To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply will be taxed at 15%. Refer to ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst Not eligible for zero-rating Services performed in New Zealand for a third party Services performed under contract to a non-resident who lives outside New Zealand, which are delivered to a third party in New Zealand, and where it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract is entered into the services will not be received by the third party in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies, are not eligible for zero-rating. GST is charged at the standard rate of 15% if supplied to non- residents, but the supply is received in New Zealand. Example A Singaporean family wants their child to receive a year's education in New Zealand. The parents contract a New Zealand school to supply the tuition. The supply of the tuition is not zero-rated because the child will receive the tuition in New Zealand, and it was reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into that the child will not receive the tuition in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Example A non-resident tour operator buys accommodation from New Zealand hotels and puts them into travel packages for tours of New Zealand. The travel packages are then sold to non-resident tourists. The supply of accommodation contracted between New Zealand hotels and the non-resident tour operator is not zero-rated because it's reasonably foreseeable another person (the non-resident tourist) will receive the services in New Zealand, and will not receive the accommodation in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Special supplies There are special rules for accounting for supplies which are different from normal business sales or purchases. Accommodation The supply of residential accommodation in a dwelling is exempt from GST. However, GST may be included for accommodation in a commercial dwelling. Commercial dwellings include: • • hotels, motels, homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, inns, hostels or boarding houses • • some service apartments • • convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes or hospice • • camping grounds • • other commercial dwellings. Commercial dwelling does not include a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when it is supplied with the right to occupy. If your taxable activity is running a commercial dwelling, you can calculate the GST on the accommodation in two ways. Four-week rule Commercial dwellings For the first four weeks' stay, charge GST on the full value of accommodation in the dwellings. After four weeks, charge GST only on 60% of the value of the domestic goods or services, usually the right to occupy the premises, which may include any of the following: • • cleaning and maintenance • • electricity, gas, air-conditioning or heating • • telephone (not tolls), television, internet, radio or similar chattels. Example Lauren stays for six weeks at the Comedy Hotel. The GST- exclusive costs are: 42 nights at $104 per night $4,368 Food and laundry $1,035 Comedy Hotel TAX INVOICE Lauren Hardie GST No. 987-654-321 71 John Street Christchurch 08 April 20 XX 28 days (first four weeks) at $104 per night$2,912.00 GST (15% of $2,912.00)$436.80 $3,348.80 14 days (after four weeks) at $104 per night$1,456.00 60% of $1,456.00$873.60 GST at 15%$131.04$131.04 $1,587.04 Food and laundry$1,035.00 GST at 15% $155.25 $1,190.25 Total due$6,126.09 Main Street PO Box 36 363 Phone: (04) 333 6666 WELLINGTON WELLINGTON FAX: (04) 333 6663 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE38 This is what Comedy Hotel needs to show in its GST return: first 28 days $ 436.80 next 14 days $ 131.04 food and laundry $ 155.25 total GST charged $ 723.09 $723.09 × 23 ÷ 3 = $5,543.69 which should be shown in Box 5. If a joint charge covers all supplies for bed and breakfast, the fully taxable supplies (breakfast) must be identified separately from the domestic goods or services (bed). Residential establishment, eg, boarding hostels, resthomes If you and the guest agree the stay is for longer than four weeks, you must charge GST on 60% of the value of domestic goods or services from the beginning of their stay. Advance payments A supplier who receives advance or progress payments must account for the GST on the payments. These are inducements for a supply of goods, not financial services (which are exempt supplies). Example Tina is a fruit grower. She receives an advance payment from her marketing board and accounts for it like this: She includes the advance payment in total sales in Box 5 of her GST return in the same period she receives it. If, for some reason, Tina has to pay back all or part of the advance she received from the marketing board it will be treated as a loan. As a loan, the advance will be exempt from GST because it's a financial service. Tina should ask us to reassess the return that included the advance payment. The marketing board may claim a GST credit for the advance payment made, as long as they hold the necessary tax invoice. If the advance is later repaid, it must be included in the total sales (Box 5). Any interest is exempt, because it's a financial service. A GST-registered agent who is involved in the transaction must account for GST on any commission or fee they charge. Auctions and auctioneers Ownership of goods under auction never passes to the auctioneer. Auctioneers sell goods on behalf of others (principals). An auctioneer may not know whether the principals are registered for GST, or whether to charge GST on a particular lot. The sale of goods on behalf of a non-registered principal is not taxable. The sale of a registered person's private assets is generally not taxable. The auctioneer can charge and account for GST as though making the taxable supply, as long as both the principal and the auctioneer agree to this arrangement. If the principal is registered, the GST-inclusive sale price, less commission, is passed on to the principal who must account for GST. If the principal is not registered, the auctioneer will pass the GST-exclusive sale price, less commission, on to the principal. An auctioneer who is registered for GST must account for the GST on fees or commissions. Auctions may be held on either a GST-inclusive or a GST-exclusive basis. The auctioneer should state this clearly at the beginning of the auction, so the bidders know whether or not their bids include GST. Price changes (credit and debit notes) Sometimes, the price of goods or services will change after you've prepared an invoice or made a payment. Here's what you need to do. Reduction of the agreed price If you supply goods and services and reduce the price of the supply after issuing an invoice or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the reduction in the taxable period you made it. This is usually the taxable period when the credit note was issued. If you've already issued a tax invoice, you must always issue a credit note. The buyer must include the reduction shown on the credit note in the return for the period covering the time of reduction. This is usually the period when the credit note was received. Note that if you purchased second-hard goods and the terms are varied (for example a discount being subsequently offered) you will not receive a credit note but you must still include the reduction in the return for the period covering the time of the reduction. Example Angela sells cleaning goods to David for $1,000. David pays Angela $900 because some goods were damaged. Angela issues a credit note for $100. Both David and Angela use the invoice basis. Angela includes $1,000 in Box 5 (sales). She claims $100 in Box 11 (purchases) in the return covering the time when the reduction was made. If the invoice and credit note were issued in the same period, Angela could have shown the net amount of $900 in Box 5 instead. David claims $1,000 in Box 11 (purchases). He includes $100 in Box 5 (sales), in the return covering the time when he made the reduction. If the invoice and credit note were received in the same period, David could claim the next $900 in Box 11. 39 Increase of the agreed price If you supply goods or services and increase the price of the supply after issuing an invoice or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the increase in the taxable period which you made it in. This is usually the taxable period when you issued the debit note. If you've already issued a tax invoice, you must issue a debit note for any price increase. The buyer must include the increase in the return covering the time the increase was made. This is usually the taxable period when the debit note was received. Example Mary sells goods worth $1,100 to Keith for $1,000 by mistake. Mary issues a debit note to Keith for $100. Both Mary and Keith use the invoice basis. Mary includes $1,000 in Box 5 (sales). She includes the extra $100 in Box 5 in the return covering the period the increase was made. Keith includes $1,000 in Box 11 (purchases). He claims $100 in Box 11 in the return covering the time the increase was made. Delayed settlement transactions If you're a GST-registered vendor and you enter into a property transaction with a delayed settlement date, you must account for GST using the invoice basis when the price of the property exceeds $225,000 including GST. You do this for any accounting basis. So, if you're on a payments basis you account for the GST when an invoice is issued or when payment is received, whichever happens earlier settlement is required within a 12-month period. These exceptions apply if: • • the supply is made under a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property - under one year • • the supplier is a non-profit body and at the time of supply, the recipient is not a registered person and is either: - not intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity, or - intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity but only after the full amount for the supply is paid to the supplier. Dishonoured cheques If a cheque is dishonoured, it's as though the payment was not made and you do not account for it. But, if you've already filed your return and it includes a dishonoured cheque and you use the payments basis, please contact us about correcting it. If you use the invoice or hybrid basis, you can only make the correction when it's written off as a bad debt. Door-to-door sales The time of supply is the first day after the period in which the purchaser may cancel the sale. If you're a door-to-door salesperson, your buyers have either seven days or one month to cancel the sale depending on the cancellation period. You account for the supply in the taxable period covering the day after the final date for cancellation. Example Selena Wares, a door-to-door salesperson, sells an item on 31 May, the last day of the taxable period. The eighth day after the sale is 8 June. She includes the full price for the supply in the taxable period covering 8 June. If you purchase from a door-to-door salesperson, you can claim a credit in the taxable period that covers the first day after the cancellation period (provided you hold a tax invoice). This applies even if you get an invoice or make payment before that date. Full price not known at the time of supply Sometimes, a final price is not settled until after the goods or services are physically supplied. If you're supplying goods or services like this and you use the invoice or hybrid basis you include the GST in the earliest period of when you: • • issued an invoice for any part of this supply, or • • have a payment due, or • • received a payment. If you use the payments basis, you account for the supply when you receive payments. Example Andy sells produce to an exporter for a down payment plus an end-of-season catch-up, based on export prices. Andy accounts for the down payment immediately. He accounts for the catch-up payment when it's due, received, or when an invoice is received - whichever is earlier. However if you buy goods or services when you do not know the full price and you use the invoice basis, you claim a credit in the earliest taxable period you: • • receive a tax invoice, or • • make a payment, or • • have a payment due. For purchases under the payments or hybrid basis, claim a credit when you make a payment. Gaming machines Gaming machine operators must register for and pay gaming machine duty. They must also pay GST on the value of the gaming machine revenue. This is the difference between: • • the increase in metered turnover • • less the increase in metered total wins during a return period. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE40 The amount of any jackpots won during that return period is also deducted from total turnover, if the jackpot figure is not included in the metered total wins. When accounting for GST, gaming machine revenue is calculated from the records you're required to keep for the Department of Internal Affairs. Where your monthly machine analysis reports or cashless gaming machine analysis reports are prepared to coincide with the last day of your taxable periods, you can use them to calculate the gaming machine revenue. You also pay problem gambling levy (PGL) on gaming machine profits. You can claim back the GST on PGL. For more information read our Gaming machine duty guide - IR180 guide. Grants and subsidies Any grant or subsidy you receive from the Crown or a public authority, is considered to include GST if you're registered for GST. Include the full grant or subsidy in Box 5 of your return. Example Helen employs 10 staff. She gets a $200 wage subsidy each week for eight weeks. The GST content is $208.69. $200 × 8 (weeks) $ 1,600.00 $1,600 × 3 ÷ 23 $ 208.69 Helen includes $1,600 as sales in Box 5 of her return. There is an exception for grants intended for international overseas development. You have to return GST on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand. If you receive a government grant or subsidy, you do not normally need to issue a tax invoice. However, if you receive a grant or subsidy, eg, a research grant, from another registered person, they will probably ask you for a tax invoice. If you pay a grant or subsidy in exchange for taxable supplies, you may request a tax invoice and claim a GST credit. Hire purchase agreements You must account for all hire purchase sales in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement, for all accounting bases. If you buy goods on hire purchase, you may claim a deduction in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement, for all accounting bases. Example Kay buys a carpet on hire purchase from Supreme Floorings on 7 June. The cash price is $1,100, which includes GST. The agreement is for 36 monthly payments of $46, totalling $1,656. Supreme Floorings accounts for the sale on the cash price of the goods ($1,100) in the period covering 7 June. Kay also claims for her purchase on the cash price in the period covering 7 June. The difference of $556 is the finance charge, which is an exempt supply. Insurance If you get an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, you must include the GST content as an adjustment in Box 9 of the return which covers the time you received the payment. Example Damien's distilling equipment was damaged by fire on 20 January 2017. An insurance company issued a cheque on 18 March 2017 for $4,500 to cover the damage. Damien includes $586.95 ($4,500 × 3 ÷ 23) in Box 9 of the return for the taxable period covering 18 March. You do not need to account for any insurance or compensation payment received for loss of earnings, eg, accident compensation. The insurer will still charge GST on their premiums for this type of cover. You do not account for any payment received under a life insurance contract, because the insurer can not charge GST on the premiums. Some types of insurance premiums are liable for GST (eg, fire and general insurance). A registered insurer may claim deductions for payments to policy holders when they are made. A tax invoice is not needed. The insurer will need a tax invoice to deduct any other payments for claims on policies, eg, a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle. Insurers can not claim for payments made under life insurance policies. Lay-by sales The time of supply is the date the buyer gets legal possession of the goods. If the sale is cancelled and the seller keeps part of the money, the time of supply is the cancellation. Include the full cost of a lay-by sale in the taxable period in which the buyer takes ownership of the goods. This is the time of the final payment. Do not account for the lay-by payments as you receive each one, but wait until you receive the final payment, even if you use the payments basis. 41 Example Sue buys a DVD player on lay-by from The Vision Shop in January 2017. The full price is $560. Sue pays $160 as a deposit, and instalments of $200 in February and March. The DVD player is delivered in April 2017. The Vision Shop accounts for GST in the taxable period covering March, because that's when Sue became the owner. If a lay-by sale is cancelled and the retailer keeps some of the payments already made (or receives any later payments), they account for this amount in the taxable period which the sale was cancelled in. GST is calculated on the full amount kept, or received later, and it must be included in the return. Example Sue cancels the agreement with The Vision Shop in February 2017 and gets a $300 refund. She loses $60 for doing this, which The Vision Shop accounts for in the taxable period covering February. If you buy goods on lay-by, you may claim a deduction when you have fully paid for them, and you have a tax invoice. When you cancel a lay-by sale, you may claim 3 / 23 of any cancellation charge made by the supplier, in the same period you cancel the sale, as long as you have a tax invoice. Local authority rates Local authorities are the only GST-registered organisations which charge rates. They use the invoice or hybrid basis to account for rates charged in full. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: • • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment, or • • the due date for payment, or • • the date when payment is received. Using the payments basis, local authorities account for all rates payments when they're received, whether they are paid in one instalment or several. Registered people may claim GST for rates payments for premises used in a taxable activity. If you use the invoice basis and you pay your rates in one lump sum, you may claim a GST credit when you make the payment or receive an invoice, whichever comes first. If you pay rates in instalments, you may claim a credit when each instalment is due or paid, whichever comes first. For the payments and hybrid basis, you claim a credit for rates when you make payment, if you hold a tax invoice. Periodic payments and hire agreements Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Private dwellings as part of taxable activity If a registered person buys a taxable activity that includes a dwelling, it may be treated as a separate supply (exempt). If the dwelling is treated as a separate supply, to claim a GST credit, the purchaser must prove the principal use of the dwelling is part of the taxable activity. If it is not, the purchaser can not claim for it. Repossessions When a buyer does not keep up their payments in a hire purchase arrangement (debtor), the seller will usually repossess the goods and resell them. The original buyer (not the repossessor) is considered to supply the goods to the new purchaser if there is a forced sale. If the goods sold are used in a taxable activity, the repossessor must account for GST on goods sold after repossession, unless the repossessor has: • • a written statement from the debtor, or • • reliable information, eg, from the debtor's accountant or solicitor, that the goods would not be a taxable supply if the debtor sold them. The repossessor will need to file a GST return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt - IR373. Example Brett sells a $1,200 fridge on hire purchase to Maria for her restaurant. Brett accounts for GST of $156.52 ($1,200 × 3 ÷ 23) in the return covering the period in which the agreement was made. Maria does not keep up the payments. Brett repossesses the fridge and sells it again. He then files an IR373. The sale after repossession, and the GST to be accounted for on it, is considered to be made by Maria. Sale of interest in a taxable activity In an unincorporated body, eg, a partnership, joint venture or trust, the body is the registered person, not the individual members. So, if a member sells an interest in the body, it's a private transaction between two people and not a taxable supply and there's no GST to account for. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE42 Secondhand goods For GST, secondhand goods are goods previously used and paid for by someone else, as in the common definition. It does not include: • • new goods • • primary produce - unless previously used • • goods supplied under a lease or rental agreement • • livestock • • secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal of any degree of purity (except to the extent that a good is composed of gold, silver, or platinum manufactured for sale to the public). Land is secondhand goods. The same rules for GST and tax invoices apply to secondhand goods as for all other goods liable for GST. Secondhand goods if seller is not GST-registered If the seller is not registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there will be no tax invoice or GST charged. If the purchaser is GST-registered they can claim a credit for GST purposes. To do this the purchaser must record: • • the name and address of the supplier • • the date of the purchase • • a description of the goods • • the quantity of the goods • • the price paid. You'll also need to keep details of the transaction if you're going to make a claim for income tax purposes. It does not matter which accounting basis you use, you must make a payment before you can claim the credit for the purchase. Successive supplies and progress payments The "time of supply" is when a progress payment was made or when an invoice was issued, whichever came first. Goods or services must be either: • • supplied progressively or periodically, and paid for in the same way, or • • supplied directly in constructing, manufacturing or extending a building, or civil engineering work, with payments made periodically as the work progresses. If you get progress payments and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, account for the GST in the earliest taxable period a payment is due or received, or when you issue an invoice for that payment only. For the payments basis, account for GST when you receive payments. If you're making progress payments under the invoice basis, you may claim a GST credit in the earliest taxable period a payment is due, when you make a payment, or when you get a tax invoice for that instalment. You claim a credit in the taxable period you make a payment in if you're using the payments or hybrid basis. Supplies to associated persons Special rules apply if you make certain supplies to people closely associated with you, eg, relatives, closely connected associated companies or trusts. See page 2 for a definition of associated persons. Supply to registered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can claim a GST credit for the purchase, you account for GST on the amount received. Example Jones, Smith and Brown, a GST-registered partnership, sells a piano to Lee, a sister of one of the partners. Lee is registered for GST and can claim a GST credit on the purchase. The open (current) market value of the piano is $2,000, but the sale goes through for $1,500. The partnership accounts for GST of $195.65 ($1,500 × 3 ÷ 23). Supply to unregistered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can not claim a deduction, you must determine the open (current) market value of the supply and account for the market value, or the amount you charged, whichever is the larger amount. Enter this in your return. In the previous example, if Lee was not registered for GST, the partnership would account for GST of $260.87. This is the $2,000 market value multipled by 3 then divided by 23. Include transactions with associated persons in the return for the taxable period when the supply was made. If you get a payment or issue an invoice before the last date for filing that return, use either the payment date or invoice to work out which taxable period the supply falls in, depending on your accounting basis. 43 Example A partnership has a two-month taxable period. The return for the period ended 30 April is due on 28 May. The partnership supplies goods with an open (current) market value of $135 to a non-registered brother of one of the partners on 24 April, and receives payment of $100 on 16 June. The partnership will account for $17.61 GST (on the market value of $135) in the return for the taxable period ended 30 April, because this is the period when the supply was made. If the partnership had issued an invoice or received payment during May (before the April return was due to be filed), the $17.61 GST would be included in the return for the taxable period ended 30 June because the invoice or payment would fall in the June period. Time of supply between associated persons Claim a deduction in your return for the taxable period when the supply is made available, removed or performed. However, if you make a payment or receive an invoice before the last date for filing the return for that taxable period you should instead claim the deduction in the taxable period: • • in which you make any payment or an invoice is issued (whichever is the earlier), if you are an invoice basis taxpayer; or • • in which, and to the extent, you make payment, if you are a cash basis or hybrid basis taxpayer. Tenders A GST-registered person may call tenders for a future supply of goods or services. The advertisement should state whether the tenders need to include GST. Occasionally, the person making a tender will have to pay a deposit. There is not usually any GST on a deposit unless all or part of it is kept for some reason. Tokens, stamps and vouchers There are special rules for the sale of tokens, postage stamps and gift vouchers. The supplier should treat tokens, stamps and vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer buys them. GST can be accounted for when the customer actually exchanges the voucher for the monetary value of the goods or services bought, if both suppliers agree. Example A petrol station owner sells an oil company's $20 petrol voucher to a customer. The petrol station owner collects the $20 for the oil company and forwards it to them. The customer gives the voucher to a friend who buys petrol at another petrol station. Because there's an agreement between the petrol stations to return the GST on redemption of the voucher, the second petrol station tells the oil company they have sold petrol (goods) in exchange for a $20 petrol voucher. The oil company reimburses the second petrol station owner for the sale, who accounts for the GST on the $20 by including the total amount of the sale in Box 5 of their GST return. This option does not apply to postage stamps and vouchers sold to a non-resident for services performed in New Zealand. The supplier has to account for GST on these items when the customer buys them. Buying tokens, stamps and vouchers You can claim tokens, stamps and vouchers as an expense when you buy them, according to your accounting basis.

GST guide Working with GST IR375 April 2023 blank Important changes ‘Tax invoice’ requirements replaced by ‘taxable supply information’ From 1 April 2023, the requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as taxable supply information. Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. For more information about taxable supply information go to page 8 of this guide, or ird.govt.nz/gst ‘Debit note’ and ‘credit note’ requirements replaced by ‘supply correction information’ From 1 April 2023, debit and credit note requirements to correct previously issued tax invoices, have been replaced with requirements to provide and keep supply correction information. Supply correction information must be provided when the taxable supply information (for example, invoice) included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. For more information about supply correction information go to page 18 or ird.govt.nz/gst GST adjustments for business, private or exempt use From 1 April 2023, • • When you acquire goods or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. • • The number and the value of the adjustment periods have changed. Fewer adjustments are required for land, as well as goods and services $20,000 or less. • • You can elect to treat goods as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. 3 Contents Introduction 4 Non-resident GST rules 4 GST registration 4 Filing in myIR 4 Filing in accounting software 4 Part 1 - Explaining GST 5 What GST is charged on 5 Understanding your basic GST requirements 6 What GST is not charged on 7 Record keeping 8 Taxable supply information 8 Part 2 - How to complete and file GST returns 11 The GST return 11 Completing your return 11 Which paper form do I use? 11 GST 101A 12 GST 103 14 Supply correction information 18 Details supply correction information must include 18 Supply correction information for price changes 18 Reduction of the agreed price 18 Increase of the agreed price 18 Filing your GST return 19 If you do not file your return, or file it late 19 If you do not make your payment, or pay late 20 Correcting an error in your GST return 20 Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration 21 Should I deregister from GST? 21 Part 4 - Adjustments 23 Other adjustments 32 Part 5 - Supplies 37 Exempt supplies 37 Zero-rated supplies 37 Not eligible for zero-rating 38 Special supplies 38 Part 6 - Services you may need 44 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE4 Introduction This guide tells you how GST works and how businesses manage their GST obligations. Our GST Plus - IR546 guide has more information on some less frequent and/or complex GST issues. Non-resident GST rules The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. If you’re a non-resident business that does not carry out activity in New Zealand, but you receive goods or services here, you may be able to register for and claim GST. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/gst/gst-for-overseas-businesses GST registration You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. A business must have a taxable activity to register for GST. A 'taxable activity' is an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods or services to another person for consideration. If you have a taxable activity, you can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? You can register for GST in myIR. The GST registration confirmation we send you includes your: • • GST number (this may be the same as your IRD number) • • registration start date • • accounting basis (the way you claim and pay your GST) • • taxable period and filing frequency (how often you need to file returns). If you register voluntarily for GST, and later decide this was a mistake, you can cancel your registration. See Part 3 of this guide for more information about cancelling your GST registration. Filing in myIR You can file your GST returns in myIR. myIR provides instant confirmation you’ve filed and faster processing of your returns. Register for myIR myIR is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Filing in accounting software You can file GST returns using accounting software. Accounting software benefits include: • • your GST return is pre-populated, so you do not need to copy figures into your myIR or paper return • • instant confirmation your return is filed. Confirm with your software provider if this filing feature is available as part of their software package. 5 What GST is charged on GST is a tax, usually 15%, charged by GST registered businesses on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Some examples of taxable activities undertaken and where GST may be charged are businesses that supply: • • services such as graphic design, hairdressing, mechanical building, painting • • products such as clothing or cars, fish and chips • • experiences such as bungee jumping, skiing, kayaking, going to the movies • • professional services such as legal advice. Adding GST to your goods or services When adding GST to the price of goods and services, multiply the amount by 15% (or 0.15) to get the GST-inclusive price. If the price already includes GST, multiply it by 3 then divide by 23 to find out the GST amount. Subtract this to get the GST-exclusive amount. Example Adding GSTSubtracting GST Product$ 100 × 15% Product $ 115 x 3 ÷ 23 GST amount$ 15GST amount $ 15 Product Plus GST amount $ 100 $15 Product Less GST amount $ 115 $ 15 GST-inclusive total$ 115GST-exclusive amount $ 100 You can also calculate the GST component by dividing the GST- inclusive price by 7.66666666. You must use at least 8 decimal places to calculate the correct GST component as using fewer decimal places can result in an incorrect answer. Using the fraction method (multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 23) will always provide you with an accurate answer. Part 1 - Explaining GST What happens to GST collected from your customers and paid on your purchases? • • You collect GST through the sale of goods and services. • • You pay GST through purchases and business expenses. When you file your GST return, you work out the difference between the amount of GST you've collected and the amount of GST you've paid. • • If you've paid out more GST than you've collected, you'll receive a GST refund. • • If you've collected more GST than you've paid, you'll need to pay the difference to us by the due date. You can only charge GST on your sales and income or claim it back on purchases and expenses if you're registered. When you receive GST from your customers, you hold this money to pass on to us. GST is not income for the business and needs to be paid to us when you file your GST return. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE6 Understanding basic GST requirements Filing GST returns You're required to file regular GST returns. You can choose your GST return filing frequency (how often you file) – monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. Your taxable period for 2 or 6 monthly returns must align to your balance date. If you did not choose a taxable period when you registered, we'll put you on the 2-monthly option matching your balance date. You can apply to change your taxable period if this does not suit. Send a message in myIR telling us which taxable period and filing frequency you prefer. If we approve the change, we'll tell you when to start using your new taxable period - do not change until we confirm this with you. Your GST taxable period must align with your balance date. For example, if you file your GST returns 2-monthly and have a March balance date your taxable periods are April-May, June-July, August-September, October- November, December-January, February-March. Monthly • • You must file monthly returns if your sales are over $24 million in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you're entitled to frequent GST refunds. 2-monthly • • Anyone with sales under $24 million in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months aligned to your balance date. Filing returns every 2 months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements and in touch with your business's progress. 6-monthly • • Anyone with sales under $500,000 in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $500,000 applies to the group as a whole. If you use this option, you will only need to file 2 GST returns a year. This can be a big job for 6 months’ worth of trading in one go. This option is more suitable if your business does not have a large volume of transactions. When to file your returns We’ll send you a reminder in myIR, when your GST return is ready for you to file. The reminder includes the due date for filing and making any payment. The due date is usually the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period, except for return periods ending: • • 30 November – the due date is 15 January of the following year • • 31 March – the due date is 7 May of the same year. If the due date for your GST return falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be due the next working day. Remember, file and pay on time to avoid late filing penalties, late payment penalties and interest. What are my options for claiming and paying GST? There are 3 ways of accounting for GST; payments, invoice or hybrid. You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you do not choose an accounting basis when you register, we’ll put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis after you've registered, you can do this in myIR. 7 Accounting basisWho is eligibleWhat you need to do Payments basisIf your total sales are: • • $2 million or less in the last 12 months • • likely to be $2 million or less in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of a month. In your GST return for the period include: • • amounts you've been paid by customers • • amounts you've paid to suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basisAnyoneIn your GST return for the period include: • • amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet • • the full sale price if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them • • amounts you’ve been invoiced by suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Even if you have not paid them yet. Hybrid basisAnyone Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. In your GST return: • • use the invoice basis for your sales • • use the payments basis for your expenses. What GST is not charged on Some goods and services do not have GST added to them. These are: • • sales by an unregistered person • • sales of private property (for example, a car or home not used for business) • • exempt supplies. Exempt supplies GST is not charged on exempt supplies, and they're not included in your GST return. These include: • • financial services such as interest payments on loans or bank fees • • donated products and services which are sold by not-for- profit organisations • • rent paid on a private home • • penalty interest. You cannot claim expenses relating to exempt supplies. You do not show income from the exempt supply in your GST return. Zero-rated supplies Some goods and services are not exempt supplies, but GST is charged at 0%. For example: • • exported goods • • sales of going concerns (selling or buying a business that will continue to run as the same type of business) • • sale of land (where certain criteria are met). If you have zero-rated supplies you can claim GST on your expenses. Payments basis Under the payments basis, account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps manage cash flow because you only pay us GST after you've received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you've paid for. You are only entitled to claim GST for purchases and expenses for which you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you issued an invoice to your customers or received an invoice and hold taxable supply information from your supplier. Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE8 In myIR include all zero-rated supplies with your total sales and income and just the zero-rated supplies amount in the next field. These are Box 5 and Box 6 for paper returns Example Joe's taxable activity is growing and selling apples. He exports some to America. Joe can claim the full cost of fertilisers and sprays used in the business. GST is not charged on the apples Joe sells to America. He enters the income as part of his sales in his GST return and then separates the amounts between the zero-rated supplies and taxable supplies. Record keeping Records must be in English or Māori unless Inland Revenue has approved keeping your records in another language. For tax records kept in Māori numerals must be 1, 2, 3 etc. Key points • • Keep all the documents supporting and explaining your GST figures. • • Keep business records for 7 years. • • Complete records save you time. • • Provide your GST number to customers as part of your taxable supply information. Good record keeping helps you complete and file your GST returns. You must: • • keep records of all your sales and income including taxable supply information and supply correction information • • keep taxable supply information and supply correction information for your purchases and expenses, such as invoices, receipts, or other documents. Decide on a record keeping system to suit your needs. For example: • • a software programme you can enter all your financial information electronically and apply formulas to calculate your GST • • a cashbook to develop your own records for your income, expenses, and GST. Make sure you have all the relevant taxable supply information (invoices, receipts or other documents), supply correction information, and bank statements for your business. This will help you find items quickly. You could set up a system by: • • date order • • supplier • • taxable period • • accounting basis for example, if you use the payments basis, file your paperwork in the month you made the payment. At some stage we may audit your business. During an audit we look at your GST records and systems. How you document and maintain your GST records is very important. For example, keeping your zero-rated invoices separate from your other invoices is a good idea because they go in a separate box on your GST return. Taxable supply information The requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as ‘taxable supply information’. Taxable supply information refers to the minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice, credit note, or debit note. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. Taxable supply information includes invoices, but it can also include information held in other forms, such as supplier agreements, contracts, and bank statements. Sellers can provide taxable supply information to a customer using an automated direct exchange between the buyer's and seller's software, for example PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) eInvoicing. You need to keep taxable supply information to claim GST on your supply purchases and expenses relating to your taxable activity. You should provide taxable supply information such as an invoice, receipt or other documentation when you sell goods or services. If the sale is $200 or less (including GST), you do not need to provide taxable supply information to the buyer but both you and a registered buyer must keep your own records of the transaction for GST record keeping requirements. 9 Taxable supply information buyers and sellers must keep Taxable supply amounts $200 or less More than $200 and up to $1,000More than $1,000 Seller’s details• Name or trade name of the seller • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number Buyer’s details• Not required• Not required• Name, and 1 or more of the following: - address (physical or postal) - contact phone number - email address - trading name if different to the buyer’s name - New Zealand business number or website URL address.

Consideration can be a • payment • act • holding back from using a legal right - for example, forgiving debt instead of enforcing payment. An unconditional gift paid to a not-for-profit organisation is not consideration for a supply. • The supply amount. Taxable supply information must be provided to GST registered buyers within 28 days of a request (or by an alternative date agreed to by the parties) for supplies over $200. Amounts of money must be expressed in New Zealand currency. Taxable supply information should only be provided once. If the buyer loses theirs, you can provide a copy. You do not need to mark it as a copy. 11 The GST return To complete your return work out the difference between: • • the GST you've added to goods or services you sell, and • • the GST you can claim back from business expenses and purchases.

Read and sign the declaration. 17 Example: Page 2 GST103B GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE18 Supply correction information Supply correction information (such as debit and credit notes) must be provided when the taxable supply information included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return. It does not matter whether the buyer has already paid for the goods or services. Examples of when corrections may be required: • • the supply is cancelled, • • all or some of the goods are returned to the seller, • • some of the goods were not delivered to the buyer, • • there is an incorrect description of the goods or services, • • incorrect seller information included, • • incorrect buyer details included, • • the date is incorrect, • • GST is calculated at the wrong rate, or • • an incorrect GST amount is charged. You can include supply correction information for a previous supply in the same document as taxable supply information, for a new supply. The seller must include the supply correction information in the GST return for the period it was provided in. Details supply correction information must include Supply correction information must include all the following details: • • the seller’s name (or trade name) and GST number • • the date the correction was provided • • details identifying the taxable supply information • • the correction to the taxable supply information including, if relevant, a correction to the amount of tax charged for the supply. Sufficient information must be provided for both parties to identify the taxable supply information being corrected. An example might be an invoice number or other details. Both buyer and seller must keep supply correction information for their records. Supply correction information for price changes Sometimes the price of goods or services will change after an invoice has been provided or a payment made. Reduction of the agreed price If you supply goods and services and reduce the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the reduction in the return period it was made in. This is usually the return when the supply correction information was provided. If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information. If you’re the buyer, you must include the reduction shown on the supply correction information in the return period covering the time of reduction. This is usually the period the supply correction information was received. Increase of the agreed price If you supply goods or services and increase the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the increase in the return for the period it was made. This is usually the return for the period you provided the supply correction information. If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information for any increase in price. The buyer, must include the supply correction information in the return covering the time the increase was made. This is usually the return for the period the supply correction information was received. Examples Kevin's cleaning goods In July, Kevin sells cleaning goods to Maria for $1,000. Maria pays Kevin $900 as some goods were damaged. In his next GST return period, Kevin issues supply correction information for $100. Both Maria and Kevin use the invoice basis. Kevin includes $1,000 in his total sales in the return he sold the goods. Kevin then claims $100 in his purchases and expenses in his return covering when the reduction was made. Maria claims $1,000 in purchases in the return she received the goods and later includes $100 in the total sales in the return covering the time when the reduction for damage was made. If the taxable supply information and supply correction information were issued in the same return period, Kevin could have shown the net amount of $900 in his total sales instead. Maria could claim the net purchase of $900. This example of how adjustments are made also applies to an increase in price. 19 GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372 If you’re filing a paper return the IR372 helps you calculate your GST adjustments. It lists the items which you need to make an adjustment for. Use the sheet to record the adjustments you need to make, then: • • transfer the figures to your GST return • • attach the sheet to your copy of the GST return • • keep full details on how you calculated the items.

What are some common mistakes? • • poor record keeping • • calculation errors • • not filing nil returns • • incorrect adjustments • • incorrect claiming of personal adjustments • • not informing us if your business ceases. If you do not file your return, or file it late Key points • • Late returns may get a late filing penalty. • • You may have to pay a default assessment if you do not file your return. Late filing penalties If you do not file your return by the due date you may have to pay a late filing penalty. These are: • • $50 for each return filed on the payments basis • • $250 for each return filed on the invoice or hybrid basis. Late payment penalties and interest are charged on late filing penalties not paid by the due date. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE20 Default assessments If you do not send us a return, we estimate the amount of tax we think you should pay - a default assessment. In most cases, this amount will be higher than what you actually owe. You still have to file the overdue return, even if you pay the default assessment. When we get your completed return, we'll calculate the actual amount you need to pay, plus any penalties and interest. If you make a combined payment for GST and provisional tax but do not file your return, we'll use it to pay any GST default assessment and late filing penalty first. If you do not make your payment, or pay late Key points • • Late payments may be charged late payment penalties and interest. Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Correcting an error in your GST return If you realise you've made an error or errors in a GST return you've filed that results in an under or overstatement of your tax liability, you may be able to correct it in: • • a later taxable period and calculate the adjustment, or • • the same taxable period by amending your return in myIR. But, if you've chosen a particular tax position and then change your mind about it, you cannot correct it. Instead, you must use our disputes process. This means completing a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770. You must send this to us no later than 4 months after the due date of the GST return it relates to. For more information How the taxpayer-initiated disputes process works Making the correction in a later taxable period Option 1 The error or errors can be corrected in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, when: • • you provided the return which contains one or more errors in the assessment of their liability for GST, and • • the total discrepancy in the assessment caused by the error is $1,000 or less. Option 2 You can correct a mistake in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, provided the purpose is not to delay the payment of tax, and the total discrepancy is equal to or less than the lower of: • • $10,000, and • • 2% of the GST collected. Option 3 You can include an unclaimed GST input tax deduction in a later return if it is within 2 years of when the claim was left out, or the error relates to: • • an inability of the registered person to get an invoice • • a dispute over the proper payment amount for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates • • a mistaken understanding on the part of the registered person, the supply the deduction relates to was not a taxable supply • • a clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person. Record keeping You must keep these details in your GST records and make the information available to us if we ask for it: • • what GST return period the error occurred in • • the GST amount involved • • the type of error • • which GST return period you made the correction in. Interest If the reassessed GST is an amount to pay and it's over $100 we'll charge you use-of-money interest. If the amount of reassessed GST is a refund over $100, we'll pay you use-of-money interest. Penalties We may ask for more information to decide whether we'll charge a shortfall penalty. 21 If your taxable activity is stopping or slowing down, you can cancel your GST registration. If you stop your taxable activity, you must cancel your registration. Cancelling your GST registration will not close your business or organisation. You can cancel your GST registration if: • • you're closing down or selling your business • • you expect your turnover to drop below $60,000 - and stay there for a while • • you realise you are not required to be registered. If you’re going to continue your taxable activity you may still choose to cancel your registration. If you do decide to cancel, you can no longer: • • charge GST on your sales • • claim GST on your expenses. If you're considering cancelling your GST registration, you'll need to know the situations where you must cancel or have a choice in cancelling. Use our handy online tool to help you decide what’s best for your situation - Should I cancel my GST registration Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration NoNo Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s Have you stopped trading or closed your business? We recommend you stay registered for GST. Are you planning to restart your business or start a new business within the next 12 months? Your GST registration is not compulsory. Do you want to cancel your registration? You must cancel your GST registration within 21 days. You can cancel your registration in myIR or fill out and send us. If you stay GST registered, you must keep filing GST returns even if they are nil. You can cancel your registration in myIR or fill out and send us an IR315 form.

Or you can fill out a Business Cessation - IR315 form and send it to us. We'll contact you if we need more information. Otherwise, we'll send you confirmation your registration has been cancelled within 5 working days. Filing your final return You will need to file your final GST return up to your date of cancellation (this may not be the end of your normal taxable period). The date you need to do this by depends on your filing frequency. Your final return needs to cover your taxable activity between the first date of your taxable period up until your registration cancellation date. For example, if you file 2-monthly and you cancel your GST on 15 October, your final return needs to cover the period from 1 September to 15 October and needs to be filed by 28 November. You will need to account for GST on any business assets you keep. For more information about your obligations go to ird.govt.nz/gst You may need to complete the ‘debit adjustments’ or ‘credit adjustment’ sections if: • • you are keeping any assets the business owns • • the business owes money to a creditor • • any debtors owe you money. Use the open (current) market value of assets you are keeping. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. For assets bought on or after 1 October 1986, work out the GST on the asset using this formula: (open market value x 3) ÷ 23 The open market value is the value of the asset as if you sold it today. You need to return the GST of the value of the asset in your final GST return, regardless of the accounting basis you use. When you’re part of a GST group There are different criteria and processes to cancel a GST group registration. For more information go to Cancelling a GST group Businesses with separate branches or divisions If you are the parent body of a business with separately registered branches or divisions you can cancel any of those registrations at any time. You will need to take over the GST responsibilities of any of the branches or divisions which are no longer separately registered for GST. If a parent body cancels its own GST registration, all the separate registrations of its branches or divisions are automatically cancelled. Note If you're liable to pay provisional tax the due dates will change if you were registered on a six-monthly basis or you use the GST ratio method to calculate your provisional tax. For more information see our Provisional tax guide - IR289. 23 Key points • • Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies - you can elect to treat some goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles, as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. • • When you acquire a good or service you may need to apportion GST between your business (taxable activity), and your private or exempt use. You can claim a percentage portion of the GST for the taxable use only. • • You may need to make change in use adjustments for the goods or services more than $10,000 (exclusive of GST), if the percentage of business to private or exempt use changes. • • Change in use adjustments are not required if: – the GST exclusive cost is $10,000 or less – the change in taxable use is less than 10% and the value of the adjustment is $1,000 or less. • • Change in use adjustments are made annually and the number of adjustment periods depends on the value and if the goods are land. • • Special wash-up rules need to be applied if you later sell a good or service where you’ve previously apportioned the GST, or you cancel your GST registration (deregister). • • Special rules apply to the concurrent use of land for taxable and non-taxable purposes. More detailed information and examples are contained in this adjustment section. Many small businesses get help from their accountant/tax agent with apportioning and making GST adjustments. Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies You can choose to treat some goods as non-taxable supplies. This only applies to goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles when the principal purpose for acquiring and use of the good is not for making taxable supplies. If you choose to treat a good as a non-taxable supply, you do not have to add GST to any future sale of the good. To qualify, the following criteria must be met: • • you have not previously claimed a GST deduction for the goods • • the goods were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies • • the goods were not acquired as zero-rated supplies (see below for the exception). Once applied, you do not need to monitor the use of the good at the end of each GST adjustment period. Part 4 - Adjustments Example Rebecca has a small farming business. Her farmhouse is used to help run her GST business, but the principal purpose is for her private residence. When Rebecca bought the farmhouse, the seller was not registered for GST, so the purchase was not zero-rated. Rebecca chose not to claim any GST on the purchase, and any capital improvements she makes relating to the farmhouse. Rebecca can elect to treat a future sale of the farmhouse as a non-taxable supply for GST purposes. This means if the use does not change, Rebecca will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the farmhouse. The land used for farming would still be subject to GST. Rebecca can still claim part of her operating costs costs such as rates, insurance, and utilities, based on the percentage of the farmhouse used for making taxable supplies. Output adjustment for zero-rated supplies There might be situations where you acquire zero-rated goods, but the principal purpose of the goods is not for making taxable supplies. To treat the goods as non-taxable, you can make a debit adjustment for the GST you would have been charged, if the goods were not zero-rated (nominal GST amount). Example Gavin is GST-registered. He buys a holiday home for $1 million from another GST-registered person. The sale was zero-rated for GST purposes. The principal purpose for buying the house is for a family holiday home. However, Gavin also intends to rent out the property for short term accommodation. Gavin can choose to make the future disposal (sale) of this property a non-taxable supply, by returning output tax of $150,000 in his next GST return (the nominal GST amount that would have been charged, had the purchase not been zero-rated). If the property use does not change, Gavin will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the holiday home. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE24 Transitional rule for goods acquired before 1 April 2023 You may want to apply a transitional rule to goods acquired before 1 April 2023, if the principal purpose for acquiring the good was not for use in making taxable supplies. The transitional rule allows you to make a debit adjustment for the percentage of GST already claimed. This means any future disposal or sale of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply. If you choose to use the transitional rule, you need to: • • return any GST you have previously claimed by making a debit adjustment in your GST return • • notify Inland Revenue by sending a message in myIR, before 1 April 2025. When the transitional rule is applied, future disposal of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply. Once applied, future adjustments may only be required if the use of the goods changes to principally making taxable supplies. Example Mary is registered for GST. She bought a lifestyle block next to her beef farm in March 2022, for $1.15 million dollars from a non-GST registered seller. Mary’s principal purpose for buying the property was for long-term residential rental. The property included some land which Mary uses in her beef farming business. Only 25% of the total property value relates to her farming activity. Mary claimed GST of $37,500 in her March 2022 GST return. In September 2023, Mary decides to use the transitional rule for the lifestyle block and sends Inland Revenue notice of the change. Mary also makes a debit adjustment of $37,500 in her September 2023 GST return to pay back the percentage of GST she claimed in March 2022. If the property use does not change, Mary will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of this property. Apportioning GST for business, private or exempt use You acquire a good or service when you either purchase it or introduce it into your business (taxable activity). When you acquire a good or service used in your business, and used privately, or to make exempt supplies, you may need to apportion the GST amount you can claim. This is based on the percentage estimate it will be used in your business, and the value of the good or service. Examples of goods commonly used in a business and privately, include: • • your home when you have a home office • • vehicles • • cell phones • • laptops. Example of a taxable and exempt supply A retirement village providing independent style accommodation and rest home/hospital style units must apportion costs relating to the rest home/hospital activity (taxable) and the independent unit activity (exempt). GST can only be claimed on the taxable portion. Home office expense If you are using your home as part of your business, GST can be claimed on the portion of the running costs relating to your taxable activity. You must keep full records of all expenses, and how you’ve apportioned your business and private use. Your apportionment must take into account: • • time spent on income-earning activities • • the percentage area used in your taxable activity (either exclusively or mixed business and private use). You cannot claim GST on any private or domestic expenses. Please note any claims for the purchase of the property itself or any capital improvements made to your home may make a future sale of the property subject to GST on the full sale amount. You can elect to treat principally private assets as non-taxable. Read our section on Electing to treat goods as non- taxable supplies on page 23 for more information. 25 Goods and services $10,000 or less When you acquire a good or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. 1. Principal purpose method You need to determine whether the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies. This test determines if the GST on the good or service is claimable or not claimable. When the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies: • • you can claim the full amount of GST • • you do not need to make a GST adjustment if the principal purpose changes later. Example Phil is a GST registered contractor. He buys a laptop for $3,000 plus GST of $450, to use in his business for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Phil will also use it occasionally for private use. Phil can claim the full amount of GST charged ($450) as an expense in his next GST return because the principal purpose of the laptop is for business use. When the principal purpose is not for making taxable supplies: • • you cannot claim the GST • • you cannot later make any GST adjustments if the principal purpose of the good or service changes. 2. Apportionment method - $10,000 or less You can choose to claim the business percentage of goods and services, using the apportionment method (regardless of the principal purpose for acquiring the good or service). Change in use adjustments in future periods are not required for goods and services $10,000 or less. If you choose the apportionment method, you’ll need to use this for all goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less for a minimum of 24 months. You cannot change to using the principal purpose method for future purchases during this time. Example Amy has a GST registered business. She buys a car for $9,000 plus GST of $1,350, principally for private use but will sometimes use it in her business. Amy estimates her business use at 20%. If Amy chooses to use the principal purpose method, she cannot claim any GST as the GST exclusive price is $10,000 or less and the principal purpose of the car is not to make taxable supplies. Using the apportionment method, Amy can claim 20% of the GST in her next return. Amy needs to apply the apportionment method to all goods and services for a minimum of 24 months. Goods and services over $10,000 When goods or services over $10,000 (GST exclusive) are acquired for business and private use, or to make exempt supplies, you must apportion the amount of GST you can claim based on your business use. You cannot use the principal purpose method for goods and services over $10,000. You will need to work out your business use based on how the good or service will be used, or is available to use, then calculate a percentage estimate of the GST amount you can claim in your next return. You can choose how you work out the percentage of business use, as long as it gives a fair and reasonable result. This can be based on past records, experience, business plans or another suitable method. For example, if the asset is a car replacing an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of working out the intended use of the replacement car, provided the patterns of use will be relatively unchanged. After the initial GST claim for goods and services over $10,000: • • You must review the business use each year for any change affecting the apportionment between business, private or exempt use. The number of adjustment periods depends on the GST exclusive value and if it is land. • • You may need to make a change-in-use adjustment for the GST claimed if the actual use is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. • • Adjustments can only be made annually, in the GST return aligning with your balance date. More information about the number of adjustment periods is on page 26. When adjustments are not required You do not need to make an adjustment if the GST exclusive cost of the good or service is $10,000 or less. For goods and services over $10,000 you do not need to make an adjustment if: • • the change in taxable use is less than 10% and the value of the adjustment is $1,000 or less • • you make taxable and exempt supplies, and the total value of exempt supplies in the adjustment period is less than both: ·· $90,000, and ·· 5% of total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE26 Example A dairy spends $16,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations. A major part of the dairy's business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors' account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be less than both $90,000 and 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made, the dairy is not required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations. Annual review and adjustments for change in use You must keep track of goods and services used in your business and for private or exempt supplies. Adjustments may be required when there is a change from your original estimate and the GST amount claimed. Change in use adjustments are accounted for annually, in your GST return aligning to your balance date. A method applied to determine taxable 'use' must be fair and reasonable. Examples • • 31 March balance date and a 2-monthly GST filing, the adjustment is included in February/March GST return aligning with the balance date. • • 30 June balance date and a 6-monthly GST filing, the adjustment is included in the January/June GST return aligning with the balance date. Choosing your adjustment period You can choose your first adjustment period to be from the date you acquire the good or service, until the end of either: • • the income year of acquisition (balance date) • • the income year (balance date) at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. Each adjustment period after this is the same as your income year. You cannot make change in use adjustments in other GST periods. Number of adjustment review periods The number of adjustment periods depends on the GST exclusive cost of the good or service: GST exclusive cost Adjustment periods $10,000 or lessNot required $10,001 - $20,0002 $20,001 - $500,0005 Over $500,000 or land (of any value)10 You may also choose the maximum number of adjustments based on the estimated useful life of the asset. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Example - Ben Ben operates a business and files 6-monthly GST returns in September and March. Ben has a 31 March balance date. In May he buys a car to use in his business for $28,750 including GST of $3,750. Ben estimates the car will be used 80% for business use and claims $3,000 GST in his September GST return. $3,750 × 80% = $3,000 Because the GST exclusive cost is $25,000, Ben needs to keep track of his business and private use for 5 adjustment periods. Adjustment period 1 At the end of the income year, Ben’s actual business use of the car is 100%. Ben makes a change in use adjustment to claim the remaining 20% of the GST ($750) in his February/ March GST return (as this is the period aligning to his balance date). Ben needs to keep track of his car’s business use for 4 more adjustment periods as the GST exclusive cost is between $20,001 and $500,000. Change in use adjustments less than 10% and $1,000 or less in value You cannot make a change in use adjustment if the percentage of actual taxable use is less than a 10 % change from either the original intended use, or previous actual taxable use if you’ve already made an adjustment, and the adjustment amount is $1,000 or less. Example – less than 10% and $1,000 or less (Ben) Ben’s been keeping track of his business and private use for the car he bought the previous year for any more change in use. He’s already made one adjustment at the end of the income year he bought the car. During adjustment period 2, Ben’s wife Carly uses his business car for 19 days while her car is being repaired. At the end of the adjustment period, Ben’s worked out the difference for private use was less than 10% and $1,000 or less. He does not need to make an adjustment in period 2 but he still needs to check for changes in business use for 3 more adjustment periods. Example - Miriama Miriama bought a car for $34,500 including GST of $4,500 12 months ago to use in her taxable activity. She estimated her business use at 50% and claimed half of the GST ($2,250). 27 At the end of her first adjustment period, she has used the car 59% of the time in her business activity (9% more than she estimated). Because the difference is less than 10% and the change in GST value is $1,000 or less, ($450) Miriama cannot make any adjustment this period. If her business use of the car increases in a future adjustment period by 10% or more from her original estimate or the value is over $1,000, she can make an adjustment for the difference. Calculating actual use Actual use is always measured from original acquisition of the good or service. You must compare the percentage actual use of goods and services with: • • the percentage intended taxable use of the goods and services (if no previous adjustment has been made), or • • the previous actual taxable use (if you have made a previous adjustment for the goods and services). Example • Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/ previous use Peter has a 31 March balance date and files 2-monthly GST returns. Peter acquires a luxury boat on 1 October for $575,000 including GST of $75,000. He intends to use the boat 100% in his charter business and claims the full input tax deduction of $75,000 GST in his October/November GST return. Based on the GST exclusive value of the boat ($500,000), Peter monitors his business use for 5 adjustment periods. Peter’s actual taxable use of the boat during each adjustment period is: – Adjustment period 1 - 100% – Adjustment period 2 - 80% – Adjustment period 3 - 83% – Adjustment period 4 - 50% – Adjustment period 5 - 90% Adjustment period 1 is the income year ending 31 March, 6 months after Peter bought the boat. All other adjustment periods are 12 months. Peter makes the required adjustments in his February/March GST return at the end of each adjustment period. The following calculations work out the actual taxable use over the 5-year period, compared to Peter’s original estimate of intended taxable use, and adjust the GST originally claimed on acquisition for any non-taxable use. Adjustment period Intended use/Previous actual use % Percentage use in this adjustment period % To t a l months since acquisition Calculation details % Percentage actual use since acquisition % Change from previous adjustment period +/- % GST adjustment $75,000 x % difference Pay back/claim) Acquisition100($75,000) 1100 1006100 x 6/61001000$0.00 2100 8018100 x 6/18 80 x 12/18 33.3 53.3 86.6-13.4$10,050 386.6 8330100 x 6/30 80 x 12/30 83 x 12/30 20.0 32.0 33.2 85.2-1.4$1,050 485.2 5042100 x 6/42 80 x 12/42 83 x 12/42 50 x 12/42 14.3 22.9 23.7 14.3 75.2-10.0$7,500 575.29054100 x 6/54 80 x 12/54 83 x 12/54 50 x 12/54 90 x 12/54 11.1 17.8 18.4 11.1 20.0 78.4+3.2($2,400) Overall result 78.4When Peter acquired the boat, he estimated it would be used 100% for making taxable supplies. Over the 5 adjustment periods the boat’s actual use in making taxable supplies was 78.4% ($75,000 x 78.4% = $58,800). Peter accounted for the changes in actual use at the end of each adjustment period. The total of annual adjustments is $16,200 (the difference between $75,000 and $58,800). Total GST adjustment $16,200 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE28 Adjustment period 1 (6 months from acquisition to the end of the income year) Peter does not need to make an adjustment for this period as his actual business use did not change. Adjustment period 2 Peter must make a debit adjustment for his non business use for the difference in GST he claimed when he bought the boat. This is calculated as 13.4% of $75,000. He includes $10,050 as a debit adjustment in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 2. Adjustment period 3 The difference in use from adjustment period 2 and 3 is a decrease in overall business use of 1.4%. The percentage is less than 10% but the value is $1,050, so Peter makes another debit adjustment for $1,050 in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 3. Adjustment period 4 The difference in business use from adjustment period 3 and 4 is a decrease in business use of 10%. Peter makes another debit adjustment for $7,500 in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 4. Adjustment period 5 The difference in business use from adjustment period 4 is an increase in business use of 20%. This time Peter makes a credit adjustment in his GST return for $2,400 at the end of adjustment period 5. After adjustment period 5 Peter no longer needs to make any further adjustments. If he sells the boat later, he will need to account for GST on the sale. Wash-up rule A wash-up adjustment is used when the business, exempt or private use of good or service changes and you do not expect it to change again. Work out the adjustment using this calculation: (full GST amount x new percentage) – actual deduction = wash-up adjustment • • The full GST amount of the good or service. For a zero-rated land transaction, this would be 15% of the purchase price. • • New percentage is the percentage of intended taxable use. • • Actual deduction is the GST previously claimed, including adjustments. If you make a wash-up adjustment and there is no change to the new percentage, you'll no longer have to make annual adjustments. The wash-up adjustment is made in the adjustment period (aligned to your balance date) after the permanent change in use is made. If your good or service changes in use later, you’ll need to make another adjustment. This adjustment needs to be made when the use changes and remains unchanged for a full adjustment period, even if the change is within the 10% or $1,000 threshold. Example – permanent change in use Tōtara Ltd is registered for GST. The company acquires an apartment building for $23m from an unregistered person. Tōtara uses 80% of the building to make exempt supplies of rental accommodation and leases the remaining 20% to Rimu Ltd who are also registered for GST. Rimu uses these apartments to supply commercial hotel accommodation units and serviced apartments. The 20% portion is a taxable supply. Tōtara claims a $600,000 deduction in the GST return period they acquire the building (3/23 x $23m = $3m potential secondhand goods input tax claim on total building, $600,000 is 20% of $3m). After 24 months, Tōtara negotiates a long-term commercial lease with Rimu to supply 50% of the building for Rimu’s commercial accommodation business. The long-term lease is a permanent change from 20% to 50%. Tōtara makes an adjustment to claim $900,000 being the difference in taxable use of 30% (additional 30% of the $3m input tax) at the end of their next adjustment period. Final adjustment on disposal of an asset used in a taxable activity You need to make a final adjustment when you dispose of the asset, to allow for any GST which has not been claimed. Use the following calculation to work out the final adjustment: Tax fraction x Consideration x (1 – Previous use) • • Where the tax fraction is 15% of the GST exclusive amount or 3/23rds of the GST inclusive amount. • • The consideration is the amount received, or treated as received, for the supply. • • Previous use is the percentage intended taxable use (if sold in the first adjustment period) or the previous actual taxable use at the end of the last adjustment period before disposal. Example Melissa buys a car for $46,000 (inclusive of $6,000 GST). She claims 70% input tax of $4,200. The car is later sold for $34,500 (GST inclusive). The sale of the car is in the course of her taxable activity, so the full sale amount is subject to GST. Melissa returns $4,500 as output tax (sales). Melissa’s final use of the car on sale is 100% taxable. As Melissa had not claimed for full business use of the car, she makes a final adjustment, calculated as follows: 29 Melissa works out the tax fraction of $34,500 (3/23) as $4,500 and multiples this by her private use (30% or 0.3). Melissa can claim an additional adjustment for $1,350. 3/23 x $34,500 x (1 – 0.7) = $1,350. Melissa includes the full $34,500 as sales and income in her GST return, and in her purchases and expenses, she includes a credit adjustment for $1,350. Example – Peter Peter sells his boat on 30 September, 6 years after acquisition for $460,000 including $60,000 GST. The sale of the boat is in the course of his taxable activity, so the full sale amount is subject to GST. Peter’s final use of the boat on sale is 100% taxable. Because the boat had some non-taxable use, Peter makes a final adjustment on disposal. In our earlier example for Peter, his last recorded taxable use adjustment was 78.4%. Peter makes a final adjustment on disposal as follows: 3/23 × $460,000 × (1 – 0.784) = $12,960 Peter includes both the output tax of $60,000 and credit adjustment of $12,960 in his August/September GST return. Maximum adjustment for property developers If you’re a property developer, your final adjustment cannot exceed the tax fraction of the purchase price when you first acquired the asset. Example: Property developer Emily, a property developer bought an apartment to renovate and rent. The input tax on the cost of the property plus renovations was $60,000. Emily claimed 64.8% of the total input tax - $38,880 because the property had a mix of taxable and exempt use. Emily sold the apartment for $640,000. As Emily has not claimed the full input tax for the purchase and renovation cost she makes a final adjustment of the input tax: 3/23 × $640,000 × (1 – 0.648) = $29,384 When Emily adds $29,384 to the deduction already claimed ($38,880), this is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($60,000). As Emily is a property developer selling land, her adjustment is limited to $21,120. Special rule for concurrent use of land The portion of a deduction you should be entitled to claim must correspond with the extent to which you use the asset for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one particular time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking your children to school - but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same time, for example, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. For the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). The following formula will help you in apportioning between concurrent uses of land: consideration for taxable supply × 100% = (percentage of taxable use) total consideration for supply The 'consideration for taxable supply' is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The 'total consideration for supply' is the sum of the amount of the 'consideration for taxable supply' described above, and: • • the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired, and • • if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non- taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged. You may apply for an alternative approach if this formula does not fit your circumstances. The market value must be used in determining consideration for taxable supply and/or total consideration for supply if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm's-length amounts. If the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value. Example Sandy, a property developer, built 2 similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction. Sandy is unable to sell the properties immediately on completion. So, while still advertising the houses for sale, she: • • rents out house A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period, and • • moves into house B and lives there rent free. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE30 Just after the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells house B for $360,000. House A - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and exempt purposes (supplying a residential dwelling), she needs to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of house A, but ascertains the market value of the house is approximately the same as for house B ($360,000). The total consideration for supply is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired ($386,000). Sandy's taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 As Sandy had originally claimed 100% on acquisition, she has therefore claimed 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 House B - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Because Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and private purposes (residential), she has to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is the amount derived, or would be derived, on a disposal of the house ($360,000). Because Sandy did not rent out house B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the total consideration for supply, is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates she would have received $26,000 of rental income. Her taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 Sandy has deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this amount to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 In both cases, Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity. An additional formula estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is: months × result total months • • 'Months' is defined as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies. • • 'Total months' is defined as the total number of months since acquisition. • • 'Result' from calculation to establish the percentage of taxable use. Example The facts are the same as in the previous example and the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months. In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out house A and advertising it for sale. However, 6 months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising house A for sale because she decides to permanently rent it out. In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of house A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000. At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy identifies the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the total consideration for the supply is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired: (360,000 + 26,000 + 30,000 = $416,000). $360,000 × 100% = 86.5% $416,000 However, because the house has been used for 6 months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to calculate the percentage actual use: 18 × 86.5% = 64.8% 24 Sandy's percentage actual use of house A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the 'previous actual use', with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. So Sandy has deducted 28.2% (93% − 64.8% = 28.2%) more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 28.2% = $8,460 31 Special rule for calculating use of some assets Until 31 March 2024, special rules may apply to purchases of the following assets costing $50,000 or more and related expenses: • • land for example, holiday home • • ships/boats • • aircraft. If you purchase one of these assets you must use a specified formula to calculate 'use' if the asset is: • • used partly to earn income and partly for private use; and • • not in use for 62 days in the income year (or 62 working days if the asset is typically only used on working days). The rule does not apply to assets of a company (unless it is a close company). They also do not apply if any private use is minor and subject to FBT and the main business use for the asset is not a rental or charter business. You can claim a deduction when mixed-use assets are acquired, and when you acquire goods and services that relate to both income-earning and private use of a mixed-use asset (mixed- use expenses), to the extent that they will be used for making taxable supplies. The estimate of how you intend to use the goods and services should take into account the formula for the adjustment for mixed-use expenses below. Then, for the first adjustment period and subsequent adjustment periods, an adjustment is required for mixed-use expenses if the actual use of the mixed-use asset is different from the intended use. The formula used to calculate the adjustment for mixed-use expenses is similar to the calculation used to determine your deduction for income tax, and is based on income-earning days and private use days of the asset. The formula to calculate the adjustment is: total amount of input tax × income-earning days income-earning days + private days Formula definitions • • 'Input tax' is the total input tax for the mixed-use expenses, including the cost of the asset (excludes input tax relating solely to non-taxable and taxable use) • • 'Income-earning days' is the total number of days when rent or a fee is paid for the use of the asset, regardless of the amount paid. Includes consideration received from family, non-associated persons, and when the asset is being repaired or relocated • • 'Private days' is the total number of days the asset is used with no amount of rent or fee paid. Using alternatives to 'days' You can use other measures in the formula if they reflect the time use of the asset more accurately. For example: • • flying hours for an aircraft • • nights for a holiday home. Example Regan purchases a charter boat on 1 April 2017 for $450,000 (GST inclusive) which is used both to earn income and for private use. He accounts for GST input tax for the year as follows: Fully deductible expenses Annual Maritime NZ survey fees $700 Charter advertising $400 Food/drinks (charter guests only) $500 Regan claims the full input tax and no adjustment is made as the expenses relate solely to income-earning. Not deductible $250 for family fishing licenses is a private expense, so no GST input tax is claimed. Apportioned (mixed-use) expenses There are apportioned (mixed-use) expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use, so Regan needs to work out how much GST he can claim. Mooring fees $2,000 Fuel $1,200 Insurance $2,450 General repairs $300 Total expenses $5,950 When Regan acquired the boat, he estimated that the taxable use would be 50%. He claimed input tax on the mixed-use expenses of $29,735.86 (credit) as follows: ExpenseCostGST value50% input tax claimed Purchase of boat $450,000$58,695.65$29,347.82 Mooring fees, insurance, fuel $5,950$776.09$388.04 Total input tax $29,735.86 Income-earnings days Days fully chartered to the public 102 Days chartered at 50% market rate 20 to Regan's local fishing club Total 122 Private days Days the family used the charter boat 30 without making any payment income-earning + private days = 152 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE32 Total input tax (boat $58,695.65 + mixed-expenses $776.09) = $59,471.74 The calculation is: $59,471.74× 122 =$47,733.90 input tax 152 Regan claimed input tax of $29,735.86 during the year. He is entitled to claim a further amount of $17,998.04 (credit) as an adjustment for input tax in Box 13 of his final GST return of the year. The calculation is: $47,733.90− $29,735.86=$17,998.04 If the amount of input tax calculated for the actual use of the asset was less than the input tax claimed during the year, the difference would be a debit adjustment added in Box 9 of the GST return for further GST to pay. Other adjustments Barters You can also exchange goods and services for other goods or services, or a combination of goods, services and money - this is b ar ter. If the exchange is for other goods and services, you must account for 3/23 of the open (current) market value of whatever you received in return for your supply. When part of the exchange is money, you must include: • • 3/23 of the open (current) market value of the goods and services you received, as a debit adjustment in your GST return, and • • the money received in the total sales box of your GST return. Use this rule whichever accounting basis you're on. You might also receive goods and services in full (or part- exchange) for your supplies from another person. Between you, work out a dollar value for the exchange, for example a trade-in. You must include this agreed value, plus any money involved, in Box 5 of your GST return. Insurance payments received If you receive an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, include 3/23 as an adjustment in the GST return that covers the time you received the payment. For example, an insurance company makes a payment to cover equipment damaged in a fire. GST shown on New Zealand Customs documents The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects GST when: • • goods are imported into New Zealand. Customs charges GST on the landed value (including insurance , freight and duties) for the goods. • • excisable goods (alcohol, fuel and tobacco) manufactured in New Zealand are removed from a licensed manufacturing area for home consumption. Customs collects any applicable levies and any GST on those levies. Documents issued by Customs (such as a Customs import entry form C4, a Deferred payment of duty statement or Broker account statement) can be used to support a claim for a GST credit. Remember, you must hold these supporting documents to make a claim. Do not include imported goods under purchases on your GST return. When to account for GST paid to Customs The table below explains when to account for GST paid to Customs, depending on your accounting basis. For more information about GST on imported goods go to the New Zealand Customs Service customs.govt.nz (search keyword: importers) or call 0800 428 786. If you use theyou invoice basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document as a credit adjustment or in Box 13 of the paper GST return for the period you receive the invoice or make a payment, whichever is earlier. payments or hybrid basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document as a credit adjustment or in Box 13 of the paper GST return for the period you make the GST payment. 33 StepWhat to do 1Take the total taxable value of all fringe benefits from your FBT return. (This is the amount of the benefits, not the FBT itself.) 2Subtract the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common ones are: • • low-interest loans • • other financial services • • international travel • • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. The result is the fringe benefits liable for GST. 3Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 then divide by 23. This is the GST adjustment to include in your FBT return. Include this adjustment in: • • Box 7 of the quarterly FBT return (IR420) for quarterly filers • • Box 6 of the annual FBT return (IR422) for annual filers • • Box 6 of the income year FBT return (IR421) for income year filers. Example: Taxable benefits for FBT quarter ended 31 March 2021 Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Low-interest loans $ 425 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Subsidy on employee's honeymoon trip $ 600 Total $ 3,682 Benefits liable for GST are: Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Total $ 2,657 The low-interest loan and subsidy for the honeymoon are not included because loans are exempt supplies and international travel is a zero-rated supply. The amount of the GST adjustment is $346.57 ($2,657 × 3 ÷ 23). Enter this in Box 7 for the FBT return for the quarter ended 31 March 2021. Pay the adjustment when your FBT for the March quarter is due. If an employee makes a payment direct to the employer towards a fringe benefit, this is a separate supply and is liable for GST. Include this payment as income in Box 5 of the GST return. The time of supply is the same as for any other sale by the business. Example An employee has paid $100 cash direct to the employer. Add the $100 to the sales in Box 5 of the GST return. The GST to pay on the $100 is $13.04. FBT (fringe benefit tax) Companies and employers registered for FBT do not need to make a private use adjustment. But, they will need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Sole traders, partnerships and trusts registered for FBT may still have to make a private use adjustment if the owner, partners, trust members or associated persons use business assets privately. They also need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Make the adjustment in the FBT return period you provide the benefits in. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE34 If you...you make the adjustment in the GST return that covers... do not have a tax agentthe date your income tax return is due or filed, whichever is the earlier date. Example If your 2023 income tax return is due on 7 July 2023 and you do not have a tax agent, you need to make your GST adjustment in the GST return which includes that date. have a tax agentthe earlier of: •• the date your income tax return is filed, or •• 31 March after the due date for your income tax return. have a tax agent who has an extension of time to file your income tax return the date your income tax return is actually filed. If an employee contributes to the expense, treat this as a separate supply for GST. Include the total expense amount in Box 11 on your GST return as usual and show the employee contribution in Box 5. Because the GST adjustment is based on the amount which is not deductible for income tax, organisations that are not liable for income tax, for example, not-for-profit organisations and charities, do not need to make this adjustment. Calculating the adjustment for entertainment expenses The table below explains how to calculate the adjustment for an entertainment expense using the example on the right. StepWhat to doExample 1To work out the GST, multiply the expense by 3 then divide by 23.$230 × 3 ÷ 23 = $30 2Subtract GST from the entertainment expense. $230 − $30 = $200 3Work out the amount that is not deductible for income tax (50%).$200 × 50% = $100 4Multiply the non-deductible amount by 15% (or 0.15). This is your GST adjustment. Show this GST adjustment on your GST adjustment calculation sheet - IR372 under 'Entertainment expenses'. Transfer the total amount to Box 9 of your GST return for the period ending 31 October. $100 × 15% = $15.00 Before 1 April 2018 the GST component was calculated by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 23 (for example, $100 × 3 ÷ 23 = $13.04) at step 4. Example XYZ Ltd's only entertainment expense in the tax year was a business lunch for clients. The lunch cost $230 including GST. The income tax return for the year ending 31 March is filed on 7 July, and the company files six-monthly GST returns for the periods April and October. XYZ makes the adjustment in the GST return for the 6 months ending 31 October. The full $230 would have been included in Box 11 of an earlier GST return to claim the GST credit. Entertainment expenses Business entertainment expenses are related to taxable income and are incurred in the course of running a business. Usually, only 50% of business entertainment expenses are deductible for income tax. Read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide for details. You'll need to make a GST adjustment of 15% of the GST-exclusive non-deductible amount once a year. You cannot claim GST on private entertainment expenses, for example, a restaurant lunch with friends. During the year, keep showing your total business entertainment expenses on your GST return. The table below explains exactly when to make the adjustment depending on whether a tax agent prepares your income tax return. 35 Telephone expenses Cellphones If you have a business cellphone, you can claim GST on the total set-up cost. If you use the same cellphone for private use, you can claim GST on these running costs: • • total fixed cost of running the phone • • business calls. How to claim for telephone line rental See the table below. If you...you... have a commercial and domestic line rentalcan claim the GST on the full cost of the commercial line. Include the commercial rental cost in Box 11 on your GST return. You cannot claim any part of the domestic rental. have only one telephone line rental and use it for business and private purposes can claim GST on 50% of the cost. Show 50% of the rental in Box 11 on your GST return. The line can be commercial or domestic. want to claim more than 50% of your rentalmust show that the actual business use of your telephone is greater than 50%. The proportion of business toll calls to private toll calls may be one factor in working out the overall business use. You'll need to consider other factors, for example, your type of business and how many people live in the house. are a farmermay claim the full cost of telephone rental used for business and private purposes. Include the full rental in Box 11 on your GST return. make business-related callsmay claim the full amount of GST on these calls. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE36 Bad debts written off If you supply goods or services services and return GST on an invoice basis, but later write off all or part of the consideration as a bad debt, you can make a credit adjustment in the period you write it off. How you do this depends on your accounting basis - see the table below. If you use the...you... invoice or hybrid basisaccount for a sale when you issue an invoice. If you've already included the GST on the sale in a previous return, and then later write off the debt, you'll use this adjustment. payments basiswill not account for the GST on a sale until you actually receive it. If you do not receive payment and write the debt off, you cannot claim a deduction, because you have not included the GST on the sale in any previous GST return. You may make an adjustment for door-to-door sales and hire purchase agreements if you use the payments basis. Calculating a credit adjustment Show 3 / 23 of the full amount you've written off on the calculation sheet and include it in Box 13 of your GST return. You do not need to send in any documents supporting the write-off, but you do need to keep a record of the steps you took to recover the debt. For example: • • a debtor's ledger showing the date you issued the invoice • • letters from a solicitor/debt collector trying to recover the debt • • a bad debts ledger showing the write-off. You must write off the debt(s). You cannot claim for provision for bad debts. Example Brent, who uses the invoice basis, issues Chris with an invoice dated 26 October for electrical goods worth $115 including GST. Brent accounts for the sale in the return for the period ending 31 October. In the following March, Brent gives up hope of receiving payment from Chris and writes off $115 as a bad debt. Brent shows $115 × 3 ÷ 23 on his IR372 under 'Bad debts written off' and includes it in Box 13 of his GST return for the taxable period ending 30 April. GST not charged on the full price If the bad debt was for goods or services where GST was not charged on the full price (for example, the fifth week of a hotel stay, or a hire purchase sale), the GST adjustment is not simply 3 / 23 of the bad debt. Use this formula to calculate the adjustment: bad debt written off ÷ total consideration × GST included in consideration = GST adjustment Example Sue stayed at the Holiday Hotel for 6 weeks. Her total bill was $6,005.57. Sue leaves, still owing $1,000. After some time, the hotel writes off the $1,000 as a bad debt. The amount of GST included in the total bill is $602.57. The hotel must make an adjustment in its return which covers the period of the write-off: $1,000 ÷ $6,005.57 × $602.57 = $100.33 Bad debts recovered If you've had a GST deduction for a bad debt written off and you later recover all or part of the debt, you must make an adjustment for the amount recovered. Include 3/23 of the amount recovered as a debit adjustment in your GST return. Example Manu, who uses the invoice basis, wrote off a bad debt of $2,500 and later recovered $1,600. He must make an adjustment of $208.70 ($1,600 × 3 ÷ 23) at the time of recovery, even if he's changed his accounting basis since then. 37 Exempt supplies Some goods and services are exempt from GST so you do not include them in your GST return. These include: • • financial services • • penalty interest • • renting a dwelling for use as a private home • • residential accommodation under a head lease. Financial services These include: • • paying or collecting any amount of interest • • mortgages and other loans • • bank fees • • securities such as stocks and shares • • providing credit under a credit contract • • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$) • • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (for example, mortgage broking) • • financial options • • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • • deliverable future contracts • • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Penalty interest Interest charges on overdue accounts are treated as exempt supplies. Example If you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90-day account basis, and the account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. You do not pay GST on fines and penalties you get for a statutory offence, for example, parking penalties or infringement fees issued by courts or local authorities. Renting a residential dwelling The rent for a residential dwelling is exempt from GST. A landlord cannot claim GST on any expenses, such as maintenance, rates, and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change of use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease In most cases, if a property is leased as residential accommodation under a head lease, both the supply of the head lease and the sub-lease are exempt supplies. Zero-rated supplies Some supplies are zero-rated for GST and taxed at 0%. Restraint of trade Any payment you receive in return for not conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand is zero-rated. Internet sales A registered New Zealand-owned entity selling goods or services through the internet to customers in New Zealand must charge GST at the usual rate. But, a New Zealand-owned entity selling goods or services through the internet to overseas buyers will generally charge GST at 0%. We expect sellers to take reasonable steps to check where the customer lives and where the goods or services are going. Sale of a going concern A going concern is a business sold 'lock, stock and barrel' or is part of a business that can operate independently. The business must be a going concern at the time of sale, right up to the time of the transfer to the buyer. A supply of goods or services must meet these criteria to be a going concern: • • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • • It must be the supply of all the necessary goods and services for the activity to continue. • • Both parties must agree in writing there is a supply of a going concern. • • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the buyer. The sale is zero-rated for GST if it meets all these criteria. Example Pat, a dairy farmer, sells his dairy farm (including land, herd, all buildings and all machinery) to another GST-registered farmer. This qualifies as the sale of a going concern if both parties agree. If Pat had sold the land and buildings but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not qualify as a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated, see land transactions in this guide. Part 5 - Supplies GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE38 But, if he'd sold parts of the farm that could have been operated separately as a going concern, the sale would be zero-rated. Land transactions A GST-registered person must zero rate a supply, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • • is made to another registered person, and • • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and • • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply will be taxed at 15%. Refer to ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst Not eligible for zero-rating Services performed in New Zealand for a third party Services performed under contract to a non-resident who lives outside New Zealand, delivered to a third party in New Zealand, and where it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract is entered into the services will not be received by the third party in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies, are not eligible for zero-rating. GST is charged at the standard rate of 15% if supplied to non- residents, but the supply is received in New Zealand. Example A Singaporean family wants their child to receive a year's education in New Zealand. The parents contract a New Zealand school to supply the tuition. The supply of the tuition is not zero-rated because the child will receive the tuition in New Zealand, and it was reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into, the child will not receive the tuition in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Example A non-resident tour operator buys accommodation from New Zealand hotels and puts them into travel packages for tours of New Zealand. The travel packages are then sold to non-resident tourists. The supply of accommodation contracted between New Zealand hotels and the non-resident tour operator is not zero-rated because it's reasonably foreseeable another person (the non-resident tourist) will receive the services in New Zealand and will not receive the accommodation in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Special supplies Special supplies are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Accommodation The supply of residential accommodation in a dwelling is exempt from GST. However, GST may be included for accommodation in a commercial dwelling. Commercial dwellings include: • • hotels, motels, homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, inns, hostels or boarding houses • • some serviced apartments • • convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes or hospice • • camping grounds • • other commercial dwellings. A commercial dwelling does not include a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when it is supplied with the right to occupy. If your taxable activity is running a commercial dwelling, you can calculate the GST on the accommodation in 2 ways. 4-week rule Commercial dwellings - residential establishments, for example boarding hostels or rest homes For the first 4 weeks' stay, charge GST on the full value of accommodation in the dwellings. After 4 weeks, charge GST only on 60% of the value of the domestic goods or services, usually the right to occupy the premises. This may include any of the following: • • cleaning and maintenance • • electricity, gas, air-conditioning or heating • • telephone (not tolls), television, internet, radio or similar chattels. Example Lauren stays for 6 weeks at the Comedy Hotel. The GST- exclusive costs are: 42 nights at $104 per night $4,368 Food and laundry $1,035 39 Comedy Hotel INVOICE Lauren Hardie GST No. 987-654-321 71 John Street Christchurch 08 April 20 XX 28 days (first 4 weeks) at $104 per night$2,912.00 GST (15% of $2,912.00)$436.80 $3,348.80 14 days (after 4 weeks) at $104 per night$1,456.00 60% of $1,456.00$873.60 GST at 15%$131.04$131.04 $1,587.04 Food and laundry$1,035.00 GST at 15% $155.25 $1,190.25 Total due$6,126.09 Main Street PO Box 36 363 Phone: (04) 333 6666 WELLINGTON WELLINGTON comedyhotel@hotmail.com This is how they calculate the amount for their GST return: first 28 days $ 436.80 next 14 days $ 131.04 food and laundry $ 155.25 total GST charged $ 723.09 $723.09 × 23 ÷ 3 = $5,543.69 is included for sales and income. If a joint charge covers all supplies for bed and breakfast, the fully taxable supplies (breakfast) must be identified separately from the domestic goods or services (bed). Residential establishment, - boarding hostels, resthomes If you and the guest agree the stay is for longer than 4 weeks, you must charge GST on 60% of the value of domestic goods or services from the beginning of their stay. Advance payments A supplier who receives advance or progress payments must account for the GST on the payments. These are inducements for a supply of goods, not financial services (which are exempt supplies). Example Tina is a fruit grower. She receives an advance payment from her marketing board and accounts for it like this: She includes the advance payment in total sales and income in the same period she receives it. If, for some reason, Tina has to pay back all or part of the advance she received from the marketing board it will be treated as a loan. As a loan, the advance will be exempt from GST because it's a financial service. The marketing board may claim a GST credit for the advance payment made, as long as they hold the necessary taxable supply information (such as an invoice or other documents). If the advance is later repaid, it must be included in total sales and income. Any interest is exempt because it's a financial service. A GST-registered agent who is involved in the transaction must account for GST on any commission or fee they charge. Auctions and auctioneers Ownership of goods under auction never passes to the auctioneer. Auctioneers sell goods on behalf of others (principals). An auctioneer may not know whether the principals are registered for GST, or whether to charge GST on a particular lot. The sale of goods on behalf of a non-registered principal is not taxable. The sale of a registered person's private assets is generally not taxable. The auctioneer can charge and account for GST as though making the taxable supply, as long as both the principal and the auctioneer agree to this arrangement. If the principal is registered, the GST-inclusive sale price, less commission, is passed on to the principal who must account for GST. If the principal is not registered, the auctioneer will pass the GST-exclusive sale price, less commission, on to the principal. An auctioneer who is registered for GST must account for the GST on fees or commissions. Auctions may be held on either a GST-inclusive or a GST-exclusive basis. The auctioneer should state this clearly at the beginning of the auction, so the bidders know whether or not their bids include GST. Delayed settlement transactions A vendor registered for GST on a payments basis who enters into a property transaction with a delayed settlement date must account for GST when an invoice is issued or when payment is received, whichever happens earlier, when the price of the property exceeds $225,000 including GST. This does not apply if: • • the supply is made under a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property - under one year • • the supplier is a not-for-profit organisation and at the time of supply, the recipient is not a registered person and is either:  not intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity, or  intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity but only after the full amount for the supply is paid to the supplier. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE40 Door-to-door sales The time of supply is the first day after the period in which the purchaser may cancel the sale. If you're a door-to-door salesperson, your buyers have either 7 days or 1 month to cancel the sale depending on the cancellation period. You account for the supply in the taxable period covering the day after the final date for cancellation. Example Selena Wares, a door-to-door salesperson, sells an item on 31 May, the last day of the taxable period. Day 8 after the sale is 8 June. She includes the full price for the supply in the taxable period covering 8 June. If you purchase from a door-to-door salesperson, you can claim a credit in the taxable period covering the first day after the cancellation period (provided you hold an invoice). This applies even if you get an invoice or make payment before that date. Full price not known at the time of supply Sometimes, a final price is not settled until after the goods or services are physically supplied. If you're supplying goods or services like this and you use the invoice or hybrid basis you include GST on the known component of the price in the earliest period of when you: • • issued an invoice for any part of this supply, or • • have a payment due, or • • received a payment. If you use the payments basis, you will account for the supply when you receive payments. Example Andy sells produce to an exporter for a down payment plus an end-of-season catch-up, based on export prices. Andy accounts for the down payment immediately. He accounts for the catch-up payment when it's due, received, or when an invoice is issued - whichever is earlier. However, if you buy goods or services when you do not know the full price and you use the invoice basis, you claim a credit in the earliest taxable period you: • • receive an invoice, or • • make a payment, or • • have a payment due. You must hold taxable supply information to support any claim. For purchases under the payments or hybrid basis, claim a credit when you make a payment. Gaming machines Gaming machine operators must register for and pay gaming machine duty. They must also pay GST on the value of the gaming machine revenue. This is the difference between: • • the increase in metered turnover • • less the increase in metered total wins during a return period. The amount of any jackpots won during that return period is also deducted from total turnover if the jackpot figure is not included in the metered total wins. When accounting for GST, gaming machine revenue is calculated from the records you're required to keep for the Department of Internal Affairs. Where your monthly machine analysis reports or cashless gaming machine analysis reports are prepared to coincide with the last day of your taxable periods, you can use them to calculate the gaming machine revenue. You also pay problem gambling levy (PGL) on gaming machine profits. You can claim back the GST on PGL. For more information read our Gaming machine duty guide - IR180 guide. Grants and subsidies Any grant or subsidy you receive in relation to your taxable activity from the Crown or a public authority, is considered to include GST if you're registered for GST. Include the full grant or subsidy with total sales and income in your return. Example Helen employs 10 staff. She gets a $200 wage subsidy each week for 8 weeks. The GST content is $208.69. $200 × 8 (weeks) $ 1,600.00 $1,600 × 3 ÷ 23 $ 208.69 Helen includes $1,600 as sales in her return. There is an exception for grants intended for international overseas development. You have to return GST on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand. If you receive a government grant or subsidy, you do not normally need to provide taxable supply information. However, if you receive a grant or subsidy, for example, a research grant, from another registered person, they will probably ask you for taxable supply information. If you pay a grant or subsidy in exchange for taxable supplies, you may request taxable supply information and claim a GST credit. Hire purchase agreements You must account for all hire purchase sales in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use. If you buy goods on hire purchase, you may claim a deduction in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use. 41 Insurance If you get an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, you are usually required to include the GST content as a debit adjustment in the return which covers the time you received the payment. Example Damien's distilling equipment was damaged by fire on 20 January. An insurance company paid the claim on 18 March for $4,500 to cover the damage. Damien includes $586.95 ($4,500 × 3 ÷ 23) as a debit adjustment in his return for the taxable period covering 18 March. You do not account for any payment received under a life insurance contract, because the insurer cannot charge GST on the premiums. Some types of insurance premiums are liable for GST (for example, fire and general insurance). A registered insurer may claim deductions for payments to policy holders when they are made. An invoice is not needed. The insurer will need taxable supply information to deduct any other payments for claims on policies, for example, a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle. Insurers cannot claim for payments made under life insurance policies. Lay-by sales The time of supply is the date the buyer gets legal possession of the goods. If the sale is cancelled and the seller keeps part of the money, the time of supply is the cancellation. Include the full cost of a lay-by sale in the taxable period in which the buyer takes ownership of the goods. This is the time of the final payment. Do not account for the lay-by payments as you receive each one, but wait until you receive the final payment, even if you use the payments basis. Example Sue buys a chair on lay-by from a furniture shop in January. The full price is $560. Sue pays $160 as a deposit, and instalments of $200 in February and March. The chair is delivered in April. The furniture shop accounts for GST in the taxable period covering March, because that's when Sue became the owner. If a lay-by sale is cancelled and the retailer keeps some of the payments already made (or receives any later payments), they account for this amount in the taxable period which the sale was cancelled in. GST is calculated on the full amount kept, or received later, and it must be included in the return. Example Sue cancels the agreement with the furniture shop in February and gets a $300 refund. She loses $60 for doing this, which the furniture shop accounts for in the taxable period covering February. If you buy goods on lay-by, you may claim a deduction when you have fully paid for them, and you have taxable supply information. When you cancel a lay-by sale, you may claim 3 / 23 of any cancellation charge made by the supplier, in the same period you cancel the sale, as long as you have taxable supply information. Local authority rates Local authorities are the only GST-registered organisations which charge rates. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: • • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment, or • • the due date for payment, or • • the date when payment is received. Registered people may claim GST for rates payments for premises used in a taxable activity. If you use the invoice basis and you pay your rates in one lump sum, you may claim for GST when you make the payment or receive an invoice, whichever comes first. If you pay rates in instalments, you may claim the GST when each instalment is due or paid, whichever comes first. For the payments and hybrid basis, you claim GST for rates when you make payment, if you hold taxable supply information. Periodic payments and hire agreements Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Private dwellings as part of taxable activity If a registered person buys a taxable activity that includes a dwelling, it may be treated as a separate supply (exempt). If the dwelling is treated as a separate supply, to claim a GST credit, the purchaser must prove how the dwelling will be used as part of the taxable activity. Repossessions When a buyer does not keep up their payments in a hire purchase arrangement (debtor), the seller will usually repossess the goods and resell them. The original buyer (not the repossessor) is considered to supply the goods to the new purchaser if there is a forced sale. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE42 If the goods sold are used in a taxable activity, the repossessor must account for GST on goods sold after repossession, unless the repossessor has: • • a written statement from the debtor, or • • reliable information, for example, from the debtor's accountant or solicitor, that the goods would not be a taxable supply if the debtor sold them. The repossessor will need to file a GST return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt - IR373. Example Brett sells a $1,200 fridge on hire purchase to Maria for her restaurant. Brett accounts for GST of $156.52 ($1,200 × 3 ÷ 23) in the return covering the period in which the agreement was made. Maria does not keep up the payments. Brett repossesses the fridge and sells it again. He then files an IR373. The sale after repossession, and the GST to be accounted for on it, is considered to be made by Maria. Sale of interest in a taxable activity In an unincorporated body, for example, a partnership, joint venture or trust, the body is the registered person, not the individual members. So, if a member sells an interest in the unincorporated body, it's a private transaction between 2 people and not a taxable supply and there's no GST to account for. Secondhand goods For GST, secondhand goods are goods previously used and paid for by someone else. Secondhand goods do not include: • • new goods • • primary produce - unless previously used • • goods supplied under a lease or rental agreement • • livestock • • secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal of any degree of purity (except to the extent the goods are composed of gold, silver, or platinum manufactured for sale to the public). Land is secondhand goods. The same rules for GST and record keeping apply to secondhand goods as for all other goods liable for GST. Secondhand goods if seller is not GST-registered If the seller is not registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there is no GST charged. If the purchaser is GST- registered they can claim a credit. To do this the purchaser must record: • • the name and address of the supplier • • the date of the purchase • • a description of the goods • • the quantity of the goods • • the price paid. You'll also need to keep details of the transaction if you're going to make a claim for income tax purposes. It does not matter which accounting basis you use; you must make a payment before you can claim the credit for the purchase. Successive supplies and progress payments The 'time of supply' is when a progress payment is made or when an invoice is provided, whichever comes first. Goods or services must be either: • • supplied progressively or periodically, and paid for in the same way, or • • supplied directly in constructing, manufacturing, or extending a building, or civil engineering work, with payments made periodically as the work progresses. If you get progress payments and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, account for the GST in the earliest taxable period a payment is due or received, or when you provide an invoice for that payment only. For the payments basis, account for GST when you receive payments. If you're making progress payments under the invoice basis, you may claim a GST credit in the earliest taxable period a payment is due, when you make a payment, or when you get an invoice for that instalment. You must have taxable supply information to support any claim. You claim a credit in the taxable period you make a payment in if you're using the payments or hybrid basis. Supplies to associated persons Special rules apply if you make certain supplies to people closely associated with you, for example, relatives, closely connected associated companies or trusts. See definition of associated persons. Supply to registered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can claim a GST credit for the purchase, you account for GST on the amount received. Example Jones, Smith and Brown, a GST-registered partnership, sells a piano to Lee, a sister of one of the partners. Lee is registered for GST and can claim GST on the purchase. The open (current) market value of the piano is $2,000, but the sale goes through for $1,500. The partnership accounts for GST of $195.65 ($1,500 × 3 ÷ 23). 43 Supply to unregistered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who cannot claim a deduction, you must determine the open (current) market value of the supply and account for the market value, or the amount you charged, whichever is the larger amount. In the previous example, if Lee was not registered for GST, the partnership would account for GST of $260.87. This is the $2,000 market value multiplied by 3 then divided by 23. Include transactions with associated persons in the return for the taxable period when the supply was made. If you get a payment or issue an invoice before the last date for filing the return, use either the payment date or invoice to work out which taxable period the supply falls in, depending on your accounting basis. Example A partnership has a 2-month taxable period. The return for the period ended 30 April is due on 28 May. The partnership supplies goods with an open (current) market value of $135 to a non-registered brother of one of the partners on 24 April and receives payment of $100 on 16 June. The partnership will account for $17.61 GST (on the market value of $135) in the return for the taxable period ended 30 April, because this is the period when the supply was made. If the partnership had issued an invoice or received payment during May (before the April return was due to be filed), the $17.61 GST would be included in the return for the taxable period ended 30 June because the invoice or payment would fall in the June period. Time of supply between associated persons Claim a deduction in your return for the taxable period when the supply is made available, removed, or performed and you hold taxable supply information. However, if you make a payment or receive an invoice before the last date for filing the return for that taxable period you should instead claim the deduction in the taxable period: • • you make any payment or an invoice is issued (whichever is the earlier), if you are an invoice basis taxpayer; or • • you make payment, if you are on payments or hybrid basis. Telecommunications – mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device and their usual network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15% Inbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used by a non-resident who is in New Zealand and their usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and so not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. Tenders A GST-registered person may call tenders for a future supply of goods or services. The advertisement should state whether the tenders need to include GST. Occasionally, the person making a tender will have to pay a deposit. There is not usually any GST on a deposit unless all or part of it is kept for some reason. Tokens, stamps and vouchers There are special rules for the sale of tokens, postage stamps and gift vouchers. The supplier should treat tokens, stamps and vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer buys them. GST can be accounted for when the customer actually exchanges the voucher for the monetary value of the goods or services bought, if both suppliers agree. Example A petrol station owner sells an oil company's $20 petrol voucher to a customer. The petrol station owner collects the $20 for the oil company and forwards it to them. The customer gives the voucher to a friend who buys petrol at another petrol station. Because there's an agreement between the petrol stations to return the GST on redemption of the voucher, the second petrol station tells the oil company they have sold petrol (goods) in exchange for a $20 petrol voucher. The oil company reimburses the second petrol station owner for the sale, who accounts for the GST on the $20 by including the total amount of the sale in their GST return. This option does not apply to postage stamps and vouchers sold to a non-resident for services performed in New Zealand. The supplier has to account for GST on these items when the customer buys them. Buying tokens, stamps and vouchers Where GST applies on the supply, you can claim tokens, stamps, and vouchers as an expense when you buy them, according to your accounting basis if you hold taxable supply information.

Taxable supply information Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and does not need to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Taxable activity Any activity carried out continuously or regularly by a business, trade, manufacturer, professional person, association or club. It includes any activity that supplies or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration but not necessarily for profit. It does not include: working for salary and wages, being a company director, hobby activities or any private recreation pursuit, private transactions such as the occasional sale of household or domestic items, or making exempt supplies. Taxable supplies Any goods or services you provide while carrying on your taxable activity. Turnover The total value of the taxable supplies in all your taxable activity, including grants and subsidies you receive or barter transactions, excluding any GST. This is not your profit because your expenses are not deducted when determining your turnover. 47
