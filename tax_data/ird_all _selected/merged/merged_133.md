Double Taxation Convention With The Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

A double taxation convention has been concluded between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and New Zealand. The text of the convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1981/43) and is available from Government Bookshops. The convention entered into force on 18 March 1981 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1979. In the Netherlands it takes effect for taxable years and periods which commenced on or after 1 January 1979.

The convention is generally drafted in accordance with the 1977 OECD Model Double Taxation Convention on Income and Capital.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article By Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The convention applies to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The convention covers income tax (de inkomstenbelasting), wages tax (de loonbelasting), company tax (de vennootschapsbelasting) and dividend tax (de dividendbelasting) imposed by the Kingdom of Netherlands.

With regard to New Zealand, the convention covers income tax and excess retention tax but not bonus issue tax which is excluded in Protocol Item I.

### Article 3 - General Definition

*   **National: Paragraph (1)(h)**
    *   The term "national" is used in paragraph (2)(c) and (d) of Article 4 in determining resident status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service. In New Zealand the term covers a citizen of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association under the law in force in New Zealand. n the Netherlands the term covers any individual possessing the nationality of the Netherlands, any legal person, partnership and association under the law in force in the Netherlands.
*   **Undefined Terms: Paragraph (3)**
    *   This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

*   Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a state" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.
*   Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. For example, an individual may have his permanent home in State A, where his wife and children live, and consequently, he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. However, he has spent 6 months of the year in State B and for that reason he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. This conflict is resolved by the tests set out in paragraph 2 giving preference to the claim of State A. Protocol Item II deems an individual living aboard a ship without any residence in either State, to be a resident of the State in which the ship has its home harbour.
*   Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.
*   In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. if the person resident in New Zealand (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the convention a "resident of the Netherlands" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the convention to a "resident of the Netherlands". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other state". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard but the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 12 months. |
| Paragraph 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 12 months in connection with a construction, installation or assembly project. |
| Paragraph 5(b) | Includes the use of substantial equipment or machinery for more than 12 months in the exploration, or the exploitation of, natural resources, or in activities connected with such exploration or exploitation. |

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

*   This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.
*   Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 7.
*   Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment. t is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see paragraph (2) above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.
*   Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.
*   Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.
*   Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has, as a matter of history, been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.
*   Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.
*   Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.
*   Paragraph 7: refer paragraph (2) above.
*   The Protocol contains certain provisions which relate to this Article:
    *   Item III - This item was inserted at the request of the Netherlands. It is of no consequence as far as New Zealand is concerned, since New Zealand abides by the arm's-length principle and associated rules contained in Article 7.
    *   Item IV - The calculation of income and the incorporation of profits from life insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Aircraft

*   Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(g) are to be taxed only in the country in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:
    
    (a) carriage of passengers and cargo;
    
    (b) sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
    
    (c) commercial advertising;
    
    (d) charter fees (but refer paragraph (3) below).
    
*   Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.
*   Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operations of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis except when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

*   Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.
*   Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. New Zealand's domestic law is not, therefore, restricted as our withholding tax rate is 15 percent of the gross dividend. However, the 1980 Income Tax Amendment Act contains an amendment to the New Zealand domestic law by increasing the withholding tax rate to 30 percent of the gross dividend as from 1 April 1982. Therefore, in terms of the agreement New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law, as proposed, will be 30 percent.
*   Paragraph 3 allows the competent authorities of the States to settle the mode of application of paragraph 2. he Netherlands require certification by the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department that a person is a resident of New Zealand in terms of the convention before refunding tax overpaid or allowing companies to restrict the tax deducted. The Netherlands tax authorities have prepared the form "Inkomstenbelasting NR 92 NZ" which is available from all district offices in New Zealand or in the Netherlands from the Ministry of Finance, Tax Service Organisation Department, The Hague. The form will be certified by the District Commissioner or District Officer concerned.
*   Paragraph 4 provides that the restriction on tax in paragraph 2 shall not apply the company paying the dividends.
*   Paragraph 5 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976 with respect to New Zealand: in the case of the Netherlands it is income which is subject to dividend tax.
*   Paragraph 6 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient, which is a resident of the other State, provided they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment, or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from any limitations under the Article. he rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected. t present these qualifications have no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provides for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law, from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment fixed base will be increased to a maximum rate of 30 percent, as against the 15 percent maximum applying under the convention, to "non-connected" dividends.
*   Paragraph 7: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. or example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of the Netherlands".

### Article 11 - Interest

*   Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State that the recipient of the interest is a resident of.
*   Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of the Netherlands instead of the usual 15 percent.
*   Paragraph 3 exempts from tax, interest if it is paid to the other State or to any agency or any instrumentality (including a financial institution) wholly owned by the other State, or to the Central Bank of the Netherlands or to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. tem VIII of Protocol excludes the Bank of New Zealand from exemption.
*   Paragraph 4 allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of paragraphs 2 and   3.
*   Paragraph 5 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or   195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies, would be dealt with under the dividend Article.
*   Paragraph 6 provides that in the State of source, interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there, owned by a resident of the other State, provided the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article. his qualification ties in with the New Zealand domestic law, which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis. (See Section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest, has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which interest is paid is effectively connected.
*   Paragraph 7 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest. he paragraph also deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.
*   Paragraph 8 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

*   Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.
*   Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. Again New Zealand's domestic law is restricted as our withholding tax rate is 15 percent.
*   Paragraph 3 allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.
*   Paragraph 4 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6. Although all royalties and know-how payments (whether lump sum or not) are covered, the following should be noted:
    *   Payments for the use of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment are royalties as defined. However, due to Item IX (a) of the Protocol such payments are treated as royalties only if they are "based on production, sales, performance, or any other similar basis related to the use of the said equipment". Where this is not the case, the payment is deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.
    *   Likewise, payments for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience come within the definition of royalties. However, Item IX (b) of the Protocol negates the application of Article 14 apply.
    *   If a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses, and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.
*   Paragraph 5: The comments relating to paragraph 6 of the Dividend Article apply equally here, except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties, provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on cultural royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payment does not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.
*   Paragraph 6 and   7: The comments in paragraphs 7 and   8 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Income from Alienation of Property

*   Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of real property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of the Netherlands sells at a profit a real property situated in New Zealand, the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.
*   Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of personal property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
*   Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State where the effective management of the enterprise is situated.
*   Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable only in the State in which the alienator is a resident.
*   Paragraph 5 contains provision for a State to tax income or gains from the alienation of shares in a company for a period of five years after the individual recipient of the income has ceased to be a resident of that State. This is a measure against tax avoidance inserted at the Netherlands request.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

*   This Article concerns income from professional services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence, unless attributable to a fixed base regularly available to the taxpayer in the other State. The term "fixed-base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.
*   The Article does not apply to artistes and athletes who are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

*   Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in the other Contracting State only if the services are performed in the other Contracting State.
*   Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:
    *   the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year,
    *   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State,
    *   the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.
*   _Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Netherlands tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of the Netherlands for the purposes of Netherlands tax._
*   Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State in which the place of effective management of the shipping or airline enterprise is situated. his means that if the place of effective management of the enterprise is in the Netherlands then the Netherlands has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Netherlands tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees and other Remuneration

Under Netherlands commercial law there are two types of Directors, viz. Bestuurder (Manager) and Commissaris (Director). There is only one contract to cover both fees and other remuneration, and the two are not separable. Therefore this article covers both directors' fees and directors remuneration. In other circumstances the latter would normally fall under Article 15 Dependent Personal Services.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

*   Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.
*   Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself, but to another person. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted, or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:
    *   (a) because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
    *   (b) in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

### Article 18 - Pensions

*   Paragraph 1 gives the state of residence exclusive rights to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 3. This means that a Netherlands Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand may also be taxed in the Netherlands if the individual is not also a national of New Zealand. Protocol Item X restricts the term "pensions and other similar remuneration" to include only periodical payments.
*   Paragraph 2 defines annuity.

### Article 19 - Government Service

*   This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:
    *   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual, may be taxed in that State.
    *   However, such remuneration shall be taxed exclusively in the other State if the services are rendered in that State by an individual who is a resident of that State, AND who is also a national of that State or did not become a resident of that State solely for the purposes of rendering those services.

*   The second situation can be illustrated as follows:
    *   Remuneration paid by the Netherlands Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Netherlands Government.

*   Paragraph 2 deals with Government pensions including social security pensions. (See explanation to Article 18 in this supplement.

*   Paragraphs 1 and   2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 18 for pensions.

### Article 20 - Professors and Teachers

Under paragraph 1, a Netherlands teacher or professor is exempt from New Zealand tax on his income from carrying out teaching or scientific research in New Zealand if:

*   he visits New Zealand for not more than two years;
*   he is or was a resident of the Netherlands immediately before visiting New Zealand;
*   his visit is solely for the purpose of teaching or scientific research.

The same rules apply conversely to a resident of New Zealand visiting the Netherlands for the same purpose.

Paragraph 2 sets out the condition that for paragraph 1 to apply the research must be undertaken in the public interest and not for the private benefit of a specific person or persons.

### Article 21 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax, maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business apprentice from the Netherlands. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of the Netherlands immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to the Netherlands.

### Article 22 - Elimination of Double Taxation

This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

### Article 23 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 24 - Exchange of Information

These are standard articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 25 - Diplomatic and Consular Privileges

*   The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements. Paragraph 2 establishes that the sending State is to be the State of residence for members of diplomatic or consular missions provided they are regarded as residents under the domestic law of that State.
*   Paragraph 3 ensures that international organisations, organs or officials, or members of a diplomatic mission of a third State, who are liable in one of the Contracting States in respect only of income from sources therein, shall not have the benefit of the convention.

### Article 26 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard article and requires no further comment.

### Article 27 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the convention will take effect in New Zealand for any income year which commenced on or after 1 April 1979 and in the Netherlands for taxable years and periods which commenced on or after 1 January 1979.

### Article 28 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol deals with those items where some further explanation is required of points not covered in the Article concerned. The main points are explained earlier in this supplement on an Article by Article basis.

Dr Muir’s summary judgment appeal dismissed in long-standing 'trinity' dispute
==============================================================================

The appellant in these proceedings, Dr Garry Albert Muir appealed the High Court decision of Associate Judge Bell granting summary judgment in favour of the respondent, the CIR.

Case

Garry Albert Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZCA 129

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 3, 109, 138D, 138P, 138I and 142F; High Court Rules 2016 r 15.1

### Summary

The appellant in these proceedings, Dr Garry Albert Muir (“Dr Muir”) appealed the High Court decision of Associate Judge Bell (in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Muir_ \[2017\] NZHC 1413, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-019) granting summary judgment in favour of the respondent, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”). The summary judgment application consisted of unpaid income taxes, interest and penalties for the years ended 31 March 1997 to 31 March 2010 totalling $8,179,830.94. The Court dismissed Dr Muir’s appeal.

### Impact

It is a decision for the Court, where there are collateral proceedings seeking to challenge an assessment, whether to proceed with summary judgment or adjourn until the collateral proceedings are resolved.

### Facts

The tax assessments arise out of a scheme (more commonly known as the 'trinity scheme') devised by Dr Muir. Under the scheme, Dr Muir invested in a loss-attributing qualifying company Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd ("Redcliffe"). Redcliffe claimed substantial deductions under subpart EG of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA"), that it passed onto Dr Muir. Dr Muir offset these deductions against his taxable income which were subsequently disallowed by the Commissioner.

Dr Muir had previously challenged the Commissioner';s assessments with the courts on the whole, upholding the Commissioner';s position. On the basis he had exhausted his challenge rights, the Commissioner sought summary judgment for unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. Summary judgment was subsequently granted on 23 June 2017 and the subject of this appeal.

Dr Muir contended that AJ Bell exceeded his jurisdiction on the summary judgment application. He argued:

Only a hearing authority as defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") can determine if there are extant challenge proceedings under Part 8A (the challenge provisions) of the TAA.

If the Court of Appeal found the amended claims could be filed, then the effect of AJ Bell's decision is to find payable tax which the hearing authority is charged with determining _de novo_.

Dr Muir further contended that the earlier courts proceeded on the mistaken basis that the trinity scheme continued in existence after 2009 when it had not.

### Decision

_Did the Associate Judge exceed his jurisdiction by entering summary judgment for Dr Muir?_

The Court (reasons given by Mallon J) did not accept that Associate Judge Bell exceeded his jurisdiction. The Court noted that the arguable defence Dr Muir raised to the summary judgment was that his challenge proceedings had not been finally determined. The Court noted that AJ Bell was considering whether it was reasonably arguable that Dr Muir's challenge proceedings were at an end following the Supreme Court's decision of 26 August 2016 (_Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZSC 113, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-067 at \[11\]).

The Court did not accept Dr Muir's arguments regarding challenge proceedings and his reliance on _Tannadyce Investment Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 ("_Tannadyce_"). Mallon J noted that _Tannadyce_ was about bringing and determining challenge proceedings, and further about what a taxpayer must do if he or she wishes to challenge an assessment.

Mallon J noted that AJ Bell's decision did not determine any challenge proceeding or make any procedural or preliminary decisions ahead of a determination on challenge proceedings. AJ Bell found that the challenge proceedings had been finally determined by the courts (that had jurisdiction). AJ Bell, therefore found, in his summary judgment jurisdiction on the Commissioner's debt recovery proceeding, that the due date for payment of the tax had passed and the tax remained unpaid.

_Timing issues_

Mallon J noted at \[34\] that there could be 'potential timing difficulty' because summary judgment had been heard in advance of the decisions of Toogood and Jagose JJ and any appeal from those decisions.

Despite this, Mallon J went on to state that the Court would have dismissed Dr Muir's appeal from the Associate Judge's decision on the basis that an Associate Judge can decide whether challenge proceedings have been finally determined by a hearing authority.

Mallon J further stated at \[36\] that it was 'ultimately a matter of judgment' for the Associate Judge on whether to grant an adjournment of the summary judgment application and Associate

Judge Bell was entitled to make an assessment of the prospects of the outstanding proceedings in the High Court when deciding to refuse an adjournment.

"He was not required to grant an adjournment if his assessment was that a final determination had been made and further proceedings were not permitted."

Appealed
1 Consultation on R&D Tax Incentive guidance to reflect proposed legislative changes This document consults on draft R&D Tax Incentive guidance related to changes proposed in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The draft guidance is based on the Bill as introduced and will be updated to reflect feedback and changes made during the legislative process. The Finance and Expenditure Select Committee received a significant volume of submissions on the first 2 items listed below which may result in change during further consideration of the Bill. The topics covered are: •changes to the eligibility of organisations which receive exempt income •changes to the refundability rules •changes related to the internal software development definition. Please provide any fe edback on the Loomio forum at govt.loomio.nz/rdtaxcredit or by email to R+Dincentive@ird.govt.nz If the feedback is to be considered for inclusion in the next update, please provide it by 11 February 2020. 2 Refunding R&D tax credits Legislative reference and policy intent Income Tax Act 2007 Section CW 9, CW 10, LA 5, LA 6 and subpart MX Refundability is intended to ensure that all claimants doing R&D are able to benefit from their R&D tax credits soon after the year their R&D takes place in. Without refundability, some claimants may not be able to benefit from their credits until a much later date (if at all, depending on the circumstances of each claimant). In year 1 (the 2019-20 income year), limited refundability rules were introduced to enable some firms to access refundable credits. These rules were taken from the existing R&D tax loss cash-out regime, because tight timeframes meant there was not enough time to develop broader refundability rules. The Government committed to reviewing the refundability rules so that broader refundability would be available from year 2 of the incentive (the 2020-21 income year). From year 2 (2020-21), it's proposed that the limited refundability rules be replaces with a new refundability cap, and that the existing corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria (from the R&D tax loss cash-out) be removed. These proposals are intended to make the credit more broadly accessible, while still ensuring the integrity of the R&D tax credit regime. Refundability from 2020-21 From the 2020-21 income year onwards, you may be able to get an R&D tax credit refund, subject to the proposed new refundability cap, if you are in a tax loss position or your R&D tax credits exceed your income tax liability for that income year. If you want to receive refundable credits, you must also make sure you do not have any other outstandi ng tax to pay. The proposed cap replaces the current refundability cap of $255,000, allowing you to claim refundable R&D tax credits for your total eligible R&D expenditure, up to the maximum eligible expenditure amount of $120 million. Proposed new cap It's proposed that th e total amount of R&D tax credits you can receive as a refund is limited to a cap based on the am ount of labour-related taxes paid by your business. The cap includes any PAYE (which includes withholding tax on schedular payments), FBT (fringe benefit tax), and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) you pay for the relevant income year. C alculating your refund You can only get refundable credit s if your R&D tax credits exceed your income tax liability for the relevant income year (for example, if you're in a tax loss position). Any surplus credits you have can be refunded, up to your refundability cap for the relevant income year. If your credits exceed your refundability cap, then any credits above your cap cannot be refunded in that year but can be carried forward to the next income year provided you meet the shareholder continuity requirements - refer to K. Receiving your R&D tax credit at g ovt.loomio.nz/rdtaxcredit 3 Example: Refunding credits under the refundability cap In the year ended 31 March 2021, EmmaCorp has eligible R&D expenditure of $1 million, so it is eligible for $150,000 of R&D tax credits. The company has 12 employees and pays a total of $200,000 in labour related taxes (this amount is EmmaCorp's refundability cap). EmmaCorp has no income tax to pay in the 2020-21 income year. Because its R&D tax credits ($150,000) are less than its refundability cap ($200,000) for the year, EmmaCorp can receive a refund of all its R&D tax credits. Variation of facts: Insufficient labour-related taxes paid to refund all claimed credits If EmmaCorp had only 6 employees and paid a total of $100,000 in labour-related taxes for the year, it would have a refundability cap of $100,000. Only $100,000 of its R&D tax credits would be refundable. EmmaCorp meets the shareholder continuity requirements, so the remaining $50,000 of R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the 2021-22 income year. Cap can include taxes paid by controller or group companies The refundability cap has grouping rules, which allow certain companies to allocate labour-related taxes they have paid to other companies they control or that sit within the same wholly-owned group. The formula for calculating the refundability cap is: Own payroll + other wholly-owned payroll + other controller payroll - double-dip allocation Term Definition Own payroll The labour-related taxes paid by a claimant for the relevant tax year. Other wholly- owned payroll The total labour-related taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a member of the claimant’s wholly-owned group for the relevant tax year. Other controller payroll The total labour-related taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a company that controls the claimant for the relevant tax year. Double-dip allocation Any amounts allocated to a claimant that have already been allocated to another person. This prevents the same taxes going towards more than 1 claimant’s refundability cap. 4 Example: Grouping rules Misto Labs is an R&D-intensive firm eligible for $400,000 of R&D tax credits in the 2020-21 income year. It is in a tax loss position. Its refundability cap is made up of the following amounts: Misto's refundability cap for the 2020-21 income year Formula component Amount Explanation Own payroll $75,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Misto this year. Other wholly-owned payroll $100,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Zeus Industries this year. Zeus is a company in the same wholly-owned group as Misto. Zeus has $200,000 of its own labour-related taxes but allocates $100,000 to Misto. Other controller payroll $100,000 Total PAYE, ESCT and FBT by ZigCo this year. ZigCo controls Misto and holds 65% of the shares in Misto. Double-dip allocation ($0) No amounts allocated to Misto by Zeus or ZigCo have been used by, or allocated to, other businesses for the purposes of calculating a refundability cap. Misto's total cap $275,000 Since Misto has a refundability cap of $275,000, it can obtain an R&D tax credit refund for $275,000 of its credits. Its remaining $125,000 of R&D tax credits are non-refundable in the 2020-21 income year. Misto can carry these non-refundable credits forward to the 2021-22 income year provided it satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. Example: Grouping rules with double-dip allocation Same facts as the previous example, except ZigCo claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits, half of which it offsets against its income tax payable. As with the previous example, ZigCo has paid $100,000 of PAYE, ESCT and FBT for the year. ZigCo indicates in its supplementary return that it has a refundability cap of $50,000, and so receives an R&D tax credit refund of its remaining $50,000 of credits. Despite this, ZigCo informs Misto that it will allocate $100,000 of labour-related taxes to Misto. Because ZigCo has already used $50,000 of its own labour-related taxes for its refundability cap, the double-dip allocation rules apply. Misto's refundability cap for the 2020-21 income year (fact variation) Formula component Amount Explanation Own payroll $75,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Misto this year. Other wholly-owned payroll $100,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Zeus Industries this year. Zeus is a company in the same wholly-owned group as Misto. Zeus has $200,000 of its own labour-related taxes but allocates $100,000 to Misto. Other controller payroll $100,000 Total PAYE, ESCT and FBT by ZigCo this year. ZigCo controls Misto and holds 65% of the shares in Misto. Double-dip allocation ($50,000) ZigCo has allocated $100,000 to Misto, of which it has already used $50,000 for its own refundability cap. The same amount of tax can only go towards one person’s refundability cap, so the $50,000 already used by ZigCo must not be included in Misto’s cap. Misto's total cap $225,000 $50,000 is subtracted from Misto's refundability cap, because this amount has already been included in ZigCo's cap. As a result, after deducting the double-dip allocation amount, Misto's refundability cap is $225,000. 5 Levy bodies and expenditure on approved research providers There are 2 exceptions to the refundability cap. The cap does not restrict refunds for either: •eligible expenditure on approved research providers •claims made by levy bodies. Example: Credits paid to levy bodies fully refundable Levy Body A (LBA) is an industry organisation to which levies are payable under the Commodity Levies Act1990. LBA incurred $1 million of eligible R&D expenditure in the year ended 31 March 2021. It has no income tax liability and pays $50,000 of labour-related taxes for the year. LBA receives a full refund of its $150,000 R&D tax credits, because the refundability cap does not apply to levy body researchers. Levy Body A - 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure $1 million x 15% R&D tax credits claimed $150,000 Income tax liabi lity $0 R&D tax credits refunded $150,000 6 Exclusion of entities which derive exempt income Legislative reference and policy intent Income Tax Act 2007 LA 5(4B), LY 3(2)(f), LY 8(2B), CW 9, CW 10 and YA 1 The rationale behind this exclusion is that tax exempt entities sit outside the tax system, so should not benefit from incentives provided from within the tax system. Charities, which come within the tax-exempt entity exclusion, do not pay income tax, and receive additional Government support in the form of GST concessions, and exemption from FBT, and the donor tax credit regime. A carve-in exists for levy bodies and claimants whose only exempt income if from foreign or intercompany dividends under section CW 9 or 10. Claimants who receive exempt dividend income will typically be businesses, and these businesses fund R&D performed by the levy bodies for their benefit, so levy body R&D is fundamentally business R&D. Some entities which receive tax exempt income do not wholly sit outside the tax system and may conduct eligible R&D. To allow such entities to claim the credit, broader association rules have not been included in the scope of this exclusion. This allows these entities to set up non-tax exempt subsidiary businesses through which the can claim the credit. From the 2020-21 income year, it is proposed that if you are an entity which derives tax-exempt income, you will be ineligible for the R&D tax credit regime, unless you are a levy body or your only exempt income is from foreign or intercompany dividends under section CW 9 or 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Any R&D tax credits received in year 1 by an entity which is ineligible on these grounds cannot be refunded in year 2, nor can these be carried forward to year 2. These credits will be extinguished from the beginning of year 2. Example: Charity's year 1 credits extinguished In the year ended 31 March 2020, Charity X claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits. As Charity X does not pay income tax, it has no income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. It is not eligible for refundability, because Charity X receives exempt income. Charity X has a standard 31 March balance date. Its $100,000 of R&D tax credits form year 1 cannot be refunded in year 1 and cannot be brought forward to year 2. They are extinguished from 1 April 2020. Charity X also ceases to be eligible for the R&D tax credit from this date. A carve-in exists for levy bodies and claimants whose only exempt income is from foreign or intercompany dividends under section CW 9 or 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This exclusion of entities which derive tax exempt income does not include broader association rules in relation to entities excluded for deriving tax-exempt income. Therefore, a subsidiary taxpaying business is not ineligible for the credit merely because it is owned by an entity which derives tax-exempt income. Example: Subsidiary not ineligible because its parent derives exempt income Charitech is a charity which performs R&D to support its charitable work. It performs R&D on adapting traditional plant medicines so that they can be used alongside modern medicine to achieve better health outcomes. Charitech would like to claim the R&D tax credit for its R&D in the 2020-21 income year, but because it derives exempt income it is ineligible to claim the credit in its own right. Charitech establishes a subsidiary company and shifts its R&D activities, so that the activities are performed by the subsidiary instead. The subsidiary does not derive any exempt income, so is not excluded from the credit through the exempt income exclusion. Assuming the subsidiary satisfies the other R&D tax credit eligibility criteria, it will be able to claim the credit, even though its parent organisation receives exempt income. 7 Internal software development Legislative reference and policy intent Income Tax Act 2007 Section YA 1 (definitions of internal software development expenditure and ineligible internal software development), Schedule 21 Parts A and B Clause 11 and Schedule 21B Part B Clause 16 The policy intent is for there to be 3 categories of software development under the R&D tax credit rules, with different treatment for each of the categories. Type of software development Policy intent Internal software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration Ineligible for the tax credit Other internal software development Capped limit at $25 million of eligible expenditure External software development (software developed for the main purpose of sale, or as an integral part of goods that are sold) Eligible for the tax credit and uncapped limit The rationale for excluding or limiting claims for internal software development is the fiscal risk and limited spill-over benefits associated with internal software development activities. Internal administration exclusion Internal software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration is ineligible for the incentive. This is because there is likely to be limited public benefit from such activities. An example of software development this exclusion would apply to is a firm upgrading its internal HR system. Other internal software development All other software development, such as software development that enhances non-digital services to customers or enhances a business's manufacturing capability, is subject to an expenditure cap of $25 million. This kind of software development is not excluded, because it has an external focus or element. Therefore, the spill-over benefits associated with this type of software development are wider than the benefits associated with activities subject to the internal administration exclusion. Projects to upgrade internal business processes can be very expensive in some industries. The Government is cautious about the fiscal consequences of including these activities within the scope of the R&D tax credit regimes. The internal administration exclusion and the $25 million cap are both aimed at reducing this potential fiscal risk. Proposed amendment to the internal software development rules The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes to clarify which software development activities are excluded, capped, or completely uncapped under the R&D tax credit rules. This clarification is proposed because it may be unclear how the current rules apply to operational internal software development expenditure. It is possible that under the rules as currently enacted, operational internal software development expenditure is either completely ineligible (under the internal administration exclusion) or is uncapped as it does not clearly come within the $25 million cap. The policy intent is for software development expenditure to come within the $25 million cap if it is not: •subject to the internal administration exclusion •developed for the main purpose of sale, or as an integral part of goods that are sold (external software development). 8 We have chosen to present the proposed new rules for internal software development as a whole, rather than presenting the changes in isolation. This is to allow readers to get a full picture of how it is intended that the rules will work. It is proposed that any amendments to the rules will apply from the 2019-2020 income year. Internal administration exclusion If you develop software for the purpose of the internal administration of your business (or an associate's business - as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 subpart YB), any expenditure you incur that relates to that development is not eligible for the R&D tax credit. The purposes of internal administration include, but are not limited to: •payroll •accounting •executive or management information •human resources •customer relationship management •enterprise resource planning •purchasing •invoicing •inventory systems. This exclusion covers both core and supporting activities. However, software development in excluded areas may still be eligible for the tax credit, if they are developed with an external focus (so would be considered external software development instead). Example: Software developed for internal administrative use GeneriCo is working on improving its inventory processes in its warehouses around the country. It developes new software which resolves technological uncertainty in managing its inventory. Because this software was developed entirely for internal administrative purposes, it is excluded from eligibility for the tax credit. Variation of facts: Developed for sale If GeneriCo were developing its inventory software primarily for sale to other companies, rather than for internal use, it may be eligible for the tax credit (as this expenditure could be considered external software development expenditure instead). Software development subject to the $25 million cap A $25 million cap applies to all other software developed for internal purposes. This means that you can only claim $25 million of expenditure on this kind of software development in your income year, regardless of how much you have actually spent - this equals a maximum tax credit of $3.75 million. The cap applies to software developed for internal purposes unrelated to administration. This includes such purposes as manufacturing, testing, quality control, or enhancing non-digital services to customers. The cap groups your expenditure with internal software development expenditure claimed by your associates, so the total you can claim combined is limited to $25 million. This is to prevent businesses from artificially splitting up their internal software development activities to get around the cap. You will be required to tick a box on your supplementary return indicating if an associate is intending to or has made a claim for the tax credit. This will trigger personal contact from us to ensure that together your claimed expenditure on internal software development does not exceed $25 million. If you and your associate are claiming for different parts of the same R&D project, you will need to set out what part each associate is claiming for an ensure no expenditure has been claimed twice. 9 Example: Software developed for non-administrative internal purposes Eugene works for a manufacturing company developing shatter-resistant glass for car windscreens. He develops software that can track stresses on the glass during impact testing in very fine details, increasing the quality of the testing process. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, as the software being developed is solely for internal use in improving the quality of the testing process. As it is unrelated to back office administrative purposes, the expenditure Eugene's business incurred to develop the software is eligible - however, it is subject to the $25 million cap. Internal software that enhances non-digital services to customers A service is a non-digital service if the main reason why your customers uses the service is to obtain a service other than the use of your software (even though that service may be enabled, supported or facilitated by computer or software technology). Software which is not being developed for sale or licence, but which is intended to enhance non-digital services to customers, is considered internal software and is covered by the $25 million cap. Example: Software that enhances non-digital services to customers Mohammad runs a courier business and develops software that enables his customers to pinpoint the exact location and condition of their packages. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, because Mohammad's customers are using his services to receive the goods he delivers (a non-digital service), not to use the software Mohammad has developed. The expenditure Mohammad's business incurred to develop the software is subject to the $25 million cap. External software development External software development is not subject to the $25 million cap. The normal expenditure rules apply. There are 2 types of external software development. Software that is sold If you develop software with the main purpose of disposing of it to someone not associated with you, then it is considered external software development and not subject to the $25 million cap. Software that is an integral part of goods that are sold Software you develop that forms an integral part of goods that you sell in your business is also considered to be external software development, and not subject to the $25 million cap. This exception is targeted at firmware - such as software that runs inside a washing machine or TV remote. Purpose behind your software development Your purpose at the time you develop your software determines what test you fall under. For example, if you develop your software for the purpose of internal administration and then later decide to sell it, this software would still be classified as ineligible internal software development and therefore excluded. If you develop software with the purpose of both internal use and sale, it will depend on your main purpose at the time you developed it. If your main purpose was internal purposes other than administration it will be subject to the $25 million cap, or, if intended for internal administration purposes, it will be ineligible. If your main purpose was to sell the software, it will be external software development and not subject to the $25 million cap.

Drafting convention for the numbering of inserted provisions
============================================================

An explanation of the drafting convention for the numbering of inserted provisions in the Taxation Acts.

### The convention

#### Provisions inserted at end of sequence

If a statute is amended by inserting provisions after an existing provision that has the last number in a sequence, and the inserted provisions are numbered by reference to that existing provision, the inserted provisions are numbered so as to continue the sequence.

For example, if subsection (5) is the last subsection in a section, new sections inserted after subsection (5) are inserted as subsections (6), (7), (8) and so on. Similarly, new paragraphs inserted between existing paragraphs (cb) and (d) in a subsection are inserted as paragraphs (cc), (cd), (ce) and so forth.

#### Provisions inserted within or before sequence

If a statute is amended by inserting provisions between two existing, sequentially numbered provisions, or before the beginning of an existing sequence of provisions -

1.  provisions numbered by reference to the existing provision that they follow are numbered by adding "b", "c", "d", "e" and so on, or "B", "C", "D", "E" and so on, to the number of that existing provision;
2.  provisions numbered by reference to the existing provision that they precede are numbered by adding "a", "ab", "ac", "ad" and so on, or "A", "AB", "AC", "AD" and so on, to the number of that existing provision.

For example, new sections inserted between sections 3 and 4 of an Act are inserted as sections 3B, 3C, 3D and so on. Similarly, new paragraphs inserted between paragraphs (cb) and (cc) in a subsection are inserted as paragraphs (cbb), (cbc), (cbd) and so on. Note that in these examples no section 3A or paragraph (cba) is inserted; a section 3A would precede section 3 and a paragraph (cba) would precede paragraph (cb).

On the other hand, new paragraphs inserted before paragraph (a) of a subsection are inserted as paragraphs (aa), (aab), (aac) and so on. Similarly, new subsections inserted between subsections (3) and (3B) in a section are inserted as subsections (3BA), (3BAB), (3BAC) and so on. Note that in these examples no paragraph (ab) or subsection (3BB) is inserted; under the preceding part of the convention, a paragraph (ab) would follow paragraph (a) and a subsection (3BB) would follow subsection (3B).

### Comment

Taxation Acts are regularly amended by the insertion of new provisions. An inserted provision, or sequence of provisions, must be numbered in a way that identifies its position in the principal Act. Provisions that are inserted into New Zealand statutes are numbered by adding a letter to the number of an existing provision that the inserted provision follows or precedes. The convention described above is based on existing New Zealand drafting practice, with two variations of that practice for the purposes of systematic consistency.

##### Use of "A" or "a" as a suffix

The first, and more significant, variation relates to a restriction on the use of "A" or "a" as a numbering suffix. This suffix has been used by drafters to indicate the first in a sequence of inserted provisions. Thus, new sections inserted between sections 3A and 3B of an Act have been numbered 3AA, 3AB, 3AC and so on. There has, however, been no standard way of indicating whether the new provisions have been inserted before or after a provision. Thus, new sections inserted between sections 3 and 3A of an Act can also be numbered 3AA, 3AB, 3AC and so forth.

As a result, if the provisions of an Act are numbered as sections 1, 2, 3, 3A, 3AA, 3AB, 3AC, 3B, 4 and so on, there is currently no standard way of numbering new provisions that are to be inserted between sections 3 and 3A. The solution to the problem, in the absence of a systematic convention, is to use the numbers 3AAA, 3AAB, 3AAC and so on. Such an approach merely postpones the further problems of numbering provisions that later may be inserted between sections 3A and 3AA and provisions that later may be inserted between sections 3AA and 3AB. In addition, users of the Act cannot infer the order in which provisions appear in the Act from the numbering of those provisions; the relative position of the provisions depends on the order in which they have been inserted.

The variation that has been adopted to avoid such a situation is to use "A" or "a" as a suffix for new provisions that are numbered by reference to the existing provision before which they are inserted. The other letters of the alphabet are used as suffixes for new provisions that are numbered by reference to the existing provision after which they are inserted.

Under the convention, then, provisions numbered "xB", "xC","xD" and so on are provisions that are inserted after provision "x" with numbers that at the time of insertion are equivalent to "x-plus-1", "x-plus-2", "x-plus-3" and so on. A provision numbered "xA" can be thought of as having at the time of insertion a number equivalent to "x-minus-1", subject to the next variation.

##### Use of "AB", "AC", etc., or "ab", "ac", and so on as suffixes

The second variation is a consequence of the first variation. It relates to the use of "AB", "AC" and so on, or "ab", "ac" and so on as numbering suffixes. These suffixes are used to indicate provisions that are inserted after a provision for which "A" or "a" is used for the suffix. The variation is necessary because the suffixes "B", "C", and so on, and "b", "c" and so on are reserved for provisions inserted elsewhere.

Under the convention, if the provisions of an Act are numbered as sections 1, 2, 3, 3B, 3BB, 3BC, 3BD, 3C, 4 and so on, new provisions that are to be inserted between sections 3 and 3B are numbered 3BA, 3BAB, 3BAC and so on. New provisions that are inserted between sections 3B and 3BB are numbered 3BBA, 3BBAB, 3BBAC and so on. Provisions that are inserted between sections 3BB and 3BC are numbered 3BBB, 3BBC and so on. Provisions that are inserted between sections 3BD and 3C are numbered 3BE, 3BF, 3BG and so on.

The numbering is systematic and does not depend on the order in which insertions are made.

##### Advantages and disadvantages

The systematic nature of the numbering convention is a major advantage for drafters and, it is suggested, for users of the taxation Acts.

A minor disadvantage is the extra number of letters in some suffixes that result from the second variation. Drafters consider that this result does not outweigh the advantages of the approach.

A possible disadvantage of the convention is that users of taxation Acts may be confused by the first variation because they will not know whether or not there is a provision between, say, paragraphs (a) and (ab). The purpose of this item is to inform users of the convention that produces such a result and of the justification for the convention.

Users who do not read this item are most likely to be using a commercial publisher's annotated version of the taxation Act, as consolidated by the publisher.

Excluded entities and accounts
------------------------------

The CRS automatically excludes a number of types of entities and accounts as being non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts.

The CRS also allows implementing jurisdictions such as New Zealand to expand on the list of automatically excluded non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts to also include other 'low risk' excluded entities and accounts that meet stringent criteria set out in the CRS. This means these entities and/or accounts would be excluded from due diligence and reporting obligations.

To be considered a 'low risk' entity or account, the financial institution must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a determination.

[Common Reporting Standard (Tax Technical)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/browse-determinations)

Submissions are welcome from financial institutions that are not otherwise excluded, but that meet these criteria and wish to be included in both or one of the following lists.

*   Excluded non-reporting financial institutions.
*   Excluded accounts - for accounts they maintain.

Send submissions to:

Duplicative claims struck out, security for costs ordered
=========================================================

2014 case note – duplicative claims struck out and security for costs ordered - duplication of process, abuse of process, vexatious.

Case

Peter William Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 1554

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") successfully had a new cause of action struck out of the pleading because it was duplicative of other proceedings and an abuse of process. The Forest Trust was ordered to pay security for costs, as it had provided no evidence that it would be able to satisfy a costs order should it prove unsuccessful on its claims.

### Impact of decision

The Court will entertain applications to strike pleadings (or portions of pleadings) when they are duplicative of other proceedings and/or an abuse of process.

### Facts

This decision relates to interlocutory applications by the Commissioner to strike out parts of Mr Mawhinney's second amended statement of claim and for security for costs.

The underlying dispute involves a claim for a goods and services tax ("GST") refund of $67,011.65 relating to the Forest Trust's ("the Trust") purchase of a property for $600,000 in 2009, which the Commissioner had reassessed to nil under section 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

On 12 July 2012, Mr Mawhinney filed a statement of claim of 88 pages, containing claims for 19 separate breaches of statutory duty; a claim for money had and received; and claims for six breaches of duty of care. Mr Mawhinney sought damages and/or compensation of $5,113,810.72.

In December 2013, Mr Mawhinney filed an amended statement of claim of 156 pages that included an additional cause of action alleging statutory entitlement and also purported to include an application for judicial review (despite the fact he had separately filed a proceeding for judicial review of the same decisions made by the Commissioner).

In February 2014, Mr Mawhinney filed his second amended statement of claim of 188 pages that included an additional, fourth cause of action purporting to be a challenge under Part 8A of the TAA.

The strike-out application concerned the new fourth cause of action.

### Decision

The fourth cause of action was struck out and the application for security for costs in the sum of $40,000 was granted. The proceeding was to be stayed until that payment is lodged with the Court.

#### _Strike-out application_

The causes of action the Commissioner sought to have struck out were:

*   a challenge to the Commissioner's reassessment of GST to nil for the period ended 31 July 2009;
*   her decision that section 89C(eb) of the TAA provided grounds, function and power for the Commissioner to reassess the amount of GST to nil;
*   her decision to accept that output tax was payable on the sale of the property at issue, while refusing the input tax refund on the same sale; and
*   the Commissioner's failure to issue a challenge notice under section 89(P) of the TAA for the GST period ended 31 July 2009.

Mr Mawhinney argued that if he supplied information in support of GST refund claims, then his assessment must be accepted if the Commissioner takes no action within 15 working days after receipt of that information.

The Commissioner's position was that:

*   she had retained refunds for seven GST periods for which she gave valid notices that she would withhold payment under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985;
*   she offset refunds due for other tax periods; and
*   for the GST period ended 31 July 2009, she validly amended the self-assessed amount of $67,011.65 to nil under section 89C(eb) of the TAA.

Mr Mawhinney contended that the disputes process under Part 4A of the TAA had concluded. He submitted that due to the Commissioner's failure to comply with time constraints, a GST refund is deemed payable by the Commissioner to the Trust.

However, the Court found that the disputes process was still underway, with the Trust's matter in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") stayed, pending the Court of Appeal's decision on Mr Mawhinney's appeal of the determination of the judicial review in the Commissioner's favour (by Cooper J on 23 December 2014). Thus, the fourth cause of action was a duplication of process.

The Court further held that if it was Mr Mawhinney's position that he retains access to challenge under Part 8A (as opposed to the Part 4A dispute access) then he faces a nearly insurmountable obstacle by virtue of what the Supreme Court said in the _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158 ("_Tannadyce_") case:

*   In summary therefore we would hold that disputable decisions (which include assessments) may not be challenged by way of judicial review unless the tax payer cannot practically invoke the relevant statutory procedure. Cases of that kind are likely to be extremely rare. \[61\]

The Court concluded that Mr Mawhinney's fourth cause of action does not by any measure qualify itself as being of the rare kind envisioned by the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce_, and thus should be struck out.

The Court further held that the fourth cause of action was prima facie vexatious because it concerns precisely those issues already subject to consideration in other pending litigation. The Court found the fourth cause of action was a duplication of process and an abuse of process, because Mr Mawhinney was attempting to relitigate a matter already determined, while duplicating the proceedings already underway pursuant to the disputes process.

#### _Security for costs application_

The Commissioner sought, as security for costs, $40,000 and for the proceeding to be stayed until the sum is paid or security given.

The Commissioner argued that the cost of defending the litigation is unjustified, particularly as it is overly complicated and unnecessarily protracted and the Trust will be unable to pay costs if unsuccessful.

It was not challenged that the Trust has inadequate resources to meet any costs. However, Mr Mawhinney opposed costs saying that he personally would be able to meet those costs, and furthermore, in his view, the claim has a very strong prospect of success.

The Court found there was no clear reason to believe costs could be paid if the claims are unsuccessful. It was not sufficient for Mr Mawhinney to claim he would meet costs.

While the Court did not attempt an overall assessment of the claims as to the merits, it noted that in a prior decision on Mr Mawhinney's summary judgment claim, Bell J found that the Commissioner had an arguable defence to the claims. The Court also noted that a number of Mr Mawhinney's pleaded causes of action face significant hurdles.

The Court reviewed the Commissioner's calculations of attendances in connection with the trial and came to the opinion that should the Commissioner succeed in due course, costs to be awarded would exceed the sum of $40,000 by a comfortable margin.

Early childhood education (ECE) and Kōhanga Reo providers
=========================================================

ECE and Kōhanga Reo providers can give caregivers invoices or quarterly statements to help them claim FamilyBoost.

Quarterly statements are:

*   for FamilyBoost only
*   easier for caregivers to upload
*   not a replacement for your usual invoices.
*   optional

FamilyBoost is based on fees charged rather than fees paid. Optional charges and service fees relating to the education and care of the child should be included.

Invoices and quarterly statements
---------------------------------

Invoices and quarterly FamilyBoost statements both need to show the following information about your ECE or Kōhanga Reo:

*   name
*   service address
*   licence number
*   GST number (if registered).

They will also need to show the:

*   full name of the caregiver
*   full name(s) of the child or children
*   date it was issued
*   start and end date of the period covered by the fees
*   the final amount invoiced after any other subsidies, discounts or donations (for example, ‘total net fees for the period’).

### Quarterly statement requirements

Quarterly FamilyBoost statements also need to show:

*   the statement number or unique identifier
*   that it is a quarterly statement.

You can add a reference like, 'Quarterly statement', and a date reference like, ‘1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024’.

### Invoice requirements

Invoices also need to show the invoice number.

You can keep including other information on your invoices.

This will not affect the caregiver’s FamilyBoost claim. 

#### Home-based providers

Invoices for home-based ECE providers need to:

*   include the same details as above
*   be sent by either the service provider or the educator.

If you invoice the caregiver and you are GST-registered, you need to include your GST number. If you are not GST-registered, you do not need to include this.

If you are an educator and do not have your own licence number, you need to include the name and licence number of the service provider you contract through.

#### School term invoices

If you invoice on a term basis, you’ll need to send out a separate invoice for each FamilyBoost quarter. 

For example, if term 2 starts on Monday 29 April and ends on Friday 5 July 2024, you should send one invoice for 29 April 2024 to 30 June 2024, and another for 1 July 2024 to 5 July 2024.

### Optional charges and fees

Optional charges and fees to educate and care for the child should be included in your invoices or quarterly statements as part of the early childhood service fees. These costs could be a one-off or ongoing charge. Examples include teaching resources, excursions and entrance fees, building levy, food, nappies, wet bags, clothing, sunscreen, and transport.

Optional charges and fees that are not for the education and care of the child should not be included as fees. Examples include fundraiser purchases, all-day parking leases, goodwill payments and donations.

Early life support
==================

For our first release (Stage 1), we ran a fairly standard Early life support process. The focus was primarily on technical and process support for our people and customers. Early life support ran for 3 months with a 3-week period of enhanced support, called hyper care.

The process worked, but as this was the first time our customers and our people were using the system, the impact on both was high. As a result, for release 2, we made significant changes to the preparation of, and engagement with our customers pre go-live and provided more comprehensive support for our people and customers post go-live.

Pou Whirinaki
-------------

For Release 3, which impacted every New Zealand taxpayer and business as we introduced the automatic individual income tax assessment process for the first time and when payday filing became mandatory for all business, we took a very different approach.

Early life support became just one strand of a support model called Pou Whirinaki (Support you can rely on).

The team was led by the Deputy Commissioner for Integrity and Assurance and the team was made up of programme and business people working together to actively identify and mitigate risks, ensure effective issues resolution, monitor progress through enhanced reporting and coordinate communications, both within the business and out to our customers.

The areas of focus expanded to include:

*   Customers
*   Our people
*   Stakeholders
*   Operations
*   Technology
*   Hypercare/Solution stabilisations.

We improved communications into the organisation and out to customers, letting them know what issues were being managed and where possible, the likely resolution date. This significantly reduced customer contacts and was continued and refined through later releases.

What we learned for future releases
-----------------------------------

We continued to use this model and incorporated lessons learnt into subsequent release support periods.

### Lessons learned from Release 4

The Pou Whirinaki support approach proved effective for managing the support phase of BT Release 4 and ensuring alignment and co-ordination with day-to-day business operations, the introduction and support of new COVID initiatives, the auto-calculation process (individual income tax assessment), peak season and the added complexity of working remotely. Key features which underpinned this were:

*   Clear roles and responsibilities within the support processes, and agreed governance and coordination forums which included all key stakeholders.
*   Leverage of ServiceNow (our support portal), Power BI (a business intelligence tool) and TEAMS (meetings software) as key collaboration tools, enablers of support processes and single sources of truth for information.
*   Time to plan for the support period and adapt the support approaches to the unique needs of the release, and reinstate the support capabilities from the previous release (Release 3).

This enabled a transparent, single source of truth for the current status of the business, customers and the release, to all stakeholders and governance forums to ensure plans remained appropriate and support responses were also appropriate.

Economic rate of depreciation for certain aircraft and motor vehicles
=====================================================================

2006 amendment clarifies the rule covering the setting of depreciation rates for certain aircraft and motor vehicles.

##### Sections EE 25D(2)(cb) and EE 25D (3) of the Income Tax Act 2004

The rule covering the setting of depreciation rates for certain aircraft and motor vehicles has been clarified.

The changes were necessary because they arguably applied to a broader class of motor vehicles and aircraft than was intended. These amendments ensure that only motor vehicles and aircraft that previously had residual values above 13.5 percent of cost can set their depreciation rates under section EE 25D.

Section EE 25D(2)(cb) excludes aircraft used for topdressing or spraying. It is now clear that depreciation rates for aircraft used for these purposes is set under section EE 25B.

Section EE 25D(3) clarifies that the type of motor vehicle that this section applies to are vehicles designed exclusively or mainly to carry people, with seats for no more than 1 people.

The rules apply from the 2005-06 and later income years.

As a point of clarification, the Commissioner remains of the view that the estimated useful life of motor vehicles where the depreciation rate is set under section EE 25D remains five years. For aircraft where the depreciation rate is set under section EE 25D the estimated useful life remains 15 years. The clarification is necessary because estimated useful life is important when taxpayers are having to determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease.

Please quote ED0210 Page 1 IN CONFIDENCE Standard Practice Statement ED 0210 Application of discretion in section 18D(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – an exception to confidentiality Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Act. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice regarding the new confidentiality rule of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”). Application This statement may be cited as “Standard Practice Statement XX/XX: Application of discretion in section 18D(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – an exception to confidentiality” and applies from XX XXXXXX 20XX. I t replaces SPS 11/07: Application of discretion in section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – The secrecy provisions, which is withdrawn. This Standard Practice Statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol XX, No X (........... 201X). All statutory references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless otherwise specified. Summary 1. The secrecy provisions of the TAA were recently amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. The old s 81 secrecy rule was replaced by the new s 18 confidentiality rule. This new rule protects sensitive revenue information from disclosure by Inland Revenue (“IR”) by requiring all revenue officers, being IR staff or people connected with IR work, to keep such information confidential unless disclosure is permitted under ss 18D-18J and schedule 7. Section 18D(2) contains a permitted disclosure that provides IR with a broad discretion to disclose information relating to the Commissioner’s various functions after a EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 2 IN CONFIDENCE number of factors have been considered. This Statement outlines the factors that revenue officers must consider and the process they must follow to ensure there is a consistent approach when exercising the discretion. 2. Section 6 confirms that all IR employees have an on-going duty to protect the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. An important way in which the tax system’s integrity is protected is by IR not disclosing sensitive revenue information it has received about a taxpayer to someone else. C riminal sanctions may be imposed on an IR employee who fails to comply with those secrecy obligations. 1 The TAA goes so far as to protect all revenue related information, including that which does not identify specific taxpayer affairs (“Revenue Information”). Revenue information is not subject to the rule of confidentiality and therefore does not require a “permitted disclosure”. However, under s 18(3) revenue information can only be released if it does not adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or prejudice the maintenance of the law. 3. It also recognises that to protect the integrity of the tax system IR will in some circumstances need to disclose taxpayer related information (sensitive revenue information) to the courts, other government agencies and other third parties (sometimes including the public). The TAA has always contained a number of exceptions that specifically allowed IR to disclose certain information. Those exceptions are now called “permitted disclosures”, a concept that is defined in s 16C(5). They are contained in ss 18D – 18J and schedule 7 of the TAA. 4. This statement focuses on the permitted disclosure provided for in s 18D(2), which was first enacted in s 81(1B) 2 and was intended to give IR more flexibility to make disclosures when administering the tax system. The new s 18D(2) is a carry-over of the previous s 81(1B) exception with minor amendments. 5. The exercise of the discretion to disclose involves a two-step inquiry: a) Is the disclosure made in carrying out or supporting a function of the Commissioner? and b) Is the disclosure reasonable having regard to five specific factors contained in s 18D(2)(b)? 6. T his statement provides guidance and outlines the steps needed before making that disclosure to ensure maximum consistency. Before that it briefly examines how this permitted disclosure interacts with the Commissioner’s authority to make other permitted disclosures.

As noted below, nothing in the operation of s 18D(2) affects other permitted disclosures contained in the TAA. Sometimes a disclosure might be made under either s 18D(2) or another permitted disclosure. EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 6 IN CONFIDENCE The general confidentiality rule and its permitted disclosures 9. Section 18(1) provides the important general rule that revenue officers must maintain the confidentiality of sensitive revenue information. Section 16C defines “sensitive revenue information” as revenue information that is taxpayer-related and meets one of the requirements in s 16C(3)(a)(i)-(iii). Revenue information is information the Commissioner holds under or for the purposes of a revenue law or under an information-sharing right. Revenue information which is not sensitive revenue information is not subject to the rule of confidentiality. Such information is releasable subject only to two considerations – whether the disclosure would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or prejudice the maintenance of the law (s 18(3)). The exceptions to confidentiality are now called “permitted disclosures”. The previous exceptions are retained with some modifications, and new exceptions have been added. As with its earlier version (s 81(1)), s 18D(1) contains a permitted disclosure of the “carrying into effect” of revenue law. Under s 81(1) this was a general exception. However, this new permitted disclosure contains a list of specific exceptions. Section 18D(1) allows disclosure where it is for the purpose of “carrying into effect” a revenue law as set out in clause 2, schedule 7, part A. Case law on an earlier version of the “carrying into effect” exception is likely to remain relevant. 10. The Supreme Court considered the former version of s 81(1) in Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,896. It noted at paragraph \[69\] that: Disclosure is not permitted unless, and to the extent that, it is reasonably necessary for the performance of the Commissioner’s statutory functions. 11. Although the case itself dealt with a relatively unusual situation involving disclosure of third-party confidential information in a complex litigation, the Supreme Court noted that this test was a straightforward legal standard. The test of “reasonable necessity” does however create a measure of uncertainty. 12. The general rule of confidentiality of sensitive revenue information in s 18(1) is subject to the discretion contained in section 18D(2), which takes on an important role. It is intended to enable disclosures which are reasonable (as opposed to reasonably necessary) in terms of the discretion enacted. 13. This raises the issue of the relationship between the permitted disclosure contained in s 18D(2) and the permitted disclosure contained in s 18D(1) – or indeed the permitted disclosures specified in s 18D(4) or schedule 7, part B (which permits disclosures to taxpayers and their representatives). While EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 7 IN CONFIDENCE some disclosure may only be made on the authority of s 18D(2), there will be many circumstances where a disclosure would equally be authorised under the other permitted disclosures. In those circumstances, IR might rely on another applicable exception without regard to the balancing act required by s 18D(2). 14. Similarly, the fact that a general subject area might be dealt with in schedule 7, part B will not affect or constrain the use of s 18D(2). I f a closely related disclosure was not specifically covered by schedule 7, part B, it might still be reasonably made if it satisfies the requirements of s 18D(2). In this regard, schedule 7, part B cannot be read as an exhaustive code. 15. One purpose behind the introduction of the legislation now contained in s 18D(2) was to expand the circumstances in which IR can disclose information (whether of a taxpayer specific or of a general nature) where disclosure is not necessarily linked to the direct administration of the revenue law. A decision to disclose under s 18D(2) may be made in response to a request from a third party for information, but it also enables IR to proactively disclose information to third parties (including the media) where it considers that the test in s 18 D(2) is met. Standard P ractice and Analysis The discretion – a function of the Commissioner 16. As noted above, in order to exercise the discretion contained in s 18D(2), the Commissioner must be satisfied that the proposed disclosure will comply with two statutory tests. The first is (subsection (2)(a)) that the communication is made in “carrying out” or “supporting” a function of the Commissioner – whether or not it provides a benefit to the recipient. T his means that the communication will be authorised if it assists a revenue officer with the functions described in s18D(2)(a). 17. The “carrying out” of a function extends to a function “lawfully conferred on” the Commissioner to: “administer”, “implement”, “improve, research or reform” the tax system. The function ( eg, researching or reforming the tax system) must be itself “lawfully conferred”. This would include functions conferred under revenue law and non-revenue law. 18. Section 18D(2) not only applies in relation to the carrying out of such actions but it also extends to anything done to “support” the carrying out of any such actions. This allows disclosure where there is not a direct carrying out of a function as such, but the disclosure is supporting the carrying out of the function. For instance, supporting work being conducted by third parties to research aspects of the tax system might reasonably warrant the disclosure of sensitive revenue information. EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 8 IN CONFIDENCE 19. There must be a nexus between the disclosure and the Commissioner’s functions. So, where the disclosure will only serve the purpose of assisting another party perform its functions and cannot reasonably be linked to carrying out or supporting the carrying out of any of the Commissioner’s functions, the test in s 18D(2) will not be met. However, where the disclosure will assist a third party and at the same time carry out or support a relevant function of the Commissioner, the disclosure may be made, if the criteria in s 18D(2) are satisfied. The discretion – the factors which must be balanced 20. Once the first test is satisfied, the Commissioner still needs to be objectively satisfied that the proposed disclosure is “reasonable” (in carrying out or supporting the carrying out of a Commissioner’s function) having regard to five listed factors. Those factors are: • the Commissioner’s “best endeavours” obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system; • the importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; • any personal or commercial impact of the disclosure; • the resources available to the Commissioner; and • the public availability of the information. 21. Before considering each factor a number of general preliminary comments can be made: a) The test for determining whether the disclosure can be made is one of reasonableness. This is an objective standard. The threshold is less onerous than the “reasonably necessary” test stated in Westpac above, meaning that greater disclosure is potentially permissible. b) The test requires that all five of the specified factors are taken into account in any decision to disclose. There may be circumstances where one or two of the factors appear immaterial but they still need to be taken into account and given appropriate weight. c) Often there will be tension between (and within) the various factors with some factors favouring disclosure while others suggesting non- disclosure. IR cannot pre-determine weightings for each of the factors. d) That said, there will be circumstances where a particular factor is so relevant that it effectively determines whether the disclosure should be made or not. An example is where the information is already publicly available. In most of these instances (even if it was confidential when it came into IR’s hands) there would be little risk in releasing it (refer to the fifth factor above) to the recipient. However, that factor still needs to be weighed in each decision. For example, IR will not be EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 9 IN CONFIDENCE likely to confirm or deny the tax status of a particular person about whom public statements have been made by others. For another example, where there is a public debate about an industry’s entitlement to deduct say research and development costs, and IR is asked to assist in the debate by providing to the industry details of a particular taxpayer’s research and development approach (which was deductible). Such a step, which might slightly assist the promotion of voluntary compliance by the taxpayer’s competitors, could well prejudice the taxpayer’s business. The adverse commercial impact of the disclosure far outweighs its benefits, and this factor would preclude disclosure, notwithstanding the other factors. Factor 1 – Protecting the tax system’s integrity 22. The first matter to consider is whether the disclosure is consistent with the Commissioner’s obligation to use best endeavours at all times to protect the “integrity of the tax system”. That term is defined in s 6(2) to include: (a) taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; and (b) the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; and (c) the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; and (d) the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and (e) the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (f) the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 23. In relation to IR’s confidentiality requirements, there are different drivers affecting the integrity of the tax system. The right of the taxpayer and the responsibility of IR to keep information confidential are only two of the factors mentioned in s 6. These may clash with the taxpayer’s obligation to comply with the law and IR’s obligation to administer the law fairly. Other taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system’s integrity are also relevant. 24. For example, a taxpayer makes misleading public statements about trying to settle a tax dispute with the IR for years to no avail, or about the conduct of an investigation. The general body of taxpayers may think negatively of IR and the tax system if they believe the assertions that IR was acting improperly. Therefore, IR may issue a statement that the taxpayer had not provided all relevant facts, and that had contributed materially to IR’s not having concluded the dispute, which would allow taxpayers to take a more informed view of the situation. EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 10 IN CONFIDENCE Factor 2 – Promoting voluntary compliance 25. The second factor considered is promoting compliance with the law, especially voluntary compliance. This factor is referred to in the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities contained in s 6A (refer to Interpretation Statement IS 10/07). This includes collecting the highest net revenue having regard to: 3 The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts 26. The promotion of voluntary compliance is a cornerstone of the New Zealand tax system. As such, it is an important factor to consider in any decision as to the reasonableness of disclosure as opposed to non-disclosure. However, as with protecting the tax system’s integrity, tensions may arise in considering the voluntary compliance of the individual taxpayer as against taxpayers more generally. Disclosing information about a specific taxpayer may adversely affect that taxpayer’s commitment to voluntary compliance, but may enhance the compliance behaviour of others. It is important to note that IR’s responsibility is to promote compliance amongst all taxpayers. As such, an adverse effect on an individual taxpayer may still be justifiable in some cases, if the Commissioner considers the disclosure will promote voluntary compliance more generally. For example, IR already makes media statements about taxpayers convicted in the courts for serious tax offending. Factor 3 – The communication’s personal or commercial impact 27. The third factor to be considered in determining whether a disclosure is reasonable is the potential impact that disclosure may have personally or commercially. This requires looking at the disclosure from the perspective of an affected taxpayer or group of taxpayers. This may in some cases justify discussion with the taxpayers potentially affected. For example, a statement by IR that a particular taxpayer is the subject of an IR investigation or dispute may negatively impact on that taxpayer’s reputation or business or share price. In such circumstances, the question becomes whether the other factors reasonably favour disclosing the information notwithstanding that consequence. 28. However, it is not necessarily the case that all IR disclosures under s 18D(2) will have an adverse commercial impact on a taxpayer. There may be circumstances where the affected taxpayer would like the confidential information to be disclosed. So where a taxpayer has requested that IR make the disclosure, this factor will carry significant weight in assessing the personal or commercial impact of the disclosure. Consent is therefore a significant factor, but not necessarily an overriding one. IR may, for instance, consider on balance that public comment on a taxpayer’s personal 3 See section 6A(3)(b). EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 11 IN CONFIDENCE affairs could have an adverse effect on voluntary compliance in the circumstances. IR would normally release information directly to the taxpayer concerned rather than to a third party on their behalf. 29. This factor may carry much less weight where the disclosure deals with anonymous, aggregated data, perhaps relating to a large industry or area. In those circumstances, where the potential commercial impact on a particular member of the industry is much less, it is unlikely that this factor would be given much weight. On the other hand, this factor would be more significant if the taxpayer is more readily identifiable and the information relates to a smaller industry or locality. Factor 4 – IR’s resources 30. The use of IR’s resources is another factor also referred to in the care and management responsibilities of the Commissioner in s 6A. This factor enables IR to have regard to the effect of a disclosure on its own resources. 31. For example, a disclosure may be an effective way to improve the compliance behaviour of a group of taxpayers. The disclosure may reduce the need for audit, amendment of assessments and possible penalties. Further, IR’s investigative resources may be freed up to do other work. 32. The use of resources factor may also be relevant in terms of determining the level of internal (and sometimes external) resource required to obtain the information requested. This can be extremely expensive, and the resources may well be better used elsewhere. Factor 5 – The information is otherwise publicly available 33. This factor may have significant weight in favour of disclosure if the information is publicly available. However, there may be circumstances where the information is theoretically publicly available but would involve the use of considerable cost or time to obtain. In such cases, the public availability factor may carry less weight in favour of disclosure. Arguably, the publication of industry income benchmarks, or other aggregated statistical data, sourced from public sources, could still be otherwise restricted by the normal confidentiality requirements. However, s 18D(2) allows for such disclosure provided that the disclosure is reasonable having regard to all five factors in s 18D(2)(b). 34. The confidential information may have been made available to the public by someone other than IR in circumstances where the information has been improperly obtained. In those circumstances, IR may decide not to disclose the confidential information even though it is otherwise publicly available, when it considers the other four factors above. EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 12 IN CONFIDENCE How the provisions will work in practice 35. The expanded confidentiality rules allow IR a greater ability to disclose sensitive revenue information, broadly where disclosure will assist the integrity of the tax system. With the greater flexibility of the confidentiality rules, IR recognises that the decision to make disclosures under s 18D(2) needs to be made by senior staff. The process will be as follows: a) The decision maker must be satisfied that the disclosure satisfies the criteria; b) The decision to disclose sensitive revenue information should be the subject of legal advice. 36. Although a proposed communication is related to the function of the Commissioner within the s 18D(2) discretion, IR can still decide not to make the disclosure after balancing the various factors. For example, IR may decline to use its discretion where it was thought that making a public statement about inaccurate information made public by a taxpayer would merely lead to a public debate about that taxpayer’s tax affairs, without leading to any material benefit to the tax system. As such, the more sensitive or wide-reaching any potential disclosure from IR is, the more likely more senior management will be involved in the decision to disclose - particularly if the disclosure would tend to identify a taxpayer or small group of taxpayers. 37. A decision maker required to determine whether a disclosure can or should be made must note the following: a) The general rule and starting point is that an officer must maintain confidentiality of all sensitive revenue information unless a permitted disclosure is identified. b) Does the “carrying into effect” permitted disclosure under s 18D(1) apply? c) Does any other specific permitted disclosure under s 18D- 18J and schedule 7 apply? d) The final step is to consider if s 18D(2) applies. This requires a conclusion that both statutory tests in subsection (2)(a) and (b) are satisfied in relation to the relevant disclosure. In this regard, the above commentary will be required to be considered in accordance with the policies outlined here before concluding that the disclosure is: i) made in carrying out or supporting a function of the Commissioner; ii) reasonable in relation to that function; iii) reasonable having taken into account each of the five relevant factors.

EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 14 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix - Examples The Appendix contains examples that are intended to assist revenue officers and taxpayers understand how the Commissioner considers the “carrying out function” permitted disclosure will operate in practice. The circumstances and content of each potential disclosure will dictate whether IR can and will rely on s 18D(2) to disclose. Therefore, revenue officers must still consider the guidance discussed above before deciding whether s 18D(2) applies even where they consider the disclosure is consistent with one of these examples. Example 1: Disclosure to the New Zealand Police IR is approached by New Zealand Police wi th a request for information on an individual who is suspected of dealing in drugs. At this stage, the Police do not have in mind any specific offence that may have been committed. The information sought is specific to income returned by the individual for tax purposes. The Police intend to use this information to conduct further investigations to determine if the individual has sufficient income to support his standard of living and advise that they will report the results of their investigation to IR to enable it to assess the correct amount of tax. Does the request come within any of the permitted disclosures to allow the release the information to the Police? Section 18D(1): Information may be released for the purpose of carrying into effect a revenue law as set out schedule 7, part A. Does the disclosure meet the criterion in relation to s 18D(1)? No, it is not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect a revenue law. And it does not come within the specific exceptions in schedule 7, part A. Sections 18E- 18J: Information may be released under other permitted disclosures Does the disclosure fall within one of the permitted disclosures in s18E to s 18J? No - none of the permitted disclosures apply in this case. However, if the offence that the Police is investigating carries a penalty of more than 4 years imprisonment (“a serious crime”), it may be possible for IR to share that information under the approved information sharing agreement authorised by section 18E(2). EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Deadline for comment 16 August 2019. Please quote ED0210 Page 15 IN CONFIDENCE Section 18D(2): Information may be released if it relates to a function of the Commissioner having regard to five factors Section 18D(2)(a) – Step One Whether the disclosure is made in: • carrying out a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner, or • supporting such a function? Is it for carrying out a function of the Commissioner? -Administer the tax system: No. The function in question is that of the Police, not IR. While the Police may eventually provide IR with information that impacts on the taxpayer’s tax obligations, the primary purpose is to enable the Police to investigate the taxpayer’s affairs. -Implement the tax system: No – as above -Improve, research, or reform the tax system: No Does it support the carrying out of any of the above? No. It does not seem to “support” any of those matters – again the nexus between the disclosure and IR’s functions is too tenuous to justify the conclusion that it would “support” those functions. Accordingly, the inquiry would stop here – the information cannot be disclosed. The same conclusion is likely to be reached where requests for information are received from other government agencies or third parties in circumstances where the information would not be covered by a specific exception and does not also assist IR in administering or implementing the tax system (see example 3 below). Because s 18D(2) will never be satisfied, there is no need to consider Step Two of the s 18D(2) test i.e. the balancing exercise in paragraph (b). Example 2: Media statements A promoter of an innovative financial product has made statements in the product’s prospectus and other promotional material that suggests the product is the subject of a binding ruling from IR. However, while the promoter applied for a binding ruling, this was not granted by IR as it did not comply with the relevant tax law. IR is considering issuing a statement to the media that it has not issued a binding ruling on the financial product. Can that information be released under any of the permitted disclosures?

Example 3: Sharing data with Treasury Treasury is working jointly with IR on tax policy development in the area of tax incentives for a small specialised industry. The Commissioner considers it worthwhile sharing tax information with Treasury in order to be consistent with international best practices for that particular industry.

Where IR considers that one or more of the criteria are not satisfied, can IR disclose the reasons for rejecting the transfer with the tax pooling intermediary? What if during the course of that conversation, the tax pooling intermediary asked for details of the taxpayer’s tax payments over the course of a year.

However, as previously noted, the exception would not extend to the disclosure of the taxpayer’s history of tax payments. Example 5: Disclosing competitor’s information IR is investigating an industry to determine whether participants in the industry are properly returning all their income. A number of taxpayers are arguing that IR has no basis for determining what amount of income their business is generating and what their net profits are.

No. While there may be circumstances where third-party information will be disclosed it is not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the ITA Act.

1 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Determination EE001: Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment Reimbursements or reimbursing allowances in relation to employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment are taxable and subject to PAYE unless specifically exempt. Section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows reimbursements or reimbursing allowances to be exempt to the extent that an employee would be allowed a deduction if they incurred the expenditure and the employment limitation did not exist. Evidence is required to demonstrate a ‘nexus’ between incurring the expenditure and deriving income. Under s CW 17(2) a reimbursement may be exempt or under s CW 17(3) a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure may be exempt. In this context a reasonable estimate is one that has some objective basis. For example, the estimate might be based on actual historical data or employee survey information. Employers must retain sufficient information about how the estimate was determined to substantiate the amount. This Determination provides employers with the option of applying certain percentages to make an allocation between business use and private use for usage plans related to telecommunications tools based on the level of business use. There is also a de minimis level of payment that may be treated as exempt income. As a means of providing flexibility and reducing compliance costs this Determination allows lesser requirements for the provision of evidence when applying the percentages or the de minimis class. The requirements may involve signed declarations from employees in lieu of other evidence of use, an employment policy to establish an obligation to use telecommunications tools and in the case of the de minimis class there is no evidence requirement. The option to use this Determination will reduce business compliance costs. Contents • Determination • Flowchart • Examples • Commentary 2 UNCLASSIFIED Determination This Determination is made under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Determination applies to the arrangements described and in circumstances where employees use their own telecommunications tools in their employment and also use the tools for private use. It may also apply where the employer provides payments in relation to usage plans only. Employers reimburse employees or provide reimbursing allowances which involve estimates being made. This Determination can be relied on for the required apportionment. This Determination relates to the following arrangements, which comprise three classes: Class A, Class B and the De Minimis Class. Class A: Principally business use, covers situations where: • an employer enters into an arrangement with the employee whereby the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or the arrangement involves the employee using their own usage plan; and • the employee incurs the cost of the telecommunications tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone and there is reimbursement; or • a reimbursing allowance represents a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure to be incurred by the employee; and • the telecommunications tools and usage plan are principally used by the employee in their employment, and the employee also uses the tools and usage plan or usage plan alone for private use; and • there may be an amount relating to depreciation loss. Class B: Principally private use, covers situations where: • an employer enters into an arrangement with the employee whereby the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or the arrangement involves the employee using their own usage plan; and • the employee incurs the cost of the telecommunications tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone and there is reimbursement; or • a reimbursing allowance represents a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure to be incurred by the employee; and • the employee is required to use telecommunications tools and usage plan in their employment based on a business reason and also uses the tools and usage plan or usage plan alone for private use; and • there may be an amount relating to depreciation loss. The De Minimis Class covers situations where: • an employer enters into an arrangement with the employee whereby the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or the arrangement involves the employee using their own usage plan; and 3 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED • the employee incurs the cost of the telecommunications tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone and there is reimbursement; or • a reimbursing allowance represents a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure to be incurred by the employee; and • the employee is required to use telecommunications tools and a usage plan in their employment based on a business reason and also uses the tools and usage plan for private use; and • there is a payment of no more than $5 per week per employee, amounting to no more than $265 per year per employee, as a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance in relation to the use of telecommunications tools and a usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone. Class A For Class A cases, employers can treat 75% of the amount paid (total bill amount) either by reimbursement or by a reimbursing allowance for usage plans, as exempt income of the employee. The extent to which the payment is taxable is 25%. If the employer pays 75% of the total bill as a reimbursement or reimbursing allowance, then the whole amount paid is exempt. Depreciation loss is calculated using the Commissioner’s rates for the items. Class B For Class B cases, employers can treat 25% of the amount paid (total bill amount) either by reimbursement or by a reimbursing allowance for usage plans, as exempt income of the employee. The extent to which the payment is taxable is 75%. If the employer pays 25% of the total bill as an reimbursement or reimbursing allowance, then the whole amount paid is exempt. Depreciation loss is calculated using the Commissioner’s rates for the items. De Minimis Class A payment up to $5 per week, amounting to no more than $265 per year, per employee, as reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance in relation to telecommunication tools and a usage plan can be treated as exempt income of the employee. This is in circumstances where the employee uses telecommunications tools in employment and incurs expenditure. Limitations on the scope of this Determination Additional and supplementary telecommunications tools If the employer provides telecommunications tools, then the employer should not also be paying a reimbursing allowance, which is exempt income, for use of the employee’s own telecommunications tools of that type. However, an employer who provides employees with laptops can also have a bring your own device (“BYOD”) plan for cell phones or home internet connections. 4 UNCLASSIFIED Additional remuneration or salary sacrifice This Determination does not apply if the amount paid is materially more than the actual plan costs or if there is evidence of the amounts being taken into account in remuneration levels so that a salary sacrifice arrangement exists. Section CW 17(2C) does not permit a Determination under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to apply to salary sacrifice arrangements. The inclusion of a telecommunications benefit in a salary statement to document the reimbursing allowance does not by itself indicate a salary sacrifice arrangement. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) This Determination does not apply where there is no employment income under the arrangement, that is, where the employer provides the telecommunications tool and pays for the usage. In such circumstances there may be FBT implications. It is noted that s CX 21 provides an exemption for business tools. Determination is not binding on employer or employee This Determination is not binding on the employer or the employee. If the employer or employee has evidence to demonstrate that, in their particular circumstance, some other apportionment is appropriate under s CW 17, the taxpayer may apply that apportionment. This Determination is signed by me on the 20 th day of December 2019. Tony Munt National Advisor - Technical Standards Inland Revenue 5 UNCLASSIFIED Does this Determination apply? 6 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Examples The following nine examples explain the application of this Determination. Example 1: Class A – Reimbursing allowance An employee brings their own telecommunications tool to work and uses it in the course of their work. The telecommunications tool is principally used for work. In recognition of that, the employer pays a reimbursing allowance of the total monthly account of $60 per month to the employee. A portion of this payment ($45) can be treated as exempt income to the employee. Under Class A, a 75% portion of the reimbursing allowance ($45) can be treated as exempt income to the employee. This Determination (for Class A) can be relied on in lieu of establishing the apportionment of usage. Example 2: Depreciation An employer has an optional BYOD policy. Employees who opt into the policy must return their employer-provided laptop and use their own laptop and associated equipment instead. Under this policy, employees must use a laptop that meets certain specifications. The employee must also purchase a mouse, keyboard and docking station to use at their workplace. This arrangement is within Class A. The employer estimates that the average cost of a laptop that meets the required specifications and associated equipment is $1,500. The cost of this device and equipment per year is subject to a depreciation calculation made using the Commissioner’s rates for the items. The employee can receive an amount calculated as depreciation loss (75% of that amount) annually as exempt income. Example 3: Class B – Reimbursing allowance An employee uses their home internet connection to do work for their employer, and the employer pays the employee a monthly reimbursing allowance of $60. It is understood that the reimbursing allowance is sufficient to cover both business use and private use, on the basis that it covers the total monthly account. The employee is required to use the home internet connection in their employment, but employment is not the principal use. There is some actual business use. Under Class B, a 25% portion of the reimbursing allowance ($15) can be treated as exempt income to the employee. This Determination (for Class B) can be relied on in lieu of establishing the apportionment of usage. Example 4: Reimbursement equal to or below business use percentage An employer makes a monthly reimbursement payment of $25 to the employee. The home internet plan costs the employee $100 per month. The employer has evidence that the $25 reimbursement will cover monthly business use because business use amounts to at least 25%. The monthly payment by the employer is equal to the business use percentage, so it is unnecessary to make a private use apportionment. The amount would be fully exempt under s CW 17. Example 5: De minimis payment An employer makes a monthly reimbursement payment of $20 to the employee. The employee must use their telecommunications tool in their employment based on a business reason and also uses the tool for private use. The payment 7 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED is exempt income given it does not exceed the de minimis threshold of a payment up to $5 per week, amounting to no more than $265 per year. Example 6: Second mobile phone An employer provides a mobile phone for work purposes that is also available for private use. The employer reimburses or pays an reimbursing allowance for a second mobile phone for the employee. No additional facts indicate that the employee needs two phones for business purposes such as specifically needing separate phone numbers. This Determination cannot be relied on in relation to the usage plan for the second mobile phone. The reimbursement or reimbursing allowance amount is likely to be employment income and not exempt. Example 7: Salary sacrifice An employer provides an amount of $1,000 per month for telecommunications tools as part of a salary package. The employee spends $100 per month on the internet (usage) plan. This Determination cannot be relied on. The amount is employment income to the extent it relates to private use. Example 8: Employee needs to be contacted at any time An employee needs to be able to be contacted at any time to deal with work related matters. While the level of usage of the plan is less than 50% these facts still meet the principal use test. Class A applies and employers can treat 75% of the amount reimbursed or provided as an allowance as exempt income of the employee. If the employer paid the employee 75% or less of the total cost of the telecommunications tool the full reimbursement or reimbursing allowance would be exempt. Example 9: Leave of absence An employee has been assessed as receiving a Class A reimbursement. The employee receives a reimbursing allowance of $100 per month, of which $75 is tax exempt. The employee takes 6 weeks annual leave, during which the employee is not contactable for work purposes. As this is a temporary arrangement, any reimbursing allowance payments during the annual leave period remain 75% tax exempt. 8 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Commentary (which does not form part of this Determination) Purpose of Determination 1.1 Section CW 17 provides an exemption for certain payments to or made on behalf of an employee. The payments are in connection with an employee’s employment or service and are for the employee’s job-related expenditure. Often this expenditure might also have a private element. Under s CW 17, apportionment is required for this private element. 1.2 This Determination allows the employer to use the relevant percentage for the taxable portion of the payment to the employee, if the requirements set out in this Determination are met and the employer considers that it is preferable not to commit resource to establishing the actual percentage. 1.3 This Determination applies where the payment covers both business use and private use and the proportion is not ascertained. Other options 1.4 Employers do not have to apply this Determination. Section CW 17 provides the basis to apportion when this Determination is not applied. Arrangement 1.5 Many employers have a policy of agreeing to or allowing employees to bring their own telecommunications tools to work for business use, or agreeing to the business use of the employee’s usage plan and telecommunications tools. There also may be an understanding that the employee will use the tools or usage plan away from work for business purposes. This has the benefits of convenience, flexibility, increased productivity and cost savings. It also results in reimbursement or reimbursing allowances paid to the employee in relation to the costs of the telecommunications tools and usage plan. There may be a depreciation loss in using these devices. The acquisition cost of any telecommunications tool is not itself a depreciation loss. 1.6 This Determination relates to an arrangement whereby an employer reimburses an employee or employees for the cost of usage plans for telecommunications tools, or the employer reasonably estimates the amount of expenditure and pays a reimbursing allowance. There may also be payments relating to depreciation loss. 1.7 This Determination applies to a variety of arrangements. They may be described as BYOD plans, whereby the employer and employee agree on a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance for the employee because the employee uses their own telecommunications tools for work. Arrangements vary and the usage plan may include the supply of telecommunications tools 1.8 The arrangements include variations where the usage plan also involves the supply of a telecommunications tool as part of the plan. The arrangements may vary as to what particular telecommunications tools and usage plans are included. They may vary as to whether there is a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance in relation to an on-going service plan. 9 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED 1.9 This Determination operates to allow a percentage of any costs relating to a usage plan or depreciation loss as exempt income. There is also a de minimis acceptable level of payment. Usage plan only 1.10 The arrangement includes the employer providing the telecommunications tools and then reimbursing the employee for the cost of the employee’s usage plan or estimating the amount of reimbursement. Fringe benefit tax implications are not covered 1.11 FBT implications are not covered by this Determination. Payment can be made in different ways 1.12 Payment could be made to an employee in a variety of ways. There could be a reimbursing allowance or an exact reimbursement of costs. This Determination applies to these types of payment that cover both business use and private use. Private use could involve allowing household use. 1.13 This Determination does not provide a percentage or reasonable estimate for expenditure on account of an employee. Employment requirement 1.14 In all cases, the payment is made because the telecommunications tools are required for the employee to do their job. In this respect, the telecommunications tools: • are used when the employee is performing an obligation required by their employment or service; • the employee derives employment income through the performance of the obligation; • the expenditure is necessary in the performance of the obligation. If payment only meets cost of business use, amount would be fully exempt 1.15 If the reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance can be evidenced as being an amount that does not exceed the actual or reasonable estimate of business use then it would be fully exempt under s CW 17. Depreciation loss would be added to other costs. For example a monthly value for depreciation loss would be added to monthly usage plan costs to establish the total cost for the employee. A reimbursement, including the depreciation loss, that did not exceed the estimate of business use would be fully exempt under s CW 17. De minimis allowance 1.16 There is also a de minimis allowance when a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance is no more than $5 per week, or $265 per year, per employee. This level of expenditure is unlikely to involve private use. In such cases, the reimbursing allowance or reimbursement will be exempt income. If this level of expenditure is not exceeded, there is no requirement to hold any evidence in support of the expenditure. 10 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Acquisition cost of telecommunications tools is not covered; an amount of depreciation loss is covered 1.17 The telecommunications tools are likely to be capital assets, and the initial payment for these would not be expenditure on account under s CW 17 because they would be subject to the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). Telecommunications tools are identifiable assets of an enduring benefit. Therefore, the initial cost of the telecommunications tool is excluded when applying this Determination. The usage plan in some cases may include any cost for the telecommunications tools and the cost is effectively paid off over the minimum sign up period. In these cases there is no need to consider depreciation further as the full cost of the usage plan is subject to the relevant percentage for exempt income under Class A or Class B. 1.18 This Determination can include an amount that represents an amount for depreciation of the telecommunications tool. Section CW 17(4) states that for the purposes of s CW 17 expenditure, the expenditure can include an amount of depreciation loss. If the telecommunications tool costs $500 or less, the amount of the depreciation loss is the cost of the tool (see s EE 38). 1.19 Employers may estimate the cost of telecommunications tools for the purpose of depreciation, and then apply the applicable ratio to the estimated depreciation loss. The estimate should be based on the depreciation rates the Commissioner has set. Class A, Class B and the De Minimis Class are covered 1.20 This Determination covers three classes: Class A, Class B, and the De Minimis Class. 1.21 Under the classes an employer can make a payment or reimbursement in relation to the telecommunication tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone. Class A – telecommunications tools are principally used in employment 1.22 Class A covers arrangements where the telecommunications tools are principally used in employment. Meaning of “principally used” 1.23 Principally used’, the basis for Class A arrangements, means the main or primary use of the telecommunications tools in these arrangements is for use in employment. Reasonable judgement can be exercised 1.24 As is the case when making an apportionment under s CW17 reasonable judgement must be exercised as to the level of business use and there would be some reasonable evidential basis based on time spent or a staff survey. 1.25 However, it may be difficult to determine the level of use precisely and this Determination is intended to allow less than precise estimation. The employer may rely on some evidence of time spent, or for the purposes of this Determination, an employer may in the absence of any other evidence choose to obtain a signed declaration from an employee that telecommunications tools will be principally used in employment. 11 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED 1.26 It is expected that the situation would be reviewed periodically to check that the level of use remains the same. A review once every two years would be adequate. If an employer has obtained a signed declaration from an employee that telecommunications tools will be principally used in employment then a review is only required if there has been a material change to the employee’s circumstances. 1.27 In some cases, the importance of the employee having access to the telecommunications tools might mean that principal use is established. For example, an employee might need to be available at all times for calls. This factor on its own, does not mean there is principal use of the telecommunications tools for employment purposes. In some cases, data or expected usage could indicate a less than 50% usage, but the importance of availability might be a factor resulting in the principal use test being met. Implications 1.28 Employers can treat 75% of the amount paid either by reimbursement or by reimbursing allowance for usage plans and depreciation loss (if any) as exempt income of the employee. If employers pay 75% of the total usage charge as reimbursement or allowance, then the whole amount paid by the employer will be exempt. 1.29 If the employer pays a fixed amount per month the employer could obtain a declaration from the employee that the employee’s costs are at least 1.33 times the amount of the reimbursing allowance paid. The whole amount paid by the employer will be exempt. Class B – arrangements where telecommunications tools are required, but not principally used for employment 1.30 Class B covers arrangements where the telecommunications tools are still required for employment, but the tools are not principally used for employment. There must be an employment reason for the use of the telecommunications tools. 1.31 Class B provides a second-tier option. This enables a reduction in the compliance costs involved in the active measurement of use. An employment reason still exists for the use of the telecommunications tools. Employers apply a lesser percentage for exempt income of 25%. Employment policy is sufficient to show employment-use obligation 1.32 Class B is intended to cover arrangements where there is an employment reason and an obligation for the employee to use the tools, but private use is predominant. An established employment policy related to the use of the tools would be sufficient to establish the obligation. It is expected that there would be actual business use of the tools over time. Access to telecommunications tools is needed, but employment use is not the principal use. Implications 1.33 Employers can treat 25% of the amount paid either by reimbursement or by reimbursing allowance for usage plans and depreciation loss (if any) as exempt income of the employee. If employers pay 25% of the total usage charge as reimbursement or reimbursing allowance, then the whole amount will be exempt. 12 UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED 1.34 If the employer pays a fixed amount per month, the employer could obtain a declaration from the employee that the employee’s costs are at least four times the amount of the reimbursing allowance paid. The whole amount paid by the employer is exempt. De Minimis Class – minimum payment treated as exempt income 1.35 The De Minimis Class allows for a payment of up to $5 per week, or up to $265 per year, per employee as reimbursement or reimbursing allowance for the cost of a usage plan to be treated as exempt income. No records necessary 1.36 It is not necessary to support this de minimis level of reimbursement or reimbursing allowance with records. Implications 1.37 Employers can treat a minor payment as exempt. Interpretation All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Unless the context otherwise requires: • “business use” means use in connection with an employee’s employment or service; • “depreciation loss” means an amount calculated under s CW 17(4). Depreciation loss is calculated using the Commissioner’s rates for the items and, if claimed, is counted as part of the $265 per year in relation to de minimis; • “employee” does not include an independent contractor; • “principally used” means the main or primary use; • “reimbursing allowance” is an allowance paid by an employer for expenses that an employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. A reimbursing allowance is not necessarily an exact reimbursement of expenditure and may involve an estimate; • “required to use” means an obligation and a business reason to use; • “telecommunications tools” includes, telephones, mobile phones, tablets, laptops and personal computers; • “usage plans” means internet connection, service plans or usage plans in relation to telecommunications tools.
WITHDRAWN - replaced by EE003 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Determination EE002: Payments to employees for working from home costs during the COVID-19 pandemic Application This Determination is a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic and applies to payments made for the period from 17 March 2020 to 17 September 2020. Background Some employers have made, or intend to make, payments to employees to reimburse costs incurred by their employees as a result of the employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue has been asked to clarify the tax treatment of such payments. It is also acknowledged that many employers will not be in a financial position to make additional payments to employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This Determination is not intended to suggest that employers should make such payments to employees. Under s CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007, such payments may be exempt income for the employees. The amount that can be paid as exempt income for expenditure incurred by an employee depends on various factors. One of the factors is the extent to which the employee would be able to claim a deduction for the expenditure if the employment limitation did not apply. The employment limitation is the rule that prevents an employee from claiming most deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving employment income. This deductibility test means that there needs to be a connection between the expenditure and the performance of the employee’s job. It also means that the expenditure cannot be private expenditure or expenditure of a capital nature (however, an amount can be paid for depreciation loss). Employers may find it administratively difficult to establish the extent to which expenditure is incurred by employees in deriving employment income or is private in nature. Employers may also find it difficult to establish or estimate the expenditure each employee has incurred or is likely to incur. This Determination is intended to remove some of this difficulty and reduce compliance costs for employers by providing some safe harbours. You do not have to apply this Determination. You can calculate tax-free allowance and reimbursement amounts under s CW 17 based on your own reasonable estimates or actual employee costs. Last year (December 2019), the Commissioner issued Determination EE001, which provides guidance on arrangements where employees agree to use their own telecommunication devices and usage plans (or just their usage plans) for their employment. EE001 sets out proportions of expenditure or loss that the Commissioner will accept as being exempt income of an employee. The proportions differ depending on whether a device or usage plan is used by the employee principally for employment. EE001 also provides a de minimis rule which treats a payment made to an employee of up to $5 per week as exempt income of the employee. All that is required for this de minimis rule WITHDRAWN - replaced by EE003 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to apply is that there is an arrangement where the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or just their usage plan, and the employee agrees to use these for their employment. Determination EE001 can be used in relation to payments made to employees for mobile phone and internet costs incurred by employees working at home. This Determination (Determination EE002) applies to working from home costs not already covered by Determination EE001. Determination EE002 can be relied on in addition to Determination EE001. As noted above, this Determination is a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic only. It applies for a 6-month period and the treatment it provides depends on an employee continuing to work from home (in a more than minor way) as a result of COVID-19. Determination This Determination (EE002) is made under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s CW 17(2C) and (2D) of the Income Tax Act 2007. For this Determination to apply: • An employer must make a payment to an employee. • The payment must be for expenditure or a loss incurred (or likely to be incurred) by the employee. • The expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee in deriving their employment income and not be private or capital in nature (the capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss). • The payment must be made because the employee is doing their job and the employee must be deriving employment income from performing their job. • The expenditure or loss must be necessary in the performance of the employee’s job. • The expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee as a result of the employee being required to work from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This Determination can apply to an employee who is partly working from home and partly outside of their home, provided that the home-based work is more than minor. For example, the Determination can apply to an employee who works at the employer’s premises on alternative days to cater for physical distancing policies. Exclusions This Determination does not apply to: • Expenditure on account of an employee. • Any payments made for a period after an employee ceases to work from home. • An amount paid under a salary sacrifice arrangement. • To a payment made to an employee to compensate the employee for the conditions of their service. WITHDRAWN - replaced by EE003 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This Determination is not binding on employers or employees This Determination is not binding on employers or employees. An employer or employee may treat a different amount paid to the employee as exempt if they have evidence to demonstrate that in their circumstances some other amount is appropriately treated as exempt income. Weekly threshold Under this Determination, where an employer pays an employee who is working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic (an “affected employee”) an allowance, up to $15 per week of the amount paid can be treated as exempt income of the employee. The same treatment can be applied to an equivalent amount paid for a different period of time, eg $30 per fortnight or $65 per month. This amount is in recognition of general expenditure (eg, additional heating costs) that an affected employee may incur when working from home, other than: • Depreciation loss, which is separately addressed in this Determination. • An expenditure or loss covered by Determination EE001. The treatment of this weekly threshold amount can apply in addition to both the treatment of an amount paid in accordance with Determination EE001 and the treatment of the cost of furniture and equipment that applies under this Determination. For example, if an employer pays an employee $20 per week for working from home expenses, $15 of this can be treated as exempt income under this Determination (EE002) and $5 can be treated as exempt income under Determination EE001 (if the de minimis option in EE001 is chosen). For this treatment to apply, the employer does not need to collect information about the actual expenditure incurred by the employee or make any estimate of expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred by the employee. Payments for the cost of furniture and equipment The following recognises that an employee might incur a depreciation loss on home office furniture or equipment, which the employee would be able to claim as a deduction, but for the employment limitation. Because of the low-value asset rule, for many assets, the depreciation loss is likely to be equal to the cost of the asset. Note that the threshold for low-value assets was recently amended. For assets purchased before 17 March 2020 the threshold is $500. For assets purchased on or after 17 March 2020 and before 17 March 2021 the threshold is $5,000 (note that the threshold will decrease to $1,000 on 17 March 2021). This Determination provides two options. An employer may apply either: • the safe harbour option, or • the reimbursement option. Safe harbour option Under the safe harbour option, an employer can treat up to $400 of an amount paid to an employee for furniture and equipment costs as exempt income. WITHDRAWN - replaced by EE003 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The safe harbour option saves an employer from having to identify the costs that their employees have or are likely to incur and from having to make judgements about the extent to which the furniture or equipment is used by employees for their employment. If an employer adopts this safe harbour option, it cannot treat any other allowance or reimbursement payment for furniture or equipment as exempt income. The reimbursement option The following applies to reimbursement payments made to employees for the cost of furniture or equipment purchased by employees. Under this reimbursement option, an amount paid by an employer to an affected employee will be exempt income of an employee if: • The amount is for furniture or equipment purchased by the employee. • The amount is equal to or less than the deduction that the employee could have for depreciation loss on the asset (or the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) for the income year, but for the employment limitation. The deduction that the employee could have for an asset and, therefore, the amount that can be paid as exempt income, depends on the extent to which the employee uses the asset for their employment. This means that the amount that can be paid as exempt income will be equal to a proportion of the depreciation loss on the asset (or a proportion of the cost of the asset in the case of a low-value asset). Applying s CW 17, where there is evidence that an asset will be used exclusively for employment purposes, 100% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. Further, under this Determination: • For an employee who uses an asset principally for their employment, an amount of up to 75% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. • For an employee who does not use an asset principally for their employment, an amount of up to 25% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a lowvalue asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. The reimbursement option will require an employer to identify the cost of the asset for which the reimbursement is paid so that they can calculate the above proportion. An employer will also need to determine whether the asset is being used exclusively, principally or less than principally for employment. For assets that are not low-value assets (which are likely to be uncommon), the employer will also need to apply the relevant depreciation rate to calculate the depreciation loss. Whether an asset is used exclusively for employment purposes will depend on the circumstances. Employers need to use their judgement. It is acknowledged that the reimbursement option could be onerous in some cases, eg where an employer has many employees. That is why the safe harbour option has also been provided. WITHDRAWN - replaced by EE003 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] A written statement (an email or expense claim application is sufficient) from an employee to their employer that the employee intends to use an asset for their employment, and whether principally or not, will be sufficient to establish such use. Overlap with Determination EE001 For depreciation losses on telecommunications devices, employers cannot apply the reimbursement option in this Determination (EE002) in addition to the treatment available in Determination EE001. Summary of options available under Determinations EE001 and EE002 The options available under Determinations EE001 and EE002 are summarised in the following table. Note that the table does not detail all the requirements of the Determinations. The table must be read together with the Determinations themselves. WITHDRAWN – replaced by EE003 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What is the payment for? How much is treated as exempt income? When can I use this option? What evidence do I need to keep? Furniture or equipment Up to $400 maximum (“safe harbour”) The safe harbour amount is the only amount paid for furniture and equipment No evidence required 25% of cost of item\* Item is used at least partly for job • Evidence of the employee’s costs • Evidence that the item is used for the employee’s job 75% of cost of item\* Item is used mainly for job • Evidence of the employee’s costs • Evidence that the item is used mainly for the employee’s job 100% of cost of item\* Item is used exclusively for job • Evidence of the employee’s costs • Evidence that the item is used exclusively for the employee’s job Telecommunication usage plan costs Up to $5 per week Plan used for job No evidence required 25% of employee’s costs Cost is at least partly for job • The employee’s costs • Evidence that the cost is for the employee’s job 75% of employee’s costs Cost is mainly for job • The employee’s costs • Evidence that the cost is mainly for the employee’s job 100% of employee’s costs Cost is exclusively for job • The employee’s costs • Evidence that the cost is exclusively for the employee’s job Other expenditure Up to $15 per week The $15 per week amount is the only amount paid for other expenditure No evidence required \* Assuming the item is a low-value asset.

Variation to Determination EE002 - Payments to employees for working from home costs during the COVID-19 pandemic (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================================================================================

In order to provide certainty for employers and employees the Commissioner has issued Determination EE002A. This determination varies and extends [Determination EE002: Payments to employees for working from home cost during the COVID-19 pandemic](/determinations/miscellaneous/determination-ee002-payments-to-employees-for-working-from-home-costs-during-the-covid-19-pandemic)
, by removing all references to the need for the employee to be working from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and extending the payment period of a reimbursing payment through to 17 March 2021. Note that this determination applies only where an employer chooses to make a payment to an employee.

Payments provided to employees that work from home; Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment (WITHDRAWN)
============================================================================================================================================

Over the past two years, the Commissioner has published several determinations that deal with the additional expenditure that employees may face when they work from home and/or use their personal telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment. 

Determination EE003 applies for the period 1 October 2021 until 31 March 2023 and sets out the extent to which a payment made by an employer to an employee in these circumstances is able to be treated as exempt income to the employee.  In order to make it easier for employers and employees to locate the information that they may require, this determination amalgamates and replaces all previous determinations that have been published on this topic.

Effect of repeal of Income Tax Act 1994 on depreciation determinations issued before repeal
===========================================================================================

QB (Apr 2006) clarifies that depreciation determinations made under the Income Tax Act 1994 continue to apply following the repeal of that Act.

**Question**

We have been asked to consider whether depreciation determinations made under sections EG 4, EG 10 or EG 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the 1994 Act") continue to apply even if they are not reissued under the Income Tax Act 2004 ("the 2004 Act") and the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA").

**Answer**

The Commissioner considers that depreciation determinations issued under the 1994 Act continue to apply following the repeal of that Act, without the need to reissue the determinations, as:

*   the effect of section YA 3(2) of the 2004 Act is that depreciation determinations made under the 1994 Act are treated as if they were made under the equivalent provisions in the 2004 Act and the TAA; and
*   the effect of section 21 of the Interpretation Act is that depreciation determinations made under the 1994 Act continue in force following the repeal of that Act.

**Legislation**

 Section YA 3(2) of the 2004 Act provides:

A reference in an enactment or document to the Income Tax Act 1994 (or to the Income Tax Act 1976), or to a provision of that earlier Act, is to be interpreted as a reference to this Act, or to the corresponding provision in this Act, to the extent necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document.

Section 21 of the Interpretation Act 1999 ("the Interpretation Act") provides:

Anything done in the exercise of a power under a repealed enactment, and that is in effect immediately before that repeal, continues to have effect as if it had been exercised under any other enactment-

(a)           That, with or without modification, replaces, or that corresponds to, the enactment repealed; and

(b)           Under which the power could be exercised.

**Analysis**

The 1994 Act was repealed with respect to tax on income for the 2005/2006 and subsequent tax years when the 2004 Act came into force on 1 April 2005:  section YA 1 of the 2004 Act.  Unless an enactment is preserved by a savings provision at the time of the repeal, the effect of the repeal of an Act is that:

*   for the future, the enactment is treated as if it had never existed; and
*   subordinate or delegated legislation made under a repealed Act lapses.

See _Inspector of Awards and Agreements v Malcolm Forlong Ltd_ \[1974\] 1 NZLR 36. 

Therefore, unless depreciation determinations are preserved by a savings provision, determinations made under sections EG 4, EG 10 or EG 11 of the 1994 Act would lapse in respect of the 2005/2006 and subsequent income years following the repeal of the 1994 Act.

The 2004 Act contains a specific savings provision, section YA 3(2).  There is also a general savings provision in the Interpretation Act 1999, section 21.  A specific savings provision will override a savings provision in the Interpretation Act:  _Vela Fishing Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,242 (CA); (2003) 21 NZTC 18,123 (PC)(CA); _Nelson Air Ltd v NZ Airline Pilots Assn IUOW_ \[1992\] 1 ERNZ 632.  However, there is no inconsistency between section YA 3(2) and section 21.  These provisions complement each other and give rise to the same result. 

**_Section YA 3(2)_**

For section YA 3(2) to apply in respect of depreciation determinations made under the 1994 Act, the following conditions must be satisfied:

*   A depreciation determination is an enactment or document.
*   A provision in the 2004 Act or the TAA is a "corresponding provision" to a provision in the 1994 Act.  References in the 2004 Act to "this Act" include a reference to the TAA "unless the context otherwise requires":  section AA 3(1).  Therefore, a "corresponding provision" may be in the 2004 Act or the TAA.
*   It is necessary to interpret references to the 1994 Act and to section EG 4, section EG 10 or section EG 11 in a determination as references to the 2004 Act and to a corresponding provision in that Act "to reflect sensibly the intent of" the depreciation determination.

Section YA 3(2) applies to depreciation determinations as:

*   A depreciation determination is a document, being an official record of the Commissioner's determination of the depreciation rates to be applied for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The essential characteristic of a "document" is that it is a record of information in some form:  see _R v Daye_ \[1908\] 2 KB 3338; _Tucker (JH) & Co Ltd v Board of Trade_ \[1955\] 2 All ER 522; and _Rollo v HM Advocate_ (1996) SCCR 874. 
*   Section EE 25 of the 2004 Act and section 91AAF of the TAA are corresponding provisions to section EG 4 of the 1994 Act.  Section EE 29 of the 2004 Act and sections 91AAG, 91AAH, 91AAI and 91AAJ of the TAA are corresponding provisions to section EG 10 of the 1994 Act. The corresponding provisions to section EG 11 of the 1994 Act are sections EE 21, EE 22, EE 23 and EE 24 and section 91AAL of the TAA.  
      
    It is irrelevant that a provision in the repealed legislation has been replaced by more than one provision.  As section 33 of the Interpretation Act provides that "words in the singular include the plural", the reference to "corresponding provision" in section YA 3(2) includes corresponding provisions:   _Seataste Products Ltd v Director-General of Agriculture and Fisheries_ \[1995\] 2 NZLR 449.  To be a "corresponding provision", a provision must have a similar purpose, have the same character and function, prescribe the same thing to be done and be designed to produce the same results but need not be identical to the provision in the repealed legislation:  _Vela Fishing Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,242 (CA); (2003) 21 NZTC 18,123 (PC).  It is considered that the provisions relating to the making of depreciation determinations in the 2004 Act and the TAA are corresponding provisions to sections EG 4, EG 10 and EG 11.  As with sections EG 4, EG 10 and EG 11 these provisions authorise the Commissioner to determine depreciation rates and set out the procedure for setting depreciation rates for the purpose of calculating the amount of depreciation on depreciable property. 
*   It is necessary to treat a reference to the 1994 Act in an existing depreciation determination as a reference to the 2004 Act or the TAA, and to the corresponding provisions in the 2004 Act or the TAA, in order to reflect sensibly the intent of a depreciation determination.  Generally there is no expiry date in a depreciation determination.   As there are no policy changes in respect of the setting of depreciation rates under the new legislation, it is considered that the intent of existing depreciation determinations is that they will apply indefinitely to the relevant assets until they are revoked or that they will apply until their expiry date. 

**_Section 21 of the Interpretation Act_**

The effect of section 21 is that anything done in the exercise of a power under a repealed enactment (such as the making of a depreciation determination under the 1994 Act), that is in effect immediately before the repeal, shall continue to have effect as if the power had been exercised under any enactment (such as the 2004 Act) if:

*   that enactment replaces or corresponds with the repealed enactment; and
*   the power could be exercised under the new enactment. 

The 2004 Act (which has the same purpose as the 1994 Act) replaces or corresponds to the 1994 Act (see section BA 1 of the 1994 Act and section BA 1 of the 2004 Act).  Under both the 1994 Act and the 2004 Act the Commissioner has the power to make depreciation determinations.  Therefore, the effect of section 21 is that depreciation determinations made under the 1994 Act continue to have effect following the repeal of the 1994 Act. 

**_Effect of sections YA 3(2) and 21_**

 The effect of section YA 3(2) is that references in existing depreciation determinations to the 1994 Act would be interpreted as references to the 2004 Act so that a depreciation determination expressed to be made under the 1994 Act is treated as having been made under the 2004 Act.  The effect of section 21 is that a depreciation determination made under the 1994 Act continues to have effect as though it was made under the 2004 Act (and the TAA).  These provisions operate in a different but complementary manner.  The effect of both section YA 3(2) and section 21 is that depreciation determinations made under the 1994 legislation continue to have effect following the repeal of the 1994 Act.

Effect of Self-Employment and Community Involvement on Decision to Bankrupt under s 37 of Insolvency Act 2006
=============================================================================================================

The Judgment Debtor, Tainui Stephens (“Mr Stephens”), opposed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“CIR”) application for an order adjudicating him bankrupt.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Stephens \[2018\] NZHC 519

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 2006 s 37; Tax Administration Act ss 6, 6A(3) and 176(1)

### Summary

The Judgment Debtor, Tainui Stephens (“Mr Stephens”), opposed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“CIR”) application for an order adjudicating him bankrupt. Mr Stephens relied on s 37 of the Insolvency Act 2006 (“the Act”), which provides a broad discretion for the High Court to decline to grant an order where it is just and equitable that the Court does not make an order, or where for any other reason an order should not be made. The Court held that the impact of an order of Mr Stephens’ career as a self-employed film producer and writer was not sufficient to trigger the exercise of its discretion under s 37.

### Impact

This case reaffirms the large body of case law which provides a high threshold for the exercise of the s 37 discretion, especially in tax arrears cases where there is a significant public interest factor in granting an order.

### Facts

Mr Stephens is a self-employed contract worker in the Maori film industry. He had failed to pay income tax for the years 2007 to 2017. He also had some GST debt. The CIR’s application for an order adjudicating Mr Stephens bankrupt was based on a judgment for $551,027.63 of tax arrears. At the date of hearing, Mr Stephens was still not keeping current with his tax affairs. Mr Stephens was also the sole director of a company, Pito One Productions Limited, which was put into liquidation by the CIR in February 2017 with tax debts of $232,793.47.

### Decision

The Court agreed with the CIR that the three particular elements of the case relevant to s 37 were:

1.  the interests of Mr Stephens himself – in particular, his ability to support himself, his age, the impact of the stigma of bankruptcy on his work and community activities;
2.  the possible presence of assets, and the potential for matters requiring the investigation of the Official Assignee; and
3.  the public interest.

Mr Stephens argued that the High Court should exercise its general discretion under s 37 of the Act to decline the CIR’s application for an order. Mr Stephens’ main submission was that his work in the film industry and as a board member and trustee of various industry and community organisations would be impeded by an order. He stated that his work was of considerable public interest and that there were few who would be able to fill his place as a contributor to the Maori screen industry.

The CIR submitted that Mr Stephens would be able to apply to the Official Assignee or the Court for leave to continue work in a self-employed capacity, and also that his ceasing to be self-employed would not justify the exercise of discretion under s 37. The CIR further submitted that Mr Stephens had disregarded taxation for a long time and therefore there was a considerable public interest in granting an order. It was also argued that the long history of non-compliance also displaced considerations regarding the effect of bankruptcy on Mr Stephen’s community participation.

The CIR also showed that there was evidence of properties owned by Mr Stephens and his wife, which were matters that should be investigated by the Official Assignee. The CIR further relied on the public interest in collecting revenue and the Commissioner’s statutory duty to maximise recovery and protect the integrity of the tax system under ss 6A(3), 6 and 176(1) of the Tax Administration Act.

The Court acknowledged that Mr Stephens’ contributions to film production and community involvement were likely to be reduced if an order were made. The Court stated that the question was whether the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the tax system outweighed those considerations. The Court decided that it did. The Court stated that Mr Stephens would be able to work with the Official Assignee and his supporters in the film industry to use his talents notwithstanding his bankruptcy. The Court further held that Mr Stephens had shown disregard or disrespect for tax obligations and considerations of public morality also weighed in favour of an order.

Election to depreciate plant and equipment at old rates
=======================================================

2006 amendment clarifies the rules covering the election to continue to depreciate plant and equipment at the old depreciation rates.

##### Section EE 26B of the Income Tax Act 2004

The rules covering the election to continue to depreciate plant and equipment at the old depreciation rates have been clarified for plant and equipment that has its depreciation rate set under a method other than section EE 25B.

Section EE 26B allows taxpayers to elect not to apply the new depreciation rates to plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and before the beginning of the 2006-07 income year. There was some uncertainty about whether section EE 26B applies to types of plant and equipment when the depreciation rate is not calculated under the new double declining balance method. The legislation has been amended to remove any uncertainty. This change applies for the 2005-06 and later income years.

Electronic payments the way of the future
=========================================

**24 October 2018**

The days of being able to pay your tax bill with a post-dated cheque are coming to an end as Inland Revenue moves with its customers, away from cheques towards electronic payments.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Meade Perrin says the plan is to stop accepting post-dated cheques in February next year.

“Payments New Zealand figures show 67 out of every 68 payments in New Zealand are electronic and there’s a 20% decline year on year in the use of cheques generally.  So we’re encouraging our customers to go with the trend and move to the simpler, easier and more certain electronic payment methods,” Mr Perrin says.

“Customers send Inland Revenue around half a million cheques each year.  That’s 4.5% of the total payments we receive. Around 17% - or more than 85,000 cheques - are post-dated.

“Instead of post-dating a cheque, and mailing it in, customers can use internet banking to set the date a payment comes out their bank account. That has the same effect as a post-dated cheque – the payment’s made on time, when the customers want it to be made and won’t be forgotten.

“There will be some impact on customers who’re used to post-dating cheques but we’re confident that can be worked through given most banks have a simple and convenient system for electronic payments.

“Compared with electronic payments, cheques are expensive to process and the technology used to process them, both by IR and banks, is approaching the end of its working life.

“Technology is more and more becoming part of our everyday lives and there’s already been a significant shift to using digital methods for paying tax and receiving refunds, with 95.5% of all payments received by IR already digital. 

“We want to keep that momentum building and ease taxpayers towards digitising all their payments,” Meade Perrin says.

Options for payment:

• Electronic via internet banking or direct debit in MyIR. Paying this way minimises delays and includes a formal notification of the date and time the payment was made to Inland Revenue. 

• Customers can make payment by debit/credit card over the phone, through the unauthenticated payment page the Inland Revenue website, and through myIR. 

• Taxpayers can also set up direct debits in myIR.

Cash or eftpos are still payment options but only at Westpac branches. They’re not accepted at Inland Revenue offices.

Eligibility for the COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP)
==================================================

A business or organisation must have been in business for at least 1 month before 16 February 2022 and experienced at least a 40% drop in revenue over a consecutive 7-day period (7 days in a row) in an affected revenue period, due to one or more [COVID-19 circumstances](/api/glossary/item?id={C306A832-B894-487C-90F6-F46B93F1F835})
. 

Any business in New Zealand that has had this drop in revenue may be eligible if they met the other criteria. 

Eligibility criteria 
---------------------

To be eligible for the CSP, your business or organisation (including sole traders) must have met all the following. 

*   Have been in business for at least 1 month before 16 February 2022.
*   Be physically present in New Zealand.
*   Be [viable and ongoing](/api/glossary/item?id={C174A092-A89C-4325-A808-C72069FE3C59})
    .
*   Have a [New Zealand Business Number](/api/glossary/item?id={8F1D6D7D-DB4E-4A20-86F7-460F8041268E})
    .
*   Have had at least a 40% drop in revenue or capital raising as a result of one or more COVID-19 circumstances.
*   If the applicant is part of a commonly owned group, this 40% drop also needs to be satisfied across the group as a whole.
*   Have taken all reasonably practical steps to minimise the decline in revenue.
*   If it is a [regulated business or service](/api/glossary/item?id={6DF086B9-F87F-41F8-B93A-86C7CAABB379})

     for regulated business or services (whether following the CVC or non-CVC rules) for both the affected revenue period and any comparator period (or part of that period) (in so far as those CVC requirements applied to all or part of those periods).
*   Applicants must be 18 years or older and agree to the terms and conditions set out in the application.
*   If the applicant breaks the terms of the agreement, they will have to repay the CSP - with interest. 

### Ministry of Culture and Heritage – Grant for Self-Employed Individuals 

Self-employed individuals who received, had an application pending for, or is going to apply for or receive in future, funding under the Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Fund – Grant for Self-Employed Individuals, administered by Manatū Taonga - Ministry of Culture and Heritage, were not eligible for the first CSP.  However, they may have been eligible for the 2nd and 3rd CSPs. 

### Government COVID-19 support 

If a business received other Government COVID-19 support, such as the Small Business Cashflow Scheme, Leave Support Scheme, Short Term Absence Payment or the Events Transition Support Payment, they may also have been entitled to the CSP. 

#### Charities, not-for-profit and state sector 

Charities and not-for-profit organisations may have been entitled to the CSP. 

State sector organisations are excluded from the CSP, but could not apply to the Minister of Finance for an exemption to apply for the scheme. 

### Commonly owned groups 

If the business or organisation is part of a commonly owned group, each member of the group may have been eligible for CSP. The business or organisation and the commonly owned group must have both: 

*   experienced at least a 40% drop in revenue 
*   used the same 7-day affected period and the same 7-day comparison period when calculating the drop in revenue. 

[Commonly owned groups](/covid-19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment/eligibility-for-the-csp/commonly-owned-groups)
 

### Businesses not trading yet 

If a business or organisation had taken active steps towards being market ready but had not yet begun trading, you can find out more on our pre-revenue businesses and organisations page.

### Recently acquired businesses 

Businesses that changed ownership after 16 January 2022 may have been to apply for a CSP. To get a CSP, the business: 

*   needs to have met the CSP criteria 
*   must have been operating for at least 1 month before 16 February 2022 
*   activity must have been largely the same as before the change in ownership.

Example: Mountain Peak Adventures - booking cancellations

Mountain Peak Adventure carries on a hotel business in Queenstown. The majority of its customers are overseas travellers from Australia. Due to border restrictions a number of its Australian based customers continue to cancel their previously booked hotel accommodation because they are not able to travel to New Zealand - Mountain Peak Adventure experiences a 60% drop in revenue as a result of these cancellations.  

  Mountain Peak Adventure’s 60% drop in revenue caused by the halt to the trans-Tasman Covid-19 bubble and is not due to one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances. Therefore, they are not eligible for the CSP even though they have experienced a drop in revenue. 

Example: Hungry Dragon - complying with the non-CVC rules

Hungry Dragon Limited operates a popular Chinese restaurant in Nelson. The restaurant on a usual day can only host around 10 people. Due to NZ moving to the Red setting under the CFC the restaurant can now only host 5 people or less. Additionally, due to the lack of space, it is challenging to have the required physical distancing between customers. As a result of this, Hungry Dragon Limited does not find it economical to host customers within the restaurant.  

The directors of Hungry Dragon Limited decide to only offer a takeaway option for their customers so that they are still able to operate. They display their CVC status (indicating that they are non-CVC rule compliant) and have systems or processes to prevent customers from entering their premises except to enable contactless collection of goods. However, even after complying with the non-CVC rules, Hungry Dragon Limited suffers a drop in revenue of 45% due to only being able to offer a takeaway service. 

Hungry Dragon Limited may be eligible to receive the CSP as they are complying with the non-CVC rules, they have taken all practicable steps to minimise the drop in revenue and their drop in revenue is more than 40% as a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances. 

Example: Good Boy Limited - complying with the CVC rules

Good Boy Limited operates a bakery and café in Ponsonby, Auckland. Since New Zealand moved to the Red settings under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, Good Boy Limited has set up their operations so that they comply with the CVC rules. This involves their shop displaying their CVC status, setting up systems and processes to verify their customers’ CVC status, adhering to the fixed capacity limits and relevant seating requirements. Even after complying with the CVC requirements, Good Boy Limited has suffered from a drop in revenue of 50% due to the lack of customers as people choose to work from home as a result of the Omicron outbreak.

Good Boy Limited may be eligible to receive the CSP as they are complying with the CVC requirements and their drop in revenue is more than 40% and is a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances.

Example: Ms Goldie Locks - COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate (CVC) requirements

Ms Goldie Locks operates a small café in the Wellington CBD. Ms Locks does not believe in vaccines and is not happy with the CVC requirements. Under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, hospitality venues can open in the Red setting as long as they follow the CVC requirements, which involves complying with the CVC rules or non-CVC rules. The CVC rules require businesses to have systems and processes to check that each person (including a worker) who is at the premises is carrying a CVC (other than a person who it is reasonable to believe is under the age of 12 years and 3 months). If a hospitality business chooses not to follow the CVC rules, and instead follows the non-CVC rules, it can open for takeaway only.  

Ms Locks does not want to open her café for takeaways only and does not feel the need to follow any of the CVC rules or non-CVC rules detailed in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021. She continues to trade by allowing customers into her café without regard to whether they carry a CVC.  Ms Locks has chosen not to comply with the CVC requirements. Therefore, Ms Locks is not eligible for the CSP, even if the 40% drop in revenue was met.  

Example: Ministry of Culture and Heritage - one off emergency grant

Jonty Glass is a self-employed upcoming artist and had an exhibition planned for 25 February 2022. Due to the increasing COVID-19 infections in the New Zealand community and the restrictions placed on the number of people that can gather in one place, Mr Clark’s exhibition is postponed which means he is unable to sell any of his art works. He applies for and receives the Ministry of Culture and Heritage emergency grant of $5,000 for self-employed individuals. On this basis he is ineligible for the first CSP payment.  

Example: Clockwork Glass - not taking all reasonably practical steps (if any) to minimise revenue losses

Clockwork Glass Ltd operates a restaurant in Auckland which is usually open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner service. The restaurant backs on to 2 large office buildings and most of its customers are staff from these offices.

Following the move to phase 2 of the Omicron response, being 15 February 2022, the director of Clockwork Glass continues to operate as usual 7 days a week. Due to the large number of COVID-19 cases in the New Zealand community, most of Clockwork Glass’s customers have decided to work from home. Clockwork Glass simply decides to close the business in response to the large number of COVID-19 cases and their loss of customers, as opposed to exploring options of how to run the business differently (such as different hours and methods of operation) to adjust to the changing circumstances. Clockwork Glass does not take all reasonably practical steps to minimise their revenue losses and therefore, they are not eligible for the CSP.  

However, suppose that instead of shutting their doors, Clockwork Glass see they are still getting customers for the dinner service. In order to minimise losses, they decide to no longer open for the lunch services but still operate their dinner services. These would be reasonably practical steps to minimise their revenue loss. 

Example: Sparkle Electrical - staff Isolating (CPF and COVID-19 Infections) 

Sparkle Electrical does wiring for businesses. Due to the rising numbers of COVID-19 infections in the New Zealand community, 6 of their 10 staff members were identified as close contacts and need to self-isolate.

The number of employees that Sparkle Electrical had working for them has now reduced by more than half. This has impacted their ability to service their clientele and has resulted in their revenue dropping by 50% compared to the week before New Zealand moved to Phase 2 of the Omicron response being 15 February 2022 (being a typical week).

Sparkle Electrical may be eligible for the CSP as their drop in revenue is more than 40% and is a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances.

Eligibility of goods to be zero-rated for GST purposes
======================================================

2013 case note – exported goods subsequently incorporated in to other goods – Court found goods consumed in NZ and not eligible to be zero-rated.

Case

\[2013\] NZTRA 04 TRA 31/11

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The taxpayer entered into an agreement to export goods to an overseas-based purchaser. After entering the agreement there was a change of approach by the purchaser who arranged for the goods to be used in New Zealand to manufacture different goods. The taxpayer argued that its goods were still ultimately exported and therefore that supply could be zero-rated for goods and services tax ("GST") purposes. The Court found that the underlying goods had been consumed in New Zealand and therefore were not eligible to be zero-rated.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that where there is manufacture, the old goods lose their identity and are consumed within the new goods.

### Facts

The dispute involves a challenge to the Commissioner's assessment disallowing the zero-rating for GST purposes of supplies of stainless steel spheres, made by the disputant, to a company based in the United Kingdom.

The disputant submits that it supplied and exported the spheres to the United Kingdom, and that those supplies accordingly qualified for zero-rating under section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act").

The Commissioner believed that the disputant did not export the goods as required under the GST Act, and therefore incorrectly returned the supplies in the relevant GST period as being zero-rated. The Commissioner contends the spheres were used in New Zealand in the manufacture of a sculpture, which was subsequently exported to the United Kingdom by another party.

Accordingly, the Commissioner made an adjustment to the GST period ending 31 July 2009 to increase the GST payable by the disputant.

### Decision

In regards to the first issue, the disputant argued that the goods exported were the spheres, not the sculpture. The Commissioner contended that the spheres were incorporated into the sculpture here in New Zealand, and it was the sculpture that was exported. Once incorporated in the sculpture the spheres no longer possessed an independent identity and could not constitute "goods" for GST purposes in their own right.

The Commissioner referred to a number of decisions from different jurisdictions and submitted that where there is manufacture, the Courts have held that old goods lose their identity and are consumed within the new goods. Judge Sinclair accepted the Commissioner's submissions that those principles are generally applicable here.

In _Wellington City Council v Attorney General_ \[1990\] 2 NZLR 281 the Court of Appeal observed that whether a particular process has resulted in a product essentially different will be a question of fact and degree. Judge Sinclair found that the sculpture was very different from the spheres. For these reasons, Judge Sinclair found for the purposes of the GST Act the spheres were consumed and used in New Zealand in the manufacture of the sculpture, and accordingly the supplies of spheres were not eligible to be zero-rated.

In regards to the second issue, the Commissioner submitted that what is required by sections 11(1)(a), (b) and (c) is that the supplier of the goods is the person who exports the goods. Judge Sinclair agreed with that submission, and reiterated her earlier finding that it was the sculpture that was exported and this was not exported by the disputant.

In regards to the third issue, the disputant alleged that there was an informal agreement constituting an agency agreement between it and the company that manufactured and exported the sculpture under section 60(1) of the GST Act. The general manager of this company denied they were acting as the disputant's agent. Judge Sinclair also found that ownership of the spheres passed from the disputant to the United Kingdom company in New Zealand so that, at the time of the export, the disputant had no legal or beneficial interest in the spheres now incorporated into the sculpture on which to found an agency arrangement.

Finally, the disputant submitted that the Commissioner has discretion under sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow zero-rating when the supplier does not export the goods. The Commissioner submitted that while she accepts the situation came about due to a change in terms of the disputant's contract of supply with the United Kingdom Company, and not because of any deliberate attempt to avoid payment of its tax obligation, she has no discretion to zero-rate the supply.

Judge Sinclair accepted the Commissioner's submissions that the care and management responsibilities set out in sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not authorise her to interpret or apply the GST Act in a manner which is inconsistent with the scheme of the legislation. In the present case, section 11(1) of the GST Act specifically requires that the supplier be the exporter. The GST Act does not provide any discretion to the Commissioner to deem someone to be the exporter to meet this requirement.

Ko wai ka taea te utu, te whiwhi rānei i te Takuhe Tiaki Tamariki? Who can pay or receive child support?
========================================================================================================

Being eligible for child support depends on:

*   whether your children qualify for child support
*   whether the other [parent](/api/glossary/item?id={4B4E9057-5321-4C5B-9F4E-3D13C76FAEE5})
    , or both parents if applying as a [non-parent carer](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
    , can be made liable
*   the amount of care you provide.

If you and your child are living in Australia, you should apply for child support through Services Australia.

[Child support in New Zealand and Australia](/child-support/overseas/australia)

If the parent of the child you want to make liable for child support is not a NZ citizen but lives in a [2007 Child Support Convention](/api/glossary/item?id={389FC8B1-8B62-4A99-9627-DCF293805298})
 country, you can apply to us for a child support formula assessment.

Child support definitions of 'child', 'liable parent', and 'ongoing daily care of a child'

Does child support apply to you?

Choose a definition Does your child qualify for child support? Are you a liable parent? What about your level of daily care for your child?

To qualify for child support, the child must:

*   be under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school. If a child is 18 and still enrolled at and attending a school, then child support ends on 31 of December of the year they turn 18
*   not be married, in a de facto relationship or civil union
*   be financially dependent, that is under the age of 16 or aged 16 and not working more than 30 hours a week on average or receiving a benefit or student allowance
*   be a New Zealand citizen or [ordinarily resident](/api/glossary/item?id={DC1E35F3-44F9-4F6C-8EE4-5F02E75DA5B4})
     in New Zealand

If you're unsure whether your children are New Zealand citizens, you can check this with the New Zealand Government.

[Check if you are a citizen (New Zealand Government)](https://www.govt.nz/browse/passports-citizenship-and-identity/nz-citizenship/proof-of-citizenship/check-if-you-are-a-citizen/)
 If your children often travel overseas, you can see whether they are spending most of their time in New Zealand by checking their tax residency status. If they are [New Zealand tax residents](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
, they are ordinarily resident in New Zealand.

Sometimes for child support, we need to decide whether or not a person will be or will continue to be ordinarily resident. In these cases we may consider the person's intentions to live or not live in New Zealand.

[Tax residency status for individuals](https://www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

In order to be a liable parent for child support, the person must either:

*   be the birth or legally adoptive parent of the child
*   have been married to the other parent when the child was conceived or born
*   have acknowledged before a court, or in writing, that they are a parent of the child
*   have been declared a legal step-parent by the Family Court
*   have had a court make a paternity order in respect of the child

They must also be either:

*   a New Zealand citizen
*   ordinarily resident in New Zealand
*   ordinarily resident in Australia,
*   ordinarily resident in Australia, or in a [2007 Child Support Convention country](/api/glossary/item?id={389FC8B1-8B62-4A99-9627-DCF293805298})
    , as we have agreements for child support.

The [formula assessment](/api/glossary/item?id={685B102C-017F-44EE-BB14-BF34C28EE726})
 for child support recognises that a parent provides for their child if they give ongoing daily care for at least 28% of the time. This is called [recognised care](/api/glossary/item?id={111F9E51-131C-472D-8F36-8E0465CD1C82})
.

A [parent](/api/glossary/item?id={4B4E9057-5321-4C5B-9F4E-3D13C76FAEE5})
 or [non-parent carer](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
 will not receive child support unless they provide ongoing daily care for at least 35% of the time.

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Eligibilty requirements (section LH 3)
======================================

2007 legislation covering eligibility requirements for research and development tax credits.

**Eligibility requirements (section LH 3)**

To claim the credit, the claimant must satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) which are listed below.

**R&D must be related to the business of the claimant (paragraph (a))**

A claimant must perform on its own behalf, or have another person perform on its behalf, R&D related to the claimant's business or intended business.

This means that there must be a connection or link between the R&D activity and the general area of the claimant's business. This requirement will generally be satisfied when the results of the activity (if successful) would have a direct and beneficial application in the claimant's business. Similarly, the requirement would be satisfied if the activity results in an extension of that business.

To show that the R&D relates to an intended business, the claimant must have a reasonable expectation, at the time that the activity is carried out, to exploit the results commercially in an extension of its business or in a new business if the R&D is successful.

In the case of industry research co-operatives, the R&D must be related to the business of an industry member. The requirements for industry research co-operatives and industry members are discussed below in relation to section LH 16.

**Claimants must bear the risk, have control over the project and effectively own the results (paragraph (b) to (d))**

Claimants must be able to show that they control the R&D activities, bear the financial risk associated with the project and effectively own the project results.

The tests in section LH 3(1)(b) to (d) are intended to ensure that the tax credit goes to the party making R&D investment decisions - that is, the party deciding what R&D should be undertaken to enhance its business activity. They aim to maximise the capture of spillover benefits.

If R&D activities are subcontracted, the rules act to prevent double dipping. The credit goes to the party commissioning the R&D, and not to someone who performs the R&D on behalf of the other person.

In some cases, no one will be eligible to claim a tax credit for the R&D activity carried out in New Zealand. This could happen if the activity is being carried out on behalf of an ineligible entity, or because no entity can demonstrate that it controls, bears the financial risk of, and effectively owns the results of the activity.

Parties to an unincorporated joint venture, or partners of a partnership (if the partnership consists of only eligible partners), can apply these tests as though the joint venture or partnership performed the R&D activity as an entity in its own right. See the discussion below on sections LH 3(3) and (4).

**Controlling the R&D activity**

Claimants must have control of the R&D activity. This means they must have the ability to:

*   determine the R&D activities to be undertaken;
*   decide on major changes of direction;
*   stop an unproductive line of research;
*   follow up on an unexpected result; and
*   terminate the activities or project.

The control requirements can still be met if the R&D activity is contracted out to a provider who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the work. The commissioner of the research will be eligible for the credit as long as it meets the control requirements above.

This may mean that the claimant exercises that control at the beginning of an arrangement and is bound by it for the duration of the work. For example, a provider may only undertake a programme of work if the party commissioning it agrees to bind itself to finance the whole programme. In these situations the claimant is not considered to have given away control, but made choices in the contract in advance. Even then, the claimant should be entitled to check that the programme is being carried out and require the researcher to act according to the arrangement.

If a business contracts another entity to carry out the R&D activity on its behalf, and that entity subcontracts that work to a third party, the R&D activity is still done on behalf of the original commissioning business, not on behalf of the intermediary contractor.

It is possible to exercise control decisions before a project begins. For example, before the work begins the parties could agree what R&D will be undertaken and what criteria should be used to determine whether a line of research is unproductive and should be terminated.

Where a major researcher determines a programme of research and actively seeks industry participants to fund the work, it may still be possible for the industry participants to meet the control requirements.

While the researcher may have independently formulated the R&D programme and control day-to-day management, it is subject to the agreement between the industry participants and the researcher. Essentially, the industry participants exercise joint control when they choose to participate and enter into the arrangement to fund the work programme.

A business's owners have the ultimate ability to control the activity by exercising their proprietary rights, but this does not undermine the demonstration of control of the activities by the business.

**Financial risk**

The claimant must bear the financial risk of the R&D activity.

If the R&D activity is outsourced, the claimant can be taken to be bearing the financial risk if it is required to pay for the activity to be carried out, regardless of the outcome of the activity. A party receiving payment for carrying out R&D regardless of the outcome of the activity is unlikely to be bearing the financial risk in relation to those funds.

"At risk" contracting is where the contractor works on the basis that its fee is not payable unless the R&D work succeeds. In this situation, the party contracting out the work would not be eligible for the tax credit. The contractor may be eligible for the tax credit if it meets the eligibility requirements in its own right.

Businesses may want to reduce the financial risk of undertaking R&D by finding another party to contribute to financing of the work. If they enter into an agreement to fund eligible R&D activity with another person, they may be eligible for the tax credit for their share of the expenditure. They are required to bear the financial risk in relation to their expenditure, not for all of the expenditure on the work.

The application of funds from donations to carry out R&D activities does not in itself mean that the claimant is not bearing the financial risk of carrying out the R&D activity. An expectation that the funds be applied for a particular purpose is not in itself fatal to the claim by the recipient that it bears the financial risk of doing the R&D.

**Effective ownership of results**

Effective ownership of the results of the R&D activity means that the claimant must have the ability to exploit the results for gain without further fee or payment. That is, the claimant must have gained the right to use the results of the activity in its business without incurring further costs. It does not require the claimant to formally own the intellectual property or results arising from the project.

While ownership can be shared, the claimant must retain sufficient rights to have reasonable commercial use of the results, commensurate with its contribution to the work.

Effectively owning the results does not require the claimant to own the intellectual property. Intellectual property such as copyright, a patent or a registered design, may not be available to protect the results.

It is also possible to have all the advantages of ownership without actually owning the intellectual property. The claimant may have the right to use a patent, to require the patent to be licensed, to restrict or direct further development based on the patent, all without further fee or payment, and not be the formal holder of the patent.

Some rights of ownership may be given to others without denying the effective ownership of the results. For example, a business having R&D carried out on its behalf might completely control commercial use of the results of that R&D (including further development of those results for commercial purposes), but allow the researcher exclusive scientific publication rights.

Similarly, actual use of particular results may only be possible in limited ways or for limited purposes, which means limited rights can amount to full effective ownership. For example, exclusive rights of commercial use and development for only a few years might amount to full ownership in a particularly fast-changing area.

A share in ownership of overall results may also amount to acceptable ownership. For example, if a business does R&D that builds on existing research results belonging to another person, the business may take a share of the overall results. The interest must match its contribution to the overall research.

If the R&D activity does not result in a product or patent, but results in new knowledge (perhaps published in a scientific paper), one way this requirement could be satisfied is if the business has been granted a preferential right to use the results of the activity. A preferential right could be access to unpublished results or early access to results.

Subsequent sale of the results does not change the effective ownership of the results at the time the eligible R&D was conducted. However, R&D carried out under an agreement that required the disposal of results or commercial rights for inadequate return will suggest less than effective ownership of the results.

It is possible that the R&D activity is unsuccessful and there are no exploitable results from it. This does not mean that the claimant does not effectively own the results of the activity.

**Deductible expenditure or depreciation loss (paragraph (e))**

The claimant must incur expenditure or depreciation that is of a type listed in Schedule 21, Part A and not a type listed in Part B. It must also be deductible in the year in which it is incurred. There are exceptions to the deductibility requirement for expenditure in deriving tax-exempt income, certain capital expenditure referred to in section LH 5(4) and deferred expenditure referred to in section LH 5(5).

For tax-exempt income, the requirement is that the expenditure or depreciation would be deductible if the person derived income other than tax-exempt income.

**Partnership with entities excluded under section LH 1(2) (subsection 2)**

R&D activities done in partnership with an entity referred to in section LH 1(2) are not eligible for a tax credit. Section LH 1(2) excludes anyone who is:

*   a Crown Research Institute, a tertiary institution, or a District Health Board;
*   associated with a Crown Research Institute, a tertiary institution, or a District Health Board; or
*   controlled by one or more of these entities.

This is to prevent partnership structures being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility.

**Partnerships (subsection 3)**

Paragraph (a) makes it possible for the business tests and the minimum threshold to be applied at the partnership level even though individual partners will be claiming the tax credit in relation to R&D activities carried out on behalf of the partners.

The requirements for claimants to be in business in NewZealand (section LH 1(1)(a)), for their R&D activity to be related to either that business or an intended new business (subsection (1)(a)(i)), and the minimum threshold for eligible expenditure can be applied at a partnership level, with the partnership treated as the entity performing the R&D activities.

Partners will be taken to have met these requirements in relation to the R&D activity if the partnership (treated as the entity carrying out the R&D activities) would meet those requirements.

Paragraph (b) allows partnerships consisting of only eligible partners to apply the requirements to control the R&D activity, bear the financial risk of undertaking the work, and effectively own the results of the activity at the partnership level.

If the partnership, treated as an entity performing the R&D activities, meets those requirements, the partners will be treated as meeting those requirements.

Partners in partnership with partners who do not meet the requirements of section LH 1 must meet the control, risk, and ownership requirements in their own right. This is to prevent partnership structures being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility.

The government will review these rules once the Limited Partnership Bill is enacted.

##### Example

A and B have been in business for the whole year as partnership C. A and B have equal interests in the partnership.

1.  The firm carries out R&D and has eligible expenditure of $15,000. A has other eligible expenditure on R&D activities of $16,000. A can claim the concession in relation to $23,500 of expenditure. She meets the minimum threshold in her own right.
2.  The firm carries out R&D and has $22,000 of eligible expenditure. B has other eligible expenditure on R&D of $5,000. B can claim the concession in relation to $11,000 (her share of the firm's eligible expenditure). The firm has met the threshold, but B does not meet the threshold in her own right and therefore cannot claim the credit in relation to the other $5,000 of eligible expenditure.
3.  The firm carries out R&D and has eligible expenditure of $18,000. A has other eligible expenditure on R&D activities of $4,000. A is not eligible to claim the concession. Neither the firm nor A (in her own right) has met the minimum threshold.

**Joint ventures (subsection 4)**

Subsection 4 allows parties performing R&D as part of an unincorporated joint venture to apply the requirements to control the R&D activity, bear the financial risk of undertaking the work, and effectively own the results of the activity at the joint venture level.

If the joint venture, treated as an entity performing the R&D activities, meets those requirements, then the parties to the joint venture will be treated as meeting those requirements. While the financial risk can be shared between the parties, each party can only claim the tax credit in relation to their share of the expenditure for which they bear the financial risk.

Parties may establish a company to carry out R&D activities (incorporated joint venture). For the company to claim the credit it will need to show the R&D activities have been carried out on its own behalf and not on behalf of its shareholders. The company will be required to meet the requirements to control the activity, bear the financial risk of doing the work, and own the results. The fact that the shareholders may expect an indirect benefit through dividends does not mean the company is carrying out R&D activities on their behalf.

Ngā mahi māraurau mō te whakahekenga tāke ngaromanga rangahau me te whakawhanake Eligible activities for the R&D loss tax credit
================================================================================================================================

This page sets out what activities are eligible for a research and development (R&D) loss tax credit. It also shows those activities that are not eligible for the tax credit.

Your research and development (R&D) should be a study to gain new knowledge of a scientific or technical nature. This can result in new or large improvements to materials, products, devices, processes or services.

Research activities
-------------------

Your research must:

*   be original
*   involve a planned investigation.

Planned investigations should be about gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. 

### Original 

Original is defined as being new. That is, not already available publicly or commercially. This also covers research and development to create something new for your company.

### Planned

Planned is defined as a proposed strategy for a future goal. There should be a stated end result and a structured approach for achieving this.

### Investigation

Investigation is defined as a series of processes with clear steps to gain new knowledge.

### New knowledge

New knowledge refers to a new theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. For example, knowledge that was unknown before and not expected.

Development
-----------

Development uses research findings to produce new, innovative or substantially improved:

*   materials
*   devices
*   products
*   processes
*   systems
*   services.  

### Substantial improvement

Substantial improvement has a high threshold. It is more than just an improvement and should be easily recognised. There should be an identifiable amount of originality and innovation.

### Innovation

This is the way to tell if your project is R&D. It separates your project from business-as-usual activities.

### Development activities excluded for the R&D loss tax credit 

There are development activities excluded for the purposes of the R&D loss tax credit.

*   Activities that happen before commercial production. These also known as pre-production activities. For example, tooling-up, trial runs, production planning, and start-up procedures.
*   Activities that have moved into commercial production.
*   Activities that seek to duplicate work already developed by others. These are not R&D unless you can show that the knowledge is not available to the company, for example, a trade secret.
*   Activities that reproduce existing product or process, for example, reverse engineering. 

Examples of areas considered to be R&D

The following are examples of what may be considered R&D and must meet the definition for the R&D loss tax credit: 

*   A deliberate search for new knowledge, intellectual property and know-how.
*   A clearly defined project with separate and identifiable costs.
*   Results written up as part of a knowledge capture during or at the end of an R&D project.
*   Freedom to Operate (FTO) search and analysis as part of planning and scoping the R&D project. FTO is required when determining whether valid intellectual property rights exist, or will be infringed.

**Software**

*   Application programme interfacing where unknown programme interactions require new technical solutions.
*   Complex data capture and analysis requiring new technical solutions.

Examples of areas considered not to be R&D

The following are examples of some areas that aren't considered R&D for the purposes of the R&D loss tax credit:

*   Exploring if something is already known compared to gaining new knowledge.
*   Reverse engineering or copying compared to substantially improving something.
*   Routine design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies, seasonal or other periodic design changes to existing products.
*   Adapting an existing product or process to a particular customer's need or site. 
*   Drafting documents to publish or communicate research results. 
*   Work to implement or comply with international quality management systems, for example, ISO 9001.
*   Clinical trials beyond Phase II.

**Software**

*   Supporting, de-bugging or making minor improvements to existing computer software.
*   Business support systems or infrastructure development, for example, a database built to manage the company's research projects.
*   Business-as-usual software development without noticeable innovation. 
*   Database creation.
*   Improvements to existing software and systems. 
*   Cross-platform development and programming.
*   User interface design, dashboard creation, front-end functionality design and development. 
*   Automated data capture and analysis.
*   Adding modules to existing software unless it can be show that something is significantly different to what is already available. 
*   Development of industry standard products not noticeably different from what is currently available.

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Eligible expenditure (Schedule 21, Part A)
==========================================

2007 legislation covering the research and development tax credit, and eligible expenditure (Schedule 21, Part A). Examples included.

Only the following expenditure is eligible for the credit:

*   salaries and other remuneration of employees conducting R&D;
*   depreciation of tangible assets used in conducting R&D;
*   costs of staff training, recruitment, relocation and travel incurred directly as a result of R&D;
*   the cost of materials incorporated into prototypes;
*   certain overheads that relate to administration, human resources, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and security;
*   rates, utilities, insurance and leasing of buildings, plant and equipment;
*   the cost of items consumed, and the net cost of items processed or transformed in R&D activities; and
*   payments to an entity or person for R&D services performed on behalf of the claimant.

**Salary and other remuneration of employees conducting R&D (clause 1)**

Salary, wages, allowances, bonuses, commissions, extra salary, overtime, fringe benefits, holiday pay and long-service pay paid to an employee who is conducting SIE or supporting R&D activities are eligible for the credit. Superannuation contributions, fringe benefit tax, specified superannuation contribution withholding tax and insurances paid for such employees are also eligible.

If an employee works part-time on R&D, the credit only applies to remuneration in relation to that portion of the employee's time that is spent on R&D.

**Depreciation of tangible property (clause 2))**

Annual depreciation on **tangible** property used in conducting R&D is eligible (depreciation on intangible property is excluded under Part B, clause 15). The credit is available to the extent the property is used in conducting R&D (the excess above this is excluded under Part B, clause 5).

Depreciation attracts the credit in two circumstances:

*   for "facilitative" assets that are used in the R&D process but are not the object of the R&D; and
*   for certain "end-result" assets that are the object of the R&D and are used in the R&D process (for example, for testing, analysis and data recording).

##### Example: Facilitative assets

ACo has a computer that is used 20 percent of the time on R&D, and 20 percent on other activities. For the remaining 60 percent of the time it is idle (evenings, weekends and holidays). The credit may be claimed in relation to 50 percent of the annual depreciation deduction.

**End result assets**

Paragraphs (b) and (c) relate to depreciable tangible assets that are developed as the object of the R&D activities and that are to be used in the business other than in the R&D process. Expenditure on developing these assets does not attract the credit when it is incurred. Rather, the credit may be able to be claimed in relation to depreciation on such an asset while it is being used in the R&D process (for example, for testing) provided construction of the asset is an eligible R&D activity. This requires that either the construction itself is a SIE activity (a sufficiently innovative construction technique) or that it is a support activity (mainly for the purpose of, required for and integral to, the SIE activity).

##### Example

ACo is a utility company experimenting with a new material for underground pipes. It constructs a small area of the network for testing before rolling out the pipes in the region. Assume that the construction of that part of the network is an eligible support activity (that is, it is mainly for the purpose of, is required for and integral to, the SIE R&D). The pipes supply gas to the neighbourhood and will remain in place following the test if they are satisfactory. The salary and materials inputs into construction of the pipe network are not eligible for the credit when they are incurred, but depreciation on the network may be eligible while it is being tested.

Construction of an asset that is mainly for non-R&D commercial purposes is not eligible for the credit at all.

The credit does not apply to depreciation of an end-result asset if the expenditure incurred in its development would be eligible for the credit as it is incurred.

**No clawback or loss on sale**

To minimise compliance costs, there is no clawback of credits on disposal of assets for more than their tax book value. When an asset is sold to an associate for more than its book value, the price above the vendor's book value does not attract the credit in the hands of the associated purchaser (Part B, clause 6).

Generally, any loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property also does not attract the credit. However, there is an exception in relation to certain end-result assets that are a failure and written off. The exclusion in relation to loss on sale is discussed further below under "ineligible expenditure" (Schedule 21, Part B - clause 2).

**Pooled property**

The credit does not apply to depreciable assets in a tax depreciation pool unless the pool consists solely of R&D assets used wholly in conducting R&D.

**Depreciation of asset by business with tax-exempt income**

Special rules are provided in section LH 14 to calculate the amount of depreciation loss in relation to tax-exempt entities.

**Employee training, recruitment, relocation and travel (clause 3)**

The cost of training, recruitment, relocation and travel of employees is eligible when it is incurred directly as a result of R&D activities.

**Materials incorporated into prototype products and plant (clause 4)**

The cost of materials incorporated into a trial model or preliminary version of a product or plant is eligible for the credit.

**Overhead costs (clauses 5 and 6, and section LH 8)**

Certain listed expenditure on overheads is eligible for the credit. Apportionment is required when overheads are only in part incurred directly for R&D activities.

If the overheads relate to administration of internal business activities, the human resources section of a business, repairs and maintenance, or cleaning and security, then employee remuneration, consumables and payments to contractors for services are eligible.

Rates, utilities (including telecommunications) and insurance and the cost of leasing buildings, plant and equipment are also eligible.

Overheads must be incurred **_directly_** for R&D activities. For example, while part of a cleaner's salary will be eligible if he cleans the R&D laboratory, and part of the secretary's salary will be eligible if she supports R&D personnel, the cleaning of the secretary's office is not eligible.

There is a regulatory power to exclude overheads that are too remotely connected with the R&D. The broad intention is that overheads not eligible for the 125 percent concession in Australia will be excluded in New Zealand. Examples include directors' fees, entertainment expenses, and canteen and recreational facilities.

Remuneration of employees performing SIE or support R&D activities are eligible under clause 1, not clause 5. Support activities must be integral to - that is, part of - SIE activities. This would include, for example, the salary of a technician collecting data used in experiments. Human resources personnel, cleaners and security officers generally do not perform activities that would be part of the R&D project so their remuneration will be eligible (if at all) as overheads under clause 5.

This clause does not include depreciation deductions, which may only be claimed under clause 2.

##### Example

ACo has an R&D division with employees engaged full-time in R&D. The human resources officer spends on average 10 percent of her time attending to issues relating to that division. These are considered to be directly related to R&D activities, so 10 percent of her remuneration is eligible.

ACo employs a cleaner who spends 10 percent of her time cleaning the R&D division. Again, this is considered to be directly related to R&D activities, so 10 percent of her remuneration is eligible. However, the cleaning of the human resource officer's office is not directly related to R&D activities.

**Items consumed in R&D activities (clause 7)**

Items consumed in the R&D process are eligible for the credit. This would include, for example, laboratory chemicals and stationery.

**Net cost of items processed or transformed in R&D process (clause 8)**

For items that are processed or transformed during R&D activities, only the net expenditure is eligible - that is, the excess of the cost of the items which are the subject of processing or transformation, over the value of the output. The value of the output is the sale proceeds when the products are sold in an arm's-length transaction and, when they are not, the market value of the products.

The provision applies to the acquisition or production of raw materials or products that are "put through" an R&D process. This will most often be trading stock and would include the catching of fish put through an experimental fish processing plant, milk processed into powder in an experimental drying process, sheep shorn or cows milked in an experimental process and timber acquired and cut using a novel technique.

It encompasses the manufacture or acquisition of a product that does not change during the R&D process or changes in a manner that is not visible.

**Payments to a person for R&D services (clause 9)**

When part or all of an R&D project is outsourced, a payment to the person or entity conducting the R&D is eligible. The performer of the R&D does not get a credit because it would fail the requirement to control the project, bear the risk and effectively own the results. When the R&D is outsourced to an associate, some of the payment is likely to be ineligible under Part B, clause 3.

The payment must relate only to the R&D conducted by the third party. If the payment is for multiple items (such as R&D services and marketing), costs must be separately identified.

The provision applies to payments for both SIE and supporting activities and covers the costs of engaging independent contractors, agency workers and temporary staff to work on R&D.

To be eligible for the credit, expenditure must be listed in Schedule 21, Part A and not listed in Schedule 21, Part B. The intention is that generally expenditure in Part B is ineligible whether it is incurred by the claimant in doing its R&D inhouse or when the R&D is contracted out to a third party.

For example, if a Crown Research Institute, performing contract R&D for an eligible business, arranges for the work to be subcontracted overseas, the expenditure limit in relation to overseas R&D still applies. The same principle applies to internal software development.

The wording of certain restrictions - for example, section LH 6 (for R&D done overseas) and Part B clause 9 (internal software development) - achieves this already. However, it is not so clear in relation to other clauses in Part B. The government will review this at the earliest opportunity. Businesses should not be able to avoid rules relating to excluded expenditure by outsourcing R&D.

Ngā whakapaunga māraurau mō te whakahekenga tāke mō te ngaromanga rangahau me te whakawhanake Eligible expenditure for the R&D loss tax credit
==============================================================================================================================================

R&D expenditure is tax deductible expenditure that is spent on eligible R&D activities. Eligible R&D expenditure must be: 

*   tax deductible 
*   spent on eligible R&D activities
*   incurred on goods and services to the extent that they relate to R&D.

Any intellectual property or know-how resulting from the R&D must be owned (either solely or jointly) by the company incurring the expenditure.

Eligible R&D expenditure includes: 

*   salaries and other remuneration of employees doing R&D, including, salaries or wages, shareholder-employee salaries, bonuses, holiday pay and fringe benefit tax
*   depreciation of tangible (physical) assets used in R&D
*   costs of staff training, recruitment, relocation, travel incurred as a direct result of R&D
*   the costs of materials used in prototypes
*   directly related overheads for administration, personnel, cleaning and security, repairs and maintenance, utilities, rates, insurance and leasing of buildings, plant and equipment
*   the costs of consumable items used in R&D activities
*   payments to an entity or person conducting R&D on behalf of their claimant.  

Apportionment of expenditure
----------------------------

Typically a company will carry out an R&D project alongside their regular business activities. You must separate R&D expenditure from a company's business-as-usual costs.

Some situations may arise where it is not possible to directly allocate all of an expense to a project. This includes overhead costs which are incurred by the company in running its day-to-day business activities

An apportionment method must be used to estimate costs incurred on the R&D project. This method should follow the same rules as those required for the apportionment of deductible income tax expenditure.

The company must be able to show that an approved method has been applied to arrive at an accurate apportionment.

Contractors
-----------

In some cases you may need to engage an external contractor. The full cost (excluding GST) associated with a contractor can be included as R&D expenditure. Contracted R&D includes:

*   R&D outsourced to a research provider, for example, Plant and Food Research
*   contracted staff, for example, temporary staff member to assist with the project
*   contracted or outsourced specialists, for example, a consultant subject-matter expert
*   a specialist workshop to produce prototype machinery parts.

The intellectual property and know-how resulting from any outsourced R&D must remain in the company contracting the services, not the external contractor.

Ineligible expenditure
----------------------

Certain expenditure and activities are excluded and cannot be included in the company's eligible R&D expenditure during the income year.

Expenditure is ineligible if it is:

*   spent on goods and services which relate to an excluded activity
*   spent on goods and services used to provide a service of R&D to another person, or used to further another person's R&D activities
*   does not give rise to a deduction for the income year
*   is for or under a financial arrangement
*   is for the acquisition or transfer of:
    *   intangible property
    *   core technology
    *   intellectual property
    *   know-how.

Ineligible activities
---------------------

Expenditure on some activities is ineligible for the R&D loss tax credit. These activities are:

*   those performed outside of New Zealand
*   acquiring or disposing of land, and related activities, except if the land is used exclusively for housing research or development facilities
*   acquiring, disposing of, or transferring intangible property, core technology, intellectual property, or know-how and related activities, for example, drafting sale and purchase agreements for patents
*   prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy
*   research in social sciences, arts, or humanities
*   market research, market testing, market development, or sales promotion, including consumer surveys
*   quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes, or services
*   making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes, or services
*   routine collection of information
*   commercial, legal, and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing, or other activities
*   activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards
*   management studies or efficiency surveys
*   reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications, or publicly available information
*   re-production activities, such as a demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up, and trial runs.

[Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-annual-rates-employee-allowances-and-remedial-matters-act-2014 "Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014")

Employee allowances
===================

2014 changes to the taxation of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other payments made by employers to cover employee expenditure.

#### _Sections CE 1, CE 1B, CE 1C, CE 1D, CE 1E, CE 5, CW 16B, CW 16C, CW 16D, CW 16E, CW 16F, CW 17, CW 17CB, CW 17CC, CX 19, CZ 23, CZ 29, CZ 30 and CZ 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Changes have been made to the taxation of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments made by employers to cover employee expenditure.

From 1 April 2015, a new set of rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 replaces the previous rules applying to accommodation, allowances and payments. The rules can be applied retrospectively in some cases.

These changes are intended to bring greater clarity and cohesion to the rules, making it easier for taxpayers to understand and comply with their obligations.

### Key features

The key changes are as follows.

#### _Accommodation_

*   Time limits on when accommodation provided in relation to out-of-town secondments and capital projects is non-taxable (up to two years for secondments and three years for capital projects);
*   A special transitional rule for Canterbury earthquake recovery projects;
*   A multiple workplace rule that exempts accommodation provided when an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis;
*   An exemption for accommodation provided when an employee is required to attend a meeting, training course or conference as part of their job that requires at least an overnight stay;
*   Confirmation that the taxable value of accommodation provided is the market rental value, less any rent paid by the employee and any adjustment for business use of the accommodation;
*   Specific exclusions from the definition of "accommodation";
*   A specific valuation rule for accommodation supplied by religious bodies to their ministers (confirming a longstanding administrative practice);
*   A specific valuation rule for accommodation provided by the New Zealand Defence Force to personnel, reflecting the specific limitations imposed on these properties;
*   Capping the taxable value of employer-funded accommodation as part of an overseas posting at the average or median rental value for accommodation in the vicinity that the employee would live in if in New Zealand.

#### _Meals_

*   Exempting meal payments linked to work travel, subject to a three-month upper time limit at a particular work location;
*   Exempting without time limit meal payments and light refreshments outside of work-related travel, such as at conferences.

#### _Clothing_

*   Payments provided to cover the cost of distinctive work clothing, such as uniforms, will be exempt (mirroring the treatment under the fringe benefit tax rules);
*   Payments to meet the costs of plain clothes allowances paid to members of a uniformed service who are required to wear ordinary clothing instead of their uniform will also be exempt, provided certain conditions are met.

#### _Other_

*   A power allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to issue a determination in relation to an expenditure payment made to a wide group or class of employees, determining the extent to which the particular type of expense payment is taxable. A determination will be binding on the Commissioner but not the taxpayer, meaning it will act as a safe harbour.

### Background

Over recent years there have been some significant concerns around the tax treatment of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances, reimbursements and payments by employers to cover employee expenditure (generically referred to as employee expenditure payments). Previous tax legislation could lead to impractical outcomes that may have differed from the way employers applied the rules in practice.

Under the previous rules, when an employee expenditure payment was made, provided it was to cover a work expense, it was not taxable, as long as there was no private, domestic or capital element to the expense. This treatment matched the general deductibility rules in the legislation. However, when there was a private or domestic element in the linked expense, that element was taxable. This was because it was considered to be in effect an alternative to receiving more salary or wages, which would be taxed.

An expense is private or domestic in nature if it is intended to further some personal purpose or provide a private or domestic benefit. As meals, accommodation and normal clothing are inherently private benefits, the starting position under tax law is that any employee expenditure payment to cover these sorts of expenses should be taxed.

In many instances, however, the private aspect is either incidental to the business objective or is minimal or hard to measure, and apportionment between the private and employment purpose is not practical given the compliance costs associated with separating out the relative elements. Accordingly, under the new rules, specific exemption provisions apply the principle that the private amount should be ignored when it is low in value or hard to measure, and is not provided as a substitute for salary or wages.

The new rules were developed after significant consultation, both leading up to the release of the November 2012 issues paper, _Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments,_ and subsequently. A total of 27 submissions were received on the suggestions in the officials' issues paper. Most focussed on the tax treatment of accommodation expenses, and establishing a boundary between private and work-related expenditure.

Subsequently, Inland Revenue officials carried out further consultation with key stakeholders, including the Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. The main area of concern was that any new rules should encompass not only work-related secondments but also employee involvement in longer-term projects. Those projects included work on the Canterbury earthquake recovery and projects in other locations throughout New Zealand (for example, the ultra-fast broadband roll-out, dam rebuilds and other major water storage projects, and road building projects). The legislation introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill took this feedback into account.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee received 25 written submissions (from 20 submitters) on the employee allowances provisions in the bill. Generally, submitters were supportive of the overall aims of the changes, subject to areas where clarifications or amendments were sought. As with the earlier consultation, the majority of submissions were in relation to the accommodation rules. The Committee recommended the following changes:

*   Four exceptions where accommodation provided in connection with employment would not be subject to tax, to allow for situations involving shift work or remote workplaces when it is considered it would be inappropriate to tax accommodation provided in connection with employment. The exceptions cover mobile workplaces such as ships, trucks or oil rigs, a station in Antarctica, lodging provided for shift workers such as fire-fighters, ambulance staff and care-givers, and accommodation provided at remote locations where an employee is expected to "fly in and out", such as mines in Australia.
*   A regulation-making power so other exceptions can be made in future – while the exceptions provided in the legislation are considered reasonably comprehensive, there may be unforeseen situations that arise when it would be inappropriate for work-related accommodation to be taxed.
*   Allow uneven apportionment of shared accommodation if the employees involved and their employer agree it is reasonable – for example, to reflect a difference in the size of their rooms.
*   Refine and simplify the valuation rule for accommodation provided by churches to ministers of religion.
*   Amend the rule regarding accommodation provided in relation to secondments or capital projects to better allow for situations when expectations about the length of secondment change.
*   Include snack foods within exempt "light refreshments" and remove the requirement for an employee to work at least seven hours in order to be entitled to exempt light refreshments.
*   Allow application of the new work-related meal rules to be backdated to 1 April 2011, provided the employer has not treated the work-related meals as taxable, to allow the status quo to continue without the need to reopen tax positions (provided they fall within the new rules).

### Application dates

The majority of the amendments apply from 1 April 2015.

However, employers have the option to backdate the accommodation rules to accommodation provided from 1 January 2011 provided they have not taken a tax position before 6 December 2012 that the accommodation was taxable.

Similarly, employers have the option to apply the work-related meal rules from 1 April 2011, provided they have not already taken a tax position that the expenditure was taxable.

Other exceptions:

*   The distinctive work clothing rule applies from 1 July 2013.
*   The transitional rules for Canterbury earthquake-related accommodation are treated as coming into force on 4 September 2010.
*   The transitional rule for New Zealand Defence Force-provided accommodation is treated as coming into force on 6 December 2012.

Detailed analysis
-----------------

The main taxing provisions for accommodation remain in section CE 1, which deals with amounts derived in connection with employment. This section includes a definition of "accommodation" which includes board or lodging, and the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof), whether permanent or temporary.

The inclusive aspect of the definition of "accommodation" is unchanged from the previous rules. Ordinarily, "board or lodging" can refer to the provision of the employee's meals and somewhere to sleep. When an employee is provided with a self-contained living space with most of the facilities necessary for independent living, what is provided is the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof). We expect, in practice, that in most cases what is provided is the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof).

### Exclusions from the definition of "accommodation"

Under the new rules the definition of "accommodation" in section CE 1 has been modified by introducing four specific exclusions involving shift work or remote workplaces, namely:

*   a berth, room or other lodging provided on a mobile workplace such as a ship, truck or oil rig;
*   a station in Antarctica;
*   lodging provided for shift workers such as fire-fighters, ambulance staff and care-givers when they are periodically required to sleep at their workplace, and the accommodation is provided only for the duration of the performance of the duties; and
*   accommodation provided at remote locations outside New Zealand, such as mines in Australia, where an employee is expected to "fly in and fly out".

In addition, section CE 1(4) enables the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to make regulations to add to the types of accommodation that are excluded from the definition of "accommodation". While the exceptions provided are considered reasonably comprehensive, there may be other situations that arise in future when it would also be inappropriate for work-related accommodation to be taxed.

Section CE 1 includes an expanded definition of "employer" to ensure that accommodation provided by an overseas employer is covered. The expanded definition also covers situations when an employee is seconded by their employer (Company A) to another company (Company B), and the accommodation is provided by Company B, but the employee remains employed by and paid by Company A.

### "Accommodation" that is tax-exempt

When the accommodation falls within the statutory definition of "accommodation" it may still be exempt from tax. The new rules specifically set out a number of exemptions.

#### _1\. Employee accommodation – out-of-town secondments and projects_

Employer-provided accommodation or an accommodation payment provided because an employee needs to work at a new work location (and that location is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their home) is tax-exempt provided the following conditions are met:

*   there is either a reasonable expectation that the employee's secondment to that work location will be for a period of two years or less, in which case the payment will be exempt for up to two years; or
*   the move is to work on a project of limited duration whose principal purpose is the creation, enhancement or demolition of a capital asset and the employee's involvement in that project is expected to be for no more than three years, in which case the maximum exemption period is three years.

If the move is to work on Canterbury earthquake recovery projects, the maximum period is extended to five years if the employee starts work in the period commencing on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2015, and to four years if the employee starts work in the period commencing 1 April 2015 and ending 31 March 2016. The maximum period reverts to three years if the employee starts work on or after 1 April 2016.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 1 |     |
| Adam is an accountant who has worked for his employer in Auckland for 10 years where he lives with his family. He is sent by his employer to New Plymouth for three months to carry out an audit of a large client before returning to the Auckland office. Adam's employer reimburses his hotel costs in New Plymouth. As Adam's employer expects him to work in New Plymouth for less than two years, the payment that Adam receives reimbursing him for his accommodation costs in New Plymouth is exempt income. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 2 |     |
| Bill lives in Wellington. His job is moved permanently to Auckland but he chooses not to move his family and commutes on a weekly basis, returning to Wellington at the weekend. Bill's employer pays him an accommodation allowance towards his Auckland accommodation costs. Bill and his employer expect he will work at the Auckland workplace for more than two years. The accommodation allowance is not tax exempt under the two-year rule. |     |

#### _Accommodation linked to long-term projects of limited duration_

The maximum exempt period of three years allowed for involvement in longer-term projects takes into account certain business practices, particularly in the construction industry. The employees might be housed at or near the construction site, might share accommodation and might be employed on a "fly in/fly out" basis so would not be relocating. Employees may be recruited specifically from overseas with no intention that they ever relocate permanently to New Zealand.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 3 |     |
| Eddie is seconded by his employer to work on a dam construction project for a client in a remote area of the North Island. Because of the scale of the project, the number of workers and the remoteness of the location, Eddie's employer sets up an accommodation facility to house its employees. The dam project is expected to take around five years to complete. However, Eddie's employer expects him to work on the project for only the first two and a half years.<br><br>Eddie is working on a project involving the construction of a capital asset so the three-year upper time limit applies. His employer expects him to be working at the distant work location for less than three years so the value of the accommodation is exempt. |     |

While the projects covered by the three-year maximum exemption will often relate to the construction industry, they may also involve, for example, upgrades of existing infrastructure and information technology development and implementation. The duration of the project can be longer than three years as the test is based on the time the employee is involved in the project, rather than the length of the project.

The project will also have to satisfy the following requirements:

*   creation of a capital asset - the principal aim of the project will have to be the creation of a capital asset of some form, whether a new capital asset, a replacement of an existing asset, an upgrade, or refurbishment;
*   employment duties specific to the project - the employee will need to be engaged exclusively on project work (bar incidental activities); and
*   the project must involve work for a client not related to the employer.

#### _When does the exemption cease?_

The payment or the employer-provided accommodation will cease to be tax-exempt before the respective maximum period if any of the following occur:

*   the employer pays the employee's costs associated with buying a house in or near the new work location, as an eligible relocation expense;
*   there is a change in the expectation that the employee will be at the new location for, as relevant, a maximum of two years or three years; or
*   the employee's involvement in the secondment or project comes to an end before the maximum time is up.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 4 |     |
| Donna works for an employer in Auckland. Her employer sends her to work in Hamilton for an expected 18-month period. After four months, Donna decides that she wants to relocate permanently to Hamilton and her employer agrees to make her job there permanent. Donna's employer has agreed to pay her an accommodation allowance for the first six months after arrival.<br><br>Up to the four-month point, Donna's employer's expectation was that she would not be working in Hamilton for more than two years, and payments to cover accommodation up to that point are exempt under the two-year rule. But given the expectation is now that Donna will be working in Hamilton for more than two years, payments to cover Donna's accommodation after four months would be taxable. |     |

The point in time at which an expectation is treated as having changed is when the employer has a firm expectation that the secondment or role on the project will last longer than initially expected. This may be evidenced by modification in the employee's terms of employment, but in many cases there may not be a written agreement. Instead, there may be other documentation such as board minutes, planning documents, correspondence with the third party for whom the employer is carrying out the capital project, and so on, that will demonstrate that the expectation has changed.

#### _What if the expected period initially exceeds the time limit but subsequently reduces?_

If a secondment is initially expected to exceed the relevant two or three years, it will be subject to tax. However, if this expectation changes during the course of the secondment, and the total period will be less than the relevant time limit, the payment or employer-provided accommodation becomes tax-exempt from the date the expectation changes. The payment or employer-provided accommodation up to the date the expectation changes remains taxable (there is no retrospective exemption following the change in expectation).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 5 |     |
| Sam lives in Napier. His employer sends him to Tauranga to set up and manage a new office. The initial expectation is that Sam will be in Tauranga for two years and six months. Sam's employer provides him with accommodation in Tauranga. The accommodation will be taxable as the secondment is expected to exceed two years.<br><br>One year into the secondment Sam's employer decides that Sam only needs to stay in Tauranga another six months as the company has found someone to run the office on a permanent basis. As the expectation of the total secondment duration is now less than two years (18 months total), the final six months of the accommodation provided to Sam are exempt from tax. The first 12 months, before the change in expectation, remain taxable. |     |

#### _Workplace_

The various new exemptions refer to the employee's "workplace". "Workplace" is defined as a particular place or base:

1.  at which an employee performs their employment duties; or
2.  from which an employee's duties are allocated.

This means that a workplace is not confined to premises of the employer but can also be any place from which the employee performs employment duties, which could be a client's premises. For example, a salesperson who is required to travel to clients located in various areas of the country will have multiple workplaces.

#### _Residence and reasonable daily travelling distance_

To qualify for the accommodation exemptions, an employee must be moving to a workplace that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their residence. "Residence" and "reasonable daily travelling distance" are not defined.

In this context (as in section CW 17B, in relation to relocation payments) "residence" refers to the employee's home immediately before the secondment. The distance test is assessed in relation to that residence.

The concept of "reasonable daily travelling distance" also appears in section CW 17B. Following the introduction of that provision, guidance on the meaning of "reasonable daily travelling distance" was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 21, No 9 (December 2009), page 6. This guidance is also applicable to the accommodation exemptions.

#### _Relationship with the relocation payments rule_

If an employee is not eligible for the secondment or capital project exemption, they may still qualify for an accommodation exemption for up to three months under section CW 17B and Determination 09/04 (provided the relevant criteria are met).

Sections CW 16C(1)(c) and CW 16C(2)(c) provide that eligibility for the section CW 16B exemption ends if an employee receives a relocation payment under section CW 17B in relation to the costs associated with settling the purchase of a new home.

#### _Anti-avoidance rules_

The rules are subject to certain conditions to protect against abuse:

*   The exemption does not apply if accommodation is provided under an explicit salary trade-off arrangement.
*   There is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent behaviour intended simply to restart the respective time limit.

#### _New employees_

The exemptions described above apply to accommodation provided to existing employees, and to new employees in specific instances.

New employees qualify for the three-year exemption, subject to the same conditions as existing employees, including that the work is on a project of limited duration and their contract is for a period of three years or less. This ensures there is no disparity between the treatment of new and existing employees working on the same project.

New employees only qualify for the two-year exemption when:

*   the employee is newly recruited to work at a particular work location but is then sent to work at another work location temporarily, for example, an individual is recruited to work in Auckland but is then sent to work in Dunedin for a month before returning to Auckland; or
*   an employee working for one employer is seconded to work for another employer on a temporary basis, with the expectation that the employee will return to work for the original employer, for example, an individual working for an Australian accountancy firm is sent to work for an affiliated New Zealand firm in Auckland for 18 months.

A more restrictive approach is taken for new employees under the two-year rule compared with the three-year rule because the scope for behavioural changes to the way new employees are remunerated is considered to be greater when fewer limitations are in place. The existing rules applying to tax-exempt relocation payments will continue to be available to these new employees.

#### _Exceptional circumstances_

There is restricted ability to extend the thresholds in exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are confined to those that are outside the control of the employer and employee, such as a natural disaster or medical emergency, that mean the employee has to stay at the work location beyond the maximum tax-free time threshold. The time limit can be extended for as long as the employee is unable to leave the work location because of the exceptional circumstance.

#### _Accommodation linked to Canterbury earthquake reconstruction work_

Given the special nature and scale of the Canterbury earthquake reconstruction work, there is a transitional rule (new section CZ 29) for employer-provided or paid accommodation for employees working on Canterbury earthquake reconstruction projects over the period from 4 September 2010 to 31 March 2019.

1.  When the employment duties of the employee require them to work in greater Christchurch on a project or projects for rebuilding or recovery work arising out of the Canterbury earthquakes, the time limits in the section CW 16B(5) definition of "project of limited duration" are effectively replaced by the following:
    *   five years when the employee's date of arrival is in the period from 4 September 2010 to 31 March 2015;
    *   four years when the employee's date of arrival is in the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016; and
    *   three years when the employee's date of arrival is in the period from 1 April 2016 onwards, for arrivals up to 31 March 2019. The normal three-year rule will apply to Canterbury rebuild and recovery work from 1 April 2019.
2.  When the date of arrival in "greater Christchurch" (as defined in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011) is in the period from 4 September 2010 (the date of the first earthquake) to 31 March 2015, the time limit will be applied by reference to the time the employee works continuously in greater Christchurch rather than to any expectation. For other periods, the time limits apply based on the employer's expectation.  
    This approach also applies more generally for out-of-town secondments and projects (see section CZ 30) so that for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2015, the relevant time limit is applied by reference to the time the employee works continuously at the distant location rather than to any expectation. For other periods, the time limits apply based on the employer's expectation.

#### _2\. Employee accommodation – ongoing multiple work places_

When an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis the accommodation or accommodation payment is tax-exempt without an upper time limit (section CW 16F).

There are a number of circumstances in which an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis. These may be because of the nature of their duties or because the additional workplaces are beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from their home. This could be the case, for example, for senior managers of large organisations. In these circumstances there is an exemption for employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments, without an upper time limit, given that there will be genuine ongoing additional costs in such cases. (If the employee has multiple work places for a limited period, the two or three-year time limit-based exemptions may also apply.)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 6 |     |
| Andrew manages two offices, one in Christchurch and one in Dunedin. He works in Christchurch two days a week and in Dunedin for three days a week. His home is in Dunedin. Andrew has more than one ongoing work location. When he works in Christchurch, he is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from his home in Dunedin. An accommodation payment to cover his hotel costs when staying in Christchurch is not taxable. The Christchurch accommodation is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. The Dunedin accommodation is not tax exempt. |     |

The multiple workplace rule can also apply when an employee is sent on a short-term business trip to another location. In these circumstances the employee will continue to have ongoing duties at their normal place of work while they are working at the other work location during the business trip.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 7 |     |
| Carmen is chief executive of a large group of companies based in Auckland. The company has offices in a number of cities across New Zealand. Each month Carmen visits one of these offices as part of her management duties. Typically these visits can last up to a week and her employer arranges and pays for her accommodation.<br><br>When Carmen is visiting the offices away from Auckland she has more than one ongoing workplace for the duration of her visit. The accommodation while working at those offices is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. |     |

#### _3\. Employee accommodation – meetings, conferences and training courses_

When an employee needs to attend a work-related meeting, conference or training course that requires at least an overnight stay, the accommodation or accommodation payment is tax-exempt without an upper time limit (section CW 16D).

While the need for accommodation would normally arise because the work-related meeting, conference or training course is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from the employee's home, this need not be the case. Some courses may be held locally but may require employees to stay overnight for reasons such as networking and team-building. Section CW 16D, therefore, covers both local and distant accommodation situations by extending the definition of "period of continuous work" to specifically include a location that is not distant from the employee's regular workplace (see section CW 16D(4)). It is possible, depending on the circumstances, that the multiple workplace exemption or the two or three-year time-based exemption could also apply.

#### _Accommodation for necessary travel in connection with performance of duties_

Section CW 16D exempts both accommodation at the location of the conference, training course, or work-related meeting and any accommodation for necessary travel in connection with the performance of the employee's duties in connection with their attendance. This means that if a stopover is required in travelling to or from the location, accommodation at that stopover will also be exempt.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 8 |     |
| Matt is required to travel to London for an international conference. The timing of available flights means it is necessary for Matt to stay in Hong Kong for a night on the way to London between flights. The Hong Kong accommodation will be exempt, along with the accommodation in London for the duration of the conference. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 9 |     |
| Sophie works in Auckland. Her employer requires her to attend a meeting in Canberra that starts early in the morning. No direct flights are available from Auckland to Canberra and the first flight from Auckland on the day of the meeting would not reach Sydney in time to catch the necessary connecting flight to Canberra. Sophie could either:<br><br>1.  fly to Canberra the day before (in which case the accommodation would be exempt under section CW 16D(1)(c)(i) or (ii)); or<br>2.  fly to Sydney and stay the night then take the first morning flight from Sydney to Canberra (in which case the Sydney accommodation would be exempt under section CW 16D(1)(c)(iii)). |     |

#### _Accommodation for necessary travel in connection with secondments and capital projects_

As with meetings, conferences and training courses, accommodation for necessary travel to and from a distant workplace in relation to secondments and capital projects is also exempt (see section CW 16B(1)(c)(iii)).

### Taxable employee accommodation – determining its value

When employer-provided accommodation, accommodation allowances and other payments for accommodation are taxable, the amendments to section CE 1, and new sections CE 1B, CE 1C, CE 1D and CE 1E specify how to determine their taxable value.

The taxable value of the accommodation continues to be linked to market rental value but will be subject to certain adjustments and exceptions as follows:

*   The taxable value is confirmed as market rental value when accommodation is provided by the employer, less any rent paid by the employee and any adjustment for business/work use of the premises. There is also an adjustment when employees share accommodation, to avoid over-taxation.
*   The taxable value of employer-funded accommodation provided to employees as part of an overseas posting is capped at the average or median rental value for accommodation in the vicinity where the employee would live if in New Zealand (section CE 1C). This cap, which is of significance to employees who remain tax-resident in New Zealand, recognises that the market rental value of accommodation in overseas locations can be disproportionately high compared with that which an employee might occupy if working in New Zealand.
*   There is a specific rule to confirm that the market value is discounted in the case of accommodation provided to New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel to reflect the specific limitations imposed on these properties (section CE 1D).
*   There is also a specific valuation rule for accommodation supplied by religious bodies to their ministers (section CE 1E). A long-standing administrative practice has capped the benefit of church supplied accommodation at 10% of ministers' stipends. This longstanding practice has been incorporated into the legislation, subject to the amount to which this treatment applies being capped at a reasonable rental value that is commensurate with the duties of the minister and the location in which the minister performs his or her duties. This rule is intended to apply across a wide variety of churches.

#### _Apportionment of taxable value between employees when accommodation is shared_

Generally, when more than one employee shares the accommodation provided by their employer, the taxable amount is either:

*   apportioned equally between the employees; or
*   if the employer and employees agree, apportioned between the employees on some other reasonable basis such as one employee having a larger room.

Separate rules apply for ministers of religion.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 10 |     |
| Two employees share a house provided by their employer, with a weekly rental value of $300. They are each taxed on $150. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 11 |     |
| Three employees share a house provided by their employer, with a weekly rental of $400. One employee has a much smaller room than the others and they all agree with their employer that the employee with the smaller room will be taxed on $100 and the other two employees will be taxed on $150 each. |     |

#### _Work use of accommodation_

The deduction from the taxable amount when part of the accommodation is used for work purposes reflects current practice and the amendment is merely intended to clarify and confirm that approach. To qualify, a clearly identifiable part of the accommodation needs to be used "wholly or mainly" for work purposes related to the employee's employment or service. The accommodation does not need to be used solely for work purposes to meet the "wholly or mainly" test, but it must at least be used predominantly for work purposes, and its primary purpose must be work-related. Any non-work-related use must be temporary or sporadic, or otherwise minor (such as using an office for checking personal emails or a family member occasionally using it for personal projects). The deduction is determined by apportioning between the business and private use.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 12 |     |
| An employer provides an employee with accommodation with a market rental value of $500 a week. The employee has set up one of the bedrooms as an office, and it is usually only used as an office. However, the office has a couch that is also a fold-out bed. On occasion, when the employee has house guests, the office is also temporarily used as a place for the house guest to sleep. As the office is one-tenth of the total floor area of the accommodation, $50 is deducted from the weekly taxable amount. |     |

#### _Accommodation for employees working overseas_

The exception to the general valuation rules allowing the use of a New Zealand-based value rather than the market value of the overseas accommodation applies not only to employer-provided accommodation but also when the employer makes an accommodation payment for the employee's accommodation costs at the overseas location.

In establishing the value of the comparable New Zealand property, regard must be had to the location where the employee would be likely to be working for the employer, the equivalent accommodation the person would be likely to occupy if living in New Zealand, and the average or median market rental values at or near that New Zealand work location.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 13 |     |
| Zoe is seconded by her employer to Brussels for three years and is provided with a flat for the duration of her secondment. The rent paid by the employer is equivalent to $50,000 a year. Zoe would normally work in central Wellington if working in New Zealand, and would be likely to be living in a two-bedroom house in Thorndon where an average annual rental value would be $24,000. Zoe is taxed on an accommodation value of $24,000 per year. |     |

When there is more than one location in New Zealand where the employee could work for the employer, a New Zealand-wide valuation can be used. There is a choice of using either the average market rental value or the median market rental value for the whole of New Zealand.

There is a range of sources available to help determine average or median market rental values; for example, the [Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment website](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/market-rent "This link will open in a new window")
 provides market rental statistics based on bonds lodged with its Building and Housing Group.

#### _Accommodation provided to Defence Force personnel_

The valuation rule for accommodation provided to NZDF personnel is that, up to 31 March 2015, the rent currently being paid is treated as the market rental value (section CZ 31) and, after that date, the market rental value is the lesser of (i) the market rental value for the accommodation and (ii) the market rent for the national NZDF benchmark property of that type less a discount (section CE 1D).  
Given the requirement for NZDF personnel to accept a posting anywhere in New Zealand, the NZDF has historically considered it appropriate to take a national approach to considering market rental value of NZDF accommodation. The deployment of personnel is concentrated around the central North Island, and therefore national benchmark properties have previously been assessed by reference to accommodation in the area of Linton Camp. Linton also offers a representative range of NZDF housing stock, reasonable access to amenities and a stable basis for rental comparison purposes.  
The benchmark properties, their market value and the discount will be determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Chief of Defence Force in consultation with a registered valuer. The determination of these matters must be reviewed every three years, at the instigation of either the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or the Chief of the Defence Force.

#### _Accommodation provided by religious bodies to ministers of religion_

The specific rule for accommodation provided to ministers of religion is given by the following formula:

_remuneration x (1 \- adjustment) + excess rental_

Where:

_remuneration_ is the amount that equals 10% of the remuneration that the minister receives for the income year for the performance of their duties as a minister;

_adjustment_ is the part of the value of the accommodation that is apportioned to work-related use, expressed as a decimal fraction of the total value of the accommodation. To be eligible for apportionment, the minister needs to use the relevant part of the accommodation wholly or mainly for work purposes. If more than one minister of religion lives in the accommodation, the adjustment is apportioned equally between them;

_excess rental_ is the amount (that is not less than zero) that is the difference between the accommodation's market rental value for the income year and the market rental value for the income year of accommodation that is reasonably commensurate with the duties of the person as a minister and for the location in which they perform their duties.

A "minister of religion" is defined "as a person who is ordained, commissioned, appointed or otherwise holds an office or position, regardless of their title or designation, as a minister of a religious denomination or community that meets the charitable purpose of the advancement or religion and whose duties are related mainly to the practice, study, teaching or advancement of religious beliefs; and whose accommodation is an integral part of performing their duties".

The definition specifically excludes a member of a religious society or order who is covered by the exemption in section CW 25. That exemption relates to board and lodging provided to members of religious societies and orders whose sole occupation is service in a society or order and who are not paid for their service. The specific valuation rule for accommodation provided to ministers of religion therefore supplements, rather than replaces, the existing exemption in section CW 25.

The requirement that a minister's church-provided accommodation is used as an integral part of performing the minister's duties refers to the expectation underlying a minister's pastoral duties that some parishioners might visit their home, irrespective of whether this happens in practice. There is no intention that ministers need to measure such use.

If the accommodation is provided for only part of the year, the calculations of the value are done with reference to that part of the year.

#### _Further guidance on determining taxable value_

During submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, some submitters raised questions about how market rental value would be ascertained, particularly in relation to specific situations when accommodation is provided at the place of work, such as accommodation provided to staff at boarding schools. To assist employers, Inland Revenue will be issuing operational guidance on the valuation of employer-provided accommodation.

### Payments to cover employee meals

Employers typically meet an employee's meal costs when linked to work-related duties. This recognises that these meals may be more expensive for the employee than normal meal costs at home.

Under previous rules, when an employer reimbursed the cost of a work-related meal, the amount saved by the employee (their normal expenditure on the meal) was arguably taxable.[1](#01)
 However, it would not be practical to carry out an apportionment each time a meal payment is made, so a more practical approach that better matches business practice was needed, given that these meal payments are generally not provided as a substitute for taxable salary.

Section CW 17CB introduces two specific exemptions:

*   An exemption of up to three months for meal payments if the employee is required to work away from their normal work location because they are travelling on business. This may be for a specific short-term, work-related journey or for a longer period such as a secondment to a distant work location.
*   Payments to cover working meals and light refreshments when working off the employer's premises are exempt without any upper time limit.

In both circumstances, when the exemption applies, the full amount of any meal payment will be exempt. The exemption includes reimbursement payments and meal allowances.

These rules do not affect the existing exemptions in section CW 17C that apply to overtime meal payments and sustenance allowances. Likewise, the direct provision of a meal by an employer remains subject to the fringe benefit tax rules (including any "on premises" exemption) rather than the new rules. The rules that limit employers' deductions of entertainment expenses also continue to apply.

#### _Calculating the three-month time limit_

The three-month time limit runs from the date the employee starts working at the workplace and extends for as long as the employee works continuously at that location.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 14 |     |
| Vernon normally works in Christchurch but is sent by his employer to work in the employer's Nelson office for a period of six months. Vernon's employer pays him a meal allowance for the duration of the secondment. The meal allowance is exempt for the first three months and taxable for the remainder of the secondment. |     |

If the employee is sent away from their normal workplace and for the period they are away does not have a fixed work base, but instead works at a variety of locations and works out of an accommodation base (a single accommodation location, away from their normal residence, from which they travel to the various workplaces), then the time limit will apply from the date at which they arrive at the accommodation base.

|     |     |

| Example 15 |     |
| Bruce normally lives in Napier. He is sent by his employer to work on an infrastructure project that requires him to work in a variety of locations around the Waikato. Rather than moving to each location, Bruce rents a house to use as a base from which he can travel to those locations each day as required. The three-month time limit applies from the date Bruce moves to the rented accommodation. |     |

In determining whether the employee is working continuously at a particular location, periods when away from the location for personal reasons such as leave and weekend breaks and short breaks that are required for work purposes will be disregarded.

The payment will not be exempt when it is paid by way of a salary trade-off.

#### _Working meals and light refreshments at or near the employee's normal work location_

Payments to cover meal expenses for a working meal near the employee's work location will be exempt in certain circumstances. for example, this will include lunches at conferences or training courses near their normal work location.

The expense will only be exempt if the employee attends the meal because of the nature of the duties of the job. The meal expense will not be exempt if it is provided as a salary trade-off.

The amendments will also introduce an exemption for payments for light refreshments (in the form of snack food such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea or coffee), when the following criteria are met:

*   the nature of an employee's employment duties mean they have to be away from the employer's premises for most of the day;
*   the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and
*   it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 16 |     |
| Jane normally works in an office where her employer provides tea and coffee for employees while working. Jane is required to spend two days out of the office staffing a recruitment stand for her employer at a local employment expo. During her attendance at the expo, it is not practical for Jane's employer to provide her with tea or coffee. A payment made by Jane's employer to cover tea or coffee in these circumstances will be exempt. |     |

### Application of new rules to past periods

As noted earlier, employers can apply the new accommodation and meal rules to periods before 1 April 2015 in certain circumstances. In the case of accommodation, the rules can be backdated for accommodation provided or expenditure incurred from 1 January 2011 provided the employer has not taken a tax position before 6 December 2012 that the accommodation or accommodation payment is taxable. Similarly, employers have the option to apply the work-related meal rules from 1 April 2011, provided they have not already taken a tax position that the expenditure was taxable.

This means in some situations amounts that were treated as taxable income will become exempt income, resulting in a refund to the employee.[2](#02)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 17 |     |
| Anna lives and works in Hamilton. In January 2013 she was sent on a 15-month secondment to Blenheim. The secondment was expected to last 15 months, and did, in fact, last 15 months. Her employer paid for her accommodation in Blenheim and treated these payments as taxable. Under the new rules the accommodation would be exempt from tax. Anna's employer may now elect to backdate the application of the new rules to exempt the payments, meaning a refund of the tax paid on the accommodation can be claimed. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 18 |     |
| Grace lives and works in Invercargill. In February 2011 her employer sent her on secondment to New Plymouth to assist with setting up a new site. The secondment was expected to last 18 months, but in fact lasted 20 months as the new site progressed slightly behind schedule. Grace's employer provided her with an accommodation allowance which was treated as taxable, with PAYE deducted. Grace's employer is unable to backdate the new provisions because although the accommodation allowance would be exempt under the new rules and was provided after 1 January 2011, it was treated as taxable before 6 December 2012. |     |

Backdating can be applied on an employee-by-employee basis. Accordingly, when the employer agrees to backdate the new rules, the employer should indicate to Inland Revenue which employees and which tax years they have chosen to apply this option to, and the employees' new gross earnings and the tax-exempt amounts. They should also provide each employee with a letter confirming they have chosen this treatment, setting out the new gross earnings details and the amount that is now tax-exempt for each tax year.

The employee will then need to make a request to Inland Revenue to amend their IR3 return or personal tax summary assessment or, if necessary, request a personal tax summary.

Employees should note that the income adjustments described above will affect their social assistance entitlements and obligations (such as Working for Families, child support and student loan repayments). For example, if as a result of the adjustment it is found that the employee's student loan repayments have been too high, the employee should indicate whether they want the repayments refunded to them or treated as voluntary repayments.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 19 |     |
| Jon was on an out-of-town secondment for two years with accommodation provided Monday to Friday at a cost of $300 per week. Jon's employer had originally treated the accommodation as tax exempt as Jon returned home every weekend to his family. Jon's employer provided a voluntary disclosure and treated the accommodation for the last 12 months as taxable income. Jon's salary was $75,000 on top of which his employer paid the additional PAYE of $150 per week, being the grossed up amount of the accommodation, increasing his earnings by a total of $450 per week.<br><br>Jon's employer agrees to apply the new rules to his accommodation making the cost of the accommodation - $300 per week - tax exempt.<br><br>Jon's employer provides him with a letter confirming the details to amend his return. Jon sends a copy of the letter and requests that the Commissioner amends his return to reduce his taxable income and issue a refund of the overpaid tax. |     |

### Payments to cover "distinctive clothing"

Under the previous general rules used to determine whether a payment or allowance is taxable, expenditure incurred on the purchase and maintenance of clothing is normally a private expense. Case law has confirmed that there is an exception to this general approach when the particular clothing is "necessary and peculiar" to the employee's occupation. This has been taken to include a uniform, or specialist clothing that is not reasonably suitable for private use. Examples include uniforms worn by nursing staff, members of the armed forces and police officers. However, ordinary clothing of a particular style or colour which could reasonably be worn outside the job would not be treated as a uniform. Specialist clothing might include overalls and protective clothing worn for health and safety reasons.

When an employer directly provides and/or maintains work-related clothing instead of paying an allowance, rather than relying on case law, the fringe benefit tax rules specifically include a distinctive work clothing exemption (see section CX 30). Applying this same approach to clothing allowances will provide consistency in this area.  
  
New section CW 17CC makes it clear that an allowance to cover the cost of buying and maintaining distinctive work clothing is not taxable income. "Distinctive work clothing" is defined drawing on the fringe benefit tax definition in section CX 30(2) to mean a single item of clothing, that:

*   is worn by an employee as, or as part of, a uniform that can be identified with the employer:
    *   through the permanent and prominent display of a name, logo, or other identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their activity or undertaking; or
    *   because of the colour scheme, pattern, or style is readily associated with the employer; and
*   is worn in the course of, or as an incident, of employment; and
*   is not clothing that employees would normally wear for private purposes.

The distinctive clothing exemption also covers plain clothes allowances that were in place on 1 July 2013 and paid to uniformed personnel who are required to wear plain clothes in order to carry out their duties. This is in line with a longstanding expectation that a portion of the plain clothes allowance paid to police officers is non-taxable, based on the specific circumstances involved. This exemption applies only when:

*   the employer provides a uniform to its employees to wear when performing the duties of their employment;
*   despite the fact that the employee has been provided with a uniform, it is a requirement of their current job with the same employer that they do not wear that uniform but instead need to wear plain clothes;
*   the plain clothes allowance was in place at 1 July 2013;
*   historically, the plain clothes allowance was part of a larger plain clothes amount the employer paid to employees, the balance being a taxable amount that was subsequently included in the taxable salary of employees receiving the plain clothes amount, under the employer's general terms and conditions; and
*   the employer's general terms and conditions of employment continue to provide for the payment of a plain clothes allowance.

Payments in relation to the purchase and maintenance of other clothing continue to be subject to the general rules for determining when a payment that does not have its own exemption rules is tax-exempt.

### General rule for determining taxable portion of other expenditure payments

For the most part, beyond the specific payments discussed earlier in relation to accommodation and meals and distinctive clothing where the need for particular rules have been identified, the previous general rule for establishing the taxable part of an employee expenditure payment has worked satisfactorily. However, some further clarity around what the rule involves was merited. Furthermore, there is still a possibility that at some time in the future the general rule may not be able to provide an appropriate outcome for another particular type of payment. There are advantages in having a mechanism to handle this other than through specific legislative amendment.

#### _Nexus test – clarification of the approach_

Under the general approach set out in section CW 17, the expenditure being paid to or on behalf of the employee is exempt income of the employee provided it is incurred in connection with the employee's employment or service and the employee would be allowed a deduction in respect of that amount if the limitation on employees claiming deductions (the employment limitation) did not exist. This is often referred to as the "nexus test". It effectively means that a payment is exempt provided it is not of a private, domestic or capital nature. This is not confined to actual expenditure. Section CW 17 allows an employer to make a reasonable estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred.

These rules generally satisfactorily deal with the vast majority of expenses that do not have their own rule. The changes are simply aimed at providing greater clarity about what the nexus test involves by providing further detail of what is considered expenditure incurred, or an amount paid, in connection with an employee's employment or service.

New section CW 17(2B) provides that to qualify as expenditure that is incurred in connection with an employee's employment or service, it has to be incurred because the employee is performing an obligation required by their employment or service, and the employee earns income through the performance of the obligation, and the expenditure is necessary in the performance of the obligation. This does not remove the requirement to consider whether the employee would have received a deduction for the amount but for the employment limitation, which necessarily incorporates consideration of whether the capital or private limitations apply.

#### _Commissioner determination power_

A new power enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a determination (under section 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994) in respect of a payment made to a wide group or class of employees. This does not dispense with the general requirements of section CW 17 but rather, in situations where it is hard to measure the precise private or capital portion of the expense, the Commissioner may determine the extent to which on average the amount is exempt income by setting a percentage that represents the extent to which the payment for the particular type of expense, based on a reasonable estimate, is taxable.

This determination-making power is discretionary. Before deciding to issue a determination, the Commissioner needs to be satisfied that the payment not only affects a large group or class of employees but also that the average private or capital benefit likely to be received is hard to measure, and that the payment is not paid as a substitute for salary or wages (see section CW 17(2C)). The power is only available in respect of payments made to a wide group of employees to ensure that the cases in which the Commissioner issues a determination are of sufficient importance to the wider business community. This is likely to mean an employee expenditure payment that is commonly provided across a wide spectrum of businesses. It may include an employee expenditure payment provided in a specific industry if it covers many employees.  
  
Any determination issued will be binding on the Commissioner but not the taxpayer, which means that it will act as a safe harbour. If the employer or employee has evidence to demonstrate that in their particular circumstance some other apportionment is appropriate under the section CW 17 general rule, the taxpayer will still be able to apply that apportionment.

### Expenditure on account of an employee

When an employer reimburses or otherwise meets a specific employee expense, this is an employee expenditure payment known as "expenditure on account of an employee". The statutory definition is very widely drawn, so there is a comprehensive list of exclusions from the definition. These include two general exclusions that covered employee expenditure payments in general.

The first general exclusion (section CE 5(3)(a), which remains unchanged) excludes payments to third parties or to employees for expenditure incurred by those employees in deriving their employment income. The second general exclusion (section CE 5(3)(c)) excluded payments made by employers to employees for expenses that an employee had incurred and paid for on their employer's behalf, when the expenses were the employer's liability. An Example would be when the employee buys a box of photocopying paper on the employer's behalf on the basis that the employer will reimburse them.

There have been a number of significant changes to the definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" since it was first introduced in 1985. As a result, the general exclusions have been amended and expanded and it was no longer clear how the two exclusions should apply in relation to each other. Arguably, there was some overlap, which the amended provision is designed to remove.

The general exclusion in section CE 5(3)(c) has been amended so that it excludes expenditure from being "expenditure on account of an employee" when:

*   the particular payment does not already fall within the section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion (this ensures the section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion takes priority);
*   the expense covered by the payment is incurred by or on behalf of the employee's employer; and
*   the expense has been paid for by the employee on their employer's behalf.

### Other matters

A number of minor technical amendments have been made to support the wider changes to the rules governing the tax treatment of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments by employers to cover employee expenditure.

The amendments cover changes to definitions, headings and cross-references to ensure compatibility with other taxing rules.

Employee entitlement fund and tax avoidance
===========================================

2014 case note – High Court confirmed decision - employee entitlement fund, tax avoidance, fraud, shortfall penalties.

Case

HC Services Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 1169

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004

### Summary

The High Court confirmed the decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") and dismissed the appeal of HC Services Ltd.

### Facts

This was an appeal against the decision of the TRA, delivered on 6 November 2013 (TRA 11/10 \[2013\] NZTRA 09); and the earlier Threshold Ruling of the TRA, delivered on 11 September 2012 (TRA11/10 \[2012\] NZTRA 08).

The appellant made payments to a purported employee entitlement fund ("the EEF") for the benefit of the appellant's employees and claimed income tax deductions for the various payments made in relation to the EEF in the income tax years ended 31 March 2004 to 31 March 2006 (inclusive). The Commissioner assessed the appellant on the basis the appellant was not entitled to deductions under the following black letter provisions: sections DC 5, DA 1, DA 2, DB 6 and/or DB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("ITA 2004"); and/or alternatively, the EEF it invested in and promoted, was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position pursuant to section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and for taking an abusive tax position pursuant to section 141D of the TAA (reduced by 50%) in each of the tax years.

In the TRA, the appellant challenged the Commissioner's assessments and asserted it was entitled to deductions under section DB 33 of the ITA 2004 for misappropriation. However, before the substantive issues were considered by the TRA, the parties requested the TRA determine whether fraud on the appellant in relation to any arrangement precludes sections OB 1, BG 1 and GB 1 of the ITA 2004 from applying.

The TRA found that, even if there had been a fraud on the appellant, the fraud did not prevent the general anti-avoidance and reconstruction provisions applying (TRA11/10 \[2012\] NZTRA 08 at \[149\]).

At a separate hearing, the TRA considered the substantive issues and confirmed the Commissioner's assessments including shortfall penalties for having taken an abusive tax position (TRA 11/10 \[2013\] NZTRA 09 at \[127\]).

### Decision

Fogarty J agreed with the TRA that the EEF did not meet the requirements of section DC 5 of the ITA 2004 as there was no evidence that there was any intention to "fully secure" employees' rights to receive benefits from the fund.

His Honour agreed with the TRA's findings at \[133\]-\[136\] that any fraud on the appellant by a third party is not relevant to the application of the anti-avoidance provisions (_HC Services Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZHC 1169 at \[25\]-\[29\]).

Further, Fogarty J dismissed the submission that fraud in an arrangement has the same vitiating effect as a sham. At \[37\] he found:

*   The fact that one of the principals behind this tax arrangement may have intended at some point, either from the outset or during the transactions, to defraud the taxpayer, does not mean that there were no rights and obligations created by the transactions, that they were not real.

His Honour concluded at \[62\]:

*   An argument that elements of fraud – either in the construction, promotion or operation of the tax avoidance arrangement – vitiated the arrangement so that the tax avoidance provisions could not apply – would render tax avoidance provisions of the Act significantly ineffectual. On such a construction, the best way to sell a tax avoidance package would be to sell an ineffective one! That has to be nonsense.

Finally, in relation to penalties, and having found that the appellant was a party to a tax avoidance arrangement, Fogarty J upheld the Commissioner's abusive tax position shortfall penalty assessments pursuant to section 141D(7)(b)(i) of the TAA, commenting that the High Court has no power to apply subsection (7)(b)(ii) of the TAA.

Employee indemnity fund a tax avoidance arrangement
===================================================

2013 case note – Taxation Review Authority finds employee indemnity fund to be a tax avoidance arrangement - misappropriation, abusive tax position.

Case

TRA 11/10

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The arrangement did not meet the requirements of sections DC 5, DA 1 DB 6 or DB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The arrangement was also a tax avoidance arrangement and the shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position was appropriately applied by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"). Further, the requirements for a deduction under section DB33 were not satisfied.

### Facts

In the income tax years ended 31 March 2004 to 31 March 2006, the disputant participated in an arrangement which purported to constitute an employee indemnity fund ("the EEF") for the benefit of the disputant's employees.

Ultimately, the disputant claimed deductions in the relevant income years for contributions, fees, insurance and interest paid under the EEF. The Commissioner reversed the deductions and assessed the disputant for shortfall penalties.

In an earlier proceeding (_Case 8_ (2012) 25 NZTC 15,824) the disputant argued that the promoters of the EEF had defrauded them and that where there is such a fraud there can be no tax avoidance.

On 11 September 2012, the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") gave a threshold decision on this point, confirming that fraud on the disputant did not preclude the tax avoidance provisions from applying to the arrangement.

The hearing for the substantive matters in dispute proceeded on 6 May 2013.

### Decision

#### _Section DC 5_

The TRA held that the EEF did not meet the requirements of section DC 5. In particular, the contributions to the EEF were not set aside or paid to provide individual personal benefits to employees of the disputant and that the EEF was not established in a way that fully secured the rights of employees to receive the benefits.

Rather, the TRA considered the EEF appeared to be more in the nature of an insurance policy for the disputant (as the employer) in the event that it was unable to meet employment-related costs. In any event, any benefits that could be regarded as personal to the employees appeared to be benefits the employees were already entitled to pursuant to statute and/or their employment contracts. Further, the funds the disputant purportedly set aside to provide individual personal benefits to the employees were no more than book entries and/or were not accessible by the employees.

**_Section DA 1_** 

The TRA found that it may have been arguable that any expenditure incurred that was directly related to the risk factors identified in the EEF would have had the requisite nexus with the disputant's income-earning business.

However, the TRA considered that because the expenses claimed related to the EEF and not the risk categories themselves, the expenditure was one step removed from actual expenditure on the risk factors. Further, the EEF was more akin to setting aside money as a contingency fund for the benefit of the disputant, rather than as a redundancy fund for employees. In addition, the EEF did not deplete over time, no claims were made and no bonuses paid to employees.

#### _Section DA 2_

The TRA considered that the expenditure was capital in nature because the contributions were an attempt to establish the nucleus of a fund that was an identifiable asset of an enduring nature; employee benefits did not accrue from the establishment of the EEF; and the disputant's director had confirmed that he saw the arrangement as a retirement fund for his own benefit.

#### _Sections DB 6 and DB 7_

The TRA considered that there was no evidence that established that any of the purported interest payments were, in fact, payments of interest in relation to the loan.

#### _Tax avoidance_

The TRA concluded that the arrangement had a purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Further, the TRA considered that no evidence existed that supported the disputant's purported purpose of creating a pool of money to meet future employment-related costs.

The TRA considered that the arrangement was artificial, contrived and something of a pretence; it was commercially unusual and there were no economic consequences incurred by the disputant. Ultimately, when viewed in a commercially realistic way, the tax avoidance purpose was pursued as a goal in itself and was therefore not merely incidental.

The disputant alleged that the arrangement was a fraud on it by the promoters but the TRA again confirmed that was irrelevant to determining whether or not section BG 1 applies. In any event, the TRA stated that the reasons the disputant gave in support of fraud allegations also supported a finding of tax avoidance.

The TRA confirmed that the reconstruction carried out by the Commissioner was an appropriate exercise of section GB 1.

#### _Shortfall penalties_

The TRA considered that, when viewed objectively, the positions taken were not about as likely as not to be correct.

Further, the TRA considered that the positions taken were in relation to an arrangement that had a dominant purpose of tax avoidance and accordingly, the Commissioner acted appropriately and correctly in imposing an abusive tax position shortfall penalty under section141D.

#### _Section DB 33_

The disputant asserted, on the basis of its allegations of fraud, it was entitled to deductions under section DB 33 for misappropriation.

The TRA considered that proof of fraud by the promoters was not relevant for the purposes of section DB 33. The TRA concluded that the disputants had failed to prove that property had been misappropriated in the course of the disputant's business by a person rendering services to the disputant.

Employees for the purposes of the COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP)
================================================================

Eligibility for the CSP was based on whether the applicant carrying on a business or organisation that met the criteria to apply. Eligibility was not based on employee numbers.

However, the number of employees did matter when working out the CSP amount. The number of employees a business or organisation had was measured at the time the business applied for the CSP.

A person was an employee if, at the time of application, both of the following were met.

*   The person was the applicant's employee and not, for example, an independent contractor.
*   They 'regularly worked' for the business. In other words, they were actively involved in the business day-to-day.

The number of hours an employee regularly worked helped work out whether to claim them as either a:

*   full-time equivalent worker (20+ hours a week)
*   part-time equivalent worker (up to 20 hours a week).

Employees on leave
------------------

An employee could be claimed even if that employee was on leave at the time the business applied (for example, on sick leave, annual leave, or parental leave). In such circumstances, the claim for the employee was based on the number of hours each week that the employee regularly worked when they were not on leave. For example, if the employee regularly worked 20+ hours per week (when they were not on leave) they could be claimed as a full-time equivalent worker even if they may be on leave at the time of application.

Employees on ACC
----------------

If the employee was on ACC at the time of application, they could still be claimed. In such circumstances, the claim for the employee was based on the number of hours each week that the employee regularly worked when they were not on ACC. For example, if the employee regularly worked 20+ hours per week (when they were not on ACC) they could be claimed as a full-time equivalent worker.

Self-employed people
--------------------

If a person was self-employed (that is, an applicant working as a sole trader for yourself) they could claim for themselves as an employee.

Shareholder-employees
---------------------

A company that applied could claim for the shareholder-employees that regularly worked for the company (that is, those shareholder-employees that were actively involved in the day-to-day business) as being employees for CSP calculation purposes, whether or not the company had paid the shareholder-employee a salary in a particular year. For example, the applicant may have been in a growth stage and they may not have yet paid the shareholder-employee a salary if they were retaining capital within the company.

Not-for-profits
---------------

Not-for-profits will often have volunteers, as opposed to employees. In this instance, the not-for-profit could apply for the base payment only if they had no employees. If they had employees, they could claim the base payment and the number of employees.

Commonly owned groups
---------------------

A member of a commonly owned group could claim those persons that regularly worked for them as being employees (for CSP calculation purposes). This is the case even if the person was legally employed by another member of the group at the time. Please see the guidance on our commonly owned groups' page for the circumstances when a member of a commonly owned group could claim a person as an employee for the purposes of the CSP calculation.  

[Commonly owned groups](/covid-19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment/eligibility-for-the-csp/commonly-owned-groups)

Example: FTE calculation

Scott has 8 full-time and 4 part-time employees. To work out his total FTE, Scott does the following calculations. 

*   8 full-time employees × 1 FTE = 8 
*   4 part-time employees × 0.6 FTE = 2.4. This is rounded up to the nearest whole number, in this case 3 
*   8 + 3 = 11 FTEs, Scott can apply for the RSP based on 11 FTEs. 

Example: Shareholder employee

Elena is the shareholder and director of Dolphin Entertainment Tours - which is not a registered employer and has no employees. However, Elena receives a shareholder salary from the company and shows this in the company’s income tax return. Dolphin Entertainment Tours can apply for the CSP with Elena as 1 FTE.

Example: Go Play Charitable Trust - non profit

Go Play Charitable Trust has 2 employees and over 100 volunteers working for them. Volunteers are not considered to be employees for the purposes for the CSP. Therefore, in this instance Go Play Charitable Trust can only claim for the 2 FTEs that are actively involved in the day-to-day activities of the Charitable Trust.

Kaimahi a tētahi kaituku mahi nō tāwahi e noho ana i Aotearoa New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer
================================================================================================================

If you live in New Zealand and your overseas employer does not need to register as an employer in New Zealand, you need to register as an IR56 taxpayer.    
  
You will not need to register as an IR56 taxpayer if your employer registers as an employer with us or arranges for someone else to manage your employment-related tax.   
  
From 1 April 2023, if you are a New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and received non-cash benefits (also known as a fringe benefit), you will have to include these benefits as gross income in your Employment Information – IR348 (EI) return. You will also need to include any employer superannuation contributions. 

[Fringe benefit tax](https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/paying-staff/fringe-benefit-tax/types-of-fringe-benefits)

60-day grace period
-------------------

From 1 April 2024, if you are required to deduct tax and have not done it, you will have 60 days to file the required return and make the payment before penalties are applied if certain criteria are met.

Calculating non-cash benefits from your employer 
-------------------------------------------------

If you receive any kind of non-cash benefit, for example health insurance, you must include the value of the benefit as part of your gross income in your EI return.  

If the non-cash benefit is paid regularly, for example monthly, simply include the value of the non-cash benefit as gross income in your EI return and tax accordingly. You can use the PAYE calculator to do this.

[Self-calculate IR56 PAYE](https://www.ird.govt.nz/roles/tax-agents/self-calculate-ir56-paye)

If it is a lump sum, you will need to calculate the PAYE on it separately to your salary. Then you will need to combine these in your EI return.

Any shares or share options you get from your employer for free or below market value are employee share scheme (ESS) benefits and are employment income. You must include the taxable value of the ESS benefit in your EI return.

You can choose to:

*   deduct PAYE at the time the benefit is recorded in your EI return
*   not deduct PAYE and instead pay the tax at the end of the year.

If you choose not to deduct PAYE, this may result in you becoming a provisional taxpayer.

If you receive a Working for Families entitlement and receive any kind of non-cash benefit, you will need to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form. Any non-cash benefits received are not adjustable in your student loan obligation.

Calculating superannuation
--------------------------

If your employer contributes to a superannuation scheme or fund, you need to account for [Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)](/api/glossary/item?id={B1FC84AD-4393-48A3-92EF-2EF29C640520})
.

[Employer superannuation contribution tax](https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/deductions-from-income/employer-superannuation-contriibution-tax-esct)
 

There are 2 options: 

*   add this in the EI ESCT field 
*   choose for it to be taxed as PAYE. This means your income is increased and is now included for Working for Families, child support, independent earner tax credit and any student loan payments.

What

Employees you do not automatically enrol but who can still join KiwiSaver by opting in

When

Hiring a new employee and seeing if you should automatically enrol them into KiwiSaver

Some of your new employees do not have to be automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver by you. If they're eligible, and want to join, they choose to opt in.

Can your employees choose to opt into KiwiSaver?

If your employee is...

Choose your employees situation Under 18 65 and over An existing employee A temporary and casual employee A private domestic worker A contractor A shareholder-employee who gets PAYE deducted A working partner of a partnership A working owner of a look-through company (LTC) An employee who has changed jobs

Eligible new and existing employees aged 18 and under opt in. They can only opt in with a scheme provider.

Do not automatically enrol your new eligible employees aged under 18.

Eligible new and existing employees aged 65 and over opt in.

They can either opt in through you or a scheme provider.

Your existing eligible employees who are older than 18 and less than 65 years of age can opt into KiwiSaver.

They can either opt in through you or with a scheme provider.

Your temporary and casual employee’s situation can mean either you automatically enrol them in to KiwiSaver, or they can choose to opt in.

Check their situation to see if you automatically enrol them.

[Opting in and enrolling temporary and casual employees](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/starting-employees-in-kiwisaver/employees-who-choose-to-opt-into-kiwisaver/opting-in-and-enrolling-temporary-and-casual-employees)

You do not automatically enrol private domestic workers into KiwiSaver if they pay their own PAYE.

If they’re eligible, they opt into KiwiSaver but only through a scheme provider. They may deduct contributions from their salary or wages and pay them to us in the same way as they would for their PAYE.

Contractors who appear on your employer monthly schedule, for example with the WT tax code are seen as self-employed people for KiwiSaver. Do not automatically enrol them.

If they’re eligible for KiwiSaver they can opt in, but only with a scheme provider.

Do not make employee KiwiSaver deductions from their pay or include payments (employee deductions or employer contributions) on the employer monthly schedule.

Shareholder-employees can automatically enrol into KiwiSaver if PAYE is deducted from their salary or wage.

Shareholder-employees should get advice to see whether their remuneration is subject to PAYE.

If PAYE is not deducted, the shareholder-employee is seen as a self-employed person for KiwiSaver. They can choose to opt in but only through a scheme provider.

Working partners of a partnership that pays them a salary or wage for services provided under a written contract of service are seen as employees for KiwiSaver.

Do not automatically enrol them. If they’re eligible, they can opt in.

Working owners of a look through company (LTC) that pays them a salary or wage for services provided under a written contract of employment are seen as employees for KiwiSaver.

Do not automatically enrol them. If they’re eligible, they can choose to opt in.

Payroll changes are the best way to tell if employees who change jobs opt in or automatically enrol.

What

New employees you’ve automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver can ask you, or us, to opt them out.

Who

Employers

When

Between 2-8 weeks of starting work.

New employees you’ve automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver can ask you, or us, to opt them out.

*   Only employees you’ve automatically enrolled can opt out of KiwiSaver.
*   Employees who’ve opted into KiwiSaver cannot opt out later.
*   You can opt your new employees out of KiwiSaver, but only between 2–8 weeks of starting work (that's on or after day 14 and on or before day 56).
*   Your employees must fill out a KiwiSaver opt out request, KS10.
*   You must send the KS10 your employees fill out to us.
*   We must approve requests to opt out after 8 weeks (57 days). These are late opt outs. We may approve them up to 3 months after we get your employee's first contribution, but only in some situations.

How your employee requests an opt out through you
-------------------------------------------------

Your employee can ask you to opt them out of KiwiSaver by handing you their KiwiSaver opt out request - KS10. You’ll have given them this when you automatically enrol them.

If your employee's request is late, your employee must ask us to opt them out. They can send their KS10 to us or apply online.

[KiwiSaver opt-out request - KS10](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/opting-out-of-kiwisaver/opt-out-of-kiwisaver)

Stopping deductions and contributions
-------------------------------------

If your employee gives you their KiwiSaver opt out request – KS10 and it's within 14–56 days of starting work with you, you can straight away stop:

*   making KiwiSaver deductions from their pay
*   paying your compulsory employer contributions and the employer superannuation contribution tax.

If your employee sends their KS10 to us and we:

*   accept their request, we’ll let you know you need to stop deductions and contributions
*   do not accept their request, and you’ve stopped deductions and contributions, we’ll ask you to start them again.

Employee refunds when they opt out
----------------------------------

If you've:

*   already sent us deductions from your employee’s pay, we'll refund your employee their deducted contributions
*   not paid your employee’s deductions to us yet, refund them to your employee.

Do not refund your employee their deductions if you’ve already paid them to us. They’ll end up getting 2 refunds for the same amount.

Your refunds when your employee opts out
----------------------------------------

If you've made employer KiwiSaver contributions:

*   we'll refund them to you - if you have no amounts owing - you do not have to do anything to tell us
*   ask us for a refund of any employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) you’ve paid on them.

You can ask for a refund of employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) by either:

*   completing an Employer schedule amendments - IR344 form
*   contacting us.

Te tāke painga tāpiri mō ngā waka e wātea ana mō te whakamahi tūmataiti Employer provided motor vehicles for private use
========================================================================================================================

If your business makes a vehicle available for employees (including shareholder employees), and their [associated persons](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
 to use privately, you may need to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT). You may be liable to pay FBT even if they do not actually use it.

Work-related vehicle exemption
------------------------------

A vehicle is exempt from FBT only on days it is used for essential work purposes. To be eligible for the exemption the vehicle needs to:

*   be a motor vehicle, which is defined as a vehicle drawn or propelled by mechanical power (including a trailer)
*   have permanent company branding must be prominently displayed
*   have a gross laden weight of 3,500 kg or less
*   be mainly designed to carry goods or goods and passengers equally.

To qualify for the daily exemption, you must also:

*   give employees a letter of restriction stating that the work related vehicle is not available for private use except for travel between home and work, and for travel related to the business
*   complete 3-monthly checks to makes sure employees are using the vehicles only for work-related purposes.

You should also keep a record of these checks.

### Vehicle made available for private use

On any day the vehicle is made available for private use (even if it is not actually used privately), the work-related vehicle exemption does not apply, and you may be liable for FBT.

### Double cab utes

A common error we see is the FBT treatment of double cab utes. Utes may be considered work related as they are dual purpose vehicles. However this does not mean they are automatically exempt from FBT. These vehicles still need to meet the conditions above.

### Vehicle above gross laden weight

If a vehicle above the gross laden weight is provided to an employee for private use this may need to be treated as an unclassified benefit. You should regularly check logbooks, petrol receipts etc to make sure employees use the vehicle appropriately.

### Emergency call exemption

If an employee uses a vehicle to attend an emergency call, FBT will not apply for that whole day when the employee travels from their home, and in the course of their employment provides:

*   essential services relating to the operation of your plant or machinery, or the plant or machinery of your client or customer
*   essential services relating to the maintenance of services provided by a local authority or a public authority
*   essential services relating to the carrying on of a business for the supply of energy or fuel to the public
*   emergency services relating to the health or safety of any person
*   the services must be requested by a member of the public, the employer, their client or customer.

The visit must take place between 6pm and 6am during the work week, or at any time on a Saturday, Sunday or statutory public holiday. There are no time restrictions in the case of health or safety of a person.

### Business travel exemption

If an employee regularly travels with a vehicle, FBT may not apply when:

*   they stay away from home overnight with the vehicle
*   they are away for more than 24 hours
*   they need the vehicle to perform their work.

### Vehicles broken down or repaired

The vehicle is exempt from FBT during any period when it is not available to be used for at least 24 hours. For example, if it has broken down or is being repaired.

Sole traders and partners in a partnership
------------------------------------------

Sole traders and partners in a partnership do not pay FBT on business vehicles they use. You instead make income tax and GST adjustments for private use of the vehicle.

Employer tax credit (sections KJ6 to KJ10 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections MK 1(2) and (4) and MK 9 to MK 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007)
===============================================================================================================================================

2007 legislation provides a tax credit to employers to help offset the costs of making compulsory employer contributions to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme.

New section MK 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section KJ 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004) provides a tax credit to employers to help offset the costs of making matching compulsory employer contributions to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme or CSF. The tax credit will be equal to the lesser of the employer's contribution or $20 a week for each employee. Sections MK 9 to MK16 of the 2007 Act (sections KJ 7 to KJ 12 of the 2004 Act) set out the eligibility rules and how the credit is to be applied. To minimise the compliance costs and cash-flow implications of compulsory employer contributions, the payment of the tax credit is integrated into the PAYE remittance process. It is expected that employers will pay Inland Revenue a net amount after deducting the tax credit from their PAYE liability for the payment period.

This tax credit can be claimed by any employer (including tax-exempt entities such as charities) provided the employer is making an employer contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme or a CSF for an employee who meets the requirements in section MK 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The employer tax credit applies to employer contributions made to a KiwiSaver scheme or CSF from 1 April 2008.

The following section references are to the 2007 Act unless otherwise specified.

**Entitlement**

New section MK 1(2) allows an employer who makes a contribution on behalf of an employee a tax credit for the payment period equal to the amount calculated under section MK 10. To be eligible for the credit the employer must meet the requirements in section MK 9.

**Eligibility requirements**

To be eligible for the employer tax credit, the employer must:

1.  pay an employer contribution for an employee who is aged 18 or over and is not entitled to withdraw an amount from a KiwiSaver scheme or CSF under the scheme rules that require lock-in (that is, the age eligibility for New Zealand superannuation or five years of membership, whichever occurs later);
2.  provide details of the amount of the credit in an employer monthly schedule or remittance certificate (although that is not required if subsection (2) applies); and
3.  be an employer to which KiwiSaver applies (that is, be an employer who is tax-resident in New Zealand or, if not tax-resident, be an employer who carries on a business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand or chooses to apply the KiwiSaver Act on behalf of its employees).

Subsection (2) applies when the employer has unpaid compulsory employer contributions.

**Amount of credit**

The amount of the tax credit allowable to an employer is equal to the lesser of:

*   the amount of the employer contributions for the employee for the payment period; and
*   the amount calculated using the formula: $20 x weeks in payment period.

"Weeks in payment period" means the number of weeks for the payment of the employee's salary or wages for which the employee meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) above, including weeks in that period in which no employer contribution is made. Parts of a week are expressed as a decimal. A "payment period" means the period in which PAYE is withheld in relation to an employee, and includes a period of a month or a period of the 1st to the 15th of a month and a period from the 16th to the end of a month.

For example, if during a payment period for the month of April an employer makes employer contributions of $50, the amount of the tax credit will be $50 because the actual employer contributions are less than the amount calculated by the formula($85.71). If the actual employer contributions were more than $85.71, the amount of the tax credit for that month would be limited to $85.71.[**13**](#13)

The tax credit is available for both voluntary and compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or CSF.

**Application of tax credit**

New sections MK 11 to MK 13 set out the rules relating to how the tax credit will be applied. The tax credit is integrated into the PAYE remittance process so that the value of the credit is given to employers at the same time the employer is required to remit the contributions to providers or Inland Revenue.

Section MK 11 provides that the tax credit arises when the PAYE is due for the month or the date of payment of PAYE for a private domestic worker in which the employer contributions were made. For example, tax credits for contributions made during April 2008 for a monthly payment period would arise on 20 May 2008, being the payment date for that period.

Subsection (2) deals with the situation when subsection MK 9(2) applies, which covers short payment of compulsory employer contributions to a CSF or KiwiSaver scheme.

Sections MK 12 and MK 13 deal with the use of the tax credits to offset employer contributions and other PAYE liabilities.

The tax credit calculated for a payment period is used as follows:

*   first, to pay KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions due for that period or the amount owing to a CSF referred to in a notice received by the Commissioner under section 101I(5) of the KiwiSaver Act;
*   second, to pay voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions for that payment period;
*   third, to pay any other amounts payable for that payment period by the employer;
*   fourth, to pay any other amount payable by the employer to the Commissioner (arrears of an amount due under an Inland Revenue Act); and
*   fifth, to be refunded to the employer.

From 1 April 2009, new section 101I of the KiwiSaver Act requires the Financial Markets Authority to send a notice to Inland Revenue detailing the amount of compulsory employer contributions to a CSF that is owed by an employer. When the notice is received by Inland Revenue or there is a short payment of compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme, new section MK 13 allows the employer tax credits used under sections MK 12(1)(b) or (c) to be used to meet that amount owing. When this occurs, a tax liability of the amount of the credits used becomes payable by the employer to the Commissioner. This is to ensure that the employee receives a contribution equal to the amount of the employer tax credits claimed.

**Miscellaneous provisions**

New section MK 14 provides that if employer contributions are refunded as a result of an employee opting out of KiwiSaver, the amount of any tax credits claimed for the contributions is refundable to the Commissioner.

New section MK 15 provides that if someone is employed by a number of employers who are associated for tax purposes, the associated employers will be considered as one employer for the purposes of claiming the tax credit. This is to prevent associated employers claiming more than one credit for the same employee.

Private domestic workers who are employers for the purposes of the KiwiSaver Act are treated as paying salary or wages to themselves in the capacity of an employee for the purposes of the employer tax credit rules. This means that they are able to claim the credit if employer contributions are made.

Section DC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (Contributions to employees' superannuation schemes), which allows an employer a deduction for contributions to an employee's superannuation scheme, has been amended to limit the amount of the deduction for contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or CSF to the amount for which no credit was claimed.

Section CX 50 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ensures that the employer tax credit is treated as excluded income. For GST purposes, the employer tax credit will be treated as a non-taxable grant or subsidy.

**Definition of "salary and wages" (section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act)**

The definition of "salary and wages" in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended in the following ways:

*   From 1 July 2007, all weekly compensation and paid parental leave payable under Part 7A of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 are treated as salary or wages for the purposes of KiwiSaver.
*   Redundancy payments as defined in the Income Tax Act 2004 are excluded from the definition of "salary and wages".
*   Expenditure on account of an employee and allowances if they are overseas, accommodation and other costs of living are also excluded from the definition of "salary and wages".

The government's intention was that from 1 April 2008, the value of benefits such as board or lodging or the use of a house or quarters, or the payment of allowances instead of such benefits[**14**](#14)
 would be excluded from the definition of "salary and wages" in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act. However, this provision was inadvertently omitted from the amending Act. The omission is expected to be corrected in future legislation.

For the purposes of compulsory employer contributions, the following are not considered salary or wages:

*   all weekly compensation and paid parental leave; and
*   weekly compensation paid by an employer, unless the employer chooses to treat such payments as salary or wages.

This means that these payments are not subject to compulsory employer contributions.

For contributions to complying funds, bonuses, commissions and other amounts that are not included in gross base salary or wages are excluded. This enables employers that contribute to complying funds to apply current practice (gross base salary, or a variant of this) as a contributions multiplier. This change means non-regular payments are excluded and contributions, including compulsory employer contributions, are calculated on the same gross base salary basis as an employee's contribution. However, employers will have to use gross salary and wages as a basis for contributions for those employees that choose to opt into KiwiSaver.

* * *

**13** The formula provided in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 for the calculation of the employer tax credit currently results in a shortfall of the tax credit, depending on how many weeks pay an employee has received in a PAYE period. Officials are working on remedying this legislative error to ensure that the policy intent is implemented.

22 Jan 2025 Interpretation statements / 2025

This interpretation statement provides general guidance on how to identify the relevant item of property when applying the depreciation rules in the income tax legislation. The relevant item of property must be identified to ensure it is a depreciable item and, if so, to determine the applicable depreciation method and rate from which amounts of depreciation losses may be calculated. In many cases, this will task be straightforward. However, in some cases it may be unclear whether an item is a standalone item of property or part of another item of property.

[Issues with logging in to myIR](/topics/myir-secure-online-services/issues-with-logging-in-to-myir)

What you need to do based on your situation
-------------------------------------------

Whether you need to provide more information to us or not, is based on your situation.

### If you receive Working for Families payments

We send out most assessments by 7 June, however if we need more information it may take until 31 July. If the information is right, there’s nothing you need to do. You’ll need to contact us if the information is wrong.

You can do this in myIR.

[End-of-year assessments](/working-for-families/managing/end-of-year-assessments)

[myIR](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/)

### If you have untaxed income, you will need to file an IR3

You’ll need to let us know about any income you’ve earned that has not had tax deducted by filing an IR3.

Returns are available to file from 1 April. If you use myIR, we'll email or text when your return is in your myIR and ready for you to file. If you do not use myIR, we'll send you a paper return by early April.

[Individual income tax return - IR3](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year/individual-income-tax-return---ir3)

If you have a tax agent, get in touch with them first as they may file on your behalf.

### If your employer sorts your salary and wages

If you haven’t heard from us, this means we don’t need more information about your income from you and you should receive your income tax assessment by 7 June in myIR or later by post. 

If you’ve also received income that hasn’t been taxed yet, you will need to let us know and file an IR3 tax return.

### Melissa – gets Working for Families

After the end of the tax year, around June or July, we’ll send Melissa an income tax assessment. This will ask her to check the information we have about her income and family.

We don’t need to hear from Melissa if the information is right. She will need to contact us if it’s wrong.

For Melissa, if either her Working for Families or income tax assessment is a refund and the other is a bill, we will use the refund to pay the bill. She may still have a remaining bill to pay or refund after this.

Te tuku, te whakaae rānei i tō pukapuka whakahoki mō te tāke Filing or approving your end-of-year tax return
============================================================================================================

The tax year is from 1 April to 31 March. You'll need to file or approve your income tax return by 7 July. If you hire a tax agent to do your taxes, you may be able to get an extension. You'll need to organise that with them. Otherwise, filing after 7 July means you'll likely need to pay a late-filing penalty.

There are some situations where your tax year might be different from the standard [balance date](/api/glossary/item?id={28AACCE7-DC17-4ED8-B93C-9BEEFB29DA97})
 of 31 March. This is most common in specific industries. You'll need to apply to change your balance date.

[Balance dates](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/balance-dates)

New Zealand has a tax system where you self-assess your tax position. This means that, while some types of income allow you to pay tax while earning them, you'll still need to file or approve a tax return at the end of the tax year. It's a final calculation to see if you paid too little or too much tax during the tax year. To do this, you'll need to work out:

*   your tax residency status
*   if you're filing or approving your tax return by post or in myIR
*   whether your income was taxed or not during the tax year.

Work out your tax residency status
----------------------------------

Your tax residency status is different from your immigration status. It determines how New Zealand's tax laws apply to you. You'll need work this out, as you can be either a:

*   non-resident taxpayer
*   New Zealand tax resident.

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

Non-resident taxpayers pay tax on income they earn from [New Zealand sources](/api/glossary/item?id={D699D7EA-502F-4FEC-BA1E-B1423F20FA7C})
. This is why you'll still pay tax to New Zealand on, for example, work you do for an organisation in New Zealand or income you earn from investments in New Zealand, even when you're not in New Zealand yourself.

If you become a New Zealand tax resident, you might be eligible for a 4-year temporary tax exemption on most types of income you're earning outside of New Zealand. Otherwise, you'll need to pay tax on your [worldwide income](/api/glossary/item?id={6C6937DA-4F22-4566-8CBF-A870CB1AAE54})
.

[Temporary tax exemption](/roles/nz-tax-residents/exemption)

In both cases, [double tax agreements](/api/glossary/item?id={0E82ABF4-1DE4-456B-BB73-86A641421F8D})
 might affect this. We recommend you check the lists and advice for specific types of income for non-resident taxpayers or New Zealand tax residents. These lists are also where you find out if any exemptions apply to your situation.

[Double tax agreements (DTAs)](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements)

, you'll need to do a final check to see if you paid too little or too much tax. If you've set up an account in myIR, we'll use this to send you either:

*   an income tax assessment
*   a request for more information - income tax assessment
*   a message to complete your tax return.

You'll also be able to update your contact, bank account and income type details in myIR.

If you do not have a personal myIR account, we'll send this information to you by post. It's important that you keep your contact details updated. You can do this by:

*   phoning us
*   filling in a Change of details - IR238 form and sending it to us by post.

You'll see contact numbers and forms under 'Other ways to do this' when you visit the pages in the 'Update my details' section.

Your income is taxed before you get paid
----------------------------------------

If all your income is taxed before you get paid, we'll automatically calculate whether you get a refund or owe us tax.

[My income is taxed before I get paid](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed/my-income-is-taxed-before-i-get-paid)

We do your income tax return based on the information we have and send you an income tax assessment. This will show you how much you earned and the tax you paid during the tax year. Here, you'll see whether you have:

*   a refund
*   tax to pay
*   no tax to pay.

You'll need to check your income tax assessment. If only some of your income gets taxed before you get paid, you'll need to tell us about the other income you earned during the tax year. There are also a few expenses you can claim as an individual.

Your income is not taxed before you get paid
--------------------------------------------

If some or all of your income is not taxed before you get paid, you'll need to tell us about that income.

[My income is not taxed before I get paid](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed/my-income-is-not-taxed-before-i-get-paid)

If we sent you an income tax assessment, you'll need to update your income details there. Otherwise, you'll need to file a tax return that matches your tax residency status. This is where you tell us the income types and amounts that you got during the tax year.

Enforcement proceedings, judicial review, interim relief
========================================================

Shane Warner Builders Ltd sought interim relief in a stay of the liquidation proceedings filed by the CIR to recover unpaid PAYE and GST to allow its judicial review proceedings to be heard.

Case

Shane Warner Builders Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 1654

Legislative References

Judicial Review Procedure Act 2016; Companies Act 1993; Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Shane Warner Builders Ltd (“the applicant”), by its sole director and shareholder, Shane Warner (“Mr Warner”) sought interim relief in the form of a stay of the liquidation proceedings filed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) to recover unpaid PAYE and Goods and Services Tax (GST) in order to allow its judicial review proceedings to be heard.

The applicant sought declarations in the judicial review proceedings that the Commissioner has erred in law and acted unreasonably in failing to accept its proposal to pay outstanding tax over time.  The Court declined to grant interim relief to the applicant as it was not satisfied that an interim order was reasonably necessary to preserve the applicant’s position.

### Impact

The judgment confirms that the Commissioner is not required to accept taxpayer proposals to pay off outstanding tax over time over continuing with enforcement proceedings.

### Facts

The applicant had difficulty keeping up with its tax obligations since operation began in 2012.  The applicant had several instalment arrangements in place to pay off its tax debt over time since 2013.  However, it had consistently failed to keep to these instalment arrangements and keep current taxes up to date, despite having the advantage of several write offs over the years totalling $106,000.  By 25 April 2018, the applicant had tax arrears of $105,679.35.

The Commissioner filed her third statutory demand in November 2017 and made an application to put the company into liquidation on 31 January 2018. The liquidation proceeding was adjourned several times to allow the applicant to apply for financial relief.

The applicant made a first proposal to pay off the tax arrears on 9 April 2018 through instalment payments over time and lump sum payments.  The proposal was considered and declined based on the applicant’s past history of failing to comply with previous instalment and lump sum arrangements.

The applicant made a second proposal on 23 April 2018. The applicant was advised on 24 April 2018 that the second proposal had been considered and declined based on the applicant’s past history of failing to comply with previous instalment and lump sum arrangements and because the applicant has failed to offer evidence that would give the Commissioner confidence that it would be able to meet the terms of this proposal and its current obligations.

The applicant filed an application for judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision and sought interim relief to prevent the liquidation proceeding until the judicial review was determined.

### Decision

_Position to preserve_

The Court was not satisfied that the applicant had a position to preserve that would justify the granting of interim relief. On an overall assessment, the Court considered the application for interim relief was an effort to have its application for financial relief considered fairly and consistently with the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) and it had already had that opportunity.

In its judicial review proceedings the applicant alleged the Commissioner had erred in law or acted unreasonably in taking into account or failing to take into account factors set out in its statement of claim.  These included the misapplication of the applicant’s payments by the Commissioner, a payment of $15,000 made in April 2018 and the applicant’s failure to provide further information.

The Court found there was no suggestion there had been any incorrect allocation of instalment payments at the time the statutory demand was issued in respect of defaults in payment of new tax, and where there was it was due to incorrect coding by the taxpayer.  In addition, the Commissioner’s decision was based on her assessment of the applicant’s history on its ability to meet its tax obligations.  The disputes as to specific amounts made no material difference to the background to the Commissioner’s decision.  There was no dispute that there were defaults in the payment of new tax, and this was quite rightly a matter of significance to the Commissioner in rejecting the second proposal.

There was no doubt the case officer turned her mind to the recovery that might be obtained through agreeing to an instalment arrangement in preference to continuing with liquidation proceedings.  Her correspondence in both proposals was directed at obtaining information that would assist in her decision making regarding outstanding arrears and future tax compliance.  The information provided had been insufficient to satisfy the Commissioner there would be a change from the previous pattern and the applicant would have the resources to pay tax when it was due.

The Court found there was no predetermination and/or bias on behalf of the Commissioner as alleged. The evidence established that the case officer engaged with the applicant’s counsel over both proposals.  She sought further information following the second proposal and had her decision peer reviewed despite having no obligation to do so.  In addition, the Commissioner agreed to a number of adjournments of the liquidation proceedings to allow the proposals to be developed by the applicant and considered by the Commissioner.

The evidence provided by the applicant was considered insufficient to indicate there was a real possibility that any further review by the Commissioner would produce a different result.  The Court considered this especially so given the evidence provided by the case officer (in an affidavit dated 5 June 2018) where she responded to the applicant’s allegations as to the decision making process in detail and explained how and why the recommended rejection of the proposal was made.   This was not a case where the applicant had a reasonable chance of success in either the judicial review proceedings or on the application for financial relief.

_Public interest_

The Court accepted it was in the public interest that the Commissioner could carry out her statutory duties under the TAA including enforcement action expeditiously.  The Court considered the integrity of the tax system would be undermined if the right of the Commissioner to enforce payment of an undisputed tax debt through liquidation is frustrated by requiring the Commissioner to be a party to continuing judicial review proceedings which are without merit.

www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 22 OIA1147 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Septe mber 2021 Dear Your r equest made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was transferred to Inland Revenue on 6 August 2021. Your request to the Minister of Finance was also transferred to Inland Revenue on 13 August 2021. You requested the following (numbered for ease of response): Under the Official Information Act please advise as below, information that will help me understand practices and policies around recovery of child support in NZ: https://www.justice.govt.nz/family/care-of -children/child-support/enforcing- child on -support-payments/. 1.How many applications were made a for border stops by child support agency/IRD- for what levels of debt, accrued over what time period, since this facility was introduced into law? 2.What criteria were applied to the decision by IRD/CSA to apply for a border stop. 3.How many times has IRD/child support agency been authorised to make a border stops on liable parents with child support debt since this facility was introduced into law? 4.By category What were the contributing factors in the court decision to grant a warrant for these border Stops? 5.How many stops resulted? 6.What was the amount of debt owed in each case, what dates were the stops, what amount was paid, over what time period? 7.Other than attachment to a known income source What m echanisms does IRD/CSA have to recover child support debt? 8.What triggers IRD/CSA action towards debt recovery- an amount of debt accrued or a percentage of the assessed amount unpaid or a number of periods unpaid. 9.Does the receiving parent have to request action or does IRD/CSA initiate action on principle in all cases meeting the criteria? 10. What is the status of this work: https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2019/2019-11-27-hague-convention- child-support#statement if it has been put into effect how many successful recoveries have resulted? How many actions have begun? How many cases have been considered? 11. Please can I have the relevant select committee reports? 12. Please can you describe the criteria and process that would see IRD/CSA action taken towards child support recovery under this policy? Is action triggered by IRD/CSA or the owed parent? 13. For example, does the policy target avoidance based on the volume of debt above a certain threshold or does it consider a percentage of the assessment owed to the receiving parent? Ref: 22 OIA1147 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14. How do the two policies and enforcement structures recognise that debt owed to parents is significant for those on low income even though the dollar value may be low? 15. Can you explain the rationale of law changes that came into effect April 2021 in the context of parity for the receiving parent accruing debt and the children being negatively impacted financially and no financial implication for the liable parent for non-payment? I understand the associated publicity cited the rationale for these changes as simplicity, please explain. On 30 August 2021, the following questions relating to arrest warrants, and contributing factors in the court decision to grant an arrest warrant at the border, were transferred to the Ministry of Justice as the information is more connected to that department’s functions. 1. How many applications were made a for border stops by child support agency/IRD 3. How many times has IRD/child support agency been authorised to make a border stops on liable parents with child support debt since this facility was introduced into law? 4. By category What were the contributing factors in the court decision to grant a warrant for these border Stops? Questions 1 and 6 \[How many applications were made a for border stops by child support agency/IRD\]- for what levels of debt, accrued over what time period, since this facility was introduced into law? What was the amount of debt owed in each case, what dates were the stops, what amount was paid, over what time period? Providing the requested information of the amount of debt, length of time the debt was accrued, the stop date at the border and the amount that was paid over a specific amount of time for each arrest warrant case can identify the liable parent. Therefore, I have decided to withhold the specified information of each case under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, a s making the requested information available would be contrary to the provisions of a specified enactment, namely Inland Revenue’s confidentiality obligation in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Disclosure of this information does not fall within any of the exceptions to the confidentiality obligation listed in sections 18D to 18J of the TAA. Question 2 What criteria were applied to the decision by IRD/CSA to apply for a border stop. In order to be able to apply for an arrest warrant under section 199(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 (CSA), we must meet the criteria set out in the legislation: Where a District Court Judge or, if a District Court Judge is not available and the case appears to be one of urgency, any Registrar (not being a constable), is satisfied on application in writing made by the Commissioner that there is reasonable cause to believe that any liable person is about to leave New Zealand with intent to avoid payment of any liability under this Act, the District Court Judge or Registrar may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person. We use this along with the other information we have available to us to look at each case on its own merits and decide if taking this action will achieve the right outcome for all parties involved, and is efficient use of the Commissioners resources. Ref: 22 OIA1147 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 5 How many stops resulted? Data from 1991 to 2005 requires a manual search through each liable parent’s account in order to determine if they were subject to an arrest warrant under section 199(1) of the CSA. Data from 2005 to 2010 requires a manual search through each arrest warrant’s case notes to see the outcome, i.e. if it resulted in an arrest at the border. As such, I have decided to withhold the data from 1991 to 2010 under section 18(f) of the OIA, as the information cannot be made available without substantial research and collation. As per our response to you on 9 July 2020 (20OIA1530), we advised from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2020, 95 arrest warrants were executed. From 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, no arrest warrants were executed. Question 7 and 8 Other than attachment to a known income source What mechanisms does IRD/CSA have to recover child support debt? What triggers IRD/CSA action towards debt recovery- an amount of debt accrued or a percentage of the assessed amount unpaid or a number of periods unpaid. Inland Revenue examines the merits of each parent’s ability to pay child support on a case-by -case basis. When liable parents fail to pay child support, we attempt to contact them to establish why payment has not been made and to encourage them to pay voluntarily. When we are unable to secure funds through all voluntary channels, we look to enforce payments from liable parents by placing a deduction notice, under section 154 of the CSA, on any funds payable to that person. This includes income from salary or wages or from a bank account in the name of the liable parent. If these collection actions are unsuccessful Inland Revenue may also pursue other legal avenues to secure payment, set out in Part 11 of the CSA. These avenues include, but are not limited to, applying for arrest warrants from the courts, issuing summons for examination of financial means, applying to the courts for charging orders against property, and applying for warrants to seize property through the courts. We take these actions as a last resort, we take into account all information we hold and determine if taking this action will achieve the right outcome, and is efficient use of the Commissioners resources. Question 9 Does the receiving parent have to request action or does IRD/CSA initiate action on principle in all cases meeting the criteria? Inland Revenue completes different types of campaigns to initiate collection, the selection process is sensitive, but depending on what information we hold the liable parent may be selected for further action. As well as this a receiving carer can contact Inland Revenue to provide us with any information they hold which would assist in collecting funds owed to them. We consider the information that has been provided, the information that is already available to us and determine what action is available and appropriate under the CSA. Question 10 What is the status of this work: https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2019/2019-11-27- hague-convention-child-support#statement if it has been put into effect how many successful recoveries have resulted? How many actions have begun? How many cases have been considered? The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance 2007 (the Convention) will come into force in New Zealand on 1 November 2021. Ref: 22 OIA1147 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Therefore, under the Convention: • There have been no successful recoveries; • No actions have begun; and • No cases have been considered. Question 11 Please can I have the relevant select committee reports? The relevant select committee report and submissions and advice are publicly available: • Final report of the Social Services and Community Committee: https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en- NZ/SCR 96350/afed3db3ab27429e798a996aec0280b85cab8d56 • Submissions and advice: https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/submissions-and- advice/all?custom=ITE 94888 Question 12 Please can you describe the criteria and process that would see IRD/CSA action taken towards child support recovery under this policy? Is action triggered by IRD/CSA or the owed parent? Article 23 of the Convention outlines the standard process that needs to be followed for recognition and enforcement when an application made under the Convention is received. Once an application is received by Inland Revenue it will either be declared enforceable or registered for enforcement, in accordance with the regular process and criteria used under the CSA. Once Inland Revenue registers the decision or declares it enforceable, no further request or application by the applicant is required under the Convention in order to have the decision enforced. Once the decision has been declared enforceable or has been registered, both parties will be notified of the decision to register or to declare the decision enforceable. The applicant may be notified through the Central Authority of the requesting State or directly, depending on the procedures of the requesting State. A similar process applies when New Zealand is the requesting state and Inland Revenue requests enforcement action in another member country. Once the New Zealand decision has been registered or declared enforceable in the requested state, enforcement action will follow the laws and procedures of that country. The Convention is a multilateral international treaty that enables member countries to recover child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) from liable persons residing in another Contracting State. The Convention would allow recognition of both administrative and court-ordered maintenance between member countries. This would be initiated through the Central Authority of another country contacting Inland Revenue. In some cases, Inland Revenue will be able to make an application for recognition and enforcement of a New Zealand liability in another member country. The owed parent will also be able to initiate the application. The Convention also enables Inland Revenue to assess child support for New Zealand children whose liable parent is not a New Zealand citizen or lives in a member country. This would be initiated through Inland Revenue. Ref: 22 OIA1147 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 13 and 14 For example, does the policy target avoidance based on the volume of debt above a certain threshold or does it consider a percentage of the assessment owed to the receiving parent? How do the two policies and enforcement structures recognise that debt owed to parents is significant for those on low income even though the dollar value may be low? The policy (the Convention) does not target avoidance based on the volume of debt above a certain threshold or consider a percentage of the assessment owed to the receiving parent. Question 15 Can you explain the rationale of law changes that came into effect April 2021 in the context of parity for the receiving parent accruing debt and the children being negatively impacted financially and no financial implication for the liable parent for non-payment? I understand the associated publicity cited the rationale for these changes as simplicity, please explain. The changes made to the penalty rules under the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 recognise that the rules for penalties are overly punitive and complex, and act more as a disincentive, rather than an incentive to pay. The changes to the penalty rules are intended to help customers get things right from the start, which should result in better ongoing compliance, and more financial payments being available for receiving carers and their children. The Bill simplifies the penalty rules by: • repealing monthly incremental penalties and simplifying the penalty write-off rules; • moving the imposition of the second phase of the initial penalty to 28 days after the initial due date; • repealing the rule that provides that the minimum penalty imposed is $5; and • introducing a grace period of 60 days from the first due date during which a newly liable person, or a person returning to the child support scheme, will not be charged late payment penalties. Right of Review If you disagree with my decisions on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decisions. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. Thank you again for your request. Yours sincerely Sue Gillies Customer Segment Leader - Families

Ensuring multinationals pay their fair share of tax
===================================================

**04 June 2019**

New Zealand is pushing on with efforts to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax, with the release of proposed options for a digital services tax (DST).

In February Cabinet agreed to consult the public on the problem of multinational digital companies which do substantial business in this country but pay no tax on income or revenues.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash today proposed two broad options to ensure offshore digital companies no longer enjoy tax breaks which are not available to local businesses.

“Our number one preference remains an internationally agreed solution through the OECD,” says Mr Robertson. “However if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year we need an interim solution. Other nations have already taken this step.”

“The UK has announced it will introduce a two percent DST from April 2020. Austria, the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy and Spain have also enacted or announced DSTs.

“We need to protect our economy and the integrity of our tax system. Modern business practices, digitalisation in particular, mean that a company can be significantly involved in the economic life of a country without paying tax on income or turnover.

“Multinational companies like social media platforms and e-commerce sites generate income through cross-border digital services rather than face-to-face retail,” says Mr Robertson.

The DST outlined in a discussion document released today would apply to:

• platforms which facilitate the sale of goods or services between people, such as Uber and Airbnb and eBay; • social media platforms like Facebook; • content sharing sites like YouTube and Instagram; and • companies which provide search engines and sell data about users.

“A DST would be narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services, but to digital platforms who depend on a base of users for income from advertising or data.

“The value of cross-border digital services in New Zealand is estimated to be around $2.7 billion. The estimated revenue of a DST is between $30 million and $80 million, depending on the design,” Grant Robertson said.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Tax Working Group concluded New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions but also stand ready to implement a DST if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction.

“The OECD is seeking approval for its digital economy work programme from the G20 group of large economies at a meeting in late June. The progress made at the OECD to date has not been sufficient to allay the concerns of several countries, who have announced or introduced DSTs as unilateral interim measures.

“Any DST in New Zealand would be an interim measure. The Government would look to repeal it if and when the OECD’s international solution was implemented,” says Mr Nash.

The two options are:

• Changing the current international income tax rules, to allow more taxation in market countries.  This option is currently being discussed by the OECD and the G20 group of large economies.   • Applying a separate DST of three per cent to certain revenues earned by highly digitalised multinationals operating in New Zealand. The discussion document seeks feedback on how a DST might work in practice.

“The Government is committed to future-proofing the tax system to ensure it can handle changes to how people work and how business is done,” Mr Nash says.

“The significance of the digital economy is only going to grow over the coming decades. We need to keep adapting to ensure multinationals who do business here are paying their fair share of tax.

“We’ve passed legislation to collect GST on remote services, and to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax if they have a physical presence in New Zealand, and we have legislation before parliament to ensure we collect GST on low-value imported goods,” says Mr Nash.

The discussion document can be found at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. Consultation closes on 18 July 2019.

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\]# EA Principles - complete list Approved by Technical Architecture Design Council 9th April 2014 # NameDescriptionRationaleImplication Applicable to Solution Y/N Application 1Principles apply to allArchitecture principles apply to all IR business units, programmes and projects. A single set of architectural principles will ensure the provision of consistent, measurable, quality information across IR. This will enable balanced, consistent decision-making on architectural or design choices and trade-offs. Enterprise Architecture principles must take priority over other design principles at business unit, programme or project level, with any departure approved at Board level or through formal delegation e.g. to the Design Authority. 2One coherent architectureThere is a single joined-up architectural view of IR current and desired future states. All Enterprise Architecture components must fit a single, coherent framework. This is to ensure IR maintains knowledge and control of the end-to-end tax system, and is not reliant for this knowledge on external parties if future changes are required. IR must retain the knowledge and ownership of the architectural framework including methods, standards, models and content, regardless of where, how, or by whom these are developed, or methodologies used. Architectural content must be delivered to IR in line with this framework, and knowledge transfer achieved as part of delivery. 3Business driven architectureAll investment in changes to business, information applications, and technology is in response and directly traceable to IR strategic objectives and business drivers. Investments are only made where there are clear business drivers for change. Solutions exist to support business outcomes and change should not occur without a business driver. IR will move towards a complete and consistent Enterprise Architecture model encompassing business functions, processes, organisational structures and business roles, and supporting information, applications and technology to achieve strategic objectives and outcomes. Solutions must demonstrate strong links to IR's Enterprise Architecture model. 4Safeguard the tax systemThe tax system's integrity is paramount.The integrity of the end-to-end tax system is critical to Crown revenue collection and social policy administration. Public trust in the tax system is essential to maintaining compliance with tax obligations. Regardless of which parties, agencies and systems are involved in its development and operation, IR must retain knowledge of, and operational control over, the working of the end- to-end tax system. All systems and processes must be designed to maintain integrity, preserve information confidentiality, and ensure consistent, fair and accurate application of relevant IR legislation. 5Comply with legislationOur systems and processes comply with all relevant laws, policies, and regulations. Failure to comply with all legislation would compromise IR ability to collect and disburse revenue as required, and erode the tax system's integrity. Architecture ensures legislative needs are highlighted and compliant solutions defined. 6Decisions based on the right information at the right time All decisions are principle-based, informed and enforced. Architecture provides confidence to decision makers that we are doing the right things, at the right time, for the right reasons, and do not deviate from IR strategic goals and business objectives. Architecture must provide guidance so decision makers have the confidence to make and enforce decisions, and deliver on IR commitments. 7Optimise the long-term value of investments Enterprise Architecture optimises the long-term value of investments in tax and social policy systems. A well-defined architecture optimises the economic value of our systems to ensure they are cheaper to run, maintain and change, and minimise investments that do not support IR strategic goals. Initiatives and solutions must be the building blocks of a coherent Enterprise Architecture. 8Mandated government services Mandated Government Services become part of our common business services. IR recognises the value of participating in AOG activities including sharing information and services with other agencies to minimise costs. IR must adopt Government Services at the time appropriate to support its needs. To ensure Government Services are suitable for adoption, IR must be actively involved in their specification and as appropriate, influence their development. 9Promote flexibility and agility Enterprise Architecture must promote flexible policy, processes, and systems. The organisation is required to change at an increasing rate to satisfy business demand. During all stages of the change lifecycle, IR must specify and deploy capabilities and services that can be re-used, re-assembled and used for different purposes. Systems must offer a high level of configurability to minimise future development needs. 10Common services and processes Common services and processes ensure consistent results, and re-use across business units. Re-using the same processes and services across the organisation reduces costs while providing a consistent customer experience. Processes and services must be defined within a coherent framework which ensures they will be re-useable across the business. Duplicate processes and services must be rationalized and services and processes managed under a governance framework. Overarching Architecture Principals Step 1: Reviewall 41 EA Principles, and define whether they are (Y) or are not (N) applicable to the solution that is being assessed. Step 2: Specify how theEA Principle will be applied in relation to the solution being assessed. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\]# 11Enable third parties to contribute Third parties are able to deliver business functions in partnership with IR. Allowing IR to focus on its core business will simplify core IR administration and provide opportunities to take advantage of capabilities within other agencies and partnerships. IRs business services will need to be built within a coherent framework, including well-defined roles and responsibilities. Services identified as non-core will become candidates for sourcing via partnerships, All-of- Government (AOG) collaboration or intermediaries. 12Business continuityIRs business services will continue to operate despite the failure of individual components, or complete outage at locations. The ability to operate is critical to IR ability to collect Crown revenue and the tax system's integrity. Each change initiative must assess the impact of downtime on affected business services, develop a recovery plan, budget for additional infrastructure and added system costs, and more expensive service- level agreements. 13Speed and qualityApplying architecture increases "speed- to-market" while maintaining outcome quality. Quality cannot be compromised while IR improves its ability to respond to increased demand. Business solutions must build on enterprise-wide capabilities to take advantage of economies-of-scale without impeding quality. 14Integrated solutionsIntegrated and unified business solutions will be provided to staff and customers. Integrated solutions reduce the need for IR support by improving staff efficiency while providing customers with a simpler experience. IR will need to develop an integrated view of business capabilities to ensure all initiatives improve integration at an enterprise level. Examples include channel strategy implementation, and a single Service-Oriented Architecture. 15Fit for purpose, fit for useSolutions must be fit for the purpose they are defined for, and fit to be used within IR. IR must have processes and systems that allow services to be efficiently and effectively delivered. This will improve user experience and provide a reliable platform on which IR can do business. IR needs to continue refining its common business services to ensure business capabilities remain fit for purpose. In addition, IR needs to align business capabilities to processes and systems to ensure they remain fit for use. 16Common data definitionsData is consistently defined throughout the extended enterprise, are understandable, and available to all users. A single set of understood and available data definitions will minimise system integration efforts, simplify data exchanges between systems, and facilitate communication and information exchange internally and between agencies. As part of its enterprise information architecture, IR must establish a common data vocabulary for standardisation and change initiatives. These definitions will need to be properly used, documented and managed, and progressively migrated to existing systems and interfaces. 17Data is trusted and ownedEach information object has a steward who provides and requires good practices for managing information over its life-cycle. Stewardship provides a cohesive, trusted, timely, and secure set of data assets that enables consistent and credible business processes within IR and with external parties. IR must identify and allocate data stewards at business and system levels. The allocation rationale, role definition, responsibilities and processes, such as dispute resolution, must be reflected in a Data Ownership Policy. Stewards must be accountable and responsible for the integrity, accuracy, classification, privacy, and usage of their designated data elements. 18Information is an assetAs an asset of value to all of New Zealand, IR manages its information accordingly. Quality information is critical to IR ability to function as an organisation. Furthermore, IR is the custodian of information increasingly sought after by third parties for use in decision making. Accurate, complete, reliable and timely information is essential to well-informed decision making. The execution of IR's responsibilities takes place in an increasingly open Public Sector. Management of the lifecycle of core information must be formally delegated to an IR information steward who has appropriate authority and accountability for its quality and integrity, regardless of where it is located. The information steward must exercise responsibility for technological obsolescence, long-term preservation, and access. 19Information is shared and available Users require appropriate access to data necessary to perform their duties. A single reliable and accessible view of information is essential to building customer trust and confidence, and promoting voluntary compliance. In line with government Information Management Principles, IR's data and information should be open, readily available, well managed, reasonably priced, and re-usable unless there are reasons for its protection. IR's data and information should also be trusted and authoritative. IR must understand what data is to be used by whom. Data must be accessible to appropriate parties through IR's systems, search and collaboration tools. IR must evaluate its data in terms of being an authoritative source and develop policies and frameworks to support this. 20Single system of recordA single system records the truth of any given information object. Establishing a single system as the “owner”, or authoritative source, of data records ensures better data integrity, simpler systems, and better alignment with a common information model. This in turn improves or quality of services and ability to change them. IR will need to develop a common information model as part of its Enterprise Information architecture, and to map data entities to their single system of truth. A framework will need to be developed to manage policies, processes, and the relationships between data in “master” and other repositories. New initiatives will be required to use or establish capabilities that implement these single record sources. Business Architecture Principles I nformation Architecture Principles \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\]# 21Buy before buildBuy suitable Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) products in preference to bespoke development, assuming the component in question is sufficiently flexible and fit for purpose. If appropriate, buying the required capability as a service should be considered. Commercial software, open source software, and Software as a Service provides IR with an opportunity to obtain functionality faster and cheaper than building bespoke software. This approach will allow IR to focus on its core business and reduce specialist technology. Selection processes must evaluate and select software that is fit for purpose. In some cases affected business processes will be tailored to align with functionality available from the selected product. Where this is not possible, software must be built in a way that does not lock IR into maintaining bespoke software. Over time the amount of bespoke development will be significantly reduced. 22Configure, don’t customiseCOTS and FOSS products and AOG solutions will be configured with minimal customisation. Once customised, COTS and FOSS applications are hard to upgrade and support increasing cost, complexity and maintenance risks. To avoid customisation, IR may need to tailor some business processes to match processes supported by COTS, FOSS, or AoG products. Any customisation must be implemented in a way that does not impact a product's ability to be upgraded. 23Capabilities have a clear purpose and scope Solutions must be built on a set of capabilities and services, each of which has a clear business function and boundary. Delivering solutions as integrated capabilities and services provides clarity to business, and results in a smaller set of applications over time. This simplifies integration, prevents capability duplication, and eliminates conflicting data and processes. IR will need to increase standardisation of business processes across the organization to avoid the cost and complexity of each capability becoming unsustainable. Reference models will need to be enhanced to identify the scope and behaviour of capabilities, so processes and systems can be developed which optimise commonality and reuse. 24Re-usable, modular, open and service-oriented Solution architectures must be based on re-usable and modular components, using open standards and assembled using a services-oriented approach. Composing services in this way allows IR to reuse investments to satisfy new business scenarios, and to operate with and consume services from other vendors or partner agencies. Solution architectures must be designed for re-use so each provides a well-defined function that can be assembled with others as part of a bigger system. All modules must follow open standards to ensure they operate with each other in a services-oriented approach. 25Version currency (n-1)IR will aim to maintain software products within one version of the most current. IR current software must be maintained to ensure software vendor support, the latest security patches, and current release new feature benefits. A robust upgrade and patching programme must be implemented. System capability roadmaps must be developed to plan for appropriate upgrades, and factored into application lifetime planning, service provider selection, and support and warranty agreements. 26Quality aspects are defined and assured All requirements for new applications will include a set of non-functional requirements including Quality Characteristics. Quality aspects contributing to a large part of the total cost of system ownership must be defined up-front and managed throughout to reduce delivery risks. Failure to identify quality aspects will lead to unexpected consequences and systems unable to satisfy IR needs. Quality definitions and assurance measures must be included in every aspect of a change lifecycle and recorded as requirements. Architecture must directly address quality requirements to ensure solutions correctly address IRs on-going needs. 27Applications run on various platforms or as a Service Applications are independent of specific technology choices or service providers and can operate on a variety of technology platforms. Platform independence offers more technology infrastructure choices which reduces obsolescence risks and vendor lock-in, and allows AoG Infrastructure Service adoption. Infrastructure and information system architectures must define portability standards, application runtime environment preferences, and application and platform consolidation strategies. 28Applications accessible via most channels with Digital first Applications and services are designed and built to be independent of, and support, multiple delivery channels. Digital channels must be the first and preferred channels. To allow users to choose the best channel and ensure the same results are obtained regardless of the channel chosen, business system functions can be offered over new channels with minimal additional investment. Channels must not contain business functions, and applications providing business functionality must be independent of channels presenting it. Functionality must be exposed using a well-defined service framework to insulate the application from the consuming channel and allow the simple addition of new channels. 29Ease of useSolutions are designed for ease-of-use by staff and customers. Easy-to-use solutions increase adoption levels and reduce errors improving staff efficiency and customer satisfaction. Simplicity and ease-of-use must become primary considerations in IR process and system design; ease-of-use in one group should not be traded off at the expense of another. 30Isolation of business rulesDefinition and execution of policy and business rules are implemented separately from application code and data. A policy of agility and speed-to-market for legislative changes should be applied consistently and correctly across products. New solutions and systems are used to consume rules from external sources, such as rules engines. Any rules capability must be capable of defining rules efficiently and independent of the consuming systems. 31Rent before buy / build / operate Rent technology infrastructure as a Service before Buy/Build/Operate (aka "Invisible Infrastructure"). This approach will allow IR to focus on its core business and simplify administration by delegating technology infrastructure to specialist service providers. IR will need to develop detailed service level agreements and increase governance to effectively utilize service providers. The security architecture will need to address specific security concerns associated with managed services. 32Consolidate infrastructures into common capabilities Technology infrastructure should be consolidated into common capabilities to allow hosting on common platforms, including AOG platforms. Consolidation simplifies the technology landscape and assists improved IR staff efficiency. The IR technology infrastructure must be designed for a reduced footprint that takes advantage of technology supporting multiple services on a common operating platform. Application consolidation may be required as a first step to fully realize common technology capabilities. 33Minimise environmental impact Applications and Infrastructure should use resources efficiently to minimise environmental impact. IR is required to comply with government policies for the efficient energy use of ICT resources. IR will need to identify and apply environmental and energy rating standards during infrastructure and service procurement. Information System Architecture Principles tructure \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\]# 34Meet availability and performance requirements Infrastructure should be designed and implemented to meet business availability and performance requirements. The availability and performance of IR business systems are critical for our ability to administer Crown revenue and to the tax system's integrity. Availability and performance requirements will need to be clearly understood and communicated through Business Impact Analysis of services to ensure selection of the right levels of resiliency, availability and performance. 35Separate production environments Production runtime environments are separated from their equivalent non- production environments to reduce production interference and security risks. Separation reduces risks associated with production environment changes which can lead to system unavailability and data corruption. Separation also makes it harder for internal hackers to access production systems. Separate environments require a larger investment in infrastructure, version control, access control, and de-identified data sets. 36Common authentication and access control Parties will need a single set of credential and access rights across all enterprise resources. One set of credentials and common access control saves the business time and improves audit efficiency. IR will need to expand its common authentication and access control capabilities to interact with AOG initiatives and provide common security for all IR business services. 37Adapt to business requirements Technology infrastructure should be adaptable to the business' changing requirements. To satisfy business demand in a timely and cost effective way, IR is required to provide new services and to institute change at an increasing rate. The technology infrastructure must be architected and designed to be able to provide throughput, volumes, and functions required by changes in a timely and cost effective way. 38Risk-based security, privacy and audit controls Adopt a risk management approach covering all protective security areas. Apply the right level of Security control to match the risk tolerance level of each situation. Control and enablement objectives are derived from analysing risks in terms of likelihood vs. consequences. Deliver the maximum level of security for the smallest investment of time and money, while having assurance risk has been properly evaluated and either appropriate controls applied, or risks explicitly accepted by the appropriate authority. IRD must proactively and routinely manage security risks based on breach events probability and the impact breaches may have on IR's business continuity and reputation. IRD must: • identify and classify business information assets that need protecting • identify controls to mitigate the risks • do a cost / benefit analysis controls where not mandated by government guidelines • apply the right level of controls to match the risk tolerance level for each situation • ensure executives accountable for decisions are made aware of all applicable risks via an enterprise risk management framework • ensure that security risk assessments are completed as part of the IR change lifecycle 39Multiple layers of securityDefend the enterprise with a variety of security controls, including managerial, operational, and technical controls (also called "defence in depth"). Layered security mechanisms increase the security of systems as a whole. If an attack caused a security mechanism to fail, other mechanisms should provide the necessary security to protect the enterprise. Enterprise Information Security Architecture must be adopted to direct security control implementation which should have traceability to the safe enablement of business operations. Staff education is a critical piece of security architecture. 40Separation of security concerns Identify and group different security concerns in systems and business functions under the same set of security controls. Design security functions to be logically separate from the enterprise capabilities they protect. Grouping systems and functions with similar security concerns under the same security controls simplifies security management, and ensures the right level of security is applied at the right place. Security Architecture must define various security zones as required and controls applied in each. These should be designed as re-usable within the zone. 41Security as an enabler of business objectives Security enables IR to perform its business functions while ensuring information assets remain secure and available. Security ensures IR has access to the information it needs to do its job and meet confidentiality, accessibility and integrity obligations, while allowing new technologies to be adopted. Security requirements should be identified from a viewpoint of: • how can we do this safely? • how can we make it easy for people to do the right thing regarding security.

Enterprise architecture
=======================

The design work for our transformation was led by the Enterprise Architecture team using a set of architectural principles which applied to all Inland Revenues business units, programmes and projects. This was important as it provided consistent, quality data which could be measured as was required to make informed design decisions and trade-offs.

High-level design
-----------------

The high-level design of our transformation delivered a complete set of solution blueprints to give us a picture of what we were creating and how this would help make tax and entitlements simpler and easier for customers and create a more agile and sustainable organisation.

We presented the blueprint content as a honeycomb to illustrate how each part of our transformation programme was being designed in an interconnected way.

The Business Transformation honeycomb - key characteristic of the business solution architecture.

### Design governance

Two forums played a critical role controlling of our programme scope, adherence to design principal and maintaining quality standards throughout the programme. These were the Business Transformation Design Authority and the Business Transformation Technical Design Authority. Their role was to:

*   ensure alignment across all the programme workstreams
*   review any proposed changes to design, scope or delivery
*   share product demonstrations or review documentation and,
*   make informed recommendations to the Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (an Executive Leadership Team-led forum outside the transformation programme).

An entertainment expense where the benefits are enjoyed or received by employees may be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT).

There are 3 major types of business entertainment expenses:

*   100% deductible, not liable for FBT
*   50% deductible, not liable for FBT
*   100% deductible, liable for FBT.

These are summarised briefly below. Read our Entertainment expenses guide - IR268 to find out more about entertainment expenses.

100% deductible, not liable for FBT
-----------------------------------

Entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and not liable for FBT if they’re completely business related.

This includes:

*   meals an employee buys while travelling on business (unless it is with an existing or potential business contact, or the meal is a celebration, reception or similar event – in these situations it would only be 50% deductible)
*   food and drink provided at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts at least 4 hours (unless the conference is mainly for entertainment – in which case it would only be 50% deductible)
*   light meals provided in a dining room for senior managers and consumed as part of their duties (such as sandwiches provided during a board meeting)
*   entertainment that promotes your business (as long as the public has the same access to this as your employees, business contacts or people associated with the business – if the public has less access it would only be 50% deductible)
*   entertainment that is only a secondary part of either a function that is open to the public, or any trade display (for example, serving coffee at your business’s trade display)
*   freebies promoting your business (such as branded stationery, but excluding any given to employees or people associated with you – these are only 50% deductible)
*   entertainment provided to someone who’s going to review it for publication (such as giving a free meal to food critics)
*   entertainment provided at a discount, if your business regularly provides entertainment at market prices (for example, offering half-price meals at your restaurant)
*   entertainment enjoyed outside of New Zealand.

50% deductible, not liable for FBT
----------------------------------

Entertainment expenses will be 50% deductible and not liable for FBT if they are not completely business related. This includes entertainment that is away from work or out of usual working hours, so it has a 'significant private element'. The expense will be 50% deductible even if you think the private element was more or less than 50%.

Examples of this include:

*   entertainment at sports or cultural events (for example, a corporate box)
*   business use of a holiday home
*   hiring a boat, and providing food and drink to people on it
*   food and drink you provide for social events (such as parties) or in an area set aside for senior employees (though there is an exception for 'light meals' consumed as part of the manager’s duties, which are 100% deductible)
*   gifts of food and drink that benefit your business and are enjoyed privately by the person who receives them (for example, if you give a bottle of wine to each customer who buys a car off you)
*   'supporting expenses' for other entertainment that’s 50% deductible, such as hire of wine glasses and wait staff for a party

100% deductible, liable for FBT
-------------------------------

Entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and liable for FBT if they are received by employees because of the work they do. Examples of this include rewards for good performance, such as a restaurant gift voucher or weekend away.

Entitlement to deregister from GST and decision on whether or not a sale was planned results in partial win for the Commissioner
================================================================================================================================

2009 case note – Partial win for CIR and taxpayer – GST de-registration, Lopas Test, Court's power to vary interest and penalties.

Case

LGH Thompson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1986

### Summary

The case was a partial win for the Commissioner and Taxpayer. The Court found that the Taxpayer was not entitled to de-register on 30 November 1999. The Commissioner's assessment which assessed output tax on two property transactions sold in the Goods and Services Tax ("GST") period after the Taxpayer's de-registration was consequently upheld. The third property transaction which the Commissioner had assessed in a later GST period was found incorrect; rather the Court found that the output tax on that property should be returned by the Taxpayer as a deemed disposition in the Taxpayer's unregistered capacity pursuant to section 5(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act ("the Act").

### Impact of decision

For the purposes of determining if transactions are relevant to the projection of whether a Taxpayer's taxable activities will exceed the legislative threshold over the ensuing 12 months, a transaction will be "planned" prior to de-registration if there is evidence that the transaction, has at that time been advanced "in a sufficiently choate way that it is to be seen as connected with the conduct of the business, even when it is being downsized". Neither contemplation nor intention to sell will be enough. It appears that "major steps" must have been taken in relation to the sale. Therefore it would seem that the test in _Lopas v CIR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,726 has been narrowed.

It is important to note that an amendment to section 10(8) of the Act with application on and after 10 October 2000, has removed the opportunity for Taxpayers to reduce their liability for GST by de-registering and paying GST on the cost price of the goods rather than the market value. With one exception the amendment has the effect of requiring GST to be paid on the market value of the goods. However for goods acquired prior to the introduction of GST on 1 October 1986, GST is either payable at the lower of cost or market price of the goods.

### Facts

The Taxpayer had been registered for GST since 1986, on a six-monthly return basis. In November 1999, he sought to deregister. The Commissioner initially accepted the Taxpayer's de-registration application from 30 November 1999 and advised him of this in December 1999. The Taxpayer then disposed of the relevant land in three transactions, in December 1999, March 2000 and September 2000 and did not account for GST on the sales. Default assessments for GST were raised in July 2004 for the six months to 31 July 2000. A subsequent assessment was also issued in January 2005, for the period ending 31 January 2001.

The Taxpayer argued that the sales went ahead only after he was deregistered and, accordingly, liability was confined to a deemed disposition to himself in his unregistered capacity (ie one ninth of the original acquisition cost) pursuant to section 5(3) of the Act.

The Commissioner contended that the Act entitled him to revisit an approval to de-register where he was not fully informed at the time of giving approval to de-register. In this case, the Commissioner considered that he was entitled under section 52(3) of the Act to treat the Taxpayer as re-registered until all the transactions had been undertaken. Accordingly, the Taxpayer was assessed for output tax for the consideration on all three of the transactions based on the sale price rather than the original acquisition costs.

In March 2005, the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") upheld the Taxpayer's challenge to the decision of the Commissioner to re-register him. The Commissioner appealed the decision. However, before the hearing of the appeal, the Court of Appeal delivered its decision in _Lopas v CIR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,726. _Lopas_ was a decision with similar issues where the Court of Appeal found that the TRA had erred because the projected extent of taxable supplies should include the value of deemed or actual dispositions of property that had been used in the GST registered business.

These proceedings were in part an appeal by the Taxpayer from a further aspect of the TRA decision as to the de-registration date and also a dispute over the correctness of the GST assessments.

### Decision

#### Issue One - Whether the Taxpayer was entitled to deregister on 30 November 1999

Before considering the liability of the Taxpayer to account for GST output tax on the three land transactions, his Honour analysed the decision in _Lopas_. Dobson J stated that the facts in _Lopas_ were "slightly different", in that the Taxpayer in this case did not account for the deemed or actual disposal of any of the properties, on any basis, at the time of de-registration.

##### The Lopas decision

His Honour agreed with the Commissioner that the Court of Appeal's reasoning in _Lopas_ "does not recognise any material distinction between immediate cessation and a staged winding-down of an about to be de-registered business". Dobson J stated that section 5(3) applies irrespective of whether the business is going to cease upon de-registration, or continue in a reduced form but in a level less than $30,000 taxable supplies for the ensuing 12 months.

His Honour also noted that the Court of Appeal in _Lopas_ interpreted the proviso in section 51(1) as only applying in situations where an initial obligation to register would otherwise be triggered by the circumstances of cessation, namely, where the deemed disposal would for the first time push the scale of taxable activities over $30,000. Accordingly, in the present case, Dobson J concluded that the three land transactions were relevant to the projection of whether taxable activities would exceed $30,000 over the ensuing 12 months, on whatever basis they are to be valued.

Further, his Honour noted that in _Lopas_ the Court held that where transactions were planned as at the date of de-registration, the sale will be treated as part of the taxable activity. His Honour rejected the Commissioner's argument that the test was whether a sale was "in contemplation". Rather, the transactions need be planned and firmly in place to be effected. This will require a fact specific assessment in each case to determine whether the transactions are planned in a "sufficiently choate way that is to be seen as connected with the conduct of the business, even when it is being downsized". Dobson J considered that _Lopas_ suggests that an intention to sell will not be enough.

##### The three land transactions

Dobson J concluded that the Taxpayer was not entitled to de-register until 31 July 2000.

As for the first land transaction, his Honour concluded that it was sufficiently planned as at the de-registration date and so the Taxpayer was obliged to account for GST on the sale price. With regard to the second transaction, while his Honour determined that more would have been needed for it to be planned; he did not accept that "each transaction can be viewed in isolation". In his opinion, because of the first transaction, "the second transaction is to be assessed as it occurred within the following six month period". Accordingly, the Taxpayer was also obliged to account for GST on the second sale on the basis of the sale price.

However, as for the third transaction, Dobson J concluded that it was not planned as at 31 July 2000. Accordingly, given the Taxpayer was in a de-registered status at that time, he was only obliged to account for GST on an apportioned component of the original acquisition price pursuant to section 5(3) of the Act.

His Honour did note that, notwithstanding the land sales, the rental income derived would have amounted to more than the required level of supplies.

#### Issue Two - Whether the steps taken by the Commissioner to de-register and re-register the Taxpayer were adequate

His Honour also discussed the arguments raised by the Taxpayer over the adequacy of steps taken by the Commissioner to de-register and re-register the Taxpayer. Dobson J concluded that "although inconsistencies in communications from the Department are unfair, they could not be sufficient to deprive an assessment for a subsequent period of its lawful effect". His Honour stated that any unfair communication could not affect the extent of basic GST for which the Taxpayer is liable.

#### Issue Three - The correctness of the assessments

The Taxpayer had also asserted that the default assessments issued were incorrect. His Honour agreed that the default assessment for the 31 July 2000 period was in error because the rental income, on which output tax had been assessed, ought to have been offset against the expenses incurred in earning that rental income. Further, the default assessment for the 31 January 2001 period was wrong by virtue of the inclusion of the third sale. In addition, a further extension of his re-registration beyond 31 July 2000 was not warranted in the absence of a planned transaction. Accordingly, Dobson J held that the default assessment for the period prior to 31 July 2000 be increased as a result of the deemed disposition. Consequently, the default assessment for the period from 1 August 2000 was considered incorrect and should be cancelled.

#### Issue Four - The application of the anti-avoidance provision in section 76

His Honour concluded that it was unnecessary to consider whether the anti-avoidance provision applied given his conclusion on the earlier issues.

#### Issue Five - Whether the interest and penalties imposed on the Taxpayer should be varied

His Honour concluded that he did not have jurisdiction to vary the extent of the late payment penalties or interest but invited the Commissioner to exercise his discretion to remit the penalties under section 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Entitlement to tax sparing credits under the double tax agreement between New Zealand and China
===============================================================================================

2017 case note - provides guidance on the interpretation of Article 23 of the China DTA - CFC, tax sparing, tax credits, OECD Model, UN Model.

Case

Patty Tzu Chou Lin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 969

Legislative References

Article 23 New Zealand/China DTA, s 138P of the TAA 1994, ss LC 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, LC4(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and LK 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This case concerns an investment held in five companies established in China (“the Chinese Companies”) and the tax consequences to the plaintiff, Ms Lin, of that investment.

Ms Lin was assessed by attribution for New Zealand tax on a 30 per cent share of the income derived by the Chinese Companies.

Ms Lin contends that, in assessing her, the defendant, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”), failed to allow her the full tax credits to which she was entitled under the double tax agreement (“DTA”) between New Zealand and China (“the China DTA”) and under the related New Zealand domestic law.

The Court found that the Commissioner’s assessments and default assessments in respect of Ms Lin’s income tax are incorrect.

This judgment is under appeal.

### Impact

The judgment provides guidance on the interpretation of Article 23 of the China DTA.

### Facts

Ms Lin is a New Zealand tax resident and her income is subject to New Zealand tax, regardless of where it is sourced. The present case concerns income attributed to Ms Lin in the 2005 to 2009 tax years (“the tax years in dispute”). During those years, Ms Lin held a 30 per cent stake in two BVI companies.

Because of her shareholdings in these companies, Ms Lin was considered to hold a control interest in the Chinese Companies. Each of the Chinese Companies was accordingly defined as a Controlled Foreign Corporation (“CFC”) for New Zealand purposes. The income derived by the Chinese Companies was therefore attributed to Ms Lin for New Zealand purposes under the regime pertaining to CFCs.

Over the course of the tax years in dispute, Ms Lin was attributed with personal income from the Chinese Companies totalling $4.605 million.

The Commissioner allowed tax credits from China of $926,968 to offset Ms Lin's New Zealand tax liability on her attributed CFC income for Chinese tax paid by the Chinese Companies in relation to that income, leaving some $869,000 due from Ms Lin.

Under Chinese domestic tax law, tax concessions were available to the Chinese Companies, so they were relieved of Chinese tax in the amount of $588,135, which would otherwise have been imposed on their incomes (tax spared).

If credited against her New Zealand liability, as she asserts should be the case, Ms Lin's tax liability would have been reduced to just under $281,000. However, the Commissioner refused to allow any credit in respect of tax spared to the Chinese Companies.

### Decision

_DTAs_

Under a DTA one country gives up some of its income taxation rights over source or residence taxation in return for which the other country gives up some of its own income taxation rights in an effort to ensure that income is taxed only once (and in some cases, to ensure it is taxed at least once).

The differing objectives of countries in entering into DTAs are reflected in the two different Model Conventions upon which most DTAs are based: The OECD Model Convention (“OECD Model”) and the UN Model Convention (“UN Model”). New Zealand is a member of the OECD and generally adopts the OECD Model’s provisions but also adopts aspects of the UN Model.

Many DTAs include "tax sparing" provisions, whereby a contracting country agrees to grant relief from residence tax by way of foreign tax credits with respect to source taxes which have not actually been paid (taxes which have been "spared") because of source taxation concessions provided by the other contracting country. In the absence of tax sparing provisions, an investor who takes advantage of Chinese tax concessions, reduces its tax in China but loses its foreign tax credits (in its New Zealand tax return) and pays more tax in New Zealand. The Chinese tax concessions, instead of encouraging investment in China, effectively transfers tax revenue from China to New Zealand.  A tax sparing provision deems Chinese tax to have been paid as if no Chinese tax concessions existed so the investor and not the New Zealand government, gets the benefit of the Chinese tax concessions and the investment incentive stays in place.  Whilst the Commentary to Article 23 of the UN Model strongly supports the inclusion of such provisions, the OECD Model does not.

_The New Zealand Approach_

Expert witness Robin Oliver for the Commissioner described New Zealand's underlying policy framework for international tax as a "national welfare maximisation" model meaning that New Zealand's domestic tax rules should apply the same rate of domestic tax regardless of whether the investment is made onshore or offshore. This best ensures investments made make the highest return to New Zealand. However, New Zealand recognises its ability to deny foreign tax credits is severely constrained by DTAs and other international practical and political considerations. The granting of credits for foreign tax is the international norm and a political necessity, rather than a desirable policy outcome as far as New Zealand is concerned. Mr Oliver described each Article of a DTA as being negotiated separately because each deals with a different income stream based on its legal form. Precedents are very important and once a deviation from national policy is agreed to with one country, it is hard to resist providing the same concession to other negotiating partners. A provision might have no practical effect but might be necessary for political or other reasons.

_The China DTA_

The Court heard that China had a firm policy of requiring tax sparing provisions in DTAs reflecting its position as a developing economy, its adherence to the UN Model, and its global positioning as a "leader of the third world". Evidence was given that New Zealand had a long-standing policy against the inclusion of tax sparing provisions in DTAs. However, by the time the China DTA was being negotiated, New Zealand had already incorporated tax sparing provisions in agreements with six other countries and was, therefore, not in a position to refuse a tax sparing agreement with China. Mr Oliver said that New Zealand would have sought a provision which was as restricted in its application as possible.

_CFCs and attribution_

New Zealand's statutory CFC regime came into effect from 1 April 1988, with the objective of reducing opportunities for New Zealand residents to avoid or defer New Zealand tax through the accumulation of income in foreign non-resident companies. The OECD Commentary states that CFC rules which tax "residents on income attributable to their participation in certain foreign entities" are “internationally recognised as a legitimate instrument to protect the domestic tax base”.

There is no dispute that the CFC regime applied to Ms Lin. She had the necessary control and income interests. The Court noted that none of the Chinese Companies ever distributed dividends to Ms Lin.

_The principles governing treaty interpretation_

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (“Vienna Convention”) applies to DTAs. While the ordinary meaning of the terms of a DTA is the starting point, it is also mandatory to consider the context, object and purpose of the DTA.

Where the treaty in question is a DTA based wholly or in part upon the OECD or UN Models, the Commentaries will be highly relevant in determining the correct interpretation of the treaty. Although the Commentaries are not legally binding, they are regarded as “a source from which courts of different states can seek a common interpretation”.

_Chinese tax paid in respect of \[CFC\] income derived by a resident of New Zealand_

The outcome of this issue turns almost exclusively upon the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”.  Ms Lin contends that tax which is paid by a CFC is “Chinese tax paid…in respect of \[CFC\] income derived by a resident of New Zealand”. The Commissioner submits that this must mean tax which has been paid by the New Zealand resident herself, therefore excluding tax paid by the CFC. The Commissioner submitted that the CFC regime has created a different income stream which is not business income but is an income stream derived by the New Zealand owner in respect of which the New Zealand owner has not paid in China. Ms Lin submitted that the proper construction of Article 23(2)(a) is to focus on the tax not the payer and the proper construction is much wider than the approach taken by the Commissioner.

Under the CFC regime the profits of the CFC are subject to corporate tax in the home jurisdiction of the CFC whilst the same or derivative income is taxed in the hands of investors in the resident state. Two separate legal persons are taxed on the same income - one directly, the company in China, and one by attribution, the investor in New Zealand. In this way, it can be said that the CFC regime results in economic double taxation.

Paragraph 3 of the OECD Commentary on Articles 23A and 23B describes international juridical double taxation as arising in three cases. This expanded definition of juridical double taxation is helpful to the CFC analysis because CFC attributed income can be considered as income derived from, in this case, China and both China and New Zealand impose tax on that income. Taxation of CFC attributed income can be considered to fall within the definition of or be deemed to be juridical double taxation and covered by Article 23. Further support for this interpretation is found in the discussion in the OECD Commentary on Articles 23A and 23B regarding the tax treatment of partnerships. The interpretation of the partnerships discussion is critical to the interpretation of Article 23 generally. In the view of the Court, the OECD Commentary extends Article 23 to partnerships and entities which, like partnerships, are treated in different ways by contracting states and this can properly include CFCs.

The Court concluded that “Chinese tax paid ... in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in the People's Republic of China” includes Chinese tax paid by the CFC itself. The effect of Article 23(2)(a) of the China DTA is therefore that Chinese tax paid by a CFC must be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable by Ms Lin on her CFC income.

_The application of tax sparing provisions to CFC income_

Unlike Article 23(2)(a), Article 23(3) refers specifically to “tax payable ... by a resident of New Zealand”. The question is whether Article 23(3) therefore precludes a New Zealand resident from obtaining any tax credit in respect of tax spared to a CFC.

The Court concluded that Article 23(3) must be read in light of Article 23(2)(a). That under the CFC rules, the income of the CFC is deemed to have been earned by the owner, and so the tax paid by the CFC is deemed to have been paid by the owner (the New Zealand resident). When this analysis is extended to Article 23(3), the only logical conclusion is that tax paid or payable by a New Zealand resident includes tax which is deemed to have been paid or to be payable by the New Zealand resident for the purpose of Article 23(2)(a).

The Court concluded that a New Zealand resident is entitled to a credit for tax spared in China to the CFC. This enables Article 23 to be read in a principled way, giving effect to its purpose of relieving double taxation.

_The effect of Article 23 on New Zealand’s domestic income tax legislation_

The China DTA has direct effect in New Zealand and therefore pursuant to the China DTA, Ms Lin is entitled to credits for tax paid by and tax spared to the CFCs. New Zealand's domestic legislation must be interpreted consistently with and give effect to New Zealand's obligations under the China DTA.

_Shortfall penalty_

Given the decision, the question of shortfall penalties does not arise.  
 

Result

The Court gave judgment for Ms Lin.

Entitlement to tax sparing credits under the double tax agreement between New Zealand and China
===============================================================================================

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue was correct in refusing to allow Patty Tzu Chou Lin a further credit for New Zealand tax payable

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Patty Tzu Chou Lin \[2018\] NZCA 38

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007 Subparts BH and LK; Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the People?s Republic of China for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (New Zealand/China DTA)

### Summary

The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) was correct in refusing to allow Patty Tzu Chou Lin (“Ms Lin”) a further credit for New Zealand tax payable on her attributed Controlled Foreign Companies (“CFC”) income for the tax totalling $588,135.91 that the CFCs had been spared from paying in China under Chinese domestic law.

### Impact

The decision confirms that New Zealand residents will not be entitled to a credit against income tax liability in New Zealand for tax spared by China on income earned there by companies in which the resident has a relevant income interest.

### Facts

Ms Lin is a New Zealand tax resident and her income is subject to New Zealand tax regardless of where it is sourced.

Between 2005 and 2009 (the tax years in dispute) Ms Lin had a 30 per cent interest in five companies which were resident in China. Each company was defined as a CFC for New Zealand tax purposes.

As a result, the income derived by four of the five Chinese companies was attributed to Ms Lin for New Zealand tax purposes under the CFC regime.

The Commissioner attributed to Ms Lin CFC income from the Chinese companies totalling $4,605,162.98. The New Zealand tax payable by Ms Lin on this income was about $1.796 million. The Commissioner allowed Ms Lin tax credits under New Zealand domestic law of $926,968.12. Her New Zealand tax liability on her attributed CFC income was offset by that amount for Chinese tax actually paid by the Chinese companies. The Commissioner assessed Ms Lin as liable to pay attributed tax of $869,000.

The Chinese companies were spared from paying tax totalling $588,135.91 under Chinese domestic law which would otherwise have been imposed on their incomes. The Commissioner refused to allow Ms Lin a further credit for New Zealand tax payable on her attributed CFC income for the Chinese tax spared.

### Decision

The Court noted that subpart BH of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”) provides for double tax agreements between New Zealand and foreign states. Further, that by s BH 1(4) a double tax agreement has effect in relation to income tax despite anything else provided in the 2007 Act and is effectively incorporated into New Zealand domestic law.

The starting point for the Court’s analysis was the CFC regime. This regime was introduced to prevent New Zealand residents from deferring or avoiding New Zealand tax by accumulating income in non-resident companies.

Having discussed how the CFC regime operated, the Court then turned to the New Zealand/China DTA. The Court noted that the purpose of the New Zealand/China DTA is, like all of New Zealand’s DTAs, to produce revenue reciprocity. That is, one country foregoes some of its income tax rights over source or residence taxation in return for the other country foregoing some of the same rights. The common economic purpose being to ensure that income is taxed only once.

The appeal centred on the proper construction of art 23 of the New Zealand/China DTA. The Commissioner’s case was that the plain meaning and purpose of art 23 is to provide relief from juridical double taxation alone. Ms Lin’s counsel argued by reference to various provisions of the OECD Model and its updated Commentaries that art 23 is directed to relieving against both juridical and economic double taxation.

The Court considered that the issue was best addressed by construing the text of art 23 as a sequential and related whole within its settled context.

The Court agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that art 23(1) had the plain purpose of eliminating juridical double taxation in China by limiting the entitlement of a resident of that country to a credit on tax actually paid in New Zealand on income derived here. The Court noted that while there are linguistic differences between art 23(1) and its companion provision art 23(2)(a) they held that the necessary inference, in the absence of any contrary intention, is that both relieve against juridical double taxation, allowing only credits for taxes actually paid by a domestic resident in the foreign jurisdiction.

The Court agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that in terms of art 23(2)(a) the “income” of the CFC was not “derived” by Ms Lin in China; and the tax paid or spared to the CFC was not payable, paid by or spared to Ms Lin. The Court found that there was no scope to import a proposition that the “income derived” refers to the deemed or attributed income of the CFC under New Zealand legislation.

The Court disagreed with the High Court’s construction of art 23(3) that, when read in conjunction with art 23(2)(a), the phrase “payable … by a resident of New Zealand” includes tax deemed to have been paid or payable by the New Zealand resident on income or tax deemed to have been earned or paid by the New Zealand resident through the CFC regime. Instead the Court viewed 23(3) as confirming the focus of art 23(2)(a) as being on “tax payable in … China by a resident of New Zealand.”

Ms Lin’s counsel particularly relied on the phrase “in respect of” where it first appears in art 23(2)(a) and stated that it should be construed as requiring a connection between tax paid in China and tax payable in New Zealand. The Court disagreed and said that the phrase “in respect of” is synonymous with “on”. The Court was satisfied that art 23(2)(a) requires the tax to have been paid by a New Zealand resident _on_ income derived by him or her in China, not by a third party CFC.

The Court concluded that art 23(2)(a) relieves solely against juridical double taxation. Ms Lin’s counsel’s argument required the Court to disregard the legal nature of the relationship between Ms Lin and the CFCs. The fact that the ultimate source is income attributed to Ms Lin from the Chinese CFCs does not justify treating the two income streams, earned separately by the CFCs and Ms Lin, as one for revenue purposes, and ignoring the plain foundation of art 23(2)(a) on the source of “the income derived by a resident of New Zealand”.

1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] High-Wealth Individuals Research Project Entity Questionnaire Guide February 2022 Project purpose 1. The high-wealth individuals research project is a statistical research project that seeks to estimate the effective tax rates of high-wealth New Zealanders in relation to their economic income. 1 The project will improve the evidence base regarding how the tax system is currently operating and will inform future tax policy. 2. No-one’s tax liability will be reassessed as part of this project; information provided for the project will not be used for tax compliance or assessment purposes. A final report on the project’s findings will be made public in 2023. This will not identify any individual or entity. This questionnaire 3. You are receiving this questionnaire as you are in the project population. You are required to provide the information in this request as either: • Individual A: this is the person who was previously issued with the notice under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 seeking details about their family; or • The domestic partner of individual A: this is the person identified as the partner of individual A in response to the prior section 17GB notice. 4. As discussed below, partners may provide either a separate or joint response to this questionnaire. 5. This questionnaire asks about the entities (including partnerships and trusts) in which family members hold a substantial interest. We need this information because our calculations of effective tax rates are based on estimates of your family income. The measures of income we are calculating will include the economic income your family earns from ownership of or interests in entities. Economic income is a broader concept than taxable income and includes non-taxable gains such as capital gains. 6. This information is sought under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 17GB allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to collect information she considers relevant to a purpose relating to the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system. Each person who has received a notice is legally required to provide this 1 An effective tax rate is calculated as the amount of tax a person pays divided by a measure of income. 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] information. You may request a tax agent or other representative complete the form on your behalf although you remain ultimately responsible. 7. You are required to provide this information by 5pm on 4 April 2022. 8. You must use reasonable endeavours to provide the requested information. It is acceptable to use reasonable estimates where you are unsure of certain information (such as ownership percentages). S tate “unknown” where you cannot obtain the requested information or leave blank questions that are not applicable. How to complete this questionnaire 9. We ask you to tell us about the entities you are connected to by completing four entity spreadsheets (referred to as Disclosure Statements). This guide tells you how to complete those Disclosure Statements, respectively referred to as: a. The Company Disclosure Statement; b. The Trust Disclosure Statement; c. The Partnership Disclosure Statement; d. The Other Entity Disclosure Statement. 10. You are also required to complete an Index Sheet. This sheet asks you to identify who the form is being completed for (individual A, domestic partner, or joint response). It also asks you to list all the entities being disclosed in the Disclosure Statements and their unique identifier. We may use the unique identifier in future communication with you to protect the security of your information. 11. Instructions for completing the Disclosure Statements (including the unique identifier) and the Index Sheet are described under Detailed Instructions. 12. Key terms are explained in the glossary and are bolded from here where appropriate. The defined terms apply for the Disclosure Statements as well. Scope of entities covered 13. Entities is defined broadly in the questionnaire and includes companies, partnerships and other forms of joint business ownership structures, and trusts. 14. You are only required to disclose entities that meet the scope criteria. The scope criteria for entities other than trusts requires that an asset or income threshold be met and requires a minimum ownership threshold to be met. Trusts are only to be disclosed where they meet an asset threshold. 15. The cumulative value of your interests in entities that fall below the scope criteria will form part of the information required later in the year, but you are not required to disclose them individually here. 16. Where a company is fully consolidated with another for both tax and accounting purposes, you only need to disclose the tax nominated company, the company which reports the 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] consolidated results (if different), and companies that filed a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) disclosure for the relevant period. 17. You are not required to disclose not-for profit entities ( such as charitable trusts or foundations), widely held or listed investment trusts, or unit trusts. You are not required to disclose foreign companies, CFC and FIF interests, but you must report which disclosed companies filed CFC disclosures (if any). 2 18. You are required to disclose all entities that meet the scope criteria as at the reporting date in any of the relevant years. Where required, ownership of the entity is then reported for each relevant year. Where an entity met the scope criteria at a point in the reporting period, but you were not an owner on the reporting date for a relevant year, (i.e., it has been liquidated, was amalgamated or you sold your entire interest), then report 0% as your ownership percentage for years you were not an owner on the reporting date. 19. Each entity should only be disclosed once for each applicable person. How this questionnaire applies to Individual A and their domestic partner 20. This questionnaire asks for information on entities to which your family is connected. Family members’ holdings are sought as the research will use information on the tax paid and income of the family to construct measures of effective tax rates. Using family income is consistent with other similar research that seeks to understand the distribution of wealth or income, such as research based on the Household Economic Survey that is conducted by Stats NZ. Information to be completed by individual A 21. If you are individual A, you are required to complete the Disclosure Statements for yourself and any dependent children. With the exception of the Trust Disclosure Statement, you only need to report interests of dependent children who are qualifying dependent children. These children should have been disclosed by name in response to the prior section 17GB notice. 22. For the Trust Disclosure Statement, you are required to tell us what relationships all dependent children have with disclosed trusts. 23. Where a trust has been disclosed in your Trust Disclosure Statement (disclosed trust), you will need to disclose its ownership of entities meeting the scope criteria in the Company, Partnership and Other Entity Disclosure Statements. 24. The D isclosure Statements need to separately identify individual A’s interest and that of each of : a. the qualifying dependent children (in the case of the Trust Disclosure Statement the dependent children); b. the domestic partner, if completing a joint Disclosure Statement; c. a disclosed trust where it has an interest that must be disclosed. 2 You may still be required to report an interest in a New Zealand entity or a trust relationship which you own or have through a foreign entity if the New Zealand entity or trust meets the scope criteria to be disclosed as an indirect interest. 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 25. You do this by choosing the relevant person from the drop-down menu in Section AA for the Company, Partnership and Other Entity Disclosure Statement, and adding a new column for each person in respect of each entity. This person is referred to as the applicable person. 26. When completing the Trust Disclosure Statement, a trust should be disclosed once (that is, in a single column) for the family, even if more than one family member has a relationship with the trust. Each family member’s interest is then disclosed in Section B by selecting from the drop-down menu. The family members whose relationship is reported in the Trust Disclosure Statement: a. will include the domestic partner, where partners are completing a joint Disclosure Statement; b. not include the domestic partner, where partners are completing separate Disclosure Statements. Domestic partner 27. If you are the domestic partner of individual A, you only need to provide information for yourself (not your dependent children). You may complete your own Disclosure Statements separate to individual A, or you may provide your information jointly in the same Disclosure Statement as individual A. Where you provide your information in a joint Disclosure Statement, you will still need to ensure your interest is identified separately. You will do this by selecting domestic partner from the drop-down menu in Section AA of the Company, Partnership and Other Entity Disclosure Statements. For the Trust Disclosure Statement, your interests are identified in Section B. 28. Where a trust has been disclosed in the Trust Disclosure Statement you are completing (disclosed trust), you will need to disclose its ownership of entities meeting the scope criteria in the Company, Partnership and Other Entity Disclosure Statements. Jointly held interests 29. For interests held jointly by both individual A and their domestic partner, you should each separately disclose your share of the total interest. 30. Where the proportionate interest is not known at the time (e.g., property held in joint tenancy), individual A and the domestic partner should each disclose a 50% interest in the jointly held property. For example, if you jointly hold 60% of the shares in a company, you will each record 30% as your ownership in the company (as well as any separate individually owned interest). 31. Where you had a joint interest with a previous domestic partner that you have separated from, disclose your best estimate of your share of the relationship property. 32. You do not need to identify potential relationship property shares between partners (which might apply in future if the relationship ends). Simply report the property you legally hold in the shares you hold it (if held jointly). 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Indirect Interests 33. You are required to disclose both direct and indirect interests held in entities. 3 An indirect interest is calculated by taking your ownership percentage of entities higher up the ownership chain, multiplied to work out your ownership percentage of the entities further down the chain. For example, if you own 50% of the shares of company A, which owns 50% of the shares of company B, your indirect interest in company B is 25%. How to submit 34. Submit the completed Disclosure Statements through the secure online platform by completing the file upload instructions on page 11. 35. 36. For e ase of subsequent information collections, please retain a copy of the completed Disclosure Statements. Next steps 37. Further information in relation to the financial affairs of these entities may be sought in June 2022, along with other financial information that is necessary to calculate the measures of income the project will use. This information will also be sought under section 17GB. 38. 39. Enquiries regarding the project more generally, or for assistance to upload the file, should be directed to etrproject@ird.govt.nz. 40. Further information on the project can be found at: High-wealth individuals research project (ird.govt.nz) 3 You are not required to disclose indirect interests in a partnership. 4 Don’t include the full stop at the end of the sentence. s18(c)(i) s18(c)(i) 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Detailed instructions Index Sheet 41. In the Index Sheet, select who the Disclosure Statements are being completed for (individual A, domestic partner or joint response). 5 You will also need to provide the name, IRD number and date of birth for the person(s) the Disclosure Statements are being completed for. 42. When you complete the Disclosure Statements (either manually or electronically), please allocate a unique identifier to each separate entity, in the following way: a. use C, if it is a company, P, if it is a partnership, T if it is a trust, and O for other; b. then number from 1 onwards for each entity added. 6 43. The same identifier should be used for all instances of the same entity where the interests of different applicable people are recorded. 44. Prior to submitting the Disclosure Statements, list each entity and its unique identifier in the Index Sheet, grouping by entity type ( select company, partnership, trust, other). Interests in New Zealand companies 45. The following applies for the Company Disclosure Statement. 46. The required information must be reported separately for the interest of each applicable person in each company. For dependent children, only separately disclose interests held by qualifying dependent children. Add a column for each new company, and applicable person per company, by clicking the “add column” button 7 and then selecting the relevant person from the drop-down menu in Section AA. If you are completing the Disclosure Statements manually, please fill-in this information. 47. Section A of the Company Disclosure Statement must be completed for all companies that must be disclosed. Section B and C ask you to list the applicable person’s direct and indirect interest in the company respectively. Companies that must be disclosed 48. A company must be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Statement if it is a New Zealand company, in which an applicable person was an owner (either directly or indirectly) during the reporting period, and the company meets the scope criteria in any relevant year (subject to the consolidation exception below). 49. Consolidation exception: for New Zealand companies that are members of a tax and financial reporting consolidated group for all relevant years, only the following members of the group need to be separately disclosed in the C ompany Disclosure Statement: 5 Click on the cell and the drop-down menu will appear. 6 The first company listed in the Disclosure Statement will be C1, the first trust T1. 7 You may need to click twice to add the column in the Statements or if an add column (or trust) button does not work use your insert column function. 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a. the nominated company for the consolidated group ( as defined by the Income Tax Act 2007); b. the company responsible for reporting consolidated financial information (if different); c. any company which has filed a CFC disclosure for the reporting period. 50. If a New Zealand company that is required to be disclosed is part of a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes, i ndicate in Section A that this company is part of a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes. Note that all New Zealand companies meeting the scope criteria that are part of a financial accounting consolidated group but not part of a tax consolidated group must be separately disclosed and provide the information in the “consolidated groups” part of the Disclosure Statement (as well as the other relevant parts). 51. For New Zealand companies where the applicable person was an owner for only some of the relevant years, choose from the drop-down menu the reason ownership ceased ( select NA if not applicable). If shares were sold, transferred or gifted, select “sold”. Direct and indirect interests 52. Complete Section B when the applicable person held a direct interest in a New Zealand company disclosed in Section A in any relevant year (including where both a direct and indirect interest were held). Only provide the direct interest in Section B. 53. Complete Section C when the applicable person held an indirect interest in a New Zealand company disclosed in Section A in any relevant year (including where both a direct and indirect interest were held). Only provide the indirect interest in Section C. 54. These sections ask for each applicable person’s ownership interest in the company (as a percentage of all ownership interests in the company), calculated as at the reporting date f or each relevant year. 55. When completing Section C, only name the entity(ies) which had the direct shareholding in the company, and in which the applicable person also had a direct or indirect interest. For example, where the applicable person has a chain of companies between themselves and the reported company, you only need to name the company sitting directly above the reported company, not every company in the chain. Where the applicable person has an interest in more than one entity that sits directly above the reported company, list these in Section C, separating each one by using a “;”. 56. Where a disclosed trust is the applicable person, and companies owned by the trust are required to be disclosed: a. report the interest as a direct interest of the trust if owned directly by the trust; b. report the interest as an indirect interest of the trust when it is owned through another entity. 57. Where the applicable person owns an interest in a partnership and the partnership owns shares in a New Zealand company that meets the scope criteria, the interest in the New Zealand company is disclosed as an indirect interest. The indirect ownership percentage is calculated by attributing the applicable person’s partnership share of the partnership’s 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] interests in the company (i.e., if the applicable person has a 50% interest in a partnership that owns 50% of the shares of a New Zealand company, the indirect interest in the New Zealand company is 25%). Foreign companies 58. Indicate in Section D whether the disclosed company filed any CFC disclosures during the reporting period. Other CFC interests are not required to be disclosed at this stage. We will check your tax returns for CFC disclosures over the reporting period. You are not required to disclose FIF interests now, but we may ask for the value of such investments at a later stage. Trusts 59. The following applies for the Trust Disclosure Statement. 60. A trust must be disclosed in the Trust Disclosure Statement if it meets the scope criteria in any relevant year, and if any of the following were a beneficiary, settlor or appointer in any relevant year: a. any family member (subject to paragraph 65); b. a company (including a foreign company), where the sum of the family members’ direct and indirect ownership interests exceeded 50% in any relevant year; c. another disclosed trust. 61. The information in Section A must be provided for all trusts required to be disclosed ( add a trust by clicking “add trust”). Section B (direct interests) must be completed when a family member being reported on in the Trust Disclosure Statement had a relevant relationship. 8 Section C (indirect interests) must be completed when a company described in paragraph 60b, or a disclosed trust (connected entity in the Trust Disclosure Statement) is a beneficiary, settlor or appointer of a trust that meets the scope criteria. 62. Where more than one member of the family has a relationship with the trust, disclose the trust only once but indicate each member of the family who had a relevant interest in Section B. This is done by selecting the appropriate family member from the drop-down menu next to each relationship question. 63. If you are completing the Disclosure Statements manually, write in the family member or members with the relevant relationships with the trusts. These can be: a. Individual A; b. Domestic partner; c. Dependent child or children; d. A combination of the above (list them); e. For Section C, the connected entities. 64. You must include the interests of all dependent children in the Trust Disclosure Statement (not just qualifying dependent children). 8 While a trustee relationship in itself is not sufficient for the trust to be disclosable, if the trust must be disclosed per paragraph 60 then it must be reported if an adult family member were a trustee. 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 65. If the domestic partner chooses to report in a separate Trust Disclosure Statement, they only need to tell us about their relationship with the trusts and are not required to answer questions relating to other family members. In this case the domestic partner’s interest is not included in individual A’s Trust Disclosure Statement. 66. You are not required to disclose interests in a charitable trust, widely held or listed investment trusts, or unit trusts. 67. Section D asks you to indicate if the substantive assets (80% or more of the value of gross assets) of the disclosed trust are residential property, and if yes, the address of that property. Providing this information now means that we may not then require further information on the trust in our next information collection. 68. Entities owned by a disclosed trust, are required to be disclosed as per the requirements in the Company, Partnership or Other Entity Disclosure Statement.

1 INLAND REVENUE’S TECHNICAL ISSUES ESCALATION POLICY AND PROCESS Approved by Peter Mersi (Commissioner of Inland Revenue) on 27/02/2023 2 Table of Contents Summary ................................................................................................................................................. 2 Background ............................................................................................................................................. 5 Consistent decision-making .................................................................................................................... 6 Identifying IR’s existing view ................................................................................................................... 7 Resolving doubt about consistency with IR’s existing view .................................................................... 8 Usual Escalation process ......................................................................................................................... 9 Escalation process in a litigation context .............................................................................................. 12 Variations to usual Escalation process .................................................................................................. 13 Exceptions not requiring escalation ...................................................................................................... 15 Impacts on outputs and potentially on revenue .................................................................................. 18 Subsequent amendments to Escalation Policy and process ................................................................. 18 Su mmary Escalation Policy 1.The Technical Issues Escalation Policy and process is intended to ensure that Inland Revenue (IR) staff apply IR’s view of the Inland Revenue Acts (IR Acts) consistently, while enabling any IR view to be reconsidered if a staff member thinks it is incorrect. 1 It sets out obligations for all IR staff making technical decisions about how the IR Acts apply, but does not create any rights for customers to have issues reconsidered by IR. 2.An IR staff member must not apply an interpretation or position on the application of any of the IR Acts to a customer (including in litigation and settlement) when they are aware that this would be inconsistent with IR’s existing view. 3.The only exceptions that apply relate to litigation (see \[72\]), draft consultation items (see \[96\]), Tax Counsel Office (TCO) adjudications, binding rulings and public statements (see \[100\], \[102\], and \[107\]) , and a current escalated issue (see \[110\]). 4.I R’s existing view may be: 1 The IR Acts are listed in Sch 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 •set out in documents IR has published externally (other than as a draft, withdrawn or superseded view) – for example, public advice and guidance such as Interpretation Statements, Standard Practice Statements, customer-specific documents (eg, Notice of Proposed Adjustment, Private Ruling) and the other documents listed at \[ 27\]; •set out in technical opinions that IR staff have prepared and are only available within IR – for example, in decisions or reports of TCO, or litigation decisions, opinions, operational guidelines or memoranda Legal Services ha s completed; 2 or •evident from an established practice IR applies to customers. Whether an established IR practice exists depends on the extent to which IR staff have seen and applied a practice as such. If there is doubt as to whether an established IR practice exists, the Tax Intelligence Group (TIG) will decide. Escalation process Usual Escalation process 5.The usual Escalation process in a non-litigation context (see \[43\] to \[66\]) is summarised below and in the diagram after \[11 \]. 6.W hen a staff member considers that IR’s existing view on an interpretation or application of any of the IR Acts is legally incorrect, they must bring this to the attention of their Line Manager (or an other person the appropriate Business Group identifies). If their Line Manager (or other appropriate person) agrees that IR’s existing view appears to be legally incorrect, then they must escalate the issue. 7.In the usual Escalation process, the appropriate Business Groups consider the escalated issue, then TIG does so and finally, if necessary, TCO resolves it. Legal Services manages the progress of issues through the Escalation process, as well as the operational response to the final decisions reached. 8.Wh en an issue is escalated, any detrimental effect for customers from delays must be minimised. Staff must give priority to resolving escalated issues and should keep customers appropriately informed of the escalation and progress of the issue. 9.Unt il a final view on the escalation has been reached, and Legal Services has communicated the operational response to staff, a staff member must either follow IR’s existing view or (if time permits) put dealing with the customer’s affairs “on hold” pending the outcome of the escalation. The exception is where the Legal Services Leader and Chief Tax Counsel agree a different approach is appropriate, taking into account the matters referred to at \[110\]. 10.O nce a final view on the escalation has been reached, Legal Services will communicate this view to staff and all IR staff must follow that decision. An exception is where IR’s Technical Governance Committee (TGC) has made a 2 All references to TCO and Legal Services include their predecessor groups, unless the context requires otherwise. 4 decision not to follow that approach. In such circumstances, Legal Services will communicate the approach that staff must follow. 11.W here IR changes its view following an escalation and the new position is less favourable to a customer, generally the change will be applied prospectively only. For more detail on this approach, see “ Internal approach to managing changes or perceived changes of interpretation or practice” (January 2017). Diagram – Summary of usual Escalation process 1. An IR Staff member identifies IR's existing view on an issue. 2. They consider IR's existing view on an issue is incorrect so they bring this to the attention of their Line Manager. 3. Their Line Manager agrees there is genuine doubt about the correctness of IR's existing view. 4. The local Tax Intelligence Group (TIG) representative agrees the issue should be discussed at a TIG meeting. 5. The staff member prepares a brief document for TIG explaining why they think IR's existing view is incorrect. 6. TIG decides there is a reasonable argument that IR's existing view is incorrect and escalates the issue to the Tax Counsel Office (TCO). 7. TCO analyses the issue escalated, consults with relevant IR staff and decides whether IR's existing view is the better view of the law. 8. Legal Services manages the process for resolving any operational and policy issues, and communicating the outcome of the escalation. 5 Variations to usual Escalation process 12.The usual Escalation process varies slightly when: •the timeframes for making a decision require a shorter process (see \[77\] and \[78\]); •IR’s existing view on the issue being escalated is clearly incorrect (see \[79\] and \[80\]); •IR’s information products or channels (eg, IR forms, guides, booklets or the IR website) incorrectly or inconsistently communicate IR’s existing view (see \[81\] and \[82\]); •Legal Services has not previously been involved in the technical correspondence that Customer and Compliance Services (CCS) staff sent to a customer 3 or third party and the correspondence did not rely on previous advice from Legal Services (see \[83\] to \[86\]); •CCS staff are undertaking a binding ruling and they disagree with a previous concluded view by TCO (see \[87\] to \[92\]); or. •TCO’s final decision on an escalated issue is re-escalated (see \[93\] to \[95\]). Escalation process in a litigation context 13.The Escalation process for litigation (including the impact of recent court cases) and settlements is different (see \[67\] to \[76\]). The Legal Services Leader will seek agreement from the Chief Tax Counsel to advance a different argument in court or a different basis for settlement. Background Protect the integrity of the tax system 14.The task of administering the IR Acts involves interpreting the law every day. Because the law must be interpreted, there is always room for more than one opinion about the correct interpretation. I t is possible, and indeed inevitable, that different people within IR may form different views. 15.U nder s 6(1) and (2)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA), all IR officers must use their best endeavours to administer the IR Acts “according to law”. However, s 6 of the TAA imposes other obligations on IR officers, and these are not always easy to balance. 16.I n particular, our over-riding obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system in s 6 also includes having regard to public perceptions of that integrity, the right of persons to have their liabilities determined “fairly” and “impartially”, and their right to have their individual affairs “treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other persons”. 17.B ecause of these obligations, it is important that IR, to the greatest extent possible, does not apply the IR Acts inconsistently between customers. An 3 References to customer in this document include any agent of the customer. 6 inconsistent approach can lead to perceptions that the tax system is not fair and impartial and instead that it can advantage, or disadvantage, some customers relative to others. 18.A nother consideration is that IR officers get the power to undertake their duties by delegation from the Commissioner. It is important that the holder of that office does not knowingly apply different views of the IR Acts (through their delegates) to different customers. Use expertise and experience 19.This need for consistency does not, however, prevent IR staff from using their expertise and experience in seeking to establish the correct view of the IR Acts. Having staff who are willing to question and review IR’s existing view is an important element of ensuring high-quality technical decision-making in IR. That is why it is important that IR has a process for dealing with different technical views. 20.The Escalation Policy a nd Escalation process describe how to bring together and consider different technical views for the benefit of IR and customers generally, and achieve a balance between the various responsibilities under s 6 of the TAA. Purpose of the Escalation Policy and process 21.The Escalation Policy and process help IR to: •maximise certainty for IR staff and customers by establishing a consistent approach to technical decisions; •constructively address and resolve differences of technical views within IR; and •build positive customer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system and so promote voluntary compliance with the IR Acts. Consistent decision-making Preventing inconsistent views 22.A staff member should not apply a view of the IR Acts to a customer’s affairs when they know that doing so would be contrary to IR’s existing view. This includes distinguishing IR’s existing view without adequate justification. 23. An inconsistent view will occur at the point when staff communicate the view to a customer or apply it to a customer’s affairs. 24.T his principle of consistency also applies to prevent policy documents from expressing inconsistent views to customers or the Minister of Revenue. IR/CLO protocol 25.This principle of consistency also applies to arguments put forward in court proceedings. However, the Escalation Policy and process must be applied in light of the Protocol that the Commissioner and the Solicitor-General, Crown Law Office (CLO) have entered into, agreeing on the processes for discharging their respective roles. 7 Identifying IR’s existing view 26.Subject to the exceptions discussed from \[96\] to \[110\], an IR staff member must apply IR’s existing view to a customer’s affairs. Identifying IR’s existing view is discussed below. Document IR has published externally 27.Any view of the IR Acts set out in a document IR has published externally (other than as a draft, withdrawn or superseded view) is IR’s existing view. This includes statements made in: •Public advice and guidance such as Public Rulings, Interpretation Statements, Interpretation Guidelines and Questions We’ve Been Asked; •Standard Practice Statements, Operational Statements and Determinations; •Tax Information Bulletins, forms, booklets, guides and IR’s website; •customer-specific documents such as a Notice of Proposed Adjustment, Notice of Response, Statement of Position, Private or Product Ruling, Determination, Short Process Ruling or Adjudication Report; and •technical correspondence sent to a customer. Technical opinions 28.IR’s existing view may also be set out in technical opinions that IR staff have prepared and are only available within IR. For example, it may appear in decisions or reports of TCO, litigation decisions, or opinions, operational guidelines or memoranda Legal Services has completed. Established practice 29.IR’s existing view may also be evident from an established practice IR applies to customers. Whether an established IR practice exists depends on the extent to which IR staff have seen and applied a practice as such. 30.F or example, if IR staff in multiple locations have applied an approach to multiple customers for a few years, and it is not clear that staff have applied any other approach, then that approach is likely to be IR’s established practice. 31.H owever, if IR staff have applied different approaches to a material number of customers, then there will not be an established IR practice. In this situation, Legal Services will determine IR’s view on the relevant issue. 32.O n occasions it may not be clear whether a practice is an established IR practice. If there is doubt on that matter, IR staff can raise the question with the local representative of TIG. TIG will then determine whether an established IR practice exists that raises the need for escalation. TCO Issues Reports 33.A TCO I ssues Report that expresses a concluded view on the interpretation or application of the IR Acts may also set out IR’s existing view. A concluded view is a view of the IR Acts that TCO expresses a definite position on and is signed off. 8 34.In contrast to a TCO concluded view, a tentative view is either: •a view that a TCO Issues Report states as not having been finally decided; or •an initial view put to the applicant for a binding ruling which was tentative only and to be the subject of further submissions, but the applicant withdrew at that stage. 35.W here two different TCO Issues Reports present two different concluded views, and the team in the later project has referred to and appears to have fully considered the views of the earlier project team, the later TCO Issues Report is IR’s existing view. 36.Where staff have any doubts over what view, if any, is TCO’s concluded view, they can refer their question to the Technical Lead, Integration in TCO to determine. Draft consultation items 37.When a draft consultation item (eg, draft Standard Practice Statement, Interpretation Statement or draft public ruling) is distributed for internal or external consultation and it differs from IR’s existing view, IR staff must continue to apply IR’s existing view and not apply the draft consultation item to customers before IR finalises and publishes the item. Resolving doubt about consistency with IR’s existing view 38.If staff have any doubt about whether an action or interpretation would be inconsistent with IR’s existing view, they should ask themselves: “Could a reasonable person consider that IR is applying the IR Acts inconsistently as between customers and, therefore, acting unreasonably and promoting uncertainty?” 39.If the answer is “yes”, staff should not undertake the action or interpretation. Instead, they should consider escalating the issue for review and decision. 40.S taff should talk to their Line Manager (or another person identified by the appropriate Business Group) about whether escalation is required in a particular case. Staff can also consult with their local TIG representative for advice. 41.If a staff member considers that IR’s existing view on an interpretation or application of any of the IR Acts is legally incorrect, they must bring this to the attention of their Line Manager (or another person the appropriate Business Group identifies). 42.I f their Line Manager (or other appropriate person) agrees that IR’s existing view appears to be legally incorrect, then they must escalate the issue. They must not apply a different view based on their interpretation until the matter has been resolved through the Escalation process. 9 Usual Escalation process 43.Subject to the variations discussed from \[77\] to \[95\], the usual E scalation process in a non-litigation context is discussed below (and summarised in the diagram after \[11\]). T he Escalation Policy and process in a litigation context (including the impact of recent court cases) is discussed from \[67\] to \[76\]. No IR existing view 44.When there is no IR existing view, no escalation is required. The relevant Business Group (eg, Legal Services or TCO) should deal with any d ifferences of view or practice within the Business Group internally, where possible. The view reached will become IR’s existing view on the relevant matter, which staff must then follow unless a different decision is reached through the Escalation process. Contact appropriate person 45.Where an IR staff member disagrees with IR’s existing view on an issue ( as described at \[ 27\] to \[37\] above), they must bring this to the attention of their Line Manager ( or an other person the appropriate Business Group identifies). IR’s existing view correct 46.If the Line Manager (or another person the appropriate Business Group identifies) concludes that IR’s existing view is correct, their decision is final. IR staff must follow that position and the Escalation process is at an end. Genuine doubt about IR’s existing view 47.Where the Line Manager (or another person the appropriate Business Group identifies) thinks there is genuine doubt about IR’s existing view, TIG should first test the matter. This must be done before communicating to the customer (if applicable) the substance of the proposed revised view. However, customers must be appropriately updated about any escalation and its progress (and any related audit). 48.B efore raising an escalation issue at TIG, the staff member should first discuss it with the local TIG representative. I f the representative agrees that it is an issue that TIG should discuss, they wil l refer the issue to the TIG Administration mailbox. Brief email, m emorandum or opinion required 49.The staff member escalating the issue must prepare a brief email, memorandum or opinion that clearly explains the issue they are escalating, provides legal reasons in support of the preferred view and explains why IR’s existing view is incorrect. That email, memorandum or opinion should also briefly refer to any relevant analysis IR has previously undertaken on the issue that the staff member is aware of. TIG consideration 50.The staff member will provide this email, memorandum or opinion to TIG via their local TIG representative. 10 51.TIG may ask the staff member to undertake further work on the email, memorandum or opinion if it sees this as necessary to make its decision on whether escalation is warranted. 52.TIG must then determine whether the escalation raises a reasonable argument that IR’s existing view is incorrect. If it decides the escalation has not raised a reasonable argument, the Escalation process is ended and IR’s existing view stands. However, if it decides the argument is reasonable, then TIG refers the matter to TCO. Legal Services manages Escalation process 53.Legal Services manages the progression of issues through the Escalation process, including where appropriate to TCO. It will keep the staff member who escalated the issue appropriately informed of progress. 54.L egal Services will provide TCO with a brief written summary of TIG’s thinking on the issue escalated and all relevant documentation. TCO consideration 55.TCO will first seek to understand the issue escalated by contacting relevant IR staff members who it is appropriate to involve given the nature of the issue. This usually includes the referrer and staff members from PaRS. TCO will then analyse the issue escalated and reach a view, following the approach to statutory interpretation set out in the Legislation Act 2019. IR’s existing view will prevail if that is the better view of the law (ie, demonstrably more likely than not to be correct). 56.A part from in exceptional circumstances where the Chief Tax Counsel or the TCO Group Leader responsible for escalations authorises otherwise, before finalising its view TCO will prepare a draft opinion and seek comments on its content and correctness from those appropriate IR staff involved (including the referrer and staff members from PaRS). This internal consultation process will generally include TIG members and will be coordinated by Legal Services. TCO will coordinate consultation with TCO staff, PaRS staff and any external consultation with people outside IR. 57.On ce TCO has reached a final view, it will communicate that view to the referrer and appropriate IR staff involved in the escalation. IR will not adopt TCO’s final view as IR’s existing view until any operational and/or policy issues have been identified and resolved. After that, wider communication to other IR staff will occur. Legal Services manages t he process for resolving any operational and policy issues, and communicating the outcome to stakeholders, and TGC oversees that process. 58.U ntil a final view on the issue escalated has been reached and Legal Services has formally communicated IR’s approach to staff, staff must either follow IR’s existing view or (if time permits) put dealing with the customer’s affairs “on hold” pending the outcome of the escalation. 11 Interaction with customers during Escalation process 59.When an issue is referred to TIG for consideration and/or to TCO for resolution, staff must minimise any detrimental effect on customers from IR’s processes. They must give priority to the issue and keep affected customers appropriately informed of the escalation and progress of the issue. 60.T hese customers should receive an update on progress at least every two months or at intervals staff agree with them. The appropriate CCS staff member will provide these updates, in consultation with a Technical Lead, Legal Services responsible for escalations. Op erational response to TCO’s final decision Legal Services manages operational response 61.Legal Services will manage IR’s operational response to TCO’s final decision on an escalated issue. This role includes coordinating a process for identifying and resolving any issues that arise, and developing any interim position required. It also includes liaising with PaRS on any policy response. Referral to TGC 62.When TCO’s final decision is likely to give rise to significant operational, legislative, system or other issues, a Technical Lead, Legal Services responsible for escalations or the TCO Group Leader responsible for escalations may refer the matter to TGC to decide what IR will do. 63.On e decision TGC could make is that IR will not implement TCO’s final decision in the short to medium term. It might reach this conclusion, for example, where the TCO final decision: •is inconsistent with the clear policy intent and PaRS intends to recommend that the government makes a legislative change; or •raises significant issues for IR’s computer systems that need to be addressed. Communication to staff and stakeholders 64.Once TCO has reached a final decision and IR’s approach has been determined (taking into account any TGC decisions), Legal Services will communicate the decision on IR’s approach to all IR staff, who must all follow it. 65.Legal Services will also communicate the outcome to any stakeholders. Generally prospective application to customers 66.As “Internal approach to managing changes or perceived changes of interpretation or practice” describes in more detail, where IR’s existing view changes following an escalation and the new view is less favourable to customers, generally the new view will be applied prospectively only. 12 Escalation process in a litigation context Impact of recent court cases Case Impact Statement or memorandum 67.In some situations, a recently decided court case or Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decision may cast doubt on the correctness of IR’s existing view. In most cases, staff will receive a Case Impact Statement that sets out IR’s view following any such court case or TRA decision. Alternatively, the Legal Services Leader or TCO may send staff a memorandum setting out IR’s view. 68.I f there is no Case Impact Statement or memorandum for such a court case or TRA decision, IR staff may not adopt an interpretation based on their own view that the court case or TRA decision establishes that IR’s existing view is incorrect. Escalation – court or TRA decision 69.If a staff member thinks that, following a court or TRA decision, IR’s existing view on an issue (including as set out in a Case Impact Statement or memorandum as noted above) is incorrect, then they can escalate that issue by following the usual Escalation process. In these circumstances, staff should consult Legal Services as part of the escalation referral process. Lit igation and settlements 70.The litigation process is subject to the Escalation Policy. Legal Services must: •implement the TCO adjudication decision in the arguments presented in court; and •not put forward any argument that is inconsistent with or significantly differs from any other decision that establishes IR’s existing view. 71.The settlement process is also subject to the Escalation Policy . Legal Services must: •implement the TCO adjudication decision in any settlement made; and •not make settlements on a basis that is inconsistent with or significantly differs from any other decision that establishes IR’s existing view. Escalation – Litigation and settlements 72.If a staff member in Legal Services wants to advance a different argument in court or a different basis for settlement, they do not follow the usual Escalation process. Instead, the Legal Services Leader will seek agreement from the Chief Tax Counsel. In considering whether a different approach is required in the litigation context, the Chief Tax Counsel will consider: •whether IR’s analysis to date, or any other relevant material, indicates that IR’s existing view is very likely to be incorrect; •CLO’s views on the merits of particular arguments; •how long IR has held the existing view, whether staff have applied it consistently and the extent of the analysis on which it is based, 13 •whether IR’s existing view is inconsistent with the clear policy intent and PaRS intends to recommend that the government makes a legislative change; •the desirability of obtaining a judicial decision on the relevant issues; •any potential difficulties for any customer involved in the litigation, or for other customers, in complying with their obligations, including any increase in customers’ tax liabilities and compliance cost implications; and •any potential impacts on voluntary compliance and on the care, management and integrity of the tax system generally. Normal weighing of litigation risk 73.The intention behind the above requirements on litigation relates to legal principles and arguments. It is not to constrain, in the context of settlements, Legal Services’ normal weighing of litigation risk based mainly on evidentiary matters, witness credibility, new factual information and similar considerations. 74.Further, the requirements are not intended to preclude Legal Services from: •responding to new arguments a disputant raises; or •revising IR’s approach appropriately where facts are established that are materially different from those on which previous IR arguments were based. 75.T his is provided that IR’s arguments and the approach IR then adopts are not inherently inconsistent with the applicable reasoning in the relevant adjudication, or any other decision establishing IR’s existing view. CLO wishing to diverge from IR’s existing view 76.On some occasions in a particular dispute in litigation, CLO or instructed counsel may wish to diverge from IR’s existing view in the arguments to be presented in court. In such situations, Legal Services will promptly advise TCO, and the Chief Tax Counsel will liaise with Legal Services and CLO to resolve any differences under the IR/CLO protocol. Variations to usual Escalation process Variation – f ast-track escalation to TCO 77.In exceptional circumstances, an escalation may be referred to TCO without TIG considering it first. This could occur if the timeframes within which a decision must be made require a shorter process. 78.Ho wever, this modification to the process can only occur when the TCO Group Leader responsible for escalations and a Technical Lead, Legal Services responsible for escalations agree to such a change. In these circumstances, Legal Services will ensure that TIG members are advised of the nature of the issue escalated once the issue has been referred to TCO. 14 Variation – correcting clear errors in IR’s existing view 79.Another variation to the usual Escalation process is when IR’s existing view on the issue being escalated is clearly incorrect. This is on the basis that no reasonable argument supports IR’s existing view and the correct view is clear from the relevant legislation. 80.I n these circumstances, a Technical Lead, Legal Services responsible for escalations will: •decide the matter in consultation with TIG and the Domain Lead, Legal Services; •arrange any necessary communication of this decision to IR staff; and •advise the TCO Group Leader responsible for escalations. Variation – correcting errors in communications of IR’s existing view 81.A variation to the usual Escalation process is permitted where any of IR’s information products or channels incorrectly communicate IR’s existing view. Examples of products or channels that may contain such errors are IR forms, guides and b ooklets or the IR website. 82.I n such circumstances, a Technical Lead, Legal Services responsible for escalations will arrange for those products or channels to be amended. Where necessary, the Domain Lead, Legal Services and the TCO Group Leader responsible for escalations will be advised of the correction. Variation – CCS technical correspondence not involving Legal Services 83.A further variation to the usual Escalation process relates to technical correspondence CCS staff send to a customer or third party. Specifically, it applies to interpretations in that technical correspondence when: •there was no IR existing view; •Legal Services was not involved in preparing that correspondence; and •the correspondence did not rely on previous advice from Legal Services. 84.I n these circumstances, if a staff member wishes to deviate from the interpretation or position set out in that correspondence, they must raise this with a Technical Lead, Legal Services responsible for escalations rather than with TIG. 85.L egal Services will then determine IR’s view on the relevant issue. Legal Services will communicate the view it reaches to appropriate staff, and all IR staff must apply that view. 86.I f a staff member disagrees with the view Legal Services has reached, then they may escalate the matter by following the usual Escalation process. Variation – CCS undertaking binding rulings 87.When CCS staff are undertaking a binding ruling (including a short process ruling) and they disagree with IR’s existing view, then a shorter version of the Escalation process will apply. In these cases, with the agreement of a Technical Lead, Legal 15 Services responsible for escalations, the relevant issue will be escalated directly to TCO for resolution. 88.CCS s taff are not required to escalate in this context when they are simply considering their view and exploring issues or arguments with the applicants and their agents. 89.H owever, when CCS staff have formed a view that they would (in the absence of the Escalation process) put forward to the applicant, escalation will be required before they communicate that view to the applicant. CCS and TCO may also have had informal discussions on the issues before that stage. 90.W hen an issue is escalated regarding a binding ruling application, the applicant should be advised that this is occurring and then be kept aware of progress. If a final decision on the ruling application must be made before TCO can finalise its conclusion, then CCS staff must follow IR’s existing view. 91.I f, after an issue has been concluded as above, and the subsequent escalation outcome TCO reaches is that the conclusion reached in the binding ruling was incorrect, then the ruling will stand, but the escalation view will become the new IR existing view. 92.Th e applicant for a binding ruling will not be charged for the work TCO undertook in considering escalated issues. I t is fair and reasonable to waive charging for this time under reg 6 of the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 because this work relates to wider issues involving the Escalation process rather than simply considering the applicant’s ruling application. Va riation – Re-e scalating TCO’s final decision on an escalated issue 93.If a staff member thinks that TCO’s final decision on an escalated issue is incorrect, then TIG may agree to have that decision reconsidered through the Escalation process. 94.T CO’s final decision on an escalated issue can only be re-escalated when TIG is satisfied that: •a material argument exists that TCO did not consider; and/or •there is a demonstrable, material error in TCO’s reasoning. 95.I f TCO’s earlier decision on an escalation is found to be incorrect, then Legal Services will communicate the appropriate information to the relevant staff. Ex ceptions not requiring escalation Exception – applying draft consultation item before finalised 96.It is only in exceptional cases, which the Legal Services Leader and Chief Tax Counsel determine, that IR will adopt a draft consultation item as IR’s existing view before it is finalised. In determining whether to apply the view in the draft consultation item before it is finalised, the Legal Services Leader and Chief Tax Counsel w ill consider: 16 •whether the analysis already undertaken, or any other relevant material, indicates that IR’s existing view is very likely to be incorrect; •how long IR has held the existing view, whether staff have applied it consistently and the extent of the analysis on which it is based; •whether IR’s existing view is inconsistent with the clear policy intent and Policy and Regulatory Stewardship (PaRS) intends to recommend that the government makes a legislative change; •any potential difficulties for customers in complying with their obligations, including any increase in customers’ tax liabilities and compliance cost implications; and •any potential impacts on voluntary compliance and the care, management and integrity of the tax system generally. 97.W hen IR adopts a draft consultation item as IR’s existing view before it is finalised, staff will receive instructions withdrawing an existing Ruling or Statement and/or specific instructions to apply the draft consultation item to customers. 98.Co nsideration will also be given to what communication is required with customers who are dealing with IR on the issue and with customers more generally. 99.A s “ Internal approach to managing changes or perceived changes of interpretation or practice” describes in more detail, where IR’s existing view changes and the new view is less favourable to a customer, generally IR will apply the new view prospectively only. Ex ception – TCO may depart from IR’s existing view 100.A key aspect of TCO’s adjudication function is to provide a fresh and impartial review of the technical decisions of other IR Business Groups that customers are disputing. Therefore, to fulfil this function, TCO must be able to make adjudication decisions that differ from IR’s existing view, including views of TCO. 101 .This means that an adjudication decision could potentially be inconsistent with a previous escalation decision (otherwise TCO is not taking a fresh view). However, the Chief Tax Counsel must approve any departure from a previous escalation decision. 102 .Similarly, in some instances, TCO may prepare a binding ruling or public statement that takes a substantively different view from IR’s existing view. Again, however, this can only occur with the approval of the Chief Tax Counsel. 103 .If TCO takes any view departing from IR’s existing view, then it will advise Legal Services who will be responsible for operationalising the new IR view. Addressing inconsistency 104.The Chief Tax Counsel will decide how to address the inconsistency that arises if an adjudication, bi nding ruling or public statement TCO has prepared takes a different view from IR’s existing view. 17 105.Addressing the inconsistency may involve a subsequent escalation of the relevant issues to determine IR’s view. Depending on the outcome of that process, it may also require the subsequent modification or withdrawal of a public statement. If escalation is required, the relevant issues will be sent immediately to TCO for a decision (without first involving TIG). Legal Services will consider whether an interim position is appropriate. 106 .However, the Chief Tax Counsel may decide that their own level of involvement in the issue means it is not necessary to escalate the issue. When that is the case, the Chief Tax Counsel may decide that the view reached in the adjudication, binding ruling or public statement is correct. In such circumstances, any modification or withdrawal of a public statement will occur without escalation. Exception – not following an adjudication, binding ruling or public statement TCO has prepared 107.It is not necessary to follow a particular decision in an adjudication, binding ruling or public statement TCO has prepared for other customers if the Legal Services Leader and Chief Tax Counsel approve making it an exception on the basis that the matter is being considered as a priority at a national level. 108 .In these circumstances, Legal Services will advise appropriate staff in a memorandum signed off by the Legal Services Leader that IR will adopt a specified contrary or modified approach (which the Legal Services Leader will have determined in consultation with the Chief Tax Counsel) pending further consideration of the matter at a national level. In such a case, all IR staff must follow the approach outlined in that memorandum until further advised. 109 .In determining whether IR staff should or should not follow a particular decision in a TCO adjudication, binding ruling or public statement, the Legal Services Leader and the Chief Tax Counsel will consider: •whether the analysis already undertaken, or any other relevant material, indicates that the TCO decision is very likely to be incorrect; •how long IR has held, or expressed, the existing view and the extent of the analysis on which it is based; •whether the TCO decision is inconsistent with the clear policy intent and PaRS intends to recommend that the government makes a legislative change; •any potential difficulties for customers in complying with their obligations, including any increase in customers’ tax liabilities and compliance cost implications; and •any potential impacts on voluntary compliance and on the care, management and integrity of the tax system generally. Exception – before Escalation process completed 110.The only exception to the requirement in \[58\] is where the Legal Services Leader and Chief Tax Counsel agree staff can apply a different approach to IR’s existing view before the Escalation process is complete in the particular circumstances. In determining whether to apply a different approach, the Legal Services Leader and Chief Tax Counsel will consider: 18 •whether the analysis already undertaken during the Escalation process, or any other relevant material, indicates that IR’s existing view is very likely to be incorrect; •how long IR has held the existing view, whether staff have applied it consistently and the extent of the analysis on which it is based; •whether IR’s existing view is inconsistent with the clear policy intent and PaRS intends to recommend that the government makes a legislative change; •any potential difficulties for customers in complying with their obligations, including any increase in customers’ tax liabilities and compliance cost implications; and •any potential impacts on voluntary compliance and on the care, management and integrity of the tax system generally. Impacts on outputs and potentially on revenue Pe rformance standards 111.Clearly, the Escalation process involves some delays as issues are being escalated. While every effort will be made to minimise delays, the delays may well have impacts on performance standards for individual cases. This could occur if staff decide to put dealing with a customer’s affairs “on hold” pending the outcome of the escalation, rather than applying IR’s existing view. Time bar 112.Further, in some instances the application of the time bar date may make it impossible to make an assessment for customers while an issue is being resolved through the Escalation process. IR is willing to accept this as a possible consequence in the interests of ensuring its decisions are, as far as possible, consistent and legally correct. 113 .The Escalation process must be followed, even though this may occasionally result in the loss of some tax revenue. Staff must not issue an assessment contrary to this process merely because the time bar is approaching. Subsequent amendments to Escalation Policy and process 114.Any proposed amendments to this statement of administrative policy and process must first be formally referred to and approved by TGC, and then approved in writing by the Commissioner. Ap proved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on the 27 th day of February 2023. Pe ter Mersi

Ngā ture Employee share scheme rules
====================================

An employee share scheme (ESS) is an arrangement for issuing or transferring shares in a company or a group company to a past, present or future employee or shareholder-employee.

The arrangement must be connected to the person's employment or service. The ESS definition also includes transfers to an associate of the employee or shareholder-employee.

A director who receives a schedular payment is also an employee for tax purposes and may come under the ESS rules.

Types of employee share schemes
-------------------------------

There are lots of different types of employee share schemes, for example:

*   Long-term incentive plans (LTIP)
*   Performance share rights plans
*   Employee share option plans (ESOP)
*   Restricted stock units (RSU)
*   Performance stock units (PSU).

An 'exempt ESS' is not an ESS. It is a scheme that is offered to all, or almost all, of a business’ employees. Both the benefit of the scheme and the amount an employee invests to get that benefit are limited. Different tax rules apply to an exempt ESS.

[Exempt ESS](/employing-staff/deductions-from-other-payments/exempt-employee-share-schemes)

Income and calculating value
----------------------------

An ESS benefit is treated as income for the employee or shareholder-employee, even if the benefit is provided to an associate.

The value of an ESS benefit is calculated on the **share scheme taxing date**. This is the earlier of the following dates:

*   The date the employee (or associate) beneficially holds the shares and there are no [conditions or protections](/api/glossary/item?id={02C3CBCB-DB79-4CA3-8791-1F641274EA01})
     under the scheme that would defer the taxing date.
*   The date the shares or share rights are cancelled or transferred to a non-associated person.

The amount of income is broadly equal to the market value of the shares on the share scheme taxing date less any amount paid for the rights or shares. However, if rights or shares are cancelled or transferred to a non-associated person, it is the amount received for the cancellation or transfer, less any amount paid for the rights or shares.

### When an ESS benefit is treated as received

An ESS benefit is treated as received by the employee or shareholder-employee on the ESS deferral date. The **ESS deferral date** is 20 days after the share scheme taxing date. However, for former employees who receive an ESS benefit in shares with no tax withheld, the benefit is received on the share scheme taxing date.

### Paying tax on an ESS benefit

In some situations an employer must withhold tax from an ESS benefit. In other situations the employer can choose whether to withhold tax. If no tax is withheld, the employee must pay tax through the end of year tax return process (and provisional tax if it applies).

[Deducting tax from employee share scheme benefits](/employing-staff/deductions-from-other-payments/employee-share-schemes/deducting-tax-on-ess-benefits)

Deductions
----------

An employer can usually claim a deduction if they're providing ESS benefits. This deduction generally matches the income to employees in timing and quantity. No other deductions are allowed for providing an ESS benefit, except for costs of establishing or managing a share scheme such as interest costs, or certain costs on other employment income like bonuses.

Reporting
---------

An employer must include information about an ESS benefit provided to an employee in their employment information.

[Student Loan Scheme Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-act-2011 "Student Loan Scheme Act 2011")

Establishment of a student loan
===============================

2011 legislation allows information to be transferred between StudyLink and IR to establish a student loan account and allow a consolidated view of loan balances.

_**Sections 9-20, 222 and part of schedule 8**_

Changes have been made to allow information to be transferred between StudyLink and Inland Revenue to enable the establishment of a loan account. The Act also provides for a near real-time transfer of loan advances from StudyLink to Inland Revenue to allow Inland Revenue to provide borrowers with a consolidated view of their loan balance.

### **Background**

Previously, borrowers had to contact two agencies to determine the total amount of student loan they owed as loan advances were held by StudyLink for a year before being transferring to Inland Revenue for collection. This increased the compliance costs involved for borrowers.

The Act introduces changes which provide for a near real-time transfer of loan advances from StudyLink to Inland Revenue. This ensures borrowers will only need to contact one agency to view their consolidated loan balance.

### **Key features**

*   When a borrower applies for a loan, information will be transferred from StudyLink to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will use this information to check it against the information it holds on the borrower and set up the borrower's account.
*   When a loan is approved, a borrower's contact details will be transferred to Inland Revenue. If the borrower's details change, StudyLink will advise Inland Revenue of the updated details.
*   When StudyLink provides a loan advance to a borrower, the loan advance will be transferred to Inland Revenue in a near real-time basis.
*   The loan establishment fee charged to a borrower by StudyLink has been increased from $50 to $60.
*   Inland Revenue will issue statements to borrowers outlining loan advances, instead of StudyLink.
*   Borrowers will continue to have at least 31 days from the date of the statement to object to the loan advances outlined in the statement.
*   Student loans will be removed from the requirement to comply with the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003, while changes have been made to the Student Loan Scheme Act to incorporate similar rights that borrowers would have had under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act.

### **Application dates**

The following changes apply from 1 January 2012:

*   the transfer of information from StudyLink to the Commissioner on establishment of the loan;
*   the transfer of the loan advances to Inland Revenue on a near real-time basis; and
*   the requirement for the Commissioner to notify borrowers of loan advances and the consolidated loan balance.

The disclosure requirements of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act apply from 30 August 2011, being the day after the date of Royal assent.

All other changes apply from 1 April 2012.

### **Detailed analysis**

_**Preparation for loan being transferred**_

Information on a borrower will be transferred from StudyLink to Inland Revenue on a near real-time basis when a borrower applies for a loan.

StudyLink will transfer information on an applicant to Inland Revenue to confirm that the information provided by borrowers is consistent with the information held by Inland Revenue. This will also allow an account to be set up for the borrower with Inland Revenue and facilitate the transfer of loan advances. The information transferred will be the applicant's name, IRD number and date of birth. If the information transferred from StudyLink to Inland Revenue differs from information held by Inland Revenue, the Commissioner must advise the Loan Manager that the information differs. The Loan Manager will then go back to the borrower to acquire the correct information.

Once the borrower has entered into the loan contract, the Loan Manager will transfer further details on a borrower to Inland Revenue, such as when the loan entitlement letter advising the borrower of their loan was issued and the borrower's contact details.

**_Real-time transfer of information_**

Changes were made to the bill at the Select Committee stage to provide for the near real-time transfer of loan advances from StudyLink to Inland Revenue. This will enable borrowers to have a consolidated view of their loan and allow them to access this at any time and from anywhere in the world. Borrowers will be able to manage their loan in an electronic environment.

Loan advances will appear on statements provided by Inland Revenue, rather than StudyLink, and borrowers will have a period of time (at least 31 days) from the date of this statement to object to a loan advance. Statements will be issued by Inland Revenue at least twice a year. Objections by borrowers to loan advances outlined in the statement will continue to be dealt with by StudyLink.

**_Student loan establishment fee_**

The current administration fee imposed by StudyLink when the loan is established will be incorporated into legislation and referred to as an "establishment fee". The current fee of $50 will be increased to $60.

**_Disclosure requirements and CCCFA implications_**

As student loan contracts came within the definition of a "credit contract" under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA), an amendment was made to remove the requirement for the Student Loan Scheme to comply with the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act.

The CCCFA was enacted to protect consumers who enter into contracts when there are generally no other legislative protections available. Student loan borrowers have protection under the Student Loan Scheme Act. There are also major differences between the features of student loans and other credit contracts, for example, the provision of hardship criteria and the income-contingent nature of repayment obligations and other protections available to borrowers which reduce the need to extend the requirements of the CCCFA to student loans. To strengthen protections provided under the student loan scheme, a number of amendments were made to the bill at the Select Committee stage to incorporate similar rights that a borrower would have under the CCCFA. These changes are as follows:

*   The right to receive a copy of the loan contract within six working days of signing. This change reflects StudyLink's current administrative practice.
*   The right to cancel the contract within seven working days of the date of the loan entitlement letter.
*   The right to disclosure of information in the loan contract, namely, the annual repayment threshold, base interest rate, repayment percentage, student loan establishment and administration fees, the right to cancel the contract within seven days and the right to object to loan advances.
*   The requirement for the Commissioner to notify the borrower of loan advances made by StudyLink to the borrower, the date and amount of any interest or penalty imposed, and the date and amount of any establishment or administrative fees charged.
*   The requirement for the Commissioner to notify the borrower of unilateral changes to the contract or statute that increase the borrower's obligations if the borrower's updated contact details are known.

**_Definition of "unpaid amount"_**

For the 2012-13 tax year, the current period-based approach to dealing with unpaid amounts will be retained. The period-based approach looks at the unpaid amounts for different periods and different obligations separately. This treatment reflects a tax approach whereby penalties and interest are applied separately to tax types and to tax periods. The provision has been retained until April 2013 to give Inland Revenue time to implement changes as detailed below.

**_Changes from 1 April 2013_**

The period-based approach to unpaid amounts is not in keeping with a loan approach whereby an aggregate approach to unpaid amounts is more appropriate. Therefore, from 1 April 2013, the definition of "unpaid amount" will be replaced with a new definition which reflects a "whole of loan" approach to outstanding amounts. "Unpaid amounts" will therefore be defined as the aggregate amount of the borrower's obligations as has not been paid by the due date.

Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968
===============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 from PIB vol 46 Aug 1968.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 46, August 1968

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

The Minister of Finance, the Hon RD Muldoon, introduced the Estate and Gift Duties Bill to the House on 4 July 1968.

The Statutes Revision Committee is now examining the Bill.

In general it follows the principles of existing legislation but has been arranged in a more logical order and written in simpler language. It is intended to apply from 1 January 1969.

The main changes proposed by the Bill are -

#### ESTATE DUTY

#### Dutiable Estate

Foreign realty is no longer excluded from the dutiable estate, but credit for overseas duty paid on the asset will be allowed up to the amount of the New Zealand duty.

A new method is provided for treating certain types of life insurance policies on deceased's life, where he disposed of the policy within three years of death.

#### Valuations

Partnership interests and certain debts owing to deceased by relatives and controlled companies are to be valued in the manner set out in the Bill.

A new table for calculating the value of widowhood interests has been added to the Schedules of the Bill.

#### Payment

The time in which to pay estate duty without interest has been extended from four months to six months from date of death. The rate of interest is 5%.

Provision is made for relief in cases of hardship.

#### Allowances

The order of the various allowances has been fixed. At present, the order in which allowances are granted can make a difference in the overall estate duty payable.

Allowances for estate duty paid outside New Zealand have been extended to cover all overseas duty. At present relief is given only from duty imposed by the country in which the assets are domiciled.

The quick succession allowance has been extended and simplified by basing the allowance on the total value of successions rather than individual assets.

A new method for making allowance for gift duty paid or payable on gifts included in the dutiable estate is set out in the Bill.

#### Notices to the Commissioner

Notice to the Commissioner of payments made to the estate of a deceased person without administration, does not have to be made unless the amount is $500 or more. At present, notice of all payments must be given.

#### GIFT DUTY

#### Dutiable Girls

Gifts of foreign realty are to be liable to gift duty if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand.

Gifts made by a controlled company axe to be treated in a special manner.

The time in which to file a gift statement has been extended from one month to three months from date of gift.

#### Payment

The penalty on unpaid gift duty is reduced from 10% to 5%. It accrues six months from the date of gift. Interest on unpaid gift duty has also been introduced, applying three months from the date of gift at 5%.

A right of objection to the Commissioner against an assessment of either estate or gift duty has been provided. At present, the only right of objection is direct to a Court.

#### Change In Rates Of Gift Duty- Budget Proposals

The Minister of Finance announced changes in the rates of gift duty payable on gifts made on or after 19 July 1968 -

*   The amount which can be gifted without duty in any 12-month period has been increased from $2,000 to $4,000.
*   A new scale of rates has been introduced. The scale is set out below.
*   Where gifts made before 19 July 1968 aggregate with gifts made after the change gift duty on the earlier gifts will not be increased unless the value of the aggregated gift is more than $4,000.

Gift statements must still be filed where the value of gifts made in any 12-month period is more than $2,000.

#### Scale Of Rates For Gifts Made On Or After 19 July 1968

| Value of Gift (Together with value of all Aggregated Gifts) |     | Rate  <br>NOTE - 'Excess' means excess of the value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not exceeding $4,000 |     | Nil |
| Exceeding | Not Exceeding |     |
| $4,000 | $6,000 | 9% of excess over $4,000 |
| $6,000 | $8,000 | $180 + 11% of excess over $6,000 |
| $8,000 | $10,000 | $400 + 13% of excess over $8,000 |
| $10,000 | $12,000 | $ 660 + 15% of excess over $10,000 |
| $12,000 | $14,000 | $ 960 + 17% of excess over $12,000 |
| $14,000 | $16,000 | $1,300 + 19% of excess over $14,000 |
| $16,000 | $18,000 | $1,680 + 21% of excess over $16,000 |
| $18,000 | $20,000 | $2,100 + 23% of excess over $18,000 |
| $20,000 | $22,000 | $2,560 + 25% of excess over $20,000 |
| $22,000 | $24,000 | $3,060 + 27% of excess over $22,000 |
| $24,000 | $28,000 | $3,600 + 23% of excess over $24,000 |
| $28,000 | $32,000 | $4,520 + 25% of excess over $28,000 |
| $32,000 | $36,000 | $5,520 + 27% of excess over $32,000 |
| $36,000 | $40,000 | $6,600 + 29% of excess over $36,000 |

### Estate duty reduced - Budget proposals explained

### Budget announcement

In the course of his 1964 Budget Statement the Minister of Finance, the Hon HR Lake, announced reductions in estate duty which, it was hoped, would be an incentive to increase production. These reductions are being put into effect immediately and will be validated by legislation during this session of Parliament.

### The date from which the new scale of rates will apply

The new rates of estate duty will apply to the estates of all persons who die on or alter 25 June 1964.

### The Reductions effected by the new scale of rates

Under the new scale of rates the non liability limit has been raised from £2,000 to £4,000. This will mean that estates of a value not exceeding £4,000 will not be liable for any estate duty at all.

In the range of estates between £4,000 and £48,000 the existing rates have been reduced but estates of £48,000 or more will continue to be charged with duty at the rates which were introduced in 1961.

#### Examples of the reductions effected

#### Where estate is left to widow

| Value of estate | Duty under 1961 scale | Duty under new scale | Reduction in duty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| £   | £   | £   | £   |

#### Where estate is left to adult children

| Value of estate | Duty under 1961 scale | Duty under new scale | Reduction in duty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| £   | £   | £   | £   |

Further copies of this table can be obtained on request from the office of any District Commissioner of Stamp Duties. Persons holding the Information Pamphlet issued by the Department in June 1964 on "Estate Duty in New Zealand" should note the changed rates.

Estate And Gift Duties Amendment Act 1983, Supplement 1
=======================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Estate And Gift Duties Amendment Act 1983, Supplement 1 from PIB vol 126 Sep 1984.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 126, September 1984

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1 - Short Title, Commencement, etc.

_Subsection (1)_ provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with, and form part of, the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968.

_Subsection (2)_ provides that the Amendment Act comes into force on 28 July 1983, except in the case of sections 3, 5, 6 and 8 which do not take effect until 1 April 1984.

It is important to check the commencement date when reading any of the amending sections. The commentary which follows will also bring this out.

### Section 2 - Matrimonial Property Definition

This section simply defines "matrimonial property" as having the same definition as that contained in section 2(1) of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. That section defines matrimonial property as having the same meaning as contained in section 8 of that Act, section 8 defining it as consisting of:

1.  The matrimonial home whenever acquired; and
2.  The family chattels whenever acquired; and
3.  All property owned jointly or in common in equal shares by the husband and the wife; and
4.  All property owned immediately before the marriage by either the husband or the wife if the property was acquired in contemplation of his or her marriage to the other and was intended for the common use and benefit of both the husband and the wife; and
5.  Subject to subsections (2) to (6) of section 9 and to section 10 of this Act, all property acquired by either or the wife after the marriage; and
6.  Subject to subsections (3) to (6) of section 9 and to section 10 of this Act, all property acquired after the marriage for the common use and benefit of both the husband and the wife out of property owned by either the husband or the wife or both of them before the marriage or out of the proceeds of any disposition of any property so owned; and
7.  Any income and gains derived from, the proceeds of any disposition of, and any increase in the value of, any property described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this section; and
8.  Any policy of assurance taken out by one spouse on his or her own life or the life of the other spouse, whether for his or her benefit or the benefit of the other spouse (not being a policy that was fully paid up at the time of the marriage and not being a policy to the proceeds of which a third person is beneficially entitled), whether the proceeds are payable on the death of the assured or on the occurrence of a specified event or otherwise; and
9.  Any policy of insurance in respect of any property described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this section; and
10.  Any pension, benefit or right to which either the husband or the wife is entitled or may become entitled under any superannuation scheme if the entitlement is derived, wholly or in part, from contributions made to the scheme after the marriage or from employment or office held since the marriage; and
11.  All other property that the spouses have agreed, pursuant to section 21 of this Act, shall be matrimonial property; and
12.  Any other property that is matrimonial property by virtue of any other provisions of this Act or by virtue of any other Act."

Paragraph (j) is particularly important because separate property of the couple transferred in accordance with an agreement under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 is _not_ exempt from gift duty _unless_ it is declared to be matrimonial property in the agreement, or has been so declared in an earlier agreement.

### Section 3 - New Schedule of Rates of Estate Duty

This section replaces the First Schedule to the principal Act and increases the dutiable estate exemption from $350,000 (applying to the estates of persons dying on or after 1 April 1983) to $450,000 in respect of the estates of persons dying on or after 1 April 1984.

The rate of estate duty, at 40 percent of the excess over the exemption limit, is unchanged.

The new First Schedule, which came into force on 1 April 1984, reads:

**Scales of Rates of Estate Duty**

| Final Balance of Estate | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| **Note:** "Excess" means excess of the final balance in complete dollars. |     |
| Not exceeding $450,00 | Nil |
| Exceeding $450,000 | 40 percent of excess over $450,000 |

### Section 4 - Matrimonial Property Act 1963 Court Orders

This section provides an exemption from estate duty for property comprised in an order of the Court made in terms of section 5 of the Matrimonial Property Act _1963_.

Section 5 of the Matrimonial Property Act _1976_prohibits the making of applications for the transfer of property after the death of a spouse. However, the latter part of that section, together with section 57(4), reactivates the rights of the surviving spouse to make such applications after death under the Matrimonial Property Act 1963 as if the 1976 Act had never been passed.

In a 1981 case, _Preest v CIR_, it was held that proceedings initiated after death pursuant to the 1963 Act did not affect the incidence of estate duty and that consequently the property comprised in the Court order formed part of the dutiable estate.

This amendment effectively means that the dicta in the _Preest_case will not apply to Court orders, being Court orders made in terms of section 5 of the 1963 Act, made on or after 28 July 1983. Any property comprised in Court orders made in such cases will not form part of the deceased's dutiable estate.

### Section 5 - New Schedule of Rates of Gift Duty

This section introduces a new scale of gift values to which the existing gift duty rates of zero to 25 percent will apply in respect of all dutiable gifts made on or after 1 April 1984. The new gift duty rate scale, which is contained in the Second Schedule of the Amendment Act, is:

**Scale of Rates of Gift Duty**

| Value of Item "b" in Section 62 |     | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _**Note:** "Excess" means excess of the value in complete dollars._ |     |     |
| Not exceeding $27,000 |     | Nil |
| Exceeding | Not Exceeding |     |
| $27,000 | $36,000 | 5 percent on excess over $27,000 |
| $36,000 | $54,000 | $450 plus 10 percent of excess over $36,000 |
| $54,000 | $72,000 | $2,250 plus 20 percent of excess over $54,000 |
| Exceeding $72,000 |     | $5,850 plus 25 percent of excess over $72,000 |

The new scale incorporates the increase from $15,000 to $27,000 in the no-liability level and widens the bands to which the 5 percent, 10 percent and 20 percent rates apply.

In cases where gifts made before 1 April 1984 are aggregated (within the 12 months aggregation period) with gifts made on or after that date, the duty on the gifts made prior to 1 April 1984 will not change unless the aggregate figure exceeds $27,000. Legislation providing the rules for aggregation before and after 1 April is contained in the proviso to subsection (3).

The following are examples of the basis of aggregation.

1.  Liable gift made before scale change aggregates with gift made after scale change and total gifts more than $27,000.

**Example 1:**

### Section 6 - Increase in Exemption for Small Gifts

This section increases the section 71 exemption for small gifts made as part of the normal expenditure of the donor, from $1,000 to $2,000.

As this exemption relates to the aggregation for gift duty purposes of gifts made to each donee in a calendar year and as the increase is to apply to all gifts made on or after 1 April 1984, this means for the calendar year ended 31 December 1984 and future years the exemption level will be $2,000.

### Section 7 - Matrimonial Property Dispositions

Section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 enables a husband and wife to mutually determine the ownership of their property at any given time, either for the purposes of contracting out of the Act or for settling any differences that have arisen between them as to the ownership of their property. The section enables them to enter into a written agreement to share their property in whatever proportions they wish, provided it is done in a strict legal form.

As an alternative to section 21, section 25 enables a couple to ask the Court to determine the proportions in which their property should be divided. In effect, the Court is asked to determine the respective rights in the property.

This section sets out the gift duty position which will apply in respect of orders of the Court made under section 25, and voluntary agreements entered into under section 21 of Matrimonial Property Act 1976.

_Subsection (1)_ defines, for the purposes of the new section 75A, the expressions:

*   "Agreement", as meaning an agreement entered into under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976.
*   "Disposition of matrimonial property", as meaning a disposition of matrimonial property (as defined in section 2(1) of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976) made by or pursuant to a section 21 agreement.

_Subsection (2)_ provides that where any disposition of matrimonial property:

*   is made by and in accordance with that agreement, and
*   does not result in the person to whom the disposition is made having legal and equitable interests to more than half the total matrimonial property of the couple,

that disposition will not be a gift.

_For example,_ assume that before entering into an agreement under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, property was held as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Husband | \- Farm | $300,000 |     | Wife | \- Bank A/C | $15,000 |     |
|     | \- Shares | $20,000 |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | \- Bank A/C | $10,000 |     |     |     |     |     |
| Section 21 Agreement declares the farm and shares to be matrimonial property held in equal proportions. Transfers are executed and the end result is: |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Husband | \- Bank A/C | $10,000 | Sep. | Wife | \- Bank A/C | $15,000 | Sep. |
|     | \- 1/2 Farm | $150,000 | Mat |     | \- 1/2 Farm | $150,000 | Mat |
|     | \- 1/2 Shares | $10,000 |     | \- 1/2 Shares | $10,000 |

The wife, as transferee, holds legal or equitable interests in not more than 50 percent of the couple's matrimonial property after the transfer. Accordingly, there is _no_ gift duty liability.

It should also be noted that if a couple enter into a simple agreement under section 21 in terms of which all property held by the husband and wife is declared matrimonial property and divided equally, there will be no liability for gift duty.

_Subsection (3)_ covers the situation where a disposition of matrimonial property is made to a party to a section 21 agreement, in accordance with that agreement, but the disposition results in the person to whom the property is disposed of holding more than half the legal and equitable interests in the property as a result of the disposition. It provides that in these circumstances the portion of the value of the disposition which brings the total value of matrimonial property held by the transferee up to 50 percent of the couple's total matrimonial property will not be a gift. Only the amount by which the disposition results in the value of the total interests in matrimonial property held by the transferee exceeding 50 percent of the couple's matrimonial property will be a gift for gift duty purposes.

Similarly, if the party to whom the property is transferred held interest in more than 50 percent of the total value of the couple's matrimonial property immediately prior to the disposition, the whole of the disposition will be a gift for gift duty purposes.

_For example_, in a section 21 agreement entered into on 20 August 1983, a husband who has all property in his name declares that it will all be matrimonial property to held in unequal proportions:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Husband | 70% | $70,000 |
| Wife | 30% | $30,000 |

The disposition to the wife of 30 percent is not dutiable.

On 10 February 1984, the husband acquires separate property by succession and in a subsequent agreement dated 15 March 1984 agrees to transfer a further 40 percent ($28,000) of his share of the matrimonial property to his wife. The end result of the disposition is that:

*   Husband has $42,000 matrimonial property
*   Wife has $58,000 matrimonial property

Fifty percent of the couple's matrimonial property is $50,000. Applying the provisions of subsection (3) to the transfer of matrimonial property (valued at $28,000):

*   $20,000 brings the value of matrimonial property held by the wife up to the 50 percent level of total matrimonial property and is therefore not a gift.
*   $8,000 is the value of the disposition which exceeds the 50 percent level and is a gift.

_Subsection (4)_ sets out the date on which the disposition is deemed to have taken place. This is defined to enable the percentage of the total matrimonial property which is owned by the person to whom the property is disposed, to be determined. It provides that, for the purposes of subsection (2) and subsection (3), the property will be deemed to have been disposed of:

1.  On the date of execution of the section 21 agreement in cases where the property is disposed of within three months after that date of execution.
2.  On the date of disposition where that disposition is made later than three months after the date of execution of the section 21 agreement.

It should be noted that this provision applies only for the purpose of determing the point at which the value of the property is to be taken in reaching a decision as to whether the disposition has not increased the transferee's ownership of matrimonial property beyond the 50 percent level. It does not define the date on which the disposition takes place for the purposes of the other provisions of the Act. It should also be noted that the Commissioner has no power to vary or extend that date.

_Subsection (5)_ provides that _all_ property, whether matrimonial property or otherwise, disposed of in compliance with an order of the Court under section 25 is specifically declared not to be a gift for the purposes of this Act.

_Subsection (6)_ requires the furnishing of a copy of the section 21 agreement to the Commissioner where a disposal of property is made by or pursuant to that agreement. Essentially, this subsection provides that sections 79, 80 and 95(5) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 shall be interpreted in the following manner.

1.  _Section 79_
2.  Where a disposition of property is made by or pursuant to a section 21 agreement, the person disposing of the property must deliver a copy of that agreement to the Commissioner within three months of the date of disposition of the property (the date of disposition being the actual date on which the property was disposed of). This action is required irrespective of the value of the property disposed of.

2.  _Section 80_
3.  Where the person who disposed of the property fails to deliver a copy of the agreement to the Commissioner, the person to whom that property is disposed of must deliver a copy of the agreement to the Commissioner within one month after the expiry of that three month period.

3.  _Section 95(5)_
4.  Any person who fails to comply with the requirement that a copy of the agreement be supplied (in the case of the person _to_whom the property is disposed of it should be noted that the failure must be wilful and negligent) is liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $500.

Subsection (2) of section 7 ensures that the amendments effected by section 7 apply only to agreements made under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, on or after 28 July 1983, and to orders of the Court made under section 25 of that Act. This is particularly important in relation to the delivery of copies of agreements to the Commissioner because it makes it quite clear that copies of such agreements are not required in respect of dispositions made on or after 28 July 1983 in accordance with agreements entered into before that date.

### Section 8 - Increase in Amount of Gift before Gift Statement to be Delivered to Commissioner

As the level at which gift duty becomes payable has been increased from $15,000 to $27,000, an increase has been made in the level at which gift statements are required to be filed with the Commissioner. The new level is $12,000 and applies both to statements to be filed by donors (section 79) and on default by donors, to be filed by donees (section 80). It is anticipated that many donors will continue to file gift statements in respect of gifts, or aggregation of gifts, less than $12,000 in value for evidential purposes.

.

### Introduction

This Act was assented to on 16 October 1971 and unless otherwise stated the amendments relate to the estates of persons dying on or after that date.

### Valuation of Life and Widowhood Interests

Under **section 2** the Commissioner's power to disregard the tables in the Second Schedule of the Act is extended to apply to the valuation of widowhood interests as well as life interests if the widow is suffering from a mortal illness.

### Persons Domiciled Overseas

**Section 3** applies to estates of persons dying domiciled out of New Zealand but having assets both in New Zealand and overseas. Where a beneficiary in an estate is entitled to a pecuniary legacy or other pecuniary claim, and the will does not specifically charge the legacy or claim on assets in any particular country, it will be apportioned between the dutiable estate in New Zealand and the foreign assets.

### Relief for Estate Duty Paid Overseas

**Section 4** provides that when calculating the relief for estate duty paid outside New Zealand the duties paid overseas are to be converted into New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of death of the deceased. This provision is retrospective to 1 January 1969.

### Deferment of Estate Duty on Mining Ventures

**Section 5** inserts a new section **43A** in the Act. When a deceased's dutiable estate includes significant mineral or petroleum interests, and the venture has not become income producing, payment of the relevant duty may be postponed at the discretion of the Commissioner.

### Gift Duty Exemption

**Section 6** transfers the exemption from gift duty enacted in the Fire Services Act 1949 into the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. It does not alter the exemptions but ensures that all the exemptions from this duty are in the one Act.

### When Gift Duty Payable

**Section 7** corrects a drafting error in **section 85** of the principal Act by providing that gift duty is payable on the making of a dutiable gift.

### Rights of Objection

**Section 8** gives administrators rights of objection to the Board of Review for the new discretions given to the Commissioner under **section 5**. As with **section 5** it applies to the estates of all persons whether dying before or after the commencement of the principal Act.

Estate and Gift Duties Bill 1968
================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Estate and Gift Duties Bill 1968 from PIB vol 46 Aug 1968.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 46, August 1968

### Estate and Gift Duties Bill 1968

The Minister of Finance, the Hon RD Muldoon, introduced the Estate and Gift Duties Bill to the House on 4 July 1968.

The Statutes Revision Committee is now examining the Bill.

In general it follows the principles of existing legislation but has been arranged in a more logical order and written in simpler language. It is intended to apply from 1 January 1969.

The main changes proposed by the Bill are -

#### ESTATE DUTY

#### Dutiable Estate

Foreign realty is no longer excluded from the dutiable estate, but credit for overseas duty paid on the asset will be allowed up to the amount of the New Zealand duty.

A new method is provided for treating certain types of life insurance policies on deceased's life, where he disposed of the policy within three years of death.

#### Valuations

Partnership interests and certain debts owing to deceased by relatives and controlled companies are to be valued in the manner set out in the Bill.

A new table for calculating the value of widowhood interests has been added to the Schedules of the Bill.

#### Payment

The time in which to pay estate duty without interest has been extended from four months to six months from date of death. The rate of interest is 5%.

Provision is made for relief in cases of hardship.

#### Allowances

The order of the various allowances has been fixed. At present, the order in which allowances are granted can make a difference in the overall estate duty payable.

Allowances for estate duty paid outside New Zealand have been extended to cover all overseas duty. At present relief is given only from duty imposed by the country in which the assets are domiciled.

The quick succession allowance has been extended and simplified by basing the allowance on the total value of successions rather than individual assets.

A new method for making allowance for gift duty paid or payable on gifts included in the dutiable estate is set out in the Bill.

#### Notices to the Commissioner

Notice to the Commissioner of payments made to the estate of a deceased person without administration, does not have to be made unless the amount is $500 or more. At present, notice of all payments must be given.

#### GIFT DUTY

#### Dutiable Girls

Gifts of foreign realty are to be liable to gift duty if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand.

Gifts made by a controlled company axe to be treated in a special manner.

The time in which to file a gift statement has been extended from one month to three months from date of gift.

#### Payment

The penalty on unpaid gift duty is reduced from 10% to 5%. It accrues six months from the date of gift. Interest on unpaid gift duty has also been introduced, applying three months from the date of gift at 5%.

A right of objection to the Commissioner against an assessment of either estate or gift duty has been provided. At present, the only right of objection is direct to a Court.

#### Change In Rates Of Gift Duty- Budget Proposals

The Minister of Finance announced changes in the rates of gift duty payable on gifts made on or after 19 July 1968 -

*   The amount which can be gifted without duty in any 12-month period has been increased from $2,000 to $4,000.
*   A new scale of rates has been introduced. The scale is set out below.
*   Where gifts made before 19 July 1968 aggregate with gifts made after the change gift duty on the earlier gifts will not be increased unless the value of the aggregated gift is more than $4,000.

Gift statements must still be filed where the value of gifts made in any 12-month period is more than $2,000.

#### Scale Of Rates For Gifts Made On Or After 19 July 1968

| Value of Gift (Together with value of all Aggregated Gifts) |     | Rate  <br>NOTE - 'Excess' means excess of the value |
| --- | --- | --- |

Evasion shortfall penalties
===========================

2014 case note – Taxation Review Authority found that disputant was subjectively reckless which can amount to evasion - liability for evasion shortfall penalties.

Case

TRA 004/12 \[2014\] NZTRA 03

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found that the disputant was subjectively reckless because, with full appreciation of the risks, he made a conscious decision to understate his income and advanced his own interpretation of the tax legislation. The disputant was found liable for evasion shortfall penalties.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that subjective recklessness can amount to evasion.

### Facts

The disputant was a director and shareholder of X Limited. He received a shareholder salary in the 2007 and 2008 income years which he omitted from his tax returns. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") assessed the disputant for evasion shortfall penalties for those two years. The disputant accepts that gross carelessness penalties apply but disputes that he is liable for evasion penalties.

The Commissioner issued default assessments in respect of the 2000 and 2001 income tax years. The disputant filed a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA"). However, subsequently following professional accounting advice (from his own accountant and the accountants for X Limited), he filed amended returns which included his shareholder salary as income.

The disputant correctly returned his shareholder salary in his 2002 and 2003 income tax returns.

The disputant was introduced to Mr A and his associates. The disputant said Mr A showed him material which said that where a person exchanges labour for reward there is an equal exchange of value so that no amount of income arises and there is no "profit" which might be taxable ("reward for labour argument"). The disputant was so convinced that he stopped listening to his accountants and appointed a member of Mr A's group as his agent to deal with his tax matters.

The agent prepared the disputant's 2004 and 2005 returns which included the disputant's shareholder salary but deducted an amount described as "reward to \[disputant's name\]" which was roughly equivalent to the shareholder salary. The disputant filed his 2006 tax return on the same basis.

The Commissioner issued a NOPA in respect of the 2004, 2005 and 2006 returns.

The disputant filed a notice of response which argued that under section 109, his returns were deemed to be correct and could not be challenged by the Commissioner. He also made the reward for labour argument.

The Commissioner issued a statement of position ("SOP") which set out the Commissioner's position on the reward for labour argument and the meaning and effect of section 109. The disputant did not file an SOP. Accordingly, he was deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's position.

The disputant's income tax returns for 2004, 2005 and 2006 were adjusted and shortfall penalties for evasion were imposed.

In March 2008, the disputant filed his 2007 income tax return and did not return his shareholder salary.

In May 2008, the disputant filed amended returns for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 income years, but did not include his shareholder salary in his amended returns.

In August 2008, the disputant filed his 2008 income tax return and did not return his shareholder salary.

In February 2009 the Commissioner advised that discrepancies had been found in the 2007 and 2008 tax returns and penalties would be considered under Part IX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

In 2010, the disputant pleaded guilty to charges under section 143A(1)(c) of the TAA for knowingly providing false or incomplete information to the Commissioner by filing false or incomplete tax returns in respect of the 2007 and 2008 income years. He was convicted and fined on both charges.

The disputant entered arrangements with the Commissioner to pay the outstanding tax but he disputed the imposing of evasion shortfall penalties.

### Decision

Sinclair DCJ confirmed the Commissioner's evasion shortfall penalty assessments for the 2007 and 2008 income tax years.

The Commissioner argued direct intention: that the disputant intended to avoid the assessment and payment of tax which he knew he was obligated to pay. In the alternative, the Commissioner argued subjective recklessness: the disputant appreciated there was a positive risk that in taking his tax position he would breach a tax obligation and proceeded regardless.

Counsel for the disputant, submitted the disputant honestly believed that the arguments he relied upon when he filed his returns were correct. She referred to _Case S100_ (1996) 17 NZTC 6,626 at 7,634.

Sinclair DCJ found that at the time the disputant filed his 2007 income tax return, he knew that the Commissioner was of the view that he was required to file a tax return declaring his shareholder salary. He also knew that the accountants for X Limited were of the same view, and he had previously been advised by his own accountants to file amended returns including his shareholder salary as income.

Sinclair DCJ considered the disputant's submission - that the disputant did take note of the advice given by the Commissioner and that it was a question of how the disputant construed that advice - lacked any merit. Sinclair DCJ held that "the disputant simply cherry picked what the Commissioner had to say to continue his own argument" \[43\].

Sinclair DCJ put weight on the fact that the disputant had chosen at an early stage not to take tax advice from a tax accountant.

Taking into account all the evidence, the TRA was not satisfied to the requisite standard that the disputant had the necessary intention to evade his tax obligations when he filed his 2007 and 2008 returns.

However, Sinclair DCJ found that the disputant was subjectively reckless:

1.  Whilst accepting that the disputant had strongly held views and even if the disputant was convinced that his interpretation of the law was correct, Sinclair DCJ was not satisfied, on the facts, that as a consequence of those views that the disputant did not appreciate, or was somehow blind to, the risk that he was taking in understanding his income if he was wrong. \[48\] 
2.  Sinclair DCJ was satisfied that it could be inferred from the facts that the disputant knew the risk that if he was wrong he would be liable to pay tax on his shareholder salary. \[49\]
3.  Sinclair DCJ was satisfied to the requisite standard that the disputant, with full appreciation of that risk, made a conscious decision to return the understated income advancing his own interpretation of the tax legislation. \[50\]

Exceptional circumstances examined by the Taxation Review Authority
===================================================================

2011 case note – Useful discussion from the Taxation Review Authority that draws together the cases in the area of 'exceptional circumstances'.

Case

TRA 27/08; TRA 28/08; TRA 53/08 \[2011\] NZTRA 05

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") considered there were arguable exceptional circumstances that existed in respect of late served Points of Objection Notices but sought further evidence prior to deciding the application for an extension of time.

### Impact of decision

While about the old objection procedures, there is a useful discussion drawing together the cases in the area of "exceptional circumstances" that is of wider interest.

### Facts

The three taxpayers affected by this ruling had sought cases stated to the TRA under the old objection procedure.

Under that procedure the taxpayer had to complete a Points of Objection Notice and deliver it to the Director, Litigation Management, at a specified address provided in the TRA Regulations 1998, within a specified statutory time frame. Failure to do so automatically ended the objection. However it was possible for a taxpayer to seek an extension of time to file their Points of Objective Notice from the TRA.

In each of these cases the taxpayers failed to serve timely Points of Objection Notices upon the Director, Litigation Management. They also failed to seek an extension of time for filing their Points of Objection Notice from the TRA. The Commissioner took as a preliminary point this failure and asked the TRA to dismiss the objections.

The taxpayer argued that there had been timely service as the calculation of time did not commence until the Commissioner provided the taxpayer with a Points of Objection Notice form; that the Commissioner has "declined" rather than "disallowed" their objections which had confused the tax agent; and that in one case the Commissioner had provided the wrong due date for the Points of Objection Notice. On the facts the Points of Objection Notice in that case was provided several weeks after either the correct or the incorrectly advised date. The taxpayers also sought an extension of time on the basis of exceptional circumstances.

### Decision

Judge Barber found as follows:

1.  The Points of Objection Notices had not been served in a timely manner as the time for serving a Points of Objection Notice ran from the date the taxpayer gave notice that it wanted a case stated and not from receipt of a Points of Objection form from the Commissioner \[56\]. The TRA Act and Regulations did not require the Points of Objective Notice to be supplied by the Commissioner to the taxpayer and "put the onus on the objector to complete a Points of Objective Notice and there is no requirement for the IRD to supply an objector with one".
2.  There was no merit in an argument trying to distinguish "declined" from "disallowed": "If an objection is declined it is disallowed".
3.  While the Commissioner provided an incorrect (and later) date for service, this made no difference as the Points of Objective Notice was supplied a few weeks after even the incorrect date.

His Honour reviewed the law addressing what constituted exceptional circumstances (at \[28\]) and accepted that it was essential there be:

NaN.  An event or circumstance which is unusual or out of the ordinary, but not so rare as to be categorised as extraordinary, which operates alone or together with other circumstances (unusual or not);
NaN.  Which must be beyond the control of the taxpayer;
NaN.  So as to provide the taxpayer with a reasonable justification for not commencing the objection or challenge within the required period;
NaN.  An act or omission of an agent of the taxpayer is only exceptional circumstance if it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the agent's control and could not have been anticipated and the effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct.

The Court was concerned that the Commissioner's pre-printed blank Points of Objection Notice forms had an incorrect address for service upon the Director, Litigation Management. While accepting it is the legislation that must be complied with and not Inland Revenue's publications, the incorrect address on an Inland Revenue form may amount to an exceptional circumstance.

The Judge then gave the taxpayers leave to reconvene to provide evidence that the incorrect address on Inland Revenue's form led them into error and as such was an exceptional circumstance which would justify the TRA granting an extension of time.

[Student Loan Scheme Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-act-2011 "Student Loan Scheme Act 2011")

Excess repayments
=================

2011 change to Student Loan Scheme Act and handling of excess repayments to account for the move towards repayments being determined on a pay-period basis.

**_Sections 118-132, 222 and schedule 8_** 

Changes have been made to the way excess repayments are dealt with to account for the move towards loan repayments being determined on a pay-period basis. This includes re-enacting the existing excess repayment bonus provisions.

### **Background**

When a borrower makes payments or deductions of $500 or more in excess of their compulsory repayment obligation for the year, they are entitled to a 10% excess repayment bonus. The bonus is calculated following the end-of-tax year assessment. The bonus is available to both New Zealand-based and overseas-based borrowers.

As a result of the repayment obligations on salary and wages being determined on a pay-period basis under the new rules, changes have been required to reflect the pay-period basis of assessment on the excess repayment bonus provisions.

There are also different time periods within which a borrower is required to request a refund of an excess repayment depending on whether the borrower is New Zealand-based or overseas-based.

### **Key features**

The major change to the excess repayment provisions policy is to exclude minor over-deductions that occur through the PAYE system from counting towards the 10% excess repayment bonus. This change is required to enable the pay-period assessment basis to apply to salary and wages. Any over-deductions that are determined as significant will be eligible for the 10% bonus, provided the other criteria for the bonus are met.

In addition, as a result of the introduction of the pay-period assessment basis for salary or wages, borrowers who want to make voluntary repayments through the PAYE system and qualify for the bonus can do so by separately tagging these payments with a new deduction code, SLBOR. This will allow Inland Revenue to separate these payments from standard salary or wage deductions when paid through the employer monthly schedule. This will allow the current practice, whereby some borrowers have their employer deduct additional amounts from their salary and wages, to continue.

When a borrower has a repayment or deduction made that exceeds their compulsory repayment obligations, the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 only enabled borrowers to either apply the amount to their loan balance or have the amount refunded. The new rules provide another option for borrowers - to have their excess repayment applied to a future repayment obligation. This will be of benefit to borrowers whose excess repayment is below the $500 threshold to qualify for the bonus. In this situation, the borrower could apply the excess to satisfy the following year's repayment obligation and thereby combine it with any other excess payments in that future year in the hope of the amount exceeding the $500 threshold and thereby qualifying for the bonus in that year.

Previously, when the Commissioner advised a borrower that they had an excess repayment, overseas-based borrowers had two months from the date of the statement to request a refund of the excess, whereas New Zealand-based borrowers had six months.

The new rules standardise the period to request a refund at six months for both New Zealand-based and overseas-based borrowers.

Generally the excess repayment bonus is credited:

*   on the day that the final excess repayment was made, if the borrower repays their loan in full; or
*   on the date the borrower died or was declared bankrupt; or
*   on 1 April in the year that follows the tax year that the excess repayment was made, in all other cases.

### **Changes from date of enactment to 1 April 2012**

Changes have been made to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to ensure that from the date of enactment of the new rules, until 1 April 2012, the excess repayment bonus will be credited:

*   on the date the borrower died or was declared bankrupt; or
*   on 1 April in the year that follows the tax year that the excess repayment was made, in all other cases.

If a borrower has repaid their loan in full part-way through the year, has died or been declared bankrupt, the excess repayment bonus is calculated based on the borrower's obligations up to the date the borrower repaid their loan, died, or was declared bankrupt. This treatment should benefit the majority of borrowers. However, if finalising the excess repayment bonus part-way through the year would disadvantage the borrower, the borrower can request that the bonus be finalised as at the end of the year.

During the Select Committee stage of the bill, a technical amendment was made to ensure that borrowers who receive other income in addition to salary or wages are able to receive a refund of overpaid loan deductions from their salary or wage income.

### **Application date**

The changes apply from 1 April 2012, with effect from the 2012-13 tax year.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2012 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012")

Excluding losses from the calculation of net income for student loan repayment purposes
=======================================================================================

2012 amendment to Student Loan Scheme increases personal responsibility for debt repayment and maximises repayments from NZ based borrowers.

_**Sections 4 and 73, new section 88A, section 46(2)(a), sections 101 to 104 (repealed), sections 149(2) and 219, and schedule 6**_

The changes introduced by the new legislation are intended to increase personal responsibility for debt repayment, maximise repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers and ensure fairness across the student loan scheme.

Broadening the income base from which student loan repayments are made contributes to maximising repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers. Under the new rules business and investment losses such as rental losses will be excluded from the calculation of net income for student loan repayment purposes.

### Background

In Budget 2011, the Government announced that, as a first step to maximise repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers, business and investment losses (such as rental losses) would be excluded from the calculation of net income when determining the repayment obligation for a student loan.

The previous definition of "net income" in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 was based on the "net income" definition for income tax purposes. It includes income such as salary and wages, income-tested benefits, NZ superannuation, interest, dividends and income such as business profits. In determining "net income" losses can be offset, but not carried forward.

The new legislation removes the ability to offset losses against income when calculating a repayment obligation, making the legislation fairer for all student loan borrowers irrespective of how they arrange their financial matters.

### Key features

When a borrower has one or more business or investment activities, the income and expenditure from an activity which results in a net loss should be ignored when calculating the net amount earned from both "other income" (business income) and pre-taxed income (for example, interest and dividends) for student loan purposes. For "other income", this is achieved by replacing the definition of "net income" with a new definition of "adjusted net income". For "pre-taxed income" the definition of "net pre-taxed income" also reflects that losses can no longer be offset against income.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 April 2012.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Other income (business income)_

Subpart 3 of part 2 determines the repayment obligation of New Zealand-based borrowers with "other income" (business income).

New section 88A replaces the definition of "net income" with a new definition of "adjusted net income".

Section 88A(1) contains the formula that borrowers with "other income" should use to determine their "adjusted net income". The borrower's annual total deductions should be subtracted from the borrower's annual gross income (other than from salary and wages) to arrive at their "adjusted net income".

Section 88A(2) contains a proviso which states that if the income and deductions from any investment or business activity result in a net loss, the income and deductions should be ignored when calculating the borrower's adjusted net income.

**Example**

Ingrid owns a café which makes a profit of $55,000 a year. She also owns a rental property. For the 2012-13 income year the rental property makes a loss of $10,000. In calculating her "adjusted net income" for student loan repayment purposes, Ingrid can no longer use the $10,000 loss to offset against her café profits which would have meant her student loan repayment obligation is based on $45,000. Ingrid must make repayments based on her café profits of $55,000.

When two or more business or investment activities are normally carried on in association with each other, the Commissioner may treat those activities as a single activity (section 88A(3)). For example, a car sales yard and a car rental agency.

When applying subsections (2) and (3) above, deductions relating to an asset used in carrying on two or more activities must be appropriately apportioned between those activities on the basis of the use of that asset in those activities.

#### _Pre-taxed income_

Subpart 2 determines the repayment obligation for pre-taxed income (that is, income from interest, dividends, a taxable Maori authority distribution, salary or wages from employment as a casual agricultural employee, or salary or wages from employment as an election day worker).

New section 73 sets out the meaning of "net pre-taxed income".

Section 73(1) contains the formula that borrowers with pre-taxed income should use to determine their net pre-taxed income. A borrower's allowable expenses should be subtracted from the borrower's pre-taxed income to determine their net pre-taxed income.

Section 73(2) contains a proviso which states that if the income and deductions from any investment activity result in a net loss, the income and deductions should be ignored when calculating the borrower's net pre-taxed income.

When two or more investment activities are normally carried on in association with each other, the Commissioner may treat those activities as a single activity (section 73(3)).

As a consequence of denying the ability to offset losses, sections 101 to 104 have been repealed because they contemplate being able to apply for a reduction of deduction rate as a consequence of incurring a loss from "other income".

Sections 46, 149(2), 219 and schedule 6 have also been amended to remove references to sections 101 to 104, following their repeal.

Exclusions to the bright-line test
==================================

A property will not be taxable under the bright-line test if you meet 1 of the following exclusions:

*   it's your main home and your use meets certain criteria
*   it’s used predominately as business premises
*   it’s being used as farmland or capable of being used as farmland.

Main home
---------

Your main home is the property where you live for most of the time. If you have more than 1 property it is the property you have the greatest connection to. You cannot have more than 1 main home.

Which property is your main home depends on:

*   the amount of time you live in each home
*   where your immediate family lives
*   where your personal property is kept
*   where your social ties are strongest
*   your use of the home
*   what other ties (for example: employment, business, economic) you have with the surrounding community.

Main home exclusion criteria
----------------------------

You can claim the main home exclusion if you:

*   used more than 50% of the property’s area as your main home (including the yard, gardens, and garage)
*   lived in the property as your main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period.

If either one of these is 50% or less, then the main home exclusion does not apply, and you will need to pay tax on any profit when you sell it.

For example, if you use 40% of a property as your main home and rent out 60% as a flat, you cannot use the main home exclusion when you sell that property.

For properties sold before 1 July 2024, different criteria apply depending on when you acquired the property.

[Property sold before 1 July 2024](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/the-brightline-test/property-sold-before-1-july-2024)

You must have lived in the property as your main home
-----------------------------------------------------

It's important to note that having the intention to use the property as your main home is not enough, you must have actually used it for this purpose.

The exclusion will also not apply when only a family member and not the owner has used the property as their main home.

The property does not need to have been used without interruption. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while you are on holiday or before settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the total time it is used as your main home is more than the total time it is not used as your main home.

Construction period
-------------------

When you build a new home, you can ignore the construction period when determining if your usage of the property qualifies for the main home exclusion.

Only look at your usage before construction began, and from when construction was completed to when the property is sold.

Construction is the work to build the home and includes the design phase. Construction is usually considered complete when the code compliance certificate is issued under the Building Act 2004.

Example: Off the plan and construction delays

In December 2020, Ben purchased a property off the plan in a new development. Construction was due to be completed in early 2022, but due to delays, construction was not completed until June 2023.

Ben moved into the property immediately following settlement in June 2023 and used it as his main home until he sold it in December 2024.

Ben can ignore the 30-month construction period and only look at the period from June 2023 to December 2024 when determining whether he qualifies for the main home exclusion. He qualifies for the main home exclusion because he lived in the property as his main home for the whole period.

Any profit on the sale is not taxable under the bright-line test.

Limits to claiming the main home exclusion
------------------------------------------

The main home exclusion does not apply when you:

*   have a regular pattern of either buying and selling or building and selling your main home (even if you or your family live in the property before it is sold)
*   have already used the main home exclusion twice over the 2-year period immediately before you sold your main home.

Main home held in trust
-----------------------

Residential properties held in trust can use the main home exclusion if the house sold was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust and one of the following conditions apply:

*   the [principal settlor](/api/glossary/item?id={A605136F-F9FB-469E-A77D-563DB6B063A3})
     does not have a main home
*   it is the main home of the principal settlor of the trust that is being sold.

If a principal settlor of a trust has a main home that is not the one being sold by the trust, the main home exclusion cannot apply to any property owned by the trust.

Rollover relief and the main home exclusion
-------------------------------------------

When residential land is sold and rollover relief applies, the usage of the last owner is considered and attributed to the new owner to work out if the main home exclusion applies.

For properties sold on or after 1 July 2024, rollover relief extends to transactions between associated persons.

For more information about rollover relief and when it applies.

[Ownership transfers and rollover relief](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/the-brightline-test/ownership-transfers-and-rollover-relief)
 

Example: Rollover relief and the main home exclusion

Hamish and Jess bought their first family home in July 2024 and settled the property on the HJ Family Trust. They lived in the property for 12 months and transferred the property to another trust, H & J Family Trust, which they are also settlors of.  H & J Family Trust rents out the property and after 6 months the property is sold.

The 12-month period that Hamish and Jess lived in the property is attributed to H & J Family Trust. The main home exclusion will apply because the property was lived in for more than 50% of the time (12 out of the 18 months).

Exempt income for religious organisation members
================================================

If you serve in a religious organisation and are not paid for your work, any board or lodging and other basic personal necessities (such as food, clothing and heating) you receive may be [exempt income](/api/glossary/item?id={486206DB-3A57-47DB-B74B-D3F51D13A4E5})
. 

This exemption will apply to you if you meet the following criteria:

You are a member of a religious society or order
------------------------------------------------

*   You must have evidence that you have joined or are a part of a religious society or order.
*   Your service to the religious society or order can be helping or doing work of any kind and it must be unpaid (other than the amount for board, lodging and/or basic personal necessities).  
*   The service does not have to be full-time, but it must be the only paid or unpaid work you do.
*   It does not matter whether you are married, and you do not need to have taken a vow of poverty.  

You only receive basic board, lodging and/or personal necessities
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*   The religious organisation can:  
    *   directly provide you with board, lodging, and/or basic personal necessities, or
    *   pay or pay you back an amount to cover these expenses.
*   The accommodation or necessities must be basic and not be considered a luxury.
*   Basic personal necessities include things like food, clothing, heating, basic travel, toiletries and grooming expenses.
*   If you are given money to cover these expenses, you must show how this was calculated. The money must be used only for board, lodging, and/or basic personal necessities. It cannot be used for general savings.  
*   If you are paid more than the amount of basic accommodation and personal necessities, none of the money is exempt from being taxed. You cannot divide the money between exempt amounts and taxable amounts. 
*   If you get income from other passive sources, such as trusts or investments, you may still be entitled to the tax exemption.

**Note**

If you are paid by the religious society or order for your service, the exemption will not apply even if you donate all your earnings to the society.

We will consider the total work or service you carry out. It cannot be divided between paid and unpaid services. 

For example, if you carry out paid work, and also perform unpaid service which you get board and basic personal necessities for, the exemption will not apply. 

The nature of the service is that you are not paid and do not receive a reward
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will consider both:

*   the society or order's intention for the service, and
*   whether you are actually paid or rewarded. 

We will consider rewards that are unexpected, infrequent, or one-off on a case-by-case basis. 

Example 1: Service and unpaid work

Robert serves the religious society that he is a member of and carries out unpaid work for 35 hours a week.

The religious society provides Robert with a room for accommodation in shared premises and meals in a communal dining area. It also calculates a $200 monthly payment to cover other basic personal necessities including clothing, grooming, toiletries and health expenses.

The value of accommodation, meals and the monthly payment received by Robert are exempt from tax.

Example 2: Entertainment tickets for members’ use

A sponsor of the regional rugby team donates to the religious society a number of free tickets for entry to an upcoming game. Each voucher is valued up to $200 and the society makes them available to members and volunteers.

Robert chooses to use a voucher one weekend for him and his family. This would be considered an unexpected and one-off reward, and it would not change the nature of Robert’s service to the organisation.

The value of the voucher would be exempt, and his accommodation, food and monthly payment discussed in example 1 would still be exempt from tax. 

Example 3: Regular donation distributed to members

The religious society receives a substantial donation from a philanthropist, who advises that she intends to provide a similar donation annually.

Together, the society and philanthropist decide that every year half of the donation is to be used for specific religious projects, and half is to be gifted to all volunteers and unpaid members as thanks for their service.

Robert receives $1,500. As this is a regular payment that will be received every year, and the religious society influenced the decision of where the money should be used, this affects the nature of Robert’s service.

The tax exemption does not apply to Robert’s portion of the donation. In addition, the exemption criteria would no longer be met for the accommodation, meals and payment for basic personal necessities from example 1.

Exemption for rights to benefit from employment-related foreign superannuation schemes
======================================================================================

2006 amendments to the foreign investment fund (FIF) exemption for rights to benefit from employment-related foreign superannuation schemes.

### Section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004, sections CG 14(3) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and sections 245R(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976

Amendments have been made to the foreign investment fund (FIF) exemption for rights to benefit from employment-related foreign superannuation schemes. The amendments extend the exemption to apply to returning residents and also give permanent exemption relief for all rights that were acquired in the first five years of each new period of New Zealand residence. These amendments apply retrospectively from the commencement of the FIF rules.

### Background

Individuals working in Australia generally have compulsory contributions made on their behalf by their employers into a superannuation scheme (the Australian Superannuation Guarantee Scheme). This scheme is an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme for New Zealand tax purposes. In general, Australian and New Zealand citizens cannot access their superannuation entitlements until they reach retirement age. If they migrate or return to New Zealand they could be subject to tax on those entitlements, under New Zealand's FIF rules.

The FIF rules currently tax the income earned by a foreign entity (such as a foreign superannuation scheme) according to the rights held by New Zealand residents in that entity. They ensure that foreign income earned by a foreign superannuation scheme on behalf of New Zealand residents is subject to New Zealand tax.

Consultation with the private sector indicated that people who held rights to benefit from an Australian superannuation scheme are not complying correctly with their tax obligations under the FIF rules and, indeed, may not even be aware that they have to account for tax. It is likely that this non-compliance is not unique to people with Australian superannuation interests. For those people who are aware of their tax responsibilities, determining whether they are required to pay tax under the FIF rules can involve high compliance costs such as specialist tax advice. Although the current FIF exemptions provide some relief from the rules, the difficulty is determining which exemption applies and how to meet the continuing requirements of the exemption if a person wants to continue to contribute to a foreign superannuation scheme after moving to New Zealand.

In the course of reviewing the effects of the impact of the FIF rules on individuals with rights to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, an inconsistency was also identified in the way first-time residents and returning residents to New Zealand were treated under the rules. There were more exemptions available to firsttime residents than for returning residents, which raised concerns about equity and consistency.

For example, the previous exemption for rights to benefit from an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme applied to those rights that were held by firsttime residents only and that were acquired by the person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for tax purposes.

The amendments specifically address the inconsistency in the FIF treatment of first time residents and returning residents. They also increase the level of exemption for rights to benefit from an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme, thereby improving the overall equity of the FIF rules and decreasing the tax burden and the associated compliance costs for those people affected.

### Key features

The exemption in section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 applies to the rights of an individual to benefit, as a beneficiary or a member, from an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme. These rights must have accrued during the period:

*   for which the person is not a New Zealand resident; and/or
*   for which the person is a New Zealand resident and that
    *   begins when the person becomes a New Zealand resident; and
    *   ends before the first day of the fifth income year following the income year in which the person becomes a New Zealand resident.

The extent to which these rights have accrued during the period as described above is calculated using the following formula:

|     |
| --- |
| Closing value – opening value |
| Where:  <br>  <br>_Closing value_ is the market value of the rights on the day that ends the period  <br>  <br>_Opening value_ is the market value of the rights on the day that begins the period |

The result of this formula is the value of the rights that are permanently exempt from the FIF rules. If there is more than one period that meets the description above, the rights accruing to each of these periods will be permanently exempt from the FIF rules.

Consequential amendments have also been made to the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Application date

The amendments to the exemption for rights to benefit from employment-related foreign superannuation schemes apply from the commencement of the foreign investment fund rules, being the 1991–92 income year for taxpayers with a corresponding non-standard accounting year ending after 2 July 1992, or the 1992–93 and subsequent income years for other taxpayers.

Exemption from gift duty for dispositions of property made by or under an order of the Court: section 75(A) Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968
===========================================================================================================================================

QB issued 2006 clarifies when the exemption from gift duty applies to dispositions of relationship property.

We have been asked to clarify when the exemption from gift duty provided in section 75A(5) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 ("the EGDA") applies to dispositions of relationship property made by or under an order of the Court pursuant to section 25 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.

### Application

The interpretation of the law outlined in this item will be applied by the Commissioner to dispositions of property made after 5 October 2005 by or under an order of the Court pursuant to section 25 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. 

The Commissioner has published a Notice of Withdrawal giving notice of the withdrawal of the previous policy statements contained in the item entitled "Gift Duty Exemption Clarified" published in _Taxation Information Bulletin_ Vol 9, No 6, June 1997 and the item entitled "Gift Duty Exemption Further Clarified" published in _Taxation Information Bulletin_ Vol 9, No 8, August 1997.

### Legislation

Section 75A of the EGDA provides for exemptions from gift duty for certain dispositions of property made pursuant to the provisions of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 ( "the PRA") (formerly called the Matrimonial Property Act 1976). 

Section 75A of the EGDA as a whole was re-enacted by the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2001 with effect from 1 August 2001.  The substituted provision took into account the changes made by the amendment Act to the Matrimonial Property Act 1976.  The changes in wording widened the group of people who could be parties to an exempt transaction by including de facto partners but did not change the other requirements for an exempt transaction.

Section 75A(5) of the EGDA concerns a disposition of property by or under an order of the Court made pursuant to section 25 of the PRA.  
  
Prior to 25 September 1993, section 75A(5) did not limit the dispositions that were exempt from gift duty if they were made under a court order pursuant to section 25 of the PRA.  From 25 September 1993, amendments to the EGDA restricted the application of the exemption to dispositions "to" a spouse or former spouse or dispositions made "solely for the benefit of" minor or dependent children of the marriage.  These amendments were made to counter the effect of the decision in _Wilson_ _v_ _Wilson_ _(No.2)_ (1991) 7 FRNZ 519 which allowed a gift duty free transfer of matrimonial assets directly to a discretionary family trust.

Section 75A(5) was subsequently amended by the Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 2005 to include references to civil unions and children of civil unions.  These amendments took effect from 26 April 2005.

Section 75A(5) of the EGDA provides as follows:

> Any disposition of property by or under an order of the Court under section 25 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 does not constitute a gift to the extent that the disposition is to a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner or former spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner or is solely for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the marriage or, as the case requires, minor or dependent children of the civil union or de facto relationship.

#### Application of the legislation

We have been asked to clarify the application of section 75A(5) of the EGDA, particularly in the context of dispositions made to a fixed or discretionary non-charitable trust.  The wording of the subsection raises the issue of whether a disposition "to" or "solely for the benefit of" a person can be made through a disposition to a fixed or discretionary trust where the person concerned is a named beneficiary of the trust.

_Disposition to a spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner_

The exemption contained in section 75A(5) of the EGDA is available in respect of dispositions to a spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner where the disposition of property is made "to" the person.  The word "to" in the context of section 75A(5) means a disposition towards a person, i.e. the giving of something in the direction of a particular person (the spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner, or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner).  A disposition of property by way of **direct transfer** to the person concerned would be a disposition _to_ that person. 

The exemption is not available where the disposition of property is made **to a fixed trust** where the spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner is a named beneficiary because the disposition is not made directly to the person but is instead made directly to a third party, the trustee.  The Commissioner does not consider that the receipt of a beneficial interest in the trust property is sufficiently direct to attract the exemption from gift duty.  This is on the basis of the words used in the subsection which can be contrasted with the words used in respect of dispositions to children, being "for the benefit of", which clearly intend the use of a trust vehicle.  The legislative history of the provision supports an interpretation of the text of the provision that the subsection differentiates between the type of disposition that is acceptable in terms of adults, and the types of disposition that are acceptable in terms of dispositions to minor or dependent children.  The use of trusts was to be restricted to situations where the ultimate recipient of the property was a minor or dependent child, and a more direct disposition was required where the recipient was an adult.   

The exemption is not available where the disposition of property is made **to a discretionary trust** where the spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner is a potential beneficiary because, again, the disposition is not made directly to the person but is instead made directly to a third party, the trustee.  In addition, there is no certainty that the person will receive any part of the trust property.  This would be the case whether or not the class of possible beneficiaries was closed.  On the plain meaning of the words used in subsection (5), a disposition of property by way of a discretionary trust is not a disposition "to" a person who _may_ later become a beneficiary. 

The words "to the extent that" in subsection 75A(5) apply to all categories of disposition but in the context of a disposition "to" a person, apportionment will only be possible if a disposition is divided between a _direct_ gift to a spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner and a gift to others (by way of trust or otherwise).  The disposition to the spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner would then be exempt under section 75A(5).

The same analysis is relevant in terms of subsections 75(A)(2) and (3) of the EGDA which apply to dispositions of relationship property "to" a party to an agreement under section 21 of the PRA.  The disposition of property would have to be made directly to the party concerned in order for the exemption to apply.

_Disposition solely for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the marriage, civil union or de facto relationship_

The use of the words "for the benefit of" recognise that, in many situations where relationship property is being transferred, the intended recipient will, at the time of disposition, be a minor and unable to hold property him or herself.  In such a situation the use of a trust in the child or children's favour is often an appropriate way of disposing of the property.  However, there are still some limitations on the use of trusts in this context which are imposed by the words used in the section.

The _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ (10th ed) defines "benefit" as follows:

*   n. **1** an advantage or profit gained from something.  **2**  a payment made by the state or an insurance scheme to someone entitled to receive it, e.g. an unemployed person.  **3**  a public performance designed to raise money for a charity.
*   v. (**benefited** or **benefited**, **benefiting** or **benefiting**) receive an advantage; profit.

In _Re Remnants Settlements Trust_ \[1970\] 2 All ER 554, Pennycuick J stated that:

> The Court is entitled and bound to consider not merely financial benefits but benefits of any other kind.

In _Re W_ \[1970\] 2 All ER 504, Ungoed-Thomas J stated that:

It seems clear to me that it is not restricted to material benefit, but it is of wide significance comprehending whatever would be beneficial in any respect, material or otherwise.  The word "benefit", prima facie, carries such wide significance; it is not limited to any particular aspect of benefit.

The word "for" has many meanings; it is defined in the _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ (10th ed) as meaning:

*   prep. **1**  in favour of.  **2**  affecting or with regard to.  **3**  on behalf of or to the benefit of.  **4**  having as a purpose or function.  **5**  having as a reason or cause.  **6** having as a destination.  **7**  representing.  **8**  in exchange for.  **\>** charged as (a price).  **9**  in relation to the expected norm of.  **10**  indicating the extent of (a distance) or the length of ( a period of time).  **11**  indicating an occasion in a series.

The most appropriate definitions of the word "for" in the context of subsection (5) would be the fourth and fifth definitions.  The definitions are of more relevance when read as part of the phrase in section 75A(5), "solely for the benefit of" as follows:

> "solely _having as a purpose or function_ the benefit of minor or dependent children"

> "solely _having as a reason or cause the benefit_ of minor or dependent children"

The word "sole", of which "solely" is a derivative, is defined in the _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ (10th ed) as meaning:

*   adj.  **1**  one and only.  **\>** belonging or restricted to one person or group.  **2**  archaic (especially of a woman) unmarried.  **\>** alone.

In _Ministry of Health v Fox_ \[1950\] 1 All ER 1050 the meaning of the words "solely for the purposes of that hospital" in section 7 of the National Health Services Act 1946 (UK) were interpreted in relation to the application of money by a trust towards a maternity home.  As the trustees were applying the funds and its income towards the maintenance and conduct of the maternity home, and for no other purpose, the funds were held to be employed "solely for the purposes of that hospital", in terms of section 7 of that Act.  This case was cited with approval in _Re Majoribanks Indenture_ \[1952\] 1 All ER 91, which was applied in _Re_ _Galloway, Hollins v AG_ \[1952\] 1 All ER 1379.

Therefore, from the preceding analysis, the word "solely" means something which belongs or is restricted to one person or group of persons.

Where the minor or dependent children of a marriage/civil union/relationship are the sole beneficiaries of a fixed trust, the disposition of property would be "for the benefit of" those children, as the purpose of the trust and the responsibilities of the trustees would be to apply the property "solely" for the benefit of those children, and they would likely receive a financial advantage.  Despite the trustees holding the legal interest in the property, the ultimate recipients of any benefit would be the children.  Such a disposition would be "solely" for their benefit because they would have a clear beneficial interest which could not be affected by another person.

The inclusion of the words "to the extent that" in subsection (5) indicates that the children do not have to be the sole beneficiaries of a fixed trust.  The words clearly anticipate apportionment and such would be easily done in the context of a fixed trust where the interests of each beneficiary are identifiable.

However, under a discretionary trust, it is not possible to identify the interests of the beneficiary until such time as the trustee exercises his or her discretion.  Where the only beneficiaries of the trust are the minor or dependent children of the marriage, civil union or relationship, and there is no ability for the trustees to add or substitute beneficiaries, such a disposition would be "solely for the benefit of" the children notwithstanding that their share is not quantifiable.  The subsection is concerned with ensuring that no one other than the parents and the children can benefit and, in a discretionary trust where _only_ the children can _ever_ benefit (even if not all of them actually do) the disposition would satisfy the requirements of the section.

There may appear to be an anomaly in section 75A(5) of the EGDA because of the differences in the application of the subsection in terms of dispositions to adults and dispositions in favour of children.  However, the text of section 75A(5) deliberately distinguishes between dispositions "to" and dispositions "for the benefit of" a person.  This would indicate that the text requires a direct disposition in the case of dispositions to a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner but accepts more indirect dispositions where children are concerned. 

The legislative history of the provision supports an interpretation that the subsection differentiates between the type of disposition that is acceptable in terms of adults, and the types of disposition that are acceptable in terms of dispositions to minor or dependent children.  The use of trusts was intended to be restricted to situations where the ultimate recipient of the property was a minor or dependent child, and a more direct disposition was required where the recipient was an adult.

There is case authority to the effect that a settlement on trust that would benefit not only the primary beneficiary but also her future children, came within the phrase "for the advancement or benefit ... of any person" ("any person" being the primary beneficiary).  In _IRC v Pilkington_ \[1964\] AC 612 the House of Lords held that a settlement on trust for an infant child would be to her benefit even if others (namely her future children) also benefited.  The decision referred to incidental benefits to other persons (unrelated third parties) that would also be considered to be "for the benefit of" the primary beneficiary.  The Commissioner considers that this analysis does not apply in respect of section 75A(5) because of the use of the word "solely" - the disposition of property must benefit _only_ the primary beneficiary and cannot benefit another person, either directly or indirectly.

### Conclusions

The exemption from gift duty contained in section 75A(5) of the EGDA is available in respect of the following dispositions:

*   A disposition to a spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner where the disposition of property is made directly to the person;  
    
*   A disposition directly to a minor or dependent child;  
    
*   A disposition to a fixed trust where the minor or dependent child or children receive a beneficial interest in the trust property.  Where there are other beneficiaries of such a trust, the interests of the children can be apportioned and be exempted from gift duty; and  
    
*   A disposition to a discretionary trust where:  
    

*   The closed class of beneficiaries includes **only** the minor or dependent children of the marriage/relationship,  
    
*   There are no other possible beneficiaries named or described (including default beneficiaries); and  
    
*   No ability exists for the trustee or some other person or persons to subsequently add further beneficiaries, or to resettle the trust in a way that adds further beneficiaries, unless the further beneficiaries are also minor or dependent children of the marriage/relationship.

The exemption is **not** available in the following situations:

*   The exemption is not available where the disposition of property is made to a fixed trust where the spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner is a named beneficiary.  If the minor or dependent children of the relationship are also named as beneficiaries of that fixed trust, the disposition is exempt to the extent that it is made for the benefit of those children.  
      
    
*   The exemption is not available where the disposition of property is made to a discretionary trust where the spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner or former spouse/civil union partner/de facto partner is a potential beneficiary.  
      
    

These conclusions differ from the previous published items because a disposition **to a fixed trust** where the spouse/de facto partner or former spouse/de facto partner is a named beneficiary is no longer considered to be exempt.  However, a disposition made to the same fixed trust "solely for the benefit of" minor or dependent children of the marriage/relationship can be apportioned and exempted from gift duty.  In addition, a disposition **to a discretionary trust** where the spouse/de facto partner or former spouse/de facto partner is a potential beneficiary as well as minor or dependent children of the marriage/relationship is not exempt from gift duty and no part of the disposition can be apportioned.

#### Submissions Received

Submissions received by Inland Revenue on an exposure draft of this item raised the issue of an apparent inconsistency between the treatment of a disposition to the trustee of a will following the death of a testator (which would be exempt from gift duty) and the treatment of an _inter vivos_ gift (which is subject to gift duty). 

When estate duty was abolished in 1992, the Government accepted that testamentary dispositions of property would not be subject to any kind of duty or tax.  Such dispositions have never been subject to gift duty and are expressly excluded from the definition of "gift" in the EGDA.  It was never intended that these two types of disposition be treated in the same way - when estate duty was abolished a decision was made by the Government to retain gift duty because it acts as a barrier to people gifting their assets to associated parties such as family trusts to avoid income tax and government assistance targeting and defeat creditors.

Some submissions received also referred to a number of Family Court decisions regarding the disposition of relationship property (for example _Ford v Ford_ (2001) 21 FRNZ 109 and _Re_ _Roberts' Application_ \[1994\] 1 NZLR 200).  These cases do not relate specifically to gift duty, nor do they discuss the gift duty implications of the dispositions involved.   The cases are therefore of limited value in the context of this item.

[Child Support Amendment Act 2006](/new-legislation/act-articles/child-support-amendment-act-2006 "Child Support Amendment Act 2006")

Exemption from liability
========================

2006 amendment introduces new exemptions from liability for child support for victims of sex offences, and a temporary exemption for liable parents under 16.

_Sections 85K and 85L of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Two new exemptions from liability for child support - a permanent exemption for victims of sex offences, and a temporary exemption for liable parents under the age of 16 years - have been incorporated into a new Part 5A. The new Part also restructures the previous provisions relating to exemptions, makes some remedial changes to them and includes new provisions for determinations that exemptions be set aside on application from the payee.

#### Background

Recent changes to provisions relating to sexual crimes in the Crimes Act 1961 highlighted the potential for victims of sexual crimes to become liable for child support when a child is born as a result.

The two most likely scenarios are:

*   A male, who is the victim of abuse by an older female, fathers a child as a result of the sexual act.
*   A female victim of abuse gives birth to a child as a result of the sexual act. She later has the child placed in foster care and becomes a liable parent in relation to the child.

In both cases an obligation to pay child support would be likely to add to the trauma already experienced by the victim.

Consideration of that specific issue was a catalyst for reconsidering the consequences for young people in general who become liable for child support at a time when their earning ability is limited through compulsory requirements for attendance at school. The reality is that if their parents do not help them to meet their obligations, they are likely to accumulate a debt that could ultimately act as a barrier to their successful transition into the workforce.

Allowing an exemption for young people does create some conflict with the rights of their children to receive financial support, particularly if the custodian is also under the age of 16 and consequently not eligible for income assistance. However, the exemption is only for a limited period and is considered to be in the long-term interests of both young parents and their children.

#### Key features

_Victims of sex offences_  
Subpart 4 of new Part 5A provides for exemption of the victim from liability for child support for a child born as a result of an offence under the relevant sections of the Crimes Act 1961. New section 89Z requires Inland Revenue to grant a permanent exemption when satisfied that the requirements for the exemption have been met.

Section 89ZA provides for the exemption to be withdrawn if a conviction is overturned on appeal, but allows a new application for exemption in the event of a new conviction at re-trial.

New sections 85K and 85L have been inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to information to be provided by the New Zealand Police and the Ministry of Justice for the purposes of this new exemption.

_Liable parents under age 16_  
Young people are exempt from child support liability until they reach the age 16 years, in accordance with new section 89E, subject to the same income criteria that apply to hospital patients and prisoners. That means they cannot have earned income, although they can receive investment income, such as interest on a bank account, up to the level of the current minimum amount of child support. They can apply for an exemption up until three months after they reach age 16 years.

The new exemptions will not preclude voluntary payments, nor will it be compulsory to apply for them.

_Remedial changes_  
Hospital patients can now apply for an exemption at any time up until three months after discharge.

When an exemption has retrospective effect Inland Revenue will not refund any payments made by the liable person. Such payments will be applied to past or future liability.

Because there are differences in the qualifying criteria, the new Part 5A provides separately for each category of exemption.

There are also a number of amendments to include new references as a consequence of the new Part 5A and related provisions.

_Transitional provisions_  
Sections 46 and 47 of the Amendment Act are transitional provisions relating to exemptions that had been applied for or were in place before its enactment.

#### Application date

The amendments apply from 26 September 2006.

Exemptions from the interest limitation rules
=============================================

If the interest limitation rules apply to your property, you may still be able to claim interest if you qualify for one of the following exemptions:

*   land business
*   property development
*   new build.

Exemption for land business
---------------------------

The land business exemption applies for interest relating to land if you hold that land as part of a: 

*   development
*   subdivision
*   land-dealing business
*   business of erecting buildings on land.

Interest relating to remediation work and other expenses from ownership and development of the land will also qualify if this exemption applies.

Exemption for other property development
----------------------------------------

If you do not qualify for the land business exemption, the development exemption applies for interest relating to land that you:

*   develop
*   subdivide, or
*   build on to create a new build.

You can only deduct interest if existing tax rules allow you to, even if you qualify for the exemption.

The exemption applies from the time you start developing the land and usually ends when you sell the land or are issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) for your new build. Once your new build receives its CCC, the new build exemption will apply instead.

Exemption for new builds
------------------------

Show all

New build definition

A new build is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under section 95 of the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020.

A new build is also a self-contained residence acquired off the plans that receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020 confirming it has been added to the land.

A place only qualifies as a new build if it is self-contained. This means the new build needs to contain its own cooking and bathroom facilities and have its own entrance. The entrance can be from a shared access way, for example, a hallway shared by a block of flats in the same building.

A new build does not have to be made of new material or constructed onsite, so it can include modular and relocated homes.

The following are new build examples. A self-contained dwelling:

*   added to bare land
*   added to land that has an existing dwelling on it, whether stand-alone or attached (apportionment will be required)
*   or multiple self-contained dwellings replacing an existing dwelling
*   converted from a commercial premises or a hotel/motel
*   part of a dwelling converted from a single dwelling.

An existing property can also qualify as a new build if it was:

*   previously on the earthquake-prone buildings register, but has been remediated and then removed from the register on or after 27 March 2020
*   has been at least 75% re-clad because of weathertightness issues and received a CCC for the re-clad on or after 27 March 2020.

Start date for the new build exemption

The new build exemption generally starts from the date a CCC is issued for a new build. For new builds purchased off the plan, the exemption starts from the date you entered into an agreement to purchase it. For motel and hotel conversions, the new build exemption starts from the date the local authority or building consent authority records indicate the conversion was complete.

Special rules also apply for hotel/motel conversions and for new builds that receive their CCC after a significant delay.

The exemption applies to anyone who owns the new build.

Apportionment for partial new build land

If interest relates to land with both a new build and a non-new build, then only part of the land is considered new build land. You need to apportion the interest between the new build land and the non-new build land. Only interest incurred in relation to the new build land qualifies for the exemption.

Use this calculator to help you work out how much interest is deductible in relation to the new build if apportionment is required.

Exercise of Court discretion to liquidate insolvent trustee company
===================================================================

2012 case note - exercise of Court discretion to liquidate insolvent trustee company – responsibilities of corporate trustees.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Newmarket Trustees Limited

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Companies Act 1993, Trustee Act 1956

### Summary

The Court of Appeal held that the Associate High Court Judge had exercised his discretion under section 241(4) of the Companies Act 1993 ("the Companies Act") on an erroneous basis. He overlooked the wider public interest considerations and well-established principles of trustee law, which meant that as a matter of principle, the respondent, as an insolvent trustee company, ought to have been put into liquidation.

### Impact of decision

This is an important decision as it clarifies the responsibilities of corporate trustees and also clarifies the matters to be taken into account when considering whether an insolvent corporate trustee should be put into liquidation.

This decision will inevitably be of interest to law firms that provide trustee services to their clients under a similar legal structure.

### Facts

Castle Brown (a law firm) established Newmarket Trustees Ltd ("Newmarket") to offer trustee services to its clients. It was a trustee of over 100 trusts. It did not have any beneficial interest in the trust assets nor did it own any other property.

Newmarket was a trustee of the Southern Lights Trust ("SLT") whose settlor, Mr Goh, was the other trustee of SLT and a client of Castle Brown.

The trustees of SLT had been default assessed for goods and services tax (GST) and income tax on assessable income derived from ten property transactions. Castle Brown was unaware of these assessments and they were not disputed. Mr Goh was adjudicated bankrupt in 2010.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) took steps to obtain payment of the $293,251.23 owing. In November 2009 a statutory demand was served on Newmarket under section 289 of the Companies Act. An application by Newmarket to set aside the statutory demand was dismissed and an order was made requiring Newmarket to pay the debt within 20 working days (_Newmarket Trustees Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,176 (HC)).

The debt was not paid and the Commissioner applied under section 241 of the Companies Act for an order for the liquidation of Newmarket. The High Court stayed the proceeding with the stay to be rescinded on the Commissioner meeting Newmarket's costs (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Newmarket Trustees Ltd_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,397 (HC)).

Following payment of the costs by the Commissioner, the application proceeded as a hearing of the liquidation application on the merits rather than as a stay application. Associate Judge Bell dismissed the Commissioner's application for the liquidation of Newmarket (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Newmarket Trustees Ltd_ (2011) 25 NZTC 20-030 (HC)). This decision was appealed by the Commissioner.

### Decision

The Commissioner in the appeal submitted that the High Court erred in:

1.  finding that the default assessments were potentially open to amendment and correction under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153;
2.  failing to take into account that Newmarket, as co-trustee of SLT, was jointly and severally liable for SLT's unpaid tax liability and not entitled to delegate payment of its tax liabilities to its co-trustee, Mr Goh;
3.  taking into account the costs of making alternative arrangements for other trusts of which Newmarket was trustee; and
4.  failing to recognise that wider public interest considerations of deterrence and removal of risk for Castle Brown's other trusts, as well as principles of trustee law, meant that Newmarket, as an insolvent trustee company, should be put into liquidation.

Newmarket submitted that the Associate Judge had correctly exercised the Court's unfettered discretion and that the Associate Judge had appropriately distinguished _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chester Trustee Services Ltd_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 395 (CA). Newmarket further submitted that the Associate Judge had not erred because:

1.  he accepted that the underlying tax debt was indisputable for the purpose of the liquidation proceeding;
2.  he correctly accepted that Newmarket was jointly and severally liable for the tax debts of SLT as this was the basis of his finding that a prima facie case had been made out; and
3.  he was entitled to take into account the impact that liquidation would have on the other trusts for which Newmarket acted as trustee. It was appropriate for the Court to have regard to the substantial work required and costs incurred in organising a replacement trustee.

The Court of Appeal accepted that the default assessments could not be challenged by Newmarket in this proceeding. However, this was not accepted as being a ground for overturning the decision of the High Court. The Court stated that there was an error of law, but noted that this was not a significant point in the High Court decision.

The Court of Appeal accepted Newmarket's submission that the Associate Judge correctly accepted that Newmarket was jointly and severally liable for the tax debts of SLT. This was the basis of his finding that a prima facie case had been made out.

The Court of Appeal further stated that Newmarket was not entitled to delegate payment of its tax liabilities to its co-trustee, Mr Goh. The Court noted the general rule that trustees may not delegate their duties or powers. This general rule against delegation extends to a prohibition on delegation to a co-trustee. The fundamental breaches by Newmarket of its trustee responsibilities and its failure to meet its tax liability, which led to its insolvency, ought to have been taken into account by the Associate Judge and he did not do so when he declined to exercise the Court's ultimate discretion.

The Court of Appeal noted that while it was not wrong for the Associate Judge to refer to the cost of making alternative arrangements, it overlooked the key point being that the end result was that Castle Brown's other trusts would be left with an insolvent trustee. The general policy of the Companies Act is that insolvent companies should be liquidated and there must be a good reason why in a particular case the insolvent company should not be put into liquidation.

The Court held that it was not satisfied that there was any sufficiently compelling ground of principle or justice to overcome the general policy of the Companies Act with regard to insolvent companies. However, the Court found there were good reasons why Newmarket should be put into liquidation, these being that:

1.  trusts should be properly administered and an insolvent trustee company is unfit to be a trustee; and
2.  the principles of trustee law, reflected in section 51(2) of the Trustee Act 1956, are that an insolvent trustee company should, as a general rule, almost invariably be put into liquidation. This would enable the Court to ensure that the trust is properly administered either by the liquidator or a replacement trustee.

The Court ultimately held the Associate Judge had wrongly exercised the discretion under section 241(4) of the Companies Act. He had overlooked the wider public interest considerations and well-established principles of trustee law, which meant, as a matter of principle, Newmarket as an insolvent trustee company ought to have been put into liquidation.

The Court of Appeal remitted that application for the appointment of a liquidator back to the High Court to make an appointment under section 241(4)(a) of the Companies Act.

Existing breeding business required before deductions allowable
===============================================================

2013 case note - High Court found breeding business must exist before deduction allowable - commencement of business, intention, bloodstock breeding.

Case

D and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in their challenge to the Commissioner's disallowance of deductions claimed for the cost of the colt by the plaintiffs as members of the syndicate. The High Court found a breeding business must be in existence before a deduction is allowable pursuant to section EC 39 of the Income Tax Act. An intention to have a breeding business at some time in the future did not meet the requirements of the section.

### Impact of decision

The judgment establishes that an existing breeding business is required before a taxpayer can claim deductions of bloodstock for breeding under section EC 39(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The judgment clarifies that carrying on a breeding business requires more than a hope or desire to use bloodstock for breeding in the future. In the absence of a commitment to a plan and a structure to establish a business, a speculative venture with a contingent intention to establish a breeding business will not be sufficient.

### Facts

The Te Akau Stallion Syndicate No 1 ("the syndicate") was formed in 2008 and its objectives were recorded in a syndicate agreement. It purchased a thoroughbred colt at the 2008 Karaka sale for $550,000.

The stud was to be trained and raced to earn money for the syndicate members and to increase its worth as a stud stallion. It did not trial in 2008 but trialled three times in 2009, making no income in either year. The temperament of the colt deteriorated, and in 2009 it was gelded.

In the tax years 2008 and 2009, each member of the syndicate claimed a deduction for their respective share of the syndicate loss, which was made up of expenditure incurred in relation to the colt and a 75% diminishing value write-down of the purchase price.

The Adjudication Unit allowed deductions for expenses incurred in relation to the colt. However, deductions for the cost of the colt were denied on the basis the syndicate was not in the business of breeding bloodstock pursuant to section EC 39(1).

Five syndicate members ("the plaintiffs") challenged the Commissioner's finding in relation to the deduction for the cost of the colt. They contended the syndicate bought the colt for use as a stud stallion, with the intention of using it in their breeding business and so were entitled to deductions under section EC 39(1)(c).

### Decision

#### _Was an existing breeding business a prerequisite for section EC 39(1)?_

To ascertain the meaning of section EC 39(1)(c), Judge Brewer canvassed the legislative history of the provision in accordance with section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999.

His Honour first considered the predecessor to section EC 39, section 86H of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 86H allowed deductions for bloodstock "used for breeding in the course of the conduct of any business of the taxpayer". He agreed with the Commissioner's submission that the application of section 86H required the taxpayer to first use the bloodstock for breeding "in the conduct of any business of the taxpayer". A taxpayer could not claim the value of bloodstock under section 89H if they were currently in the business of racing the bloodstock, with only an intention the bloodstock would be used for breeding in the future.

Judge Brewer then went on to consider the amendments to section 89H implemented by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1990 (No 3), the substantial re-enactment of the section in section EM 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and current form in the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007. His Honour noted there were no apparent changes in meaning between the 1994 and 2004 sections, and the 2004 and 2007 sections as supported by section YA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which confirmed the intention that the provisions would not change in effect between the earlier and later Acts.

His Honour agreed with the Commissioner's claim that the 1990 amendments to section 86H had extended the circumstances in which a taxpayer was entitled to make deductions for change in valuation of the bloodstock, but had not removed the requirement for a taxpayer to carry on a bloodstock breeding business. This was because the section expressly allowed deductions to be made in the business of breeding bloodstock in the 1994 Act and in the taxpayer's breeding business in the 2004 and current Acts. If the sections were intended to extend eligibility beyond breeding businesses, these words would be redundant.

Lastly, Judge Brewer looked at section EC 39(1)(a) and (b) to interpret subparagraph (c). All three subparagraphs allowed taxpayers to take the value of bloodstock into account in various circumstances, but in every instance this had to be "in their breeding business". This supported the conclusion that section EC 39(1)(c) allowed a taxpayer to write down the cost of bloodstock only when they had an existing breeding business.

The taxpayers alternatively argued that the scheme of the provisions focused on the identity of the taxpayer using the bloodstock, and so "their" in section EC 39(1) should be interpreted to draw a distinction between intended use of the bloodstock in the taxpayer's own business or in another taxpayer's breeding business. They claimed that because they had the intention of using the bloodstock in their breeding business, the requirements were met. His Honour dismissed this interpretation because it was incompatible with the legislative history of EC 39 and would significantly widen the application of EC 39.

#### _Was the syndicate carrying on a breeding business?_

While the finding for the Commissioner on the first issue was fatal to the plaintiff's case, Judge Brewer considered it would be of assistance to consider the second issue, particularly in light of the probability of an appeal by the unsuccessful party.

The taxpayers claimed that everything that was done to acquire the colt and train it was not exceptional in terms of breeding business models and consistent with it being part of a breeding business. They accepted the speculative nature of the venture, but argued this should not frustrate the intention of the taxpayers. They argued the legislative history showed a discernible move from a "use test" to an "intention to use test", and the "intention to use test" was for assessing when bloodstock became part of a breeding business, rather than when a breeding business commenced.

The Commissioner submitted that the activities carried on by the syndicate did not show an intention to engage in a business of breeding. While the colt was acquired as a potential stud stallion, this outcome was dependent on events. The activities that did occur were instead consistent with the raising and development of a racehorse. The future prospect of breeding the colt was a contingency plan, not an intention. The point at which the business would become a breeding business was when the stallion was standing at stud or at least marketed as a stud for breeding purposes. Because the colt was never advertised, marketed for present or future services or bred, no breeding business ever began.

His Honour accepted it was the intention of the syndicate to stand the colt at stud if it was feasible, but found it was an ideal outcome for the syndicate rather than a fixed intention. The acquisition and racing of the colt was preparatory to a breeding business, not the establishment of a breeding business. Buying bloodstock with an intention to stand it at stud in the future does not establish a breeding business. A speculative venture could be a breeding business, but it would require a commitment to a plan and structure to establish the business, rather than an objective that the bloodstock be developed so that a breeding business could come into fruition in the future.

Expenditure must be significantly in connection with determination of assessable income
=======================================================================================

2009 case note – Guidance on how section DJ(5)(a) should be interpreted - deduction, income tax, expenditure.

Case

TRA Decision Number 08/2009, TRA Number 023/2007

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

Taxpayer failed to establish that expenditure incurred was _significantly_ in connection with her determined assessable income and therefore were non-deductible under section DJ(5)(a).

### Impact of decision

This decision provides guidance on how section DJ(5)(a) should be interpreted.

### Facts

1.  This supplementary decision was issued pursuant to the "leave reserved" by Barber DCJ in his substantive decision issued on 14 January 2009.
2.  The substantive decision dealt with the disputant's challenge of the defendant's assessment of her income tax liability in the 2004 income tax year over the aspect of conversion of her income from social welfare benefits to ACC earnings related compensation, and receipt of residual backdated ACC lump sums.
3.  In his substantive decision, Barber DCJ, in relation to the deduction claimed for expenses incurred by the disputant in pursuing the issue, held the disputant had failed to establish that any expenditure was incurred by the disputant in the 2004 income tax year. Barber DCJ reserved leave for the disputant to provide further evidence in order to claim deductions.
4.  As a consequence of Barber DCJ reserving leave, the disputant applied for reimbursement of expenses. In her application, the disputant outlined the various Review Hearings she had brought against ACC in July 2003, August 2003, and February 2004.
5.  The disputant generally focussed on reasons for reimbursement of expenses totalling $3,706. The expenses claimed involved computer repairs in 2008 and 2009, postages over the years 2005 to 2009, photocopying over the years 2007 to 2009, obtaining copies of case law in 2005, inkjets over 2005 to 2008, and Court fees paid in 2005 and 2009.

### Decision

6.  Barber DCJ stated that the authority can only make a decision in respect of the deduction of expenditure for the 2004 income year. He found that no deduction was available to the disputant, because she had not discharged the onus on her to establish that any expenditure incurred in the 2004 income year was _principally_, if not _exclusively_, in connection with the determined assessable income. He suggested that it may be more appropriate to express the threshold as requiring expenditure to be _significantly_ in connection with the determined assessable income but found that the taxpayer also failed to establish that.
7.  Barber DCJ agreed with the Commissioner that the expenses and disbursements referred to by the disputant are not deductible in the 2004 income year because they were not incurred in that year, do not relate to that year, and do not satisfy the test of deductibility provided for in section DJ5(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994.
8.  Barber DCJ went on to say that the claimed expenditure did not have the necessary nexus with the determination of the disputant's assessable income. The expenditure is related to the disputant's successful efforts to be covered by ACC and receive ACC entitlements; not to determining her assessable income. She unsuccessfully sought costs from ACC Reviewers.
9.  Barber DCJ noted that there could have been expenditure incurred by the disputant which may be deductible and reserved leave for the disputant to adduce clear evidence of that expenditure and its character and purpose.

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Expenditure on overseas R&D (section LH 6)
==========================================

2007 legislation covers the eligibility for tax credits of research and development activities carried out overseas.

Expenditure on R&D activities carried out overseas is not eligible for the tax credit unless it is part of a project based in New Zealand, and meets the definition of overseas eligible expenditure.

Subsection (1) excludes expenditure or an amount of depreciation loss on R&D performed overseas unless it is part of a R&D project. "Research and development project" is defined in subsection 4. (See discussion below.)

Subsection (2) excludes expenditure or an amount of depreciation loss on R&D performed outside New Zealand as part of a R&D project, unless it is overseas eligible expenditure.

A "research and development project" is defined in subsection (4) and means a process:

*   consisting of co-ordinated R&D activities controlled by the business;
*   having start and finish dates;
*   undertaken collectively to achieve a specified objective within constraints of time, cost and other resources;
*   for which the business bears the financial risk and effectively owns the results, if any; and
*   for which the business incurs on R&D activities performed in New Zealand more than half of the total amount of expenditure and depreciation loss that would be eligible expenditure under section LH 4 in the absence of subsection (2).

For an R&D project to exist, more than half of the expenditure that would be eligible under section LH 4 must be incurred on R&D activities performed in New Zealand. If that is not the case, then the expenditure incurred on activities performed outside New Zealand will not be eligible for the credit. However, the expenditure incurred in New Zealand will still be eligible.

"Overseas eligible expenditure" is defined in subsection(5). The expenditure must be:

*   expenditure that would be eligible under section LH 4 (in the absence of a restriction on overseas R&D);
*   incurred on R&D performed outside New Zealand in or after the 2008-09 income year; and
*   limited to 10 percent of the total eligible expenditure incurred in New Zealand in or after the 2008-09 year as part of the same R&D project.

The 10 percent rule applies over the life of the project. Therefore, eligible expenditure incurred on R&D activities performed overseas can be carried forward until sufficient local eligible expenditure is incurred on the same project. Similarly, the eligible overseas expenditure can be incurred in years subsequent to years in which the eligible local expenditure is incurred.

"New Zealand" is defined in section YA 1.

##### Example 1

Company A performs eligible R&D activities. The activities are carried out over three years, starting in the 2008-09 income year. Some of the activity is carried out in New Zealand, and some is done in Australia.

In the first year, the company spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $15,000 on eligible expenditure in Australia. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to $110,000 of expenditure. This is made up of $100,000 of local expenditure + $10,000 Australian expenditure. The remaining $5,000 of Australian expenditure has to be carried forward until there is sufficient eligible local expenditure to claim the credit.

In the second year of the project, the company spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $2,000 on eligible expenditure in Australia. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to $107,000 of expenditure, made up of $100,000 local expenditure + $5,000 Australian expenditure carried forward from the previous year + $2,000 Australian expenditure from the current year.

In the third year, the company has no eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $40,000 of eligible expenditure in Australia. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to $3,000 of expenditure, made up of $3,000 of Australian expenditure, for which sufficient local expenditure was incurred in the previous year and the resulting entitlement carried over to this year.

##### Example 2

Company B performs R&D activities which are carried out over three years, starting in the 2007-08 income year. Some of the activity is carried out in New Zealand, and some is done in Brazil.

In the 2007-08 year, the company spends $100,000 in New Zealand and $15,000 in Brazil. The company is not entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to any of expenditure because the R&D is done before the credit is in effect.

In the second year, the company spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $15,000 on eligible expenditure in Brazil on the same R&D project. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit for $110,000 of expenditure, made up of $100,000 local expenditure + $10,000 Brazilian expenditure.

In the third year, the company spends $20,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $200,000 on eligible expenditure on the same project in Brazil. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to the $20,000 of New Zealand expenditure for that year.

However, the project no longer comes within the definition of an R&D project (because more eligible expenditure has being incurred in Brazil than in New Zealand in or after the 2008-09 income year) and therefore the company must revise its tax credit claim for the previous year and pay back the credit for the Brazilian expenditure incurred in that year.

Ngā tūtohi utu tautoko tamaiti Child support expenditure tables
===============================================================

The income ranges are based on average weekly earnings for the June quarter of the previous child support year.

We use the average weekly earnings provided by Statistics New Zealand to create an annual figure.

Expenditure tables for 2025
---------------------------

The tables below are based on the June 2023 average weekly earnings.

To calculate per child expenditure values when there are at least 2 children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age groups first use the 12 and under table using the total number of children then dividing the result by the number of children. This gives a per child expenditure value for each child aged 12 and under.

Next use the 13 and over table again using the total number of children then dividing the result by the number of children. This gives a per child expenditure value for each child aged 13 and over.

Children aged 12 and under

Expense items in the Table of Depreciation Rates
================================================

Determination lists 'expense items' being removed from the Table of Depreciation Rates and the depreciation determinations in which they appear.

The Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates ('the Table') lists general economic depreciation rates and provisional depreciation rates set by the Commissioner. The Table, set out in industry and asset categories, is compiled from Tax Depreciation Determinations issued by the Commissioner.

Several of these determinations include items of property where the Commissioner has not set an estimated useful life and has included the word "expense" in the Diminishing Value Rate and the Straight Line Rate columns. For example in Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1, in the "Contractors, Builders and Quarrying" industry category items such as "Abrasive cutting wheels", "Drilling bits (except as shown) and similar tooling", "Drop sheets", and "Grinding wheels" are listed as "expense".

These items were included in the determinations for completeness. However, there is no legislative basis for non-capital items to be included in determinations. Consequently, to ensure that the Table is correct in terms of the legislation, these items are being removed from the Table as indicated below. The Commissioner stresses that correcting the Table by removing these expense items does not affect the income tax treatment of their cost. They will continue to be fully deductible, subject to the usual deductibility tests that require a sufficient connection with an income earning activity or business.

The items are being removed from the Table for one (or more) of the following reasons as noted in the attached table:

1.  They are consumables and fully deductible for income tax purposes (c), or
2.  the replacement of these items, when they are part of a larger item, would qualify as repairs and maintenance (r), or
3.  the items are no longer in general use in the respective industries (n).

Note that if the "replacement" items in number 2 are first purchased as part of a larger capital asset, their cost will generally be included in the cost of the larger item and depreciated at the rate set for that larger item. In such cases the item is only expensed when it is later replaced.

There may possibly be some items of property that are currently shown as "expense" that taxpayers may consider are depreciable property for which an economic depreciation rate should be set. To apply to the Commissioner for a provisional depreciation rate, download the [Application for a provisional depreciation rate](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/title/forms-a/ir260a-form-provisional-depreciation.html)
 form.

### "Expense items" being removed from the Table that are included in the following Tax Depreciation Rates Determinations

Items will still be fully deductible for income tax purposes as "consumables" under general accounting principles.

**\***The Commissioner is considering whether to update the "Computer" asset category in view of the length of time since the depreciation rates for this industry were set (1992) and the advancement in technology since then. If the update proceeds, the Commissioner will be consulting with the industry and, before any new rates (if any) are set, all taxpayers will have the opportunity to comment through the Department's public consultative process.

Business expenses are broken down into 3 different types.

Revenue expenses.

These help the business run day to day.

For example, office supplies, rent or lease payments.

Capital expenses.

These are generally related to assets purchased for the business, and last longer than the financial year.

For example a courier drivers van.

There are also some expenses that are non-deductible, such as parking tickets.

Vehicle expenses

Sole Trader or Partnership

Three ways to work out expenses.

*   Use a logbook  
    Minimum 3 months (90 consecutive days)  
    Every 3 years, or more often if the percent changes by 20 percent
*   Claim kilometre rates
*   Claim up to 25 percent of vehicle expenses

#### Audio

**Narrator**

For most new businesses one of the biggest expenses are vehicle related.

We're going to look at 2 different scenarios, depending on the business structure.

Both at the end of the day take into account private and business use, it’s just the process which is different.

Firstly, we are going to look at a sole trader or partnership, then move onto a company.

For a sole trader or partnership there are two ways of calculating vehicle expenses.

To determine a business to private use percentage, you can use a logbook for a 90 consecutive day period.

You are then able to use the percentage outcome for a 3-year period, unless your usage changes by plus or minus 20 percent, then a new logbook will be required.

Most new business will find their vehicle usage changes as their business grows.

Alternatively, you can keep a track of actual kilometres travelled for business, and use a set rate which is published by Inland Revenue.

You will need to know you start and end of year odometer reading as well, to work out your private and business use.

If you do not keep the records needed to substantiate your vehicle expenses claim, then this claim can be limited to 25 percent, or less, if that is more reasonable or evidenced.

This is known as the default rate.

It is not a third option.

If you do not keep a logbook or record of your kilometres, then you run the risk of having your vehicle expenses limited.

Which, for many businesses, will not a be true reflection of the actual costs incurred to the business, and may mean you end up paying more in tax in the long run.

If you opt for the logbook option, you'll need to keep all receipts to do with the vehicle.

For example, all fuel receipts, insurance, repairs, and maintenance, as you’ll tally-up all of these at the year end and claim the percentage as per the logbook.

This will create your vehicle expense figure, in your end of year return.

A logbook Excel template can also be found on our website.

Search logbook and select use a logbook.

The logbook download is found at the bottom of the page.

Let's now look at how we would apply the kilometre rate.

* * *

#### Visual

Vehicle expenses – example

Kilometre rate

The vehicle logbook for the 2019-2020 year shows 60 percent business use and there was a total of 20,000 kilometres travelled.

Example of using the kilometre rate for 20,000 kilometres of travel

| Distance multiplied by Rate multiplied by Business use equals expense |
| --- |
| 14,000 multiplied by 79 cents, multiplied by 60 percent, equals 6,636 |
| 6,000 multiplied by 30 cents, multiplied by 60 percent, equals 1,080 |
| Total deduction equals 7,716.00 dollars |

#### Audio

**Narrator**

In this example, the vehicle has travelled 20,000 kilometres for the year and was used 60 percent for business.

As per the current rates set by IR, the first 14,000 kilometres is set at 79 cents per kilometre, and the remaining 6,000 kilometres is set a 30 cents per kilometre.

We take 60 percent of these values as this is the business portion.

Using this example, your vehicle expense in your end of year calculations would be 7,716 dollars.

I’ll give you a few moments to look at the calculation.

Vehicle expenses

Company owned business vehicle

Worked out differently.

*   Claim all expenses without making private use adjustment
*   Logbook not required
*   Liable for fringe benefit tax (FBT) if the vehicle is available for private use

#### Audio

**Narrator**

As mentioned earlier the, vehicle expense calculation for a company is different due to its structure.

A company would claim the expenses in full that relate to a company owned vehicle, therefore, no logbook is required.

Any availability for private use will be accounted for, under the fringe benefit tax regime.

Home office – option one

Actual costs (floor area calculation)

An example showing an area of 6 square metres is being used as home office space in a 100 square metre house.

Claim 6 percent of:

*   Rent
*   Power
*   House insurance
*   Mortgage interest
*   Rates
*   Contents insurance

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Some small businesses run from home.

We therefore need to take into account that some of the expenses associated with the home, are incurred in the running of the business.

This is often referred to as the home office expense.

There are 2 ways of calculating home office expenses, actual cost, and the square meter rate.

Let’s look at the actual cost option.

You’ll need to determine the total area of your home.

You may already know this, or you may need to do a measurement of the exterior.

We then need to determine the area that is used for business.

This may be part of the garage if it’s used for storage, and maybe your guest room it its set up solely as an office.

If your space is used for business and part for another activity, we are only taking into account the area used for business.

In this example, the total area of the home is a hundred square metres, and the area used for the office is 6 square metres.

This equates to 6 percent of the home being used for business.

You need to keep all receipts and invoices associated with the home.

For example, rent, power, house and contents insurance.

If you own the home, you will need to know the interest paid on your mortgage.

Six percent of all these things will be your home office expenses in your end of year return.

Remember to keep all of your workings, just in case.

And if you move, you’ll need to redo these calculations.

Let’s look at option 2.

* * *

#### Visual

Home office – option two

Square metre rate

Add together your:

*   Premises cost  
    (mortgage interest/rent plus rates) multiplied by office percent
*   Utilities cost  
    Standard rate per square metre multiplied by office area

Example of using the square metre rate for a home office that is 6 percent of a house’s floor area

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Premises cost | 26,000 multiplied by 6 percent equals 1,560 |
| Utilities cost | 42.75 multiplied by 6 (for the metres squared) equals 256.50 |
| Total cost | 1,816.50 dollars |

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Option 2 is known as the square meter rate.

We still need to determine your premises costs, as these depend on your own situation.

IR have determined a utility cost set rate that you can apply instead of keeping all of your receipts and invoices.

The premises cost is determined by adding together your mortgage interest, or rent cost, plus rates.

We then multiply this figure by the percentage area of the home office.

We then need to determine the utilities cost, which is the square meterage of the home, multiplied by the set utility cost of 42 dollars 75.

We then add these 2 figures together to determine the home office expense using the square meterage rate.

I’ll give you a few moments to look at the calculation.

Let’s move on to other typical business expenses.

#### Visual

Typical business expenses

*   Telephone and internet
*   Travel and accommodation
*   ACC levies
*   Insurance
*   Salary and wages
*   Entertainment
*   Website
*   Advertising
*   Interest
*   Special clothing

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Our tax system in New Zealand is based on self-assessment and honesty.

These are some common examples.

If you have a home line you can claim 50 percent of telephone rental, plus any business toll or mobile calls.

You’ll need to keep your bill and identify the business-related calls if your home is the centre of operations.

Mobile phones are more common these days.

If your mobile is prepay, you’ll need to determine a reasonable percentage.

You may wish to jot down some of this reasoning when you’re determining this.

Keep this with your records, just in case we ever ask how you came up with this.

If you’re on a plan, then the business calls are fully deductible.

It is common for your home line and internet broadband, or mobile to be part of a package deal, you’ll need to determine a reasonable percentage that is used for business.

Entertainment expenses are limited to either a 50 percent or 100 percent claim.

This depends on what type of entertainment, and where the entertainment is happening.

I suggest reading the, Entertainment guide, IR268, before you start wining and dining.

If you need to go away for work, then travel and accommodation expenses are fully deductible.

If you decide to stay on for some personal time, then the cost associated to these days are personal, and cannot be claimed as a business expense.

Note, that this includes a reduced claim for any airfares as well.

A website is a capital asset, and the costs must be capitalised and depreciated if the cost exceeds the threshold.

Ongoing costs of updating or adding to the information on a website are a revenue expense.

All business will be charged an ACC levy that cover any workplace accidents.

These levies are risk based, so vary from industry to industry.

They are a deductible business expense in the year which they are paid.

Any insurance is fully deductible if specifically related to business, for example public liability insurance.

Any interest on money borrowed for a business is an expense.

So are the gross wages paid to any employees.

Any clothing which has the business logo, or is protective in nature, like, safety gear, hard hats, wet weather gear, is considered a business expense as well.

Depreciation

*   Asset register
*   Depreciation rates
*   Straight line method
*   Diminishing value method
*   Pooling assets

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Depreciation is a method of deducting the cost of an asset over its useful life.

There have been some changes to depreciation due to COVID-19.

One most significant for business was the increase in the, low value asset threshold, until 16 March 2020.

If an asset was under 500 dollars, then it was claimed in full in the year of purchase, it was not depreciated, even though it may meet the definition of an asset.

For the period 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021 this limit has increased to 5,000 dollars.

From 17 March 2021 onwards, this limit is reducing to 1,000 dollars.

Depreciation can seem complex at first.

There are some really useful tools on our website, like the depreciation rate finder and calculator which are designed to do all the hard work.

You simply answer the questions and it will produce a schedule of amounts to be claimed in each year.

You will need to keep an asset register.

This is also very useful for insurance purposes.

It’s simply a list of assets the business owns, when they were purchased, and how much they were purchased for.

Depreciation rates are set by Inland Revenue.

They vary depending on the useful life of an item.

For example a car, it’s expected to last longer, than an angle grinder.

There are 2 different ways of calculating depreciation.

Straight line is when you claim the same amount each year, until it has an nil book value.

Diminishing value is when you claim the same percentage of the book value each year, as the book value of the assets goes down, so does the depreciation claim each year.

It’s possible for an asset to have a book value of nil, but still be used in the business.

Pooling refers to grouping a number of assets together to do one depreciation calculation, instead of a calculation for each asset.

Each asset must have a value of 5,000 dollars or less, and you must use the diminishing value method.

Also, if the assets you pool, or group together, have different depreciation rates, you must use the lowest rate for all of the assets in the pool.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2012 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012")

Extending pay-period assessments to the salaries and wages of all borrowers
===========================================================================

2012 legislation relates to extending the pay-period assessment for salary and wage deductions of all student loan borrowers, regardless of the income they derive.

_**Sections 4, 42(1), 54(1), 90, 91, 119(2), and section 125 (repealed)**_

### Background

Pay-period assessments were introduced in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and are a significant simplification measure, removing the need for the annual square-up assessment for most borrowers' salary and wage earnings. Pay-period assessments focus on ensuring correct repayment deductions are made at source.

Previously, borrowers with salary and wages who also had business income would continue to receive an annual square-up because they could offset losses against their salary and wages.

As a consequence of denying the ability to offset losses in the new legislation, there is no longer the need to "ring fence" borrowers with sources of income other than salary and wages from the pay-period assessment policy. Therefore, extending the pay-period assessment to salary and wage deductions of all borrowers, regardless of the income they derive, required a number of consequential amendments to the 2011 Act.

### Application date

These amendments apply from 1 April 2012.

### Detailed analysis

Sections 90 and 91 have been repealed and replaced with new sections 90 and 91. The new sections change the way the repayment obligation is calculated for borrowers with "other income" so that salary and wage earnings are excluded.

Section 90 applies when a borrower has other income and any salary or wages are below the annual repayment threshold. The formula calculates the borrower's repayment obligation by applying the repayment percentage to however much of the person's other income is over the annual repayment threshold after taking their salary or wages into account.

Section 91 applies when a borrower has other income and any salary or wages are equal to or above the annual repayment threshold. The formula calculates the repayment obligation by applying the repayment percentage to the borrower's other income as their salary or wages are already above the annual repayment threshold. The borrower's salary or wages and student loan repayment deductions are excluded from the formula, reflecting that student loan repayment deductions are based on a pay-period assessment.

Section 42 has been amended to give borrowers with "other income" access to the procedure by which any unused repayment threshold from a borrower's primary employment earnings can be allocated to the borrower's secondary employment earnings. Borrowers with "other income" were denied the ability to apply for any unused repayment threshold to be allocated to secondary employment earnings because these borrowers could rely on the annual end-of-year square-up to address any over- or under-deductions with their secondary employment earnings.

Section 54 ensures that full-time students who earn income over the threshold for a short period of time are exempted from salary or wage deductions, as their annual income would be below the repayment threshold. The amendment gives borrowers with "other income" access to this process by notifying the Commissioner in a declaration. Previously borrowers with "other income" could rely on the end-of-year square-up to ensure that deductions were made only on income earned over the threshold.

Section 125 ensures that borrowers who would have been eligible for the excess repayment bonus of 10% but for an error made by their employer, are not disadvantaged. As a borrower's repayment deductions are now based on a pay-period assessment, employer errors will no longer have this effect. Therefore this section is no longer necessary and has been repealed. Sections 118 and 129(2) have been amended as a consequence of repealing section 125.

The definition of "significant over-deduction" has been amended to ensure that over-deductions can be refunded to borrowers with other income. Previously, borrowers with other income could rely on the end-of-year square-up to receive any refund due to a significant over-deduction.

As a consequence of extending the pay-period assessment policy to all salary and wage earnings, section 119(2)(a)(ii) has been repealed. Borrowers who earn "other income" no longer need to have their salary and wage deductions treated differently when determining if a borrower has made an excess repayment for a tax year.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

Extending the amnesty on student loan penalites
===============================================

2007 legislation extends the amnesty on student loan penalties until 31 March 2008.

##### Sections 2 and 89 to 105 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

The amnesty on student loan penalties has been extended until 31 March 2008.

### Background

An amnesty on student loan penalties was introduced by the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2005. The amnesty allowed non-resident borrowers in arrears the chance of a fresh start by having their penalties cancelled. The amnesty was introduced to remove barriers to borrowers returning to New Zealand.

### Key features

The amnesty on student loan penalties has been extended by one year, until 31 March 2008. This will allow borrowers identified as non-resident as a result of the information match with Customs the chance of a fresh start. The old amnesty provisions (sections 45A to 45D and section 66A of the Act) have been repealed.

#### Fresh start for certain non-resident borrowers

Under section 90, the Commissioner is not obliged to issue a non-resident repayment obligation for any period before 1 April 2007 if it has not already been made.

Section 91 provides that any existing repayment obligations (whether resident, non-resident, assessed or not assessed) and penalties will be cancelled. The section applies to borrowers who were non-resident for tax purposes on 31 March 2006 and who were in arrears on all or part of a repayment obligation on 1April 2007. However, the amount cancelled is still subject to compounding interest at the applicable rate(s) from the date that the repayments were (or would have been) due, and remains part of the loan balance.

The effect of the amendments is to wipe the penalties slate clean for borrowers who were non-resident on 31 March 2006. For borrowers who were resident on 31 March 2006, but who were non-resident at any time before that date, Inland Revenue will not issue any non-resident assessment if not already made.

**Example 1**  
  
Lenore has a loan balance on 1 April 2005 of $15,000. Lenore was issued with non-resident assessments of $1,997 for the 2005-06 tax year and $1,919 for the 2006-07 tax year, which she has failed to pay. The 2005-06 assessment ceased to be subject to standard interest (7% for the 2005-06 tax year) and instead became subject to compounding late payment penalties of 2% per month from 1 April 2006. The 2006-07 assessment ceased to become subject to standard interest (6.9% for the 2006-07 tax year) 1 year later on 1 April 2007. Her total late payment penalties on 31 March 2007 are $536 and her loan balance is $17,555. On 1 April 2007 her overdue debt is reduced to zero and her loan balance is reduced by $398 (penalties of $536 less interest of $138 charged in place of penalties) to $17,157.  
**Example 2**  
  
Keith left New Zealand on 31 March 2005 with a loan balance of $20,000. Inland Revenue was not aware that Keith was a non-resident and therefore did not issue non-resident assessments while Keith was overseas. After 1 April 2007, Inland Revenue becomes aware that Keith is non-resident and has been since 1 April 2005. Inland Revenue is not required to make non-resident repayment obligation assessments for tax years before 1 April 2007. Keith has not made any repayments while overseas and his loan balance is $22,877 on 1 April 2007, including compounding interest.

#### New amnesty

In exchange for not establishing or removing penalties under the "fresh start for certain non-resident borrowers" provisions, borrowers will have the chance to apply to Inland Revenue for the new amnesty and begin making regular payments. Borrowers will have from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 to apply to come within the amnesty.

##### Who does it apply to?

Section 92 of the Act specifies that the new amnesty applies only to borrowers who were:

*   non-resident for tax purposes on 31 March 2006; and
*   in arrears on all or part of a repayment obligation on 1 April 2007.

Section 92 also specifies that the accounts of borrowers who had repaid their loans by 13 November 2006 will not be adjusted, although the borrowers concerned might technically have been in arrears.

##### Meeting repayment requirements

Sections 94 to 98 set out the repayment requirements for borrowers who come within the amnesty. Borrowers must give an undertaking to repay, and actually pay the following amount, to the Commissioner:

*   $2,000, if the borrower's loan balance on the date they apply for the amnesty is $15,000 or less;
*   $4,000, if the borrower's loan balance on the date they apply for the amnesty is $15,001 to $30,000; or
*   $6,000, if the borrower's loan balance on the date they apply for the amnesty is more than $30,000.

###### Borrowers who apply for the amnesty between 1 April 2007 and 31 August 2007

For borrowers who apply for the amnesty between 1 April 2007 and 31 August 2007, the payments must be made in four equal instalments and will be due on 30 September 2007, 31 March 2008, 30 September 2008 and 31 March 2009.

The amount payable applies instead of:

*   any overseas-based repayment obligation to which the borrower would otherwise be liable, if the amount is received by the Commissioner in the tax year ending 31 March 2008 or 31 March 2009; and
*   any repayment holiday the borrower may have during the tax years ending 31 March 2008 or 31 March 2009.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Example**  <br>  <br>Kirsty applies for the amnesty on 6 April 2007. Her loan balance on that date is $25,000. To meet the amnesty conditions, Kirsty must make repayments as follows: |     |
| 30 September 2007 | $1,000 |
| 31 March 2008 | $1,000 |
| 30 September 2008 | $1,000 |
| 31 March 2009 | $1,000 |
| These repayment requirements apply instead of any overseas-based repayment obligation or repayment holiday Kirsty would have otherwise been entitled to. |     |

###### Borrowers who apply for the amnesty between 1 September 2007 and 29 February 2008

For borrowers who apply for the amnesty between 1 September 2007 and 29 February 2008, the payments must be made in four equal instalments and are due on 31 March 2008, 30 September 2008, 31 March 2009 and 30 September 2009.

The amount payable applies instead of:

*   any overseas-based repayment obligation the borrower may otherwise have for the tax years ending 31 March 2008 or 31 March 2009; and
*   is offset against any overseas-based repayment obligation the borrower may have for the tax year ending 31 March 2010; and
*   any repayment holiday the borrower may have during the tax years ending 31 March 2008 or 31 March 2009.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Example**  <br>  <br>Fran applies for the amnesty on 10 February 2008. Her loan balance on that date is $7,000. To meet the amnesty conditions Fran must make repayments as follows: |     |
| 31 March 2008 | $500 |
| 30 September 2008 | $500 |
| 31 March 2009 | $500 |
| 30 September 2009 | $500 |
| The payments due in 2008 and 2009 apply instead of any overseas-based repayment obligation or repayment holiday Fran would otherwise be entitled to. |     |

###### Borrowers who apply for the amnesty in March 2008

For borrowers who apply for the amnesty in March 2008, the payments must be made in four equal instalments and are due on 30 September 2008, 31 March 2009, 30 September 2009 and 31 March 2010.

The amount payable applies instead of:

*   any overseas-based repayment obligation the borrower may have for the tax years ending 31 March 2009 or 31 March 2010; and
*   any repayment holiday the borrower may have during the tax year ending 31 March 2009.

For the tax year ending 31 March 2008, the borrower's repayment obligation is reduced to zero.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Example**  <br>  <br>Nicolas applies for the amnesty on 10 March 2008. His loan balance on that date is $48,000. To meet the amnesty conditions, Nicolas must make repayments as follows: |     |
| 30 September 2008 | $1,500 |
| 31 March 2009 | $1,500 |
| 30 September 2009 | $1,500 |
| 31 March 2010 | $1,500 |
| The payments due in 2008 and 2009 apply instead of any overseas-based repayment obligation or repayment holiday Nicolas would otherwise be entitled to. The payment in 2010 is offset against his repayment obligation (if any) for that year. |     |

#### Hardship

Section 98 enables the Commissioner to reduce a payment instalment if the Commissioner is satisfied the reduction is necessary to alleviate significant financial hardship. Significant financial hardship includes difficulties that arise because of:

*   the borrower's inability to meet minimum living expenses;
*   their inability to carry out their usual occupation because of illness, injury or disability;
*   their inability to meet mortgage repayments on their primary residence, resulting in the mortgagee seeking to enforce the mortgage on the residence;
*   the cost of modifying a residence to meet special needs arising from a borrower's disability or a dependant's disability;
*   the cost of medical treatment for a borrower's illness or injury or a dependant's illness or injury;
*   the cost of palliative care for a borrower or their dependant; or
*   the cost of a funeral for a borrower's deceased dependant.

**Example**  
  
Nicolas (as outlined in the example above) could not afford to make the full $1,500 payment in 2008 because he had been in hospital for six weeks and was not earning any income during that period. The Commissioner reduces the instalment amount to $600, which Nicolas can afford to repay. Nicolas is still required to repay $1,500 for every other instalment, as the financial hardship was only temporary.

##### Relationship with New Zealand-based repayment obligations

Section 99 enables the amount a borrower pays to meet their amnesty repayment requirements to be offset against any New Zealand-based repayment obligations.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Example**  <br>  <br>Maria applied for the amnesty in June 2007 and was required to repay the following amounts: |     |
| 30 September 2007 | $500 |
| 31 March 2008 | $500 |
| 30 September 2008 | $500 |
| 31 March 2009 | $500 |
| Maria returns to New Zealand on 20 April 2008. Her New Zealand-based repayment obligation for the 2008-09 tax year is $2,050. All of her repayments while she is in New Zealand are made by deductions from her salary. The repayment deductions are more than enough to meet her amnesty repayment requirements. |     |

##### People who applied for old amnesty

If a person applied for the old amnesty (before 1 April 2007) they must meet the repayment requirements outlined above. However, under section 100, the Commissioner can give credit for the extent to which the borrower complied with the conditions of the old amnesty.

**Example**  
  
Bob applied for the old amnesty in April 2006 and met his repayment obligations for the 2006 tax year. Under the new amnesty, Bob is required to repay $4,000 in four six-monthly instalments. The Commissioner gives Bob credit for meeting the old amnesty conditions for a 12-month period, and Bob is required to meet the new amnesty conditions for a further 12-month period. Bob's new amnesty repayment requirement is $2,000, payable in two six-monthly instalments of $1,000 due on 30 September 2007 and 31 March 2008.

##### What happens if the amnesty condition is breached?

Under section 102, the first breach of the amnesty conditions, the Commissioner must give the borrower written notice of:

*   the breach that has occurred;
*   the action that must be taken by the borrower to remedy that breach;
*   the date by which the breach must be remedied, which is 30 days after the date of the Commissioner's notice; and
*   the fact that the Commissioner is exercising a discretion that can be used only once in relation to that borrower.

If the borrower remedies the breach according to the terms in the Commissioner's notice, the Commissioner must treat the borrower as having met the obligations outlined above.

A borrower may object under section 104 to a Commissioner's decision not to treat the borrower as having met their obligations on the ground that the decision is erroneous.

##### Increase to loan balance if borrower does not come under amnesty or amnesty condition breached

Under section 103, if a borrower does not apply for the amnesty before 1 April 2008, the borrower's loan balance will be increased by an amount equal to five percent of the borrower's loan balance on 31 March 2008, including any interest compounded by that date.

If the Commissioner considers, however, that the five percent penalty would be more than the late payment penalties that would have been charged if not for the "fresh start for certain non-resident borrowers" provisions, the Commissioner may reduce the amount added to the borrower's loan balance to an amount the Commissioner considers fair and reasonable. The intention is for the increase to the loan balance to be the lesser of five percent or the penalties that would have been charged if not for the "fresh start for certain borrowers" provisions.

If the borrower comes within the amnesty but fails to meet the repayment requirements, the borrower's loan balance will be increased on 31 March as outlined above, but the amount added to the loan balance will be reduced in proportion to the degree of the breach.

Under section 104, a borrower may object to the Commissioner's decision to increase the borrower's loan balance on the grounds that the decision is erroneous.

**Example 1**  
  
Christian was a non-resident on 31 March 2006 and was in arrears. Christian does not apply for the old or the new amnesty, and on 31 March 2008 his loan balance is $41,000 (including interest compounded as at that date). On 1 April 2008 his loan balance will be increased by $2,050 (5%). His new loan balance is $43,050.  
**Example 2**  
  
Charlotte was a non-resident on 31 March 2006 and was in arrears. Charlotte does not apply for the old or the new amnesty and on 31 March 2008 her loan balance is $6,000 (including interest compounded as at that date). Because a 5% increase in Charlotte's loan balance is greater than the penalties that would have been charged if not for the "fresh start for certain non-resident borrowers" provisions, Charlotte's loan balance is increased by the amount of the penalties that would otherwise have been charged. As a result, on 1 April 2008 Charlotte's loan balance is increased by $260, to $6,260.  
**Example 3**  
  
Michael was a non-resident on 31 March 2006 and was in arrears. He applied for the new amnesty on 1 December 2007 and met the first three $1,000 repayments required but failed to meet the last one, even after notification by the Commissioner, and being given 30 days to remedy the breach. On 31 March 2008 his loan balance is $12,000 (including interest compounded as at that date). Because Michael met three-quarters of the instalments required, his loan balance is increased by (5% x ¾). As a result, on 1 April 2008 his loan balance is increased by $450, to $12,450.

### Application date

The changes applied on or after 1 April 2007.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

Extending the thin-cap rules to active and Australian FIFs
==========================================================

Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 - extending the thin capitalisation rules to active and Australian foreign investment funds.

_Subsections FE 1(1)(a), FE 2(1)(e) and FE 3(2)(b), and sections FE 5(1C) and FE 16(1B)_

The Act modifies the thin capitalisation rules so that investments in FIFs for which the investor uses the attributable FIF income method or the section EX 35 Australian exemption are treated the same as investments in CFCs.

In the absence of such rules there could be an incentive for businesses to reduce their taxable income by stacking additional debt against their New Zealand operations when in fact they are using these funds to equity finance their exempt offshore investments.

#### Application date

The changes apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011.

#### Key features

The Act modifies the thin capitalisation rules so that investments in FIFs for which the investor uses the attributable FIF income method or the section EX 35 Australian exemption are treated the same as investments in CFCs.

#### _When the thin-cap rules apply_

The thin-cap rules apply to New Zealand persons that are controlled by a single non-resident or that have an interest in a CFC or an interest in a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method or that use the section EX 35 exemption for FIFs resident in Australia.

Sections FE 1(1)(a) and FE 2(1)(e) have been modified so that the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE apply to persons with CFCs or with FIFs for which they use the attributable FIF income method or the section EX 35 exemption for FIFs resident in Australia.

Note that a person is considered to “use the attributable FIF income method for a FIF” when the FIF passes the active business test so that no income is attributed, as well as when the FIF fails the active business test and income is attributed under the attributable FIF income method.

It is expected that the new legislation will have limited impact in practice, as most investors in the affected FIFs will also have CFC investments and already be subject to the thin-capitalisation rules.

#### _Special rules for excess debt outbound entities_

A person is regarded as an excess debt outbound entity if they:

*   have an interest in a CFC or in a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method, or use the section EX 35 Australian exemption for FIFs resident in Australia;
*   are not a non-resident;
*   are not controlled by a single non-resident; and
*   are not a bank.

An excess debt outbound entity is excluded from applying the thin capitalisation rules if it is part of a New Zealand group which has less than $1 million of interest deductions (section FE 6(2)(ac)) or if the assets of the New Zealand group are 90% or more of the assets of the worldwide group (section FE 5(1B).)

In other cases, excess debt outbound entities are subject to the thin-capitalisation rules, although there are several concessions that apply only to excess debt outbound entities. These concessions are:

*   The ratio of New Zealand debt to New Zealand assets must exceed 75% (compared with 60% for excess debt inbound entities) before interest deductions are denied.
*   The portion of interest deductions that are denied is reduced to the extent to which the New Zealand group has less than $2 million of interest deductions.

An alternative thin-capitalisation method may be used if the excess debt outbound entity meets certain requirements (see the next section, Alternative thin-cap rule for low-asset companies).

#### _New Zealand group assets_

In general, assets from investments in CFCs and investments in FIFs which qualify for the section EX 35 Australian exemption, or for which a person in the New Zealand group uses the attributable FIF income method (section FE 16(1B)), are excluded from the New Zealand group's assets for the purposes of determining the New Zealand group's debt-to-asset ratio. The only exceptions are if the New Zealand group has on-lent debt to the CFCs or FIFs, or if the CFCs or FIFs derive income from a source in New Zealand which is not relieved under a double tax agreement. In such cases, the assets can be included only to the extent to which they are on-lent debt or relate to New Zealand-sourced income which is not relieved under a double tax agreement.

#### _Worldwide group assets_

In respect of companies, the new legislation does not change how the assets of the worldwide group are measured. This means that if a New Zealand company owns shares in a CFC or a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method or the section EX 35 Australian exemption, these shares would still count as assets of that company's worldwide group, even though these shares would be excluded from the assets of the company's New Zealand group.   

For individuals and trustees of trusts, the worldwide group includes that person's New Zealand group plus the group's interests in CFCs and interests in FIFs which qualify for the section EX 35 Australian exemption or for which a person in the New Zealand group uses the attributable FIF income method (sections FE 3(2)(b) and FE 5(1C)).

Under the TAA, we are required to protect the integrity of the tax system and are responsible for the care and management of taxes. The TAA requires Inland Revenue to collect over time the highest net revenue practicable within the law.

Bulk external datasets may be used to help us meet legislative requirements for the following purposes. 

*   Making sure our customers are paying the right amount of tax, complying with their tax obligations and taking targeted compliance actions where appropriate.
*   Helping our customers receive correct entitlements.
*   Identifying opportunities to improve our customer service.

Collecting information is part of the day-to-day activities we carry out in administering the tax system. We get information from many sources. We collect information when we consider it necessary or relevant for the administration or enforcement of the tax Acts. We approach businesses, organisations and individuals from time-to-time to obtain bulk information to meet our needs.

We cannot explain the purpose of bulk external datasets in detail, as we must maintain the confidentiality of sensitive revenue information and the affairs of taxpayers. Our obligations to protect the integrity of the tax system, and the confidentiality of information, are stated in section 6 and section 18 of the TAA.

Bulk external datasets process
------------------------------

Due to the sensitive nature of this information, we have developed a process to govern how we use our power to obtain datasets, and how we use and manage this information. We are bound by the confidentiality of information provisions, and use the data we get only for the purposes of tax administration.

The process also includes consideration of the Privacy Act 2020, including ethical requirements. 

The process does not apply to:

*   memorandums of understanding or information-sharing agreements between us and other agencies. These agreements are intended for regular information sharing for the purpose of delivering public services
*   data-matching programmes between government departments, which are approved by statute and regulated by the Privacy Commissioner.

### The process for requesting a dataset

Collecting information under the bulk external datasets process is done in 3 stages. We engage with the business, organisation or individual at all stages of the process to resolve any difficulties they may have in supplying the information.

#### Stage 1: Business case approval

The process has controls and governance in place to determine if a dataset request is appropriate. We prepare a proposal to make sure that requests for datasets are only made when it is necessary or relevant. The proposal is reviewed to consider legal and organisational requirements under the TAA and Privacy Act, including ethical requirements.

#### Stage 2: Issue section 17B notice

Once a proposal has been approved, we will issue a section 17B notice to request the information. The section 17B notice will:

*   list all the information required
*   detail the external stakeholders' statutory non-disclosure rights
*   give details on how the information can be delivered and/or collected.

#### Stage 3: Dataset supply

The information is given to us in the manner set out in the section 17B notice.

If gathering the information is unreasonably time-consuming or causes the external stakeholder who is providing the information difficulty with cost and effort, they should contact the Inland Revenue officer involved for assistance. In cases of genuine difficulty, the section 17B notice may be modified. However, we must agree to this before the expiry date on the original notice.

Obligations of the external stakeholder
---------------------------------------

If a business, organisation, or individual receives a request from us to supply a dataset, they are legally obliged to provide it under section 17B of the TAA.

### Confidentiality and privacy

We recognise the sensitive nature of this type of information. We limit access to data from an external stakeholder to only those of our staff who need it. We have strict access controls in place to prevent unauthorised access to information. Staff are prohibited from accessing, recording, or disclosing any customer's tax information except in the performance of their duties. Internal audit checks are built into the bulk external dataset process to make sure that processes, procedures and system-user monitoring policies are followed.

### Assistance

Our Bulk External Dataset team can help with the extraction, encryption and safe transport of data. Businesses, organisations, and individuals needing assistance must arrange this with us before their section 17B notice expires.

Research purpose The research purpose is to monitor Inland Revenue’s engagement and reputation through the business transformation process. The research targets stakeholders identified by the Executive Leadership Team as having an important role in the transformation process. In 2018, the research highlights trends in Inland Revenue’s engagement with stakeholders compared with the 2015 and 2016 results. The research also identifies key improvements to strengthen Inland Revenue’s engagement. Research method As in 2015 and 2016, we used a mixed-method approach. We completed 22 in-depth interviews. An online survey was completed by 118 stakeholders; a response rate of 52%. Fieldwork was completed between 14 February and 26 March 2018. Research conclusions In a dynamic environment of internal restructure, Inland Revenue has maintained and in some areas strengthened engagement with its stakeholders.  Stakeholders describe Inland Revenue as an exemplar of best practice in stakeholder engagement.  Inland Revenue is accessible, open minded, and provides accurate, timely and mainly consistent information.  Stakeholders’ support for Inland Revenue’s transformation and confidence that Inland Revenue will deliver the changes is increasing.  Stakeholders’ engagement with Inland Revenue on the transformation is increasing as is their understanding of transformation goals and priorities.  Stakeholders acknowledge improvements in Inland Revenue’s ability to collaborate and most (but not all) welcome the opportunity to collaborate. Perceptions of Inland Revenue’s engagement, collaboration and transformation vary across stakeholder groups.  Central government agencies, business representative groups, government agencies, the financial sector, and vendors and suppliers are mainly positive about their engagement with Inland Revenue.  Tax agents/intermediaries have mixed perceptions about Inland Revenue’s engagement. Tax agents/intermediaries are mainly positive about Inland Revenue’s operation engagement. However, they are less supportive about how Inland Revenue is changing and its ability to deliver.  Large enterprises have positive experiences in their day-to-day engagement with Inland Revenue. However, those interviewed stated Inland Revenue is not addressing their complex needs through the transformation and is increasing their workload with little direct benefit. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 3 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected  Local government stakeholders have a distant relationship with Inland Revenue due to the lack of engagement with their sector. Areas for improvement suggested by stakeholders  More tailored information on Inland Revenue’s transformation, particularly the long-term vision and the implications for other organisations’ systems, processes and customer interfaces.  Ensuring privacy protections of citizens are considered when designing the infrastructure and determining information sharing with other government agencies.  Building on Inland Revenue’s collaboration gains, particularly delivering more collaborative policy processes, while retaining the rigour of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Future work and research  Review whether the current questions in the stakeholder engagement survey continue to be fit- for-purpose at this stage of Inland Revenue’s transformation process.  Conduct further research with large enterprises to fully understand their issues and to identify an appropriate engagement strategy that meets their needs and addresses their concerns. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 4 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Introduction Detailed below is the research context. Inland Revenue engages with a broad and diverse range of external stakeholders Engagement occurs throughout Inland Revenue’s business areas and at different levels from Chief Executive meetings, and operational day-to-day relationships to ad-hoc interactions. Inland Revenue also runs a number of stakeholder committees (e.g., the Transformation Reference Group). Inland Revenue’s stakeholder engagement is informed by its Enterprise Stakeholder Engagement Framework and the Corporate strategy – External Collaboration (Inland Revenue 2016). The Corporate strategy commits Inland Revenue to working with external stakeholders to “innovate, gain insight, and achieve wider government economic and social outcomes”. Inland Revenue’s commitment to collaboration involves working with others to deliver better services, using co-design and co-delivery, sharing information and expertise, and consulting with stakeholders. Inland Revenue is transforming to better meet changing needs and contexts In 2014, Inland Revenue embarked on a significant transformation programme to make it simpler for New Zealanders to pay taxes and receive entitlements. The purpose of change is to better fit with how New Zealanders live and how businesses operate in today’s world. Inland Revenue is involving change experts, individual customers, businesses, third parties and the wider government sector in its transformation. The transformation has four stages:  enabling secure digital services (released in February 2017)  streamlining business tax processes (released in April 2018)  streamlining income tax processes and social policy delivery  completing delivery of the future revenue system. Inland Revenue is engaging with external stakeholders through the transformation Inland Revenue is engaging with stakeholders about changes in policy and design to meet New Zealanders’ needs now and in the future. The engagement purpose is to secure stakeholders’ support and confidence in the transformation direction, mitigate risks and manage expectations (Inland Revenue 2015a). Throughout the change period, Inland Revenue has engaged with external stakeholders, through formal and informal channels. In 2017, Inland Revenue engaged with stakeholders on two Official Issues Papers, Better administration of individuals’ income tax (June 2017), and Better administration of social policy (July 2017). Recent public engagement focused on notifying stakeholders of progress and direction, and of changes to myIR and the introduction of the Accounting Income Method (AIM). Before the stage two release in April 2018, Inland Revenue held a series of webinars to update stakeholders about the changes. These webinars particularly targeted tax agents/intermediaries. Inland Revenue is monitoring external stakeholder engagement to drive continuous improvements In July 2015, Litmus (www.litmus.co.nz) conducted research to benchmark external stakeholders’ satisfaction with their engagement with Inland Revenue. The research was repeated in 2016 and 2018 to assess changes in Inland Revenue’s stakeholder engagement, and identify ways to strengthen that engagement. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 5 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Research methodology Detailed below are the research scope and the research methods. Scope and research objectives The research purpose is to monitor Inland Revenue’s engagement and reputation through the business transformation process. The core business objective for this follow-up research is to help Inland Revenue improve engagement by understanding stakeholder concerns about their relationship with Inland Revenue. In 2018, the key research aim is to provide a high-level organisational view of how Inland Revenue engages with its stakeholders, what is done well and identify improvements, compared with the 2015 and 2016 research findings (Litmus 2015 and 2016). The main research topic areas continue to be:  stakeholders’ satisfaction with Inland Revenue’s engagement and collaboration  stakeholders’ understanding of how Inland Revenue is transforming  stakeholder’s view of how well Inland Revenue contributes to innovation and wider social and economic outcomes. Research methods As in 2015 and 2016, Litmus used a mixed-method research approach to address the business objective. We completed in-depth qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and an online quantitative survey of other stakeholders. This approach provides Inland Revenue with an overview of how perceptions of their engagement is changing supplemented with an in-depth understanding of what is driving perceptions and identification of suggested improvement areas. The research targets stakeholders identified by the Executive Leadership Team as having an important role in the transformation process. Qualitative in-depth interviews We completed 22 in-depth qualitative interviews to understand Inland Revenue’s engagement with stakeholders. We interviewed stakeholders from business representative groups, vendors and suppliers, government agencies, central government agencies, financial sector, tax agents/ intermediaries, and large enterprises. The stakeholder sample was comparable to 2015 and 2016 with the addition of large enterprises in 2018. Table 1 below details the qualitative sample frame. We followed an informed consent process. Interviews lasted 30–45 minutes, were audio recorded and transcribed. Where requested, stakeholders received a copy of their interview transcript to review and amend. We interviewed stakeholders face-to-face or by phone. In-depth interviews took place between 26 February and 14 March 2018. Quantitative survey We developed the online survey in 2015. The survey was modified slightly in 2016 and unchanged in 2018 to allow comparisons across time. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 6 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Litmus emailed a link to the online survey, hosted by SurveyMonkey, to a list of 229 stakeholders supplied by Inland Revenue. Of these, 118 completed or partially completed the survey, a response rate of 52%. 1 Table 2 details the sample achieved across the key sectors with their response rates. The survey was in field between 14 February and 26 March 2018. James Reilly, Statistical Insights, weighted the data of the 2015, 2016 and 2018 surveys to enable comparison of results across the years. The maximum margin of error for differences across the 2015, 2016 and 2018 surveys at a total sample level is ±9.5 percentage points. Only statistically significant differences are noted in the report. The key limitation of the research is the relatively low sample sizes within sectors, which limits the ability to undertake sub-group analysis.

Appendix 1 contains the research tools. Report structure Following feedback on the 2016 research report, we have structured the research findings into two sections:  Quantitative survey results at a total sample level to demonstrate key trends in stakeholders’ perceptions of Inland Revenue’s engagement supported by key findings from across the qualitative interviews.  Research findings for each sector, drawing as appropriate on the quantitative and/or qualitative research findings. Sector findings are representative of the stakeholders who completed an interview or survey. We acknowledge wider stakeholders in the sector may hold different views. However, findings within a sector group were mainly consistent. Appendix 2 contains the research tables as a total sample for 2015, 2016 and 2018. Appendix 3 contains the 2018 research tables at a total sample and sector level. 1 In 2016, we achieved a response rate of 55%. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Results: Overall rating of Inland Revenue’s stakeholder engagement in 2018 This section presents the quantitative findings for Inland Revenue’s stakeholder engagement at a total sample level supported by overarching themes from the qualitative interviews. We present the findings in three parts: Inland Revenue’s overall engagement; transformation engagement; and contribution to New Zealand’s wider economic and social outcomes. Assessing Inland Revenue’s engagement Stakeholders continue to view Inland Revenue’s engagement very positively Similar to 2015 and 2016, 93% of stakeholders have a positive perception of their engagement with Inland Revenue over the last six months (94% in 2016 and 91% in 2015). 2 Stakeholders interviewed are mainly positive about their relationship and engagement with Inland Revenue. Stakeholders mainly describe a mature relationship with constructive and systematic engagement. They consider Inland Revenue open-minded and actively engaging. Stakeholders are particularly positive about engagement on operational day-to-day matters. Perceptions of Inland Revenue’s engagement vary across stakeholder groups Stakeholders across sectors have varying perceptions of Inland Revenue’s engagement. This variation reflects their drivers for engagement with Inland Revenue, and their level of involvement in the transformation process. Central government agencies, business representative groups, government agencies, the finance sector and vendors and suppliers tend to be more positive about their engagement with Inland Revenue. Tax agents have mixed perceptions of engagement. Large enterprises are positive about operational engagement. However, they are concerned their complex needs are not addressed in the transformation process. Local government stakeholders are less positive due to Inland Revenue’s infrequent engagement with them. 2 Table 1, appendix 2 Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 8 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Details of engagement for each sector are in the following results section. Inland Revenue’s engagement is stable or improving In 2018, six in ten stakeholders (59%) said their engagement with Inland Revenue stayed the same over the last six months. A quarter (24%) said their engagement with Inland Revenue had improved. One in ten stakeholders (11%) said engagement had got worse. These were one to two stakeholders across the sectors, with the exception of business representative groups, central government agencies and local government. 3 Most stakeholders interviewed commented that Inland Revenue’s engagement had remained the same or improved over the last year. Some stakeholders noted Inland Revenue’s engagement had become more facilitative and less combative. A few with a close working relationship acknowledged the Commissioner and the Executive Leadership Team are driving these changes. A few years ago, they had a very combative culture, and it was a bit of a bully boy way of dealing with corporates and consumers. I get the sense that’s changing a bit and they’re trying to be more user-friendly. They seem to be putting in a bit of effort around that. That’s encouraging. (Large enterprise) Components of Inland Revenue’s engagement continue to be rated positively In 2018, seven in ten stakeholders (72%) agreed Inland Revenue provides accurate information. 4 Six in ten agreed Inland Revenue is flexible (66%), 5 responsive (66%), 6 consistent in its messages (62%), 7 delivers on promises (61%), 8 actively listens (59%), 9 and offers timely engagement (56%). 10 In 2018, Inland Revenue maintained improvements to increased ratings for timely engagement, accuracy of information and responsiveness to queries made between 2015 and 2016. In 2018, there were no significant increases or decreases in ratings compared with 2015 and 2016. In the qualitative interviews, some stakeholders perceived Inland Revenue’s restructure in 2017 had adversely affected its staff capacity. They perceived Inland Revenue’s staff to be under pressure and not as responsive or as timely in their engagement. A few felt these issues may resolve when the restructuring is completed. Their recent restructuring has had a greater than anticipated impact on staff morale, and that has been quite distracting. The day-to-day performance of the teams we engage with has fallen off. Now they’re through that restructure and starting to settle and operate. They do have to lift the morale and motivation, but are working hard on that. (Finance sector) Inland Revenue’s engagement is better or the same as other partners Inland Revenue is a leader in engaging well with partners. Three quarters of stakeholders said Inland Revenue’s engagement is the same (43%) or better (29%) than other partners’ engagement. These rating are unchanged from the 2015 benchmark (70%) and the 2016 survey (76%). 3 Table 2, appendix 2 4 Table 10, appendix 2 5 Table 15, appendix 2 6 Table 11, appendix 2 7 Table 13, appendix 2 8 Table 14, appendix 2 9 Table 12, appendix 2 10 Table 9, appendix 2 Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 9 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Two in ten stakeholders (18%) think Inland Revenue’s engagement is worse than that of their other partners. These were one to two stakeholders across the sectors, with the exception of central government agencies. 11 In qualitative interviews, most stakeholders commented that Inland Revenue’s engagement is better than or similar to other partners. For those in central government and government agencies, Inland Revenue is an exemplar of effective cross-agency engagement and collaboration. Most stakeholders receive the right amount of engagement from Inland Revenue As in 2015 and 2016, most stakeholders agreed Inland Revenue’s engagement over the last six months was at the right level (72%). One in ten thought there was too little engagement (13%), or had no contact with Inland Revenue (9%). The latter tended to be local government stakeholders. 12 In the qualitative interviews, most stakeholders had the right level and frequency of engagement with Inland Revenue. These stakeholders tended to have multiple operational and strategic interactions with Inland Revenue at various levels in their organisations. Stakeholders particularly valued face-to-face meetings, their relationship manager, being invited to workshops, and having access to senior managers and the Commissioner. Many stakeholders interviewed participated in advisory or other reference groups (e.g., the Software Liaison Group, Tax Payer Simplification Group). Involvement in these groups enhances their access to information and depth of understanding, and fosters trusting relationships based on a shared understanding. They also offer a forum to discuss and debate areas of disagreement. Relationship managers are key point of contact for stakeholders In 2018, 68% of stakeholders had at least one interaction with Inland Revenue’s relationship managers over the last six months. Contact with relationship managers has steadily increased compared with 49% in 2015. 13 Stakeholders interviewed commented their relationship manager enabled their day-to-day operational engagement. Relationship managers facilitated access to information on Inland Revenue’ transformation for some stakeholders. Stakeholders appreciated access to the Commissioner and the Executive Management Team In 2018, 45% of stakeholders had at least one interaction with the Executive Management Team. 14 Stakeholders interviewed valued interactions with senior management, particularly at events. The Commissioners and the Executive Leadership Team are seen as proactively leading and role modelling effective and positive engagement. Some stakeholders are seeking more access to senior leaders. \[The Commissioner’s\] leadership has increased the engagement. She is very accessible and willing to engage. She turns up and speaks at a lot of industry events and then she stays around afterwards and talks to people. She role models engagement for the rest of the leadership team. (Finance Sector) Inland Revenue’s workshops and public events are important mechanisms for sharing information In 2018, half of all stakeholders (46%) attended a seminar, workshop or public event held by Inland Revenue at least once in the last six months. 15 This attendance rate is similar to the 2016 and 2015 rate. Stakeholders interviewed were positive about events they attended. These events helped stakeholders understand what Inland Revenue is doing and how it is working. 11 Table 3, appendix 2 12 Table 8, appendix 2 13 Table 5, appendix 2 14 Table 4, appendix 3 15 Table 6, appendix 2 Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 10 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Auckland-based stakeholders interviewed are seeking more events and meetings with the Executive Leadership Team in their region. Assessing Inland Revenue’s transformation engagement Stakeholders support for Inland Revenue’s transformation is increasing In 2018, three quarters of stakeholders (72%) agree Inland Revenue is changing for the better, up from half (55%) in 2015. 16 As in 2015 and 2016, two thirds (67%) think Inland Revenue will make the tax system better. 17 In the qualitative interviews, stakeholders also supported Inland Revenue’s transformation as it will benefit them and their customers. Inland Revenue is improving its computer systems and its software platform, which is very welcome and possibly overdue. The potential is there for improved interaction between tax payers and the Commissioner as a result of those software changes, so that’s good. (Business representative group) Stakeholders are increasingly confident in Inland Revenue’s direction and ability to deliver From 2015 to 2016, stakeholders’ confidence in Inland Revenue’s direction and ability to deliver change significantly increased. In 2018, Inland Revenue maintained this increase. Over half (56%) agree Inland Revenue’s engagement creates confidence in their direction (up from 39% in 2015). 18 In 2018, there was no change to stakeholders’ perception that Inland Revenue’s engagement creates confidence it will successfully deliver the change, around half agreed (48%). 19 In the qualitative interviews, most stakeholders are confident Inland Revenue will deliver the change. Some stakeholders, who are consulted regularly about changes to tax policy and legislation, are finding the pace of change overwhelming. These stakeholders struggle to contribute to all requests for input, and question whether the pace of change adversely impacts policy and legislation developed. These stakeholders appreciate policy and other departments are under considerable time pressures due to a range of factors (not always under their control). However, they are concerned time pressures mean the best practice Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) is not followed. Stakeholders understand Inland Revenue’s transformation goals and priorities Most stakeholders are aware of Inland Revenue’s transformation goals and priorities. Around nine in ten stakeholders surveyed can answer questions about Inland Revenue’s engagement on its transformation. One in ten stakeholders had little awareness, answering ‘don’t know’ for these questions. Awareness was lower amongst local government. In 2016, Inland Revenue made significant gains in engaging with stakeholders, proactively communicating, and improving stakeholders’ understanding of their transformation priorities. In 2018, Inland Revenue improved stakeholder understanding in these areas, specifically. 16 Table 25, appendix 2 17 Table 26, appendix 2 18 Table 21, appendix 2 19 Table 22, appendix 2 Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 11 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected  61% agree Inland Revenue engages with those interested and affected by the transformation (up from 44% in 2015). 20  67% agree Inland Revenue is proactively ensuring stakeholders understand what it is trying to achieve through the transformation (up from 47% in 2015) 21 Six in ten stakeholders think Inland Revenue ensures stakeholders understand its priorities (61%). 22 There was no significant change between 2016 and 2018. However, Inland Revenue maintained gains made in 2016. In qualitative interviews, all stakeholders are aware of Inland Revenue’s transformation. Stakeholders’ depth of knowledge about Inland Revenue’s transformation varies across sectors. Stakeholders more involved in the transformation talk about a culture change process through which new technology will enable Inland Revenue to be more customer-focused. Others less involved tended to focus more on the information technology aspects of the change. It is basically a complete transformation of the way the tax system is administered. It is attempting to put the tax system into a digital first environment and apply modern technologies to the system so that we can leverage those advantages from data analytics and cost perspective. (Financial sector) Stakeholders interviewed receive their information on the transformation from a range of Inland Revenue sources, including: Inland Revenue’s website, newsletters, advisory group briefings, face-to- face meetings and consultation documents. The need for more information about Inland Revenue’s transformation varies across stakeholders. Most stakeholders want to have a good oversight of the changes. Some stakeholders are feeling overloaded and are seeking a way to prioritise information without losing their high level overview. As Inland Revenue’s transformation moves towards business-as-usual, stakeholders are seeking information on implications of the changes for their organisation and customers/members. Stakeholders’ collaboration with Inland Revenue is strengthening Inland Revenue, through its External Corporate Strategy for External Collaboration, has been seeking to move engagement with stakeholders from ‘inform and consult’ to ‘involve and collaborate’ (figure 1). Evidence from the stakeholder survey and interviews highlight Inland Revenue is moving the dial on their engagement. Stakeholders consider Inland Revenue understands the shared benefits gained through involvement and collaboration. This positive shift reflects a number of work streams across Inland Revenue to improve stakeholder involvement. 20 Table 16, appendix 2 21 Table 17, appendix 2 22 Table 18, appendix 2 Figure 1: Stakeholder engagement spectrum Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 12 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Inland Revenue understands the benefits of collaboration In 2018, more stakeholders agree Inland Revenue appreciates the need to consider the impact of its changes on other organisations, and identify ways for others to contribute:  56% agree Inland Revenue considers the impact of the transformation on their business and interface with customers (up from 38% in 2015). 23  47% agree Inland Revenue understands how stakeholders can contribute to its transformation (up from 31% in 2015). 24 Inland Revenue is creating opportunities to collaborate In 2018, more stakeholders agree Inland Revenue enables them to collaborate:  59% agree Inland Revenue creates opportunities for effective collaboration compared with 49% in 2016 and 35% in 2015. 25 Collaboration is enabling shared outcomes The intent of collaboration is to achieve shared outcomes. In 2018, half of stakeholders surveyed agree collaboration results in positive outcomes for shared customers:  47% agree Inland Revenue collaborates to create innovative customer-centric solutions. 26  40% agree Inland Revenue ensures a seamless service for its shared customers. 27 Not all stakeholders want to collaborate, some prefer to be consulted or involved In the qualitative research, stakeholders had varied engagement experiences. Most stakeholders are at the consult end of the spectrum. Some stakeholders described a noticeable shift in Inland Revenue becoming more collaborative through the transformation process. These stakeholders tend to have shared customers/interfaces, or a vested interest in the technology solutions (e.g., government agencies, tax agents and software developers). These stakeholders have much to gain through collaboration. Stakeholders’ preferences on how they wanted to engage with Inland Revenue vary depending on the reason for engagement. Collaboration was seen as important in the early design stage of policy or tax process to discuss and debate different approaches. Collaboration also has a role when seeking to implement agreed policy or legislative changes. However, formal consultation (e.g., as part of the GTTP) is seen as a protective function, and is a formal mechanism for disagreements to be noted and heard. Stakeholders in advocacy roles wanted to be involved. They are reluctant to collaborate due to the resource commitment required. Stakeholders in regulatory roles said collaborating would undermine the independence of their role. Some vendors and suppliers prefer to be consulted as they are supplying defined products. We are resource constrained. We might not be able to do everything going forward... But certainly on the bigger stuff in terms of legislation then we and other stakeholders would like to see that next level of collaboration. It makes for better outcomes than going back and forth for months and writing massive submissions. That is not effective use of anyone’s time and resource.

Around half think Inland Revenue contributes to a seamless experience of government for customers. There was no change across 2016 and 2018.  Around two thirds agree or strongly agree Inland Revenue contributes to improved economic (69%) 29 and social (63%) 30 wellbeing for New Zealand.  61% agree or strongly agree Inland Revenue understands how it can contribute to wider outcomes for New Zealand. 31  45% agree or strongly agree Inland Revenue contributes to a seamless experience of government for customers. 32 Stakeholder perception on Inland Revenue’s contribution to wider outcomes varies Stakeholders interviewed demonstrate diverse opinion on Inland Revenue’s contribution to wider outcomes. Some stakeholders continue to see Inland Revenue as almost exclusively a revenue gathering organisation. These stakeholders think Inland Revenue contributes broadly to New Zealand’s economic outcomes. I still see it as taking as much tax as possible. (Large enterprise) Fewer stakeholders perceive Inland Revenue’s contribution to New Zealand’s social wellbeing. Those who acknowledge this contribution tend to talk about Inland Revenue’s involvement in student loans, child support and Working for Families. A few stakeholders believe Inland Revenue should not be involved in social policy as their job is to collect revenue for the Government. Provision of revenue for the Crown is the main way they contribute to wellbeing and the efficiency of things like Working for Families. They are tied into some of the social provisions like managing child support in collaboration with Ministry of Social Development. (Central government agency) ‘A good tax system is critical for functioning society’ is a deeply held belief of Inland Revenue staff. It is a powerful cultural asset. They genuinely believe that they, by running the tax system, and rightly so, are contributing to the health and wellbeing of society. (Finance sector) 28 In 2016, new questions were added to the survey to assess stakeholders’ perceptions of their contribution to wider social and economic outcomes. These questions were repeated in 2018. 29 Table 30, appendix 2 30 Table 31, appendix 2 31 Table 27, appendix 2 32 Table 29, appendix 2 Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Results: Stakeholder engagement across key sectors This section presents the research findings for each of Inland Revenue’s stakeholder engagement groups. For each group, we tailor the findings to their reasons for engaging with Inland Revenue. We offer insight into what Inland Revenue is doing well on its day-to- day operational and strategic engagement. We also identify areas where Inland Revenue can strengthen its engagement. The findings are based on sub-group samples achieved in the survey, and the common themes from in-depth stakeholder interviews. Where sub-sample sizes are small, we present only the qualitative research findings. Given the small sample sizes, we have not presented quantitative findings as percentages. Detailed data tables supporting the findings are in appendix 3. We present the sub-group findings from those most positive about Inland Revenue’s engagement, those with mixed views, and those less positive:  Central government agencies  Business representative groups  Government agencies  Financial sector  Vendors and suppliers  Tax agents/intermediaries (referred to as tax agents)  Large enterprises  Local government. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 15 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Central government agencies 33 Central government agencies engage with Inland Revenue at a strategic level Central government agencies have specialist and regulatory-based engagement with Inland Revenue. Their reasons for engagement vary dependent on the mandate of their agency. Engagement can be complex and occur at multiple levels. Central government agencies tend to engage with Inland Revenue frequently at a senior level and with named contacts. They also have an established relationship and regular contact with the Commissioner. Central government agencies’ engagement with Inland Revenue is facilitated by strong personal and trusted relationships developed over a long time. Central government agencies are very positive about their engagement with Inland Revenue Stakeholders interviewed noted their agency and Inland Revenue shared a strong public sector ethos with responsibility to New Zealand citizens to achieve common outcomes. They described engagement with Inland Revenue as proactive, open and honest, and based on a mutual respect for their different roles. Stakeholders use existing mechanisms to explore and create an understanding of differing perspectives, approaches and opinions. They are mature. They know what they are doing – certainly at a leadership level... It’s that give and take, sharing of ideas and not sharing solutions... It’s saying this is where we want to get to, this is what we’ve thought about, what do you think? Have a mature two-way discussion, an engaging relationship where agencies listen to each other. (Central government agency) Stakeholders agree Inland Revenue provides accurate information, is responsive to queries, actively listens, offers consistent messages, and delivers on their promises. Timeliness and flexibility in their engagement are areas for ongoing improvement. At times, Inland Revenue is focused on driving through change to meet its goals within agreed timelines without reference to other agencies. Inland Revenue’s engagement is improving and is an exemplar to other agencies Stakeholders interviewed noted Inland Revenue’s engagement continues to improve over time. The leadership of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Executive Leadership Team are seen as leading a culture change in Inland Revenue. This culture change is positively impacting engagement with key stakeholders who are being supported and informed about the changes. Certainly in the last 12 months, the changes have been accelerating... it’s been a lot more open. Coming from the leadership but you can still feel it at the lower levels as well... They are engaging with us and taking us on the journey. (Central government agency) Central government stakeholders interviewed considered their relationship and engagement with Inland Revenue as better than with other agencies. They described a more mature relationship than with other partners with higher trust, better communication and a willingness to listen. Probably better than many comparative organisations. There aren’t many comparable of the same scale or nature but of that cohort of half a dozen, Inland Revenue would be close to the top. (Central government agencies) Central government agencies want to be involved, but are not seeking collaboration Central government agencies’ engagement with Inland Revenue tends to be in consultation and involvement. Central government agencies, particularly regulatory agencies, feel it is not appropriate 33 We interviewed three people from central government agencies. We sent the survey to nine people from central government agencies. Only two completed the survey. We have presented the qualitative findings only due to the low survey numbers. The survey results were consistent with the qualitative findings. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected to collaborate with Inland Revenue. They perceive a collaborative role has the potential to undermine their independence if called to review Inland Revenue’s activities. We have a statutory independence... If we’ve been involved in the design, that may affect our ability to discharge that independent review function. (Central government agency) One central government stakeholder wants a more collaborative relationship. Barriers to collaboration were time and lack of maturity on both sides. They commented on the need for more multi-government agency collaboration whereby the agencies worked together on shared goals and resolved any conflicting needs. Central government agencies have a good to reasonable understanding of how Inland Revenue is changing Stakeholders interviewed are aware of Inland Revenue’s transformation programme. The level of understanding varies depending on their involvement in the change process. Those involved have a deep understanding of the transformation and its long-term goals. Stakeholders in regulatory agencies tend to have a high level overview of the changes. Overall, stakeholders appreciate Inland Revenue is trying to be customer-focused through the use of technology. It’s about refreshing Inland Revenue to be more flexible and more supportive of their customer base. They are trying to ensure tax payers who want to pay tax can do so as easily as possible. Then those who don’t want to pay they throw their investigative unit at... It’s business transformation supported by technology, not just a technology change. (Central government agency) Stakeholders commented Inland Revenue has done a good job of keeping them informed. These stakeholders receive information through face-to-face briefings, newsletters and Inland Revenue’s website. Central government agencies interviewed had several suggestions for Inland Revenue to consider:  Providing more information about the transformation progress for those less involved, and being more proactive in sharing the information (e.g., progress against service delivery goals, focus for the next six months).  Providing more information on the implications of Inland Revenue’s transformation for other government agencies, and Inland Revenue’s role in the public sector.  Sharing with the wider public sector the learnings from their transformation journey and their successes in collecting revenue.  Ensuring privacy protections of citizens are carefully considered when designing the infrastructure, and working with appropriate specialists to review these protections.  Ensuring responsiveness to citizens, especially vulnerable people and those that are not technology savvy. I’m very positive about what they’ve done and where they’re going. Obviously I want more, but compared to a lot of agencies they are light years ahead. There are more things for them to think about, but you don’t want those things to distract them from their better service delivery. They’ve got to make those judgements. (Central government agency) Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 17 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Business representative groups 34 Business representative groups mainly engage with Inland Revenue at a strategic level Business representatives groups include a diverse range of member-based organisations. Business representative groups share Inland Revenue’s goal of developing an effective and fair tax system. They engage with Inland Revenue to:  review and comment on proposed changes to tax policy and legalisation from a public good perspective, and for some from an industry sector perspective  understand proposed changes to inform their business or industry sector. These groups have a long-term and mature relationship with Inland Revenue. They engage weekly or two-weekly with Inland Revenue. These stakeholders have built trusted relationships with senior staff at Inland Revenue, including the Commissioner. Some stakeholders are members of Inland Revenue’s advisory and reference groups. Stakeholders from business representative groups have complex relationships with Inland Revenue. Some are employed by the business representative group. Others work in a voluntary role, and may also engage with Inland Revenue through their paid employment. These stakeholders tend to have high levels of expertise on tax systems nationally and internationally. A few business representative groups have an operational relationship with Inland Revenue focused on their organisations’ tax compliance requirements. They may put in submissions on behalf of their members. However, engaging with Inland Revenue and informing members of changes is not a key priority. These stakeholders are satisfied with their more distant relationship and infrequent engagement with Inland Revenue. Business representative groups are positive about their strategic engagement with Inland Revenue All stakeholders are satisfied with their engagement with Inland Revenue. Stakeholders agree Inland Revenue excels at providing accurate and timely information, being consistent and responsive and delivering on promises. Personal relationships, involvement in advisory groups, and access to the Commissioner drives their satisfaction. These stakeholders know who to contact if they have a query and are confident they can get a response. They feel respected and valued in the relationship. They appreciate that Inland Revenue listens to their feedback, and are aware at times they will agree to disagree. We don’t always agree with Inland Revenue's view of the world and naturally that means we might take an advocacy role. So the relationship in those situations is naturally a bit more strained. (Business representative group) Inland Revenue’s engagement is getting better Stakeholders with a long-term relationship commented Inland Revenue’s engagement has strengthened over the years. Inland Revenue’s engagement is more systematic. Inland Revenue is sharing information in a more timely way to enable engagement. However, the amount of change to the tax system over the last two years, which the transformation process contributes to, has created pressure (see below). We appreciate the effort the Commissioner goes through to improve stakeholder engagement... The level of engagement with New Zealand’s Inland Revenue is far better than the engagement that overseas Inland Revenue people have, so that’s a positive. (Business representative group) 34 We interviewed three people from business representative groups. One interview from the tax agent group was included here. They are an industry representative group and their feedback mirrored the other business representative groups. Nine people completed or partially completed the survey. These results are indicative of this sub-group. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 18 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Business representative groups support the policy group’s intent to engage earlier in the policy cycle Stakeholders commend Inland Revenue’s policy group’s initial work for exploring how they can be more proactive in their early engagement around policy and legislative changes. Stakeholders are interested to see how this intent plays out, given the current pressures from the transformation process and the changes sought by Government. Stakeholders are positive about how Inland Revenue is changing and their ability to deliver Business representative group stakeholders agreed Inland Revenue is changing for the better. Most stakeholders agree with the direction of the change and agree that the change will make the tax system better. Almost all stakeholders are confident in Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver the change. Business representative groups have a good understanding of Inland Revenue’s transformation These stakeholders perceive Inland Revenue as proactive in informing them about its priorities, and ensuring they understand the goal of the change. Stakeholders have been actively involved in the transformation of Inland Revenue Stakeholders, through their participation in advisory and reference groups, have been closely involved in the transformation process. Collaboration is important to this group, given their level of expertise and links to their members. Stakeholders appreciate opportunities to collaborate through advisory groups and other mechanisms. However, resource constraints on both sides can impede the collaboration. Stakeholders highlighted a number of areas to strengthen engagement with Inland Revenue:  Managing the balance of keeping stakeholders informed but not overloaded. While these stakeholders are keen to know about all the changes occurring at Inland Revenue, some are at an information overload stage. These stakeholders are seeking ways to prioritise the information/changes they engage with. In contrast, others want to receive all information on the changes to avoid missing out.  Providing information on how Inland Revenue’s transformation will benefit their members.  Improving engagement timelines and internal coordination of engagement requests. Stakeholders, particularly those in voluntary roles, have limited capacity to engage and respond, if timelines are short. One stakeholder noted a lack of internal coordination can result in receiving requests from multiple divisions within Inland Revenue at the same time.  Adhering with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). These stakeholders noted Inland Revenue leads the world in its engagement on tax policy and legislation through the use of GTPP. Stakeholders perceive time pressures on developing policy and legislation has meant a lack of adherence to the GTPP. Some stakeholders are concerned about the quality of policy/legislation, given the haste.  Addressing concerns relating to the privacy of information. Some stakeholders are apprehensive about the levels of information sharing occurring. They appreciate the wider context is changing with information use, but question whether the balance is right.  Ensuring responsiveness through adequate internal capacity. Stakeholders perceive Inland Revenue’s restructure in the last 12 months has affected responsiveness. In part, this is due to a loss of subject specialists in some areas. Stakeholders are currently holding judgement to see whether this is an ongoing issue or a one-off due to the restructure process. The tsunami of legislation... It’s very difficult for professional bodies to cope with. We’ve pretty much been overwhelmed by the volume of legislation we’ve had to look at. We’re concerned at the haste with which it’s been put together and sometimes the quality of the legislation that results. (Business representative group) Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 19 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Government agencies 35 Government agencies engage with Inland Revenue at a variety of levels Inland Revenue engages with government agencies to share information, consult on tax policy and legislation, facilitate compliance, co-design services and infrastructure, and meet domestic and international responsibilities. Government agencies engage at both a strategic and operational level across a diverse range of initiatives and issues. Most government agencies engage frequently with Inland Revenue. Eight in ten felt the engagement frequency and amount was about right in the last six months. These stakeholders have named contacts at Inland Revenue who they can access when needed. Three quarters engaged with their relationship manager in the last six months, and half with Inland Revenue’s executive management team. Government agencies consider Inland Revenue’s engagement very positively: an exemplar of inter- agency engagement All government agencies surveyed are positive about Inland Revenue’s engagement over the last six months. Government agencies rate the efficiency of Inland Revenue’s engagement very highly. Around eight in ten agreed Inland Revenue offers timely engagement, provides accurate information, is responsive to queries, actively listens and delivers on promises. Similar to other stakeholders, two thirds agreed Inland Revenue is flexible. Seven in ten also rated Inland Revenue highly for creating opportunities for collaboration and creating innovative solutions together. Government agencies rated Inland Revenue’s engagement higher than that of other stakeholders for these attributes. Government agency stakeholders interviewed said they had frequent and proactive engagement with Inland Revenue. They described a positive, collaborative working relationship at operational and strategic levels through advisory or reference groups. Stakeholders noted Inland Revenue’s engagement was mature and an exemplar of collaborative cross-agency engagement. Half of government agency stakeholders supported this position, agreeing Inland Revenue’s engagement is better than their partners’ engagement. They’re hugely engaged in the programme. They see the value of collaborating across agencies. They put into the programme with their people as well as their funding. They are open to trying new things and sharing their experiences and Intellectual Property... Mature in understanding what we are trying to achieve, why collaboration is critical, and they understand customer-focused service design... They are the model for how I would like other agencies to be. (Government agency) Government agencies perceive engagement with Inland Revenue as stable or improving Half of the government agency stakeholders surveyed said their engagement with Inland Revenue stayed the same and a quarter said it improved in the last six months. One government agency interviewed noted improvements in engagement over the last 12 months. In part, this shift reflected the work by the agency to monitor engagement and resolve issues arising to achieve their effective working relationship. We invested in some workshops with us and Inland Revenue about a year ago to get people to meet face-to-face and bring challenges to the table and talk about things. That really improved the relationship. (Government agency) 35 We interviewed two people from government agencies, and 26 people completed or partially completed the survey, a response rate of 52%. These results are indicative. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 20 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Government agencies support how Inland Revenue is changing and their ability to deliver Eight in ten government agencies agree Inland Revenue is changing for the better, and will make the tax system better. Compared to other stakeholders, they appear more confident in Inland Revenue’s direction; three quarters agree compared to half of stakeholders as a whole. Six in ten agreed Inland Revenue creates confidence it will successfully deliver the change. Government agencies have mixed views on engagement on and understanding of Inland Revenue’s transformation Half agree Inland Revenue is engaging with stakeholders about their transformation, and the implications for their organisation. Around six in ten agree Inland Revenue is proactive in ensuring an understanding of its priorities and transformation goals. Six in ten also agree Inland Revenue understands how stakeholders’ organisations can contribute to the change. Although only half agree Inland Revenue is ensuring seamless services for shared customers. Government agencies want information on the implications of the transformation for their agency Feedback from government agencies interviewed indicated a high level of understanding of Inland Revenue’s transformation. For some the information received was adequate for their needs. However, as transformation progresses, some want a greater understanding of how Inland Revenue’s system will interface with their system. They also want to explore potential shared opportunities. They have started progressing to the new system. I’d like more information on the system and what that means for \[organisation\] and what we need to do to move forward with the system. It is not just the SAP accounting system but other systems that interface. But it is early days, it’s only just started being communicated over the last two weeks. So we should get more information. (Government agency) Understand that opportunities will arise as the transformation goes on and be willing to at least assess these or collaborate to determine if they can be leveraged as part of the transformation programme. Approach currently can be quite rigid, with an automatic no, without the possibility of consideration. There are possibly some missed opportunities along the way. (Government agency) Government agencies’ open ended survey comments highlighted suggestions for Inland Revenue to consider:  Increasing the sharing of tax and intelligence information across government agencies. Care is needed with this suggestion as other stakeholders are concerned about maintaining the privacy of tax information (refer business reference groups and central government agencies).  Increasing efficiencies in working collaboratively, including: - greater understanding of the limitations and priorities of other government agencies - clarity on co-design models being used, and being open to alternative approaches - ensuring customer benefits are considered as important benefits to Inland Revenue. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 21 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Financial sector stakeholders 36 Financial sector stakeholders have a multi-dimensional relationship with Inland Revenue Inland Revenue engages with financial sector stakeholders at a variety of operational and strategic levels. Financial sector stakeholders engage with Inland Revenue to:  manage their organisation’s tax compliance  act on behalf of their clients with tax issues  offer tax advice and guidance to Inland Revenue on their transformation and other tax matters through reference and advisory groups  input into tax policy and legislative changes. Financial sector stakeholders tend to be experts or have specialist knowledge of tax. These stakeholders have a long-term relationship with Inland Revenue and frequently engage. Eight in ten said their engagement in the last six months was about right. Stakeholders have built trusted relationships with senior staff at Inland Revenue, including the Commissioner. At an operational level, their organisations work with relationship managers or other key contacts. Around half had interacted with Inland Revenue’s Executive Management Team, and nine in ten with their relationship managers. Financial sector stakeholders’ engagement with Inland Revenue is positive Nine in ten financial sector stakeholders rate Inland Revenue’s engagement positively. Seven in ten agree Inland Revenue provides accurate information, actively listens and is flexible. Two thirds agree Inland Revenue provides consistent messages, delivers on promises, and is responsive to queries. These stakeholders described a positive, mature, and principle-based relationship which is mutually valuable and professional. For these stakeholders Inland Revenue is accessible at many levels. One stakeholder described Inland Revenue’s culture as genuinely seeking input and dialogue, and actively listening. Stakeholders are also putting in time and energy to develop an effective relationship with Inland Revenue. Stakeholders commented the Commissioner’s leadership contributes to Inland Revenue being more accessible and open to engagement. Very positive in each dimension. We get good access to \[the Commissioner\] and her senior team, and really good engagement in whatever capacity we are involved in... It is constructive, professional, accessible engagement. Better than most government agencies. (Financial Sector) Inland Revenue’s engagement is stable over time and better than other partners Six in ten financial sector stakeholders think engagement stayed the same, and a third said it improved in the last six months. Eight in ten stakeholders agreed their engagement with Inland Revenue was the same or better than with their other partners. Stakeholders interviewed also noted Inland Revenue’s approach to engagement was strengthening. They identified Inland Revenue’s shift from an adversarial and regulatory approach to being more collaborative and engaging. They noted this change has occurred over the past few years. Certain parts of Inland Revenue are still seeking to have the traditional adversarial attitude... The change I’ve seen is that there is more of a willingness to sit down and talk about things, rather than coming from a place of distrust. (Financial Sector) 36 We interviewed three people from the financial sector, and 19 people completed the survey, a response rate of 58%. These results are indicative. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 22 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Stakeholders interviewed noted the impact of Inland Revenue’s restructure over the last year on their engagement. They commented that the restructure had some impact on staff morale and their capacity to respond to queries promptly. I worry their bench strength is not very deep. Inland Revenue feels very skinny at the moment, so things can take a long time because there are so few resources to deal with certain issues... Feels like key knowledge is trapped with just a few people. (Financial Sector) Financial sector stakeholders support how Inland Revenue is changing and its ability to deliver Eight in ten financial sector stakeholders agree Inland Revenue is changing for the better, and will make the tax system better. Two thirds agree Inland Revenue creates confidence in its direction. Half are confident Inland Revenue can deliver the changes. Financial sector stakeholders understand the goal and priorities of the transformation Seven in ten financial sector stakeholders agree Inland Revenue engages with those interested and affected by the transformation. They also agree Inland Revenue engages to create understanding of what it is trying to achieve, and its priorities. In terms of transformation, we’ve had good but limited engagement and that has been on an as-needed basis from Inland Revenue’s perspective – when they have wanted information. As time progresses engagement seems to be ramping up. (Financial sector) In qualitative interviews, financial sector stakeholders’ understanding of the transformation ranges from a high level overview to an in-depth understanding. Those with a high level overview perceive Inland Revenue is using new technology to be more customer-centric, and to speed up processes. These stakeholders feel they do not have enough detailed information about the transformation and what it means for their organisations. Others, particularly those on advisory groups have a deep understanding and involvement in the transformation. Financial sector stakeholders have mixed opinions on Inland Revenue’s collaboration Six in ten stakeholders agree Inland Revenue creates opportunities for collaboration. A third agree Inland Revenue collaborates to create innovative solutions. In qualitative interviews, stakeholders consider collaboration to be a balance and not appropriate in all contexts (e.g., during disputes). Only a third of stakeholders agree Inland Revenue is aware of the implications of changes to their business, understands how they can contribute to Inland Revenue’s change, or ensures a seamless experience for shared customers. Stakeholders interviewed questioned Inland Revenue’s understanding of how transformation affects their businesses and integrates with their technology. For example, with GATCA we are required to be collecting information. Even today we are still not certain how we are supposed to be reporting certain types of transactions. I set up systems to interface with Inland Revenue in the hope we’ve made the right pick. (Financial sector). For some, the change process has felt rushed and it is unclear what is required from their organisations to meet the change. The following are suggestions for Inland Revenue to consider from the financial sector:  Continue strengthening engagement on policy by working with advisory groups and considering whether these groups are too conformist, engaging with large enterprises, and allowing more time to consider major change initiatives (particularly for large enterprises).  Provide more information on the transformation including: - regular updates on progress to date, upcoming initiatives, and an overview of the long-term goal and vision - publish ‘hero’ stories describing the benefits for customers/organisations from the changes. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 23 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Vendors and suppliers 37 Vendors and suppliers mostly engage with Inland Revenue at an operational level Vendors and suppliers are a diverse group of organisations offering a range of services. Most engage weekly or more often with Inland Revenue to deliver services. Some vendors and suppliers are directly or indirectly involved in Inland Revenue’s transformation. These stakeholders consider their engagement on transformation as a business-as-usual relationship with Inland Revenue. Heritage vendors and suppliers remain engaged. Nine in ten vendors and suppliers reported the level of engagement from Inland Revenue in the last six months was about right. Eight in ten engaged with their relationship manager at least once in the last six months, and six in ten with the Executive Management Team. Vendors and suppliers are mainly positive about their engagement with Inland Revenue All vendors and suppliers rated Inland Revenue’s engagement positively. At an operational level, vendors and suppliers interviewed are mainly positive about their engagement. They describe a mature relationship characterised by mutual respect, open communication, a learning environment, high levels of trust and teamwork. It’s excellent. It’s robust which is good. It can survive its ups and downs. They listen and understand our position... you feel like they’re on your side. (Vendor and supplier) Seven in ten vendors and suppliers agree Inland Revenue provides accurate information, offers timely engagement, is responsive to queries, gives consistent messages and is flexible. Two thirds agreed or strongly agreed Inland Revenue actively listens and delivers on promises. Vendors and suppliers agreed more strongly than the total stakeholder group across these measures. As in 2016, heritage vendors and suppliers are mainly positive about their day-to-day engagement with Inland Revenue. However, they are frustrated they can no longer engage at a strategic level to inform or collaborate on the transformation process. We are well-regarded in service provision. It seems we are really at arm’s length, like it’s a one way dialogue. (Vendor and supplier) Inland Revenue’s engagement with vendors and suppliers is stable over time Seven in ten vendors and suppliers said their engagement was the same over the last six months and two in ten said it had improved. Vendors and suppliers interviewed commented on the number of staff changes at Inland Revenue over the last six months. Inland Revenue’s staff turnover did not impact their engagement. However, vendors and suppliers perceived they had an important role retaining institutional knowledge through the transition. The high turnover isn’t a challenge for us... They rely on the fact we haven’t changed so there is institutional reliance... Our consistency probably makes it less of a challenge. (Vendor and supplier) Inland Revenue engagement is better than that of vendors and suppliers’ other partners Two thirds of vendors and suppliers rate Inland Revenue’s engagement better than that of their other partners. This rating is higher than with other stakeholder groups. Vendors and suppliers interviewed, who are closely involved in the transformation, thought their relationship with Inland Revenue was better than with their other key partners. They described Inland Revenue’s engagement as more mature than that of other partners. 37 We interviewed four people from vendor and supplier organisations. Fourteen people completed or partially completed the survey, a response rate of 78%. These results are indicative. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 24 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected I wish every other government department was as easy, open minded and reciprocal as they are. (Vendor and supplier) Vendors and suppliers are very positive about how Inland Revenue is changing and its ability to deliver Eight in ten agree Inland Revenue is changing for the better, and will make the tax system better. Seven in ten are confident in Inland Revenue’s direction and ability to successfully deliver change. Vendors and suppliers understand Inland Revenue’s transformation goals and priorities Seven in ten stakeholders agree Inland Revenue is seeking to engage them in the transformation processes. These stakeholders also agree Inland Revenue informs them of its transformation goals and priorities. These stakeholders tend to be involved in transformation work, or cover both transformation and heritage services. In comparison, heritage vendors and suppliers feel blocked out of the transformation programme. They continue to seek ways to be more involved in the change process. We would like to position ourselves as part of the future. But we are the incumbent for the heritage service. There is a feeling we being kept in that category. It’s an important step for transformation because we keep the lights on and integrate with the new system, but we aren’t linked to the new world. (Vendor and supplier) Most vendors and suppliers are collaborating with Inland Revenue Seven in ten vendors and suppliers agree Inland Revenue creates opportunities for collaboration; higher than other stakeholders. They also agree Inland Revenue collaborates to create innovative solutions. With BT, it has always been very good, mature, good robust discussions about what both parties need to be successful. (Vendor and supplier) In qualitative feedback, vendors and suppliers had differing experiences of collaboration. Stakeholders closely involved in the transformation described themselves as part of Inland Revenue’s team. Examples of collaboration include shared work planning, co-designed projects, openly discussing progress, and adapting and learning from each other. Stakeholders said this level of collaboration was necessary to achieve the desired outcomes from Inland Revenue’s transformation. The way they managed the whole co-design is great... They come and say they want our help and want to work together to find a solution. (Vendor and supplier) Other vendors and suppliers described their engagement with Inland Revenue as consultative. This is appropriate for these stakeholders as their role in transformation is moving to business-as-usual. Heritage vendors and suppliers describe their relationship with Inland Revenue as one-way, with Inland Revenue informing and at times consulting them. We could add more value if we were allowed into some discussion. (Vendor and supplier) Vendors and suppliers agree Inland Revenue is business and customer-focused Seven in ten vendors and suppliers agreed Inland Revenue ensures businesses/customers know the implications of the change, understands how their organisations can contribute to the change, and ensures a seamless service for shared customers. Reflecting their high level of satisfaction, vendors and suppliers put forward two suggestions to strengthen their engagement with Inland Revenue:  Improving access to decision-makers who are responsible for changing agreed work plans.  Keeping vendors and suppliers informed and involved early, when work plans change. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 25 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Tax agents/intermediaries 38 Tax agents engage with Inland Revenue at both operational and strategic levels Tax agents/intermediaries (tax agents) include tax companies and member-based organisations. 39 In general, tax agents engage with Inland Revenue at an operational level. Some engage at a strategic level for their members. They engage with Inland Revenue to:  address day-to-day operational matters that affect their ability to efficiently run their businesses  understand how Inland Revenue and tax policy is changing and the operational implications for their business or their members  review and comment on proposed changes to tax policy and legalisation from an industry sector perspective. Tax agents have a long-standing relationship with Inland Revenue. They have relatively frequent contact with Inland Revenue both at a senior level (71% had at least one contact in the last six months), and operationally through their relationship manager (86% had at least one contact in the last six months). Over half had attended an Inland Revenue seminar or workshop in the last six months. In the 2015 and 2016 research, tax agents had divided perceptions about Inland Revenue’s engagement. Some were concerned about a lack of engagement and information, given the changes proposed were likely to disrupt their industry. Others were more positive. They perceived Inland Revenue’s engagement about transformation was strengthening. This variation in perception continues in 2018, and may reflect the variations in experiences across different Inland Revenue functions. Tax agents are mainly positive about Inland Revenue’s operational engagement In 2018, tax agents surveyed are mainly positive about Inland Revenue’s engagement. Nearly nine in ten think Inland Revenue’s engagement is satisfactory, good or excellent, and the level of engagement is about right. Three quarters also think engagement is getting better or staying the same. Tax agents interviewed were positive about Inland Revenue’s day-to-day and operational engagement. This reflected their professional and constructive working relationship, and the ability to get operational information or help. The day-to-day operational stuff is handled incredibly professionally – no complaints there. (Tax agent) As in previous years, some tax agents are critical of Inland Revenue, rating their engagement as unacceptable, too little, and getting worse compared with last year. Tax agents are seeking more timely engagement and delivery on promises Tax agents surveyed rated the efficiency of Inland Revenue’s engagement less positively than other stakeholder groups. Around half of tax agents agree Inland Revenue listens and its engagement is accurate, responsive, and consistent. Only one in ten tax agents agreed Inland Revenue’s engagement was timely and it delivered on promises. Tax agents are less supportive about how Inland Revenue is changing and its ability to deliver Half of tax agents surveyed agree Inland Revenue is changing for the better, compared to three quarters for all stakeholders. However, two thirds agree Inland Revenue will make the tax system better for New Zealand. 38 We interviewed two agents/intermediaries, and seven people completed or partially completed the survey, a response rate of 70%. These results are indicative. 39 We included one of the member organisations in the business representative group as they had a more strategic and public interest view in their relationship with Inland Revenue. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 26 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Only a third are confident Inland Revenue will successfully deliver the change. Two thirds are also neutral on Inland Revenue creating seamless services for shared customers. This lack of confidence may reflect a lack of detailed information about the changes and how the changes will impact tax agents’ businesses. Stakeholders are feeling a lack of information... especially as we come close to changes being implemented. We know big changes are coming in 12 to 24 months, but we don’t know exactly what that looks like when the rubber hits the road. (Tax agent) Tax agents have mixed views on Inland Revenue’s engagement about transformation In contrast to other stakeholders, most tax agents/intermediaries do not agree Inland Revenue is engaging with them about the transformation. Only a quarter agreed Inland Revenue is inclusive in its engagement about the transformation. However, just over half agreed Inland Revenue is proactive in creating understanding of its transformation priorities and goals. Two thirds also agree Inland Revenue ensures awareness of the implications of the changes for businesses, and understands how stakeholders can contribute to the change. Tax agents have mixed opinions on Inland Revenue’s collaboration Just over half agree Inland Revenue creates opportunities for collaboration, while a third agree Inland Revenue collaborates to create innovative solutions. In qualitative interviews, tax agents interviewed described their engagement with Inland Revenue as ranging from informing to collaborating. Collaboration occurred through working groups and with their relationships managers. Stakeholders thought Inland Revenue consulted in rulings and policy areas. Tax agents wanted to see more collaboration, although a lack of resources on both sides may impede collaboration. Tax agents want more involvement and information about transformation Feedback from tax agents indicates key improvement areas are enabling involvement and providing more detailed information about the transformation process. In particular, tax agents want to understand the implications of the changes for their business. Other areas of improvement are more timely information and delivering on promises. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 27 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Large enterprises 40 Large enterprises are a diverse group with complex national and international financial and tax needs In 2018, Inland Revenue included large enterprises in this research. Large enterprises are companies with an annual turnover of more than $100 million. Large enterprises engage with Inland Revenue both operationally and strategically, and tend to have an account or relationship managers. They engage with Inland Revenue frequently, and can have several touch points within their organisation. Some large enterprises are members of Inland Revenue’s reference or advisory groups (e.g., the corporate tax group). However, others have little engagement with Inland Revenue’s Executive Management Team. The feedback below is based on the large enterprises included in the research. Given the mixed views and concerns raised, further research is needed to fully understand their perception of Inland Revenue’s transformation and engagement. Large enterprises have reasonable to positive experiences of their day-to day engagement with Inland Revenue At an operational level, stakeholders are positive about the engagement with Inland Revenue’s relationship managers. They described having an open relationship with their relationship manager, and were able to have constructive discussions about any concerns. Open relationship. We’re very comfortable raising our concerns with them and bringing issues we may have... No concerns with the relationship. (Large enterprise) Large enterprises noted engagement with relationship managers declined over the last six months Large enterprise stakeholders thought engagement worsened over the previous six months. Large enterprises interviewed noted their relationship managers were overloaded due to Inland Revenue’s restructuring process. As a result, they were less accessible. These stakeholders adapted how they engaged to avoid further overburdening their relationship manager, for example only contacting Inland Revenue once a week instead of several times a week. However, some were frustrated by delays processing their accounts, particularly when penalties were added. We are fairly well aware of the turmoil Inland Revenue have gone through over the last 12 months. That put pressure on the strength of their relationship, people moved around... we managed to negotiate through it. (Large enterprise) Over a longer term, one large enterprise stakeholder noted a positive cultural shift at Inland Revenue from a combative to collaborative and more user-friendly organisation. This stakeholder recognised that culture change takes time and was positive about the changes to date. Large enterprises are aware and have a reasonable understanding of Inland Revenue’s transformation Large enterprises are aware of Inland Revenue’s transformation. In qualitative interviews, stakeholders reported a moderate understanding of how Inland Revenue is changing. Some primarily consider the transformation as a technology change. Stakeholders interviewed had learned about Inland Revenue’s transformation through sector groups such as the corporate tax payer group. A few had attended seminars or workshops, which were useful for learning about the changes at Inland Revenue. 40 We interviewed three people from large enterprises. We sent the survey to seven people, three completed it. The survey results were polarised. We have therefore presented the qualitative results only. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 28 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected A few stakeholders noted Inland Revenue visited their offices to discuss upcoming changes. Some welcomed the visit as it enabled them to prepare for changes. Others felt it was more of a PR exercise. These stakeholders had expected more information tailored to how the changes would directly impact them so they could prepare for it. We took it more as a feel good thing rather than wanting to take on board our feedback about the changes \[increasing the workload for little direct benefit\]. It was more they just came and talked. The CFO made strong comments but we didn’t expect to see any changes and there weren’t. (Large enterprise) Large enterprises perceive the changes are not addressing their complexity and are creating more work Stakeholders interviewed questioned whether the transformation is adequately considering the needs of large enterprises. Large enterprise stakeholders were critical that coming changes would create significantly more work for them (e.g., filing more information, challenges managing complex payrolls). They also identified technological difficulties of the new system not accommodating multiple companies under one tax manager. I think it is more focused at the individual as opposed to the company. It might be good for the small tax payer at home... but it doesn’t work in a corporate... no benefits for a corporate. (Large enterprise) Large enterprises do not think Inland Revenue is collaborating with them Large enterprise stakeholders interviewed think Inland Revenue informs and consults them about changes. They would prefer to be more involved and collaborate. Barriers to collaboration for large enterprise stakeholders are lack of trust, a need to build mutual understanding of needs, more open communication and dialogue, and a cultural shift. Stakeholders spoke of ‘one way traffic’ from Inland Revenue. Still inform and consult. It would be nice to have them doing that \[involve/collaborate\], but account managers come in and talk to us and formulate risk assessments, it’s one way traffic. It’s them pulling information. I haven’t seen that change. I’m encouraged that they want to move to that space, but it’s a work in progress. (Large enterprise) Several suggestions were put forward by large enterprises to strengthen engagement with Inland Revenue:  Changing the approach to materiality in the context of large enterprise accounts.  Keeping large enterprises more informed about how changes to Inland Revenue will affect them.  Addressing concerns that changes are going to significantly increase their workload and are not fit-for-purpose for their complex financial set up. Given the issues noted by the small number of large enterprises interviewed, we recommend further research to fully understand their needs and to enhance engagement. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 29 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Local government 41 Local government stakeholders were initially included in the research to track changes in engagement In 2015, when the research began, Inland Revenue had limited engagement with local government. Inland Revenue expected engagement with local government would increase over the following years. On this basis, local government stakeholders were included in the research. Feedback from Inland Revenue indicates engagement with the sector has not changed over the last three years. Local government stakeholders have the lowest engagement level compared to other stakeholder groups Just over half of local government stakeholders reported Inland Revenue’s engagement in the last six months was about right. A third had no engagement or too little engagement, more than any other stakeholder group. Local government had little engagement with Inland Revenue’s executive management team (nine in ten had never engaged) and low engagement with relationship managers (six in ten never engaged). Three quarters had never attended a seminar/workshop. Inland Revenue’s engagement with local government is mainly unchanged Six in ten local government stakeholders said their engagement with Inland Revenue stayed the same over the last six months. For a quarter engagement had improved. Local government stakeholders have a lower level of satisfaction with Inland Revenue’s engagement A third of local government stakeholders rate Inland Revenue’s engagement as excellent or very good, compared to half of all stakeholders. Half consider Inland Revenue’s engagement satisfactory. Compared to other stakeholders, local government consistently rated the responsiveness and efficiency of Inland Revenue’s engagement lower. Of particular note are that only a third agreed Inland Revenue listens, and two thirds don’t know. In part, these rating reflects that local government stakeholders were unable to make the assessments with four in ten rating don’t know or neither/nor. Local government stakeholders are positive about how Inland Revenue is changing but less sure about the ability to deliver Around two thirds of local government stakeholders agree Inland Revenue is changing for the better, and will make the tax system better. However, only four in ten are confident in the direction, and in Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver the change. Local government stakeholders do not have a deep understanding of or engagement in Inland Revenue’s transformation Around half of local government stakeholders disagree or don’t know whether Inland Revenue has engaged about their transformation. Half also don’t know or disagree Inland Revenue has sought to increase stakeholders’ understanding of its intended achievements and priorities. Around half of local government stakeholders disagree or don’t know whether Inland Revenue creates opportunities for collaboration. Six in ten do not think Inland Revenue understands how local government can contribute to Inland Revenue’ transformation. 41 Thirty one people completed or partially completed the survey, a response rate of 48%. These results are indicative for the sector. We did not complete in-depth interviews with local government representatives. Strengthening stakeholder engagement 2018 30 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Local government’s open-ended survey comments highlight areas for Inland Revenue’s consideration:  Increasing the level and frequency of stakeholder consultation, in particular proactively informing them of changes that will affect local government.  Considering the practicality of proposed changes on different sectors.  Providing training and information sessions to help local government staff understand their relationship with Inland Revenue and the changes to the tax system.  Being responsive to operational queries and consistently following through on communication, in particular easier access to customer service and technical expertise. Continue to update us on changes. Consider impacts on different sectors. Keep us in the loop about up-and-coming tax changes and what is in the roadmap. (Local government) Great level of stakeholder consultation. Consider practicality of implementing proposed tax changes for businesses when engaging stakeholders.
