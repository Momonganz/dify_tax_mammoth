Currently borrowed money for other forms of investments and business is tax deductible. This is where the majority of rental property losses occur. Borrowing costs are a legitimate business expense, and a lot of businesses require the owners to top up toe accounts from time to time. It could be more reasonable to tax gains i.e capital gains, on a regular basis, rather than just when they are sold. This value be linked to the value of capital value and also the amount borrowed against it to stop the transf er of personal mortgages to the rental investments. It would be unfair for those, particularly those with one or two rentals, to have a different approach to business expenses.

Supports New Zealand's democratic society of individuals 2. Supports and enhances the development of an egalitarian society 3. Is fair 4. Is simple to understand and implement 5. Is low cost (has low deadweight) Achieving the Vision: The Tax Working Group needs to spell out the changes required to transition, over a relatively short time frame of, say, 5 years, from our existing tax system to one which achieves the above vision. Wealth Inequality: Since the end of World War II wealth inequality has been increasing at an accelerating pace in New Zealand and the existing tax system and the changes to it have struggled with population growth, technology changes, and citizens’ desires for a “better life”. The results have been underfunded health and education systems and increasing disparity in social mobility and socio-economic status. Tax system changes in the 1980s and the privatisation of many industries heavily reliant on natural resources (fisheries, forestry, ports, airports, railways, power generation, etc) have quickly divided New Zealand society into “haves" and "have nots”. In particular, the current tax system strongly encourages private acquisition of natural resources and the subsequent accumulation of unearned wealth by the retention of the economic rent for those resources. In it’s simplest form the evidence for this is in the many many examples of huge wealth gains by private individuals who invested in land on the outskirts of cities and simply waited for the city to grow past them, cashing in on the infrastructure and other investments made by society as a whole. In their seminal work and subsequent book entitled The Spirit Level, Wilkinson and Pickett demonstrated that wealth inequality correlates closely with a variety of societal ills. This is why the tax system needs to achieve the vision. The Solution: In 1879 political economist and philosopher Henry George published his book Progress and Poverty which examined the conundrum of why poverty increased in a society in the face of increasing progress. He identified the problem as the retention of unearned wealth in the form of economic rent of land and proposed a simple solution - Land Value Tax (LVT). Further resources for researching Georgism can be found here http://www.henrygeorge.org/bob/ \[1\] \[1\] 4 Modern Georgism refers to “land” which is the collection of all natural resources (land, water, air, electromagnetic spectrum, etc). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism. It is a relatively simple matter to extend a Land Value Tax to “Land” Value Taxes. Incidentally, Henry George visited New Zealand and met with Governor Sir George Grey (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_Grey). The Georgist influence in New Zealand remained for many years and is reflected, for example, in the works of Dr Rolland O’Regan and his father as reported in the obituary here https://hgarchives.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/keall-obituary-rolland-regan-1992.pdf by Robert Keall. Conclusion: There are a number of reasons why New Zealand society is becoming divided along racial and economic lines but wealth inequality is a significant contributor and New Zealand’s current tax system is a major culprit. To Georgists the solution is obvious. The Tax Working Group may like to ponder these thoughts: Pay for what we hold or take\*, not for what we do or make. (from the “Land” Rent for Revenue & Justice Association) (\* of course, “take” includes “pollute”) “Land" is not given to us by our parents - it is loaned to us by our children (Kikuyu saying) OTHER: Other Wealth-Related Taxes: The introduction of a Capital Gains Tax and/or an Inheritance Tax will simply create a new accounting industry to minimise and avoid these taxes. Arbitrary rules will need to be created and enforced. The deadweight will not be justified and the taxes will inevitably fall on those without the resources to mitigate them. Greater Consumption Taxes: Seriously? It is well recognised that GST is highly regressive tax - especially with current New Zealand law which supports and encourages the accumulation of unearned wealth. Income Tax: Ultimately, income tax should be phased out (what better incentive to get people involved in productive enterprise). In the meantime, the arbitrary imposition of various income tax rates is quite farcical. Surely our collective knowledge of mathematics is sufficient to introduce a single mathematical function to calculate the applicable rate. 5 From: Sent:Monday, 30 April 2018 11:44 AM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Subject:Submission FUTURE OF TAX SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP, April 2018 First Name: Grace Mairi Last Name: JAY Email: Preliminary My name is Grace Mairi Jay. I have a PhD from the University of Waikato and a M.A. (Resources and Environmental Planning) from the University of Waterloo, Canada. From 1995 to 2010 I was a Senior Lecturer in Environmental Planning at the University of Waikato. Before that, I practiced environmental and regional planning with the Department of Conservation (1990-1995), Hamilton City Council (1988-1990) Wellington Regional Council (1987-1988) and the Wainuiomata ward of Hutt County Council (now Lower Hutt City Council). I am a New Zealand resident and citizen, now retired. I have a son and grandchildren who live in New Zealand and will be impacted by future tax policies. My comments and answers to the questions asked by the Tax Working Group follow. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 6 What does the future of tax look lie to you? In addition to the trends outlined in the TWG background paper, government will experience greatly increased expenditure due to impacts of climate change and sea level rise. These will include:  Damage to settlements and communities from storms, floods and drought. Predictions by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, NIWA and the Ministry for the Environment expect the impact of storms, floods and droughts to increase in future. The Insurance industry reported that damage from weather-related claims in 2017 amounted to $242 million; Insurance Council chief executive Tim Grafton indicated that premiums are likely to go up as a result of expected increases in extreme weather events.  Damage to significant infrastructure Our active geology and erosion-prone landscapes make roads, rail, stormwater systems, power etc. vulnerable to landslips and flooding. For example, road and rail north and south of Kaikoura due to storm damage (2018); SH2 Manawatu Gorge road between Palmerston North and Dannevirke; regular closures of roads around Thames Coast (e.g.Thames to Manaia, (Jan 2018); Whangamata to Whiritoa (April, 2018); regular closure of Northland roads e.g. SH11 Paihia to Kawakawa (Lemons Hill); regular closure of roads to Milford Sound, Haast and Franz Josef; rail links between Napier and Gisborne, Blenheim and Christchurch, Palmerston North and Dannevirke, Wellington and the Wairarapa, Wellington and Kapiti Coast.  Loss of livelihood for farmers from flood and drought. Examples include: Kaiawa area (flood, Jan 2018); Edgecumbe area (flood, April 2017); Bay of Plenty (flood, April, 2017); Taranaki, Wellington Manawatu and Whanganui (drought December 2017), Canterbury (2016), North Canterbury (2015), North Island and west coast of South Island (2013 flooding worst in 40 years), Northland (2010 worst drought in 60 years), Waikato (2008, driest January in a century).  Impacts of sea level rise (together with storm surges and high tides) on towns and coastal settlements. Low-lying areas of Christchurch, Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland are already at risk of flooding from rising sea levels. A report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment noted that a minimum 30cm rise in average sea level by the middle of the century is already ‘locked in’. A recent Ministry for the Environment report identifies an average sea-level rise since records began of 1.76mm/yr (Page 81) and projects sea level rises for the next 50 years (out to 2070) from 32cms (.32m) to 61cms. Further into the future, sea levels are expected to continue rising for the next several centuries. 7  Impacts of sea level rise on aquifers. Many of New Zealand’s most heavily used freshwater aquifers are coastal and vulnerable to salinization from saltwater intrusion. According to a report by M. Ingham et al , saltwater intrusion is an existing and potential problem in many of New Zealand’s aquifers. Sea level rise and increasing incidence of coastal flooding is likely to increase the problem. In summary, I think that future environmental disruptions to settlements, infrastructure and the country’s farming base are going to increase dramatically and will require assistance from the public purse for humanitarian and practical reasons. My Personal answers to specific questions asked by the TWG:  How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? I think that stable and affordable housing, whether owner occupied or rented, is critical for human and community welfare; it impacts on so many other fundamentals such as health and education, particularly of children; the development of community identity and sense of belonging; the ability of families to find and maintain support networks. The current tax system provides incentive to invest in housing rather than non-residential options and this appears to make it harder for people with lower income (who are often also those with young children) to buy their own home. However, I do not think home ownership is essential if residents can have safe, secure and affordable rental housing. I think there should be a capital gains tax on non-owner occupied homes and also that houses owned for rental purposes should be subject to performance and monitoring of conditions of safety, healthfulness and affordability.  Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Yes, I think New Zealand should introduce a capital gains tax that excludes the family home;  Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 8 Yes. New Zealand should introduce a land tax on all land used for commercial purposes, including farming and commercial forestry. Land exempt from tax should include:  land under the family home;  land used for permanent protection of a natural or physical resource. Note 1: land used for riparian protection of lakes, rivers and streams should be excluded if registered for that purpose on the Certificate of Title. Note 2: Improved and unimproved land should be taxed at the same rate (i.e. relatively low); land used for intensive agriculture should not be penalised except as it is subject to a pollution tax. The whole aim of a tax on commercial use of land should be to encourage efficient use of productive land and protection/conservation of non- productive land.  What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? In my view, we need to encourage the most efficient use and conservation of natural and physical resources by taxing commercial consumption and providing incentives for the protection of non-commercial uses. Taxes should be imposed on:  water used for commercial purposes;  land used for commercial purposes based on a standard rate, but which could perhaps vary in accord with zoning (to distinguish between urban and rural land, for example). That means land not used for commercial purposes, such as native forest and regenerating scrub, is not taxed; it also means that capital improvements on land (whether urban or rural) are not taxed.  air – where the use of that air reduces or excludes its use by others (e.g. as with air space, and as when a use causes pollution of air);  minerals, including aggregate and sand  marine and coastal space. Commercial use of all natural and physical resources should be subject to taxes on externalities that cause social or environmental harm. For example, cars powered by fossil fuel should be taxed at a higher rate than electric vehicles. Water used for agricultural or horticultural irrigation or cleaning of dairysheds and intensive agricultural and industrial facilities should also be taxed (i.e. farms should be treated the same way as other commercial enterprises).  Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? 9 Yes. This would encourage people to start their own small business rather than depend on welfare. It would especially help parents of young children (mostly women) to start a business at home while they have children to care for. It would also help people in rural and regional communities to engage in small-scale business that serves the need of their local community, and help to support local and regional self-sufficiency.  Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? Yes. GST on milk and bread and on unprocessed fruit, vegetables and meat should be excluded. The GST on processed foods should be increased to make up for the lost revenue.

After all aren't rates a form of local body tax on property. While some may say rates are a form of service charge for the services city/rural bodies provide to residents the same could be said about central government. Surely the government provides services like Health(hospitals), Police, Defense, etc. GST on rates in effective are a tax on what is another tax in all but name, and an added burden on low income and beneficiaries. Kind regards Michael Cuncannon \[1\] 11 From:Matt Vincent Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:21 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Re: Tax working group Submission Further: 1. For clarity any tax increase will make housing less affordable for me and my family. 2. A simpler tax system would be appreciated. 3. I do not believe in increased funding on university education. As someone who has complete a degree and is currently studying the courses are often of little value and are very much just about ticking the boxes to get the piece of paper at the end. In saying that I generally support educating sciences, engineering and supporting these industries in nz. 4. I can be contacted for discussing these points and have many other comments about issues around spending of tax money in nz.

Saving approximately $50K a year while I've not got a family. GST 1. Any increase in GST would be bad for nz retailers and businesses as this will further increase the incentive to go overseas for holidays and to purchase goods etc where there is lower sales taxes and the products are already significantly cheaper. 2. GST does ca pture people such as tourists who use NZ's infrastructure without paying any tax but any increase will increase the cost of living especially for the people who can afford it the least. I.e. if a family spends nearly all of their income on getting by an increase in GST will increase that cost. This increasing hardship and increasing dependency on welfare. CAPITAL GAINS TAX and LAND TAX 1. The need for these seams to be as a result of increasing property prices. NZers incomes have not been increasing at the same rate as property prices therefore either the lending criteria is to relaxed or money in coming in from outside NZ pushing up prices past what a lot of NZers can affort. Assuming it is the second these taxes are a bandaid and are not fixing the actual problem. 2. If the idea is to reduce speculation on property from NZers and foreigners as apposed to increasing the governments revenue then I would think the solution would be to actually put restrictions on \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 12 doing so. It would be very easy to restrict overseas buyers which would also likely reduce the speculation by residents. 3. Any tax will effect the mobility of the people selling. If they are selling one place to buy another for personal reasons they cannot buy the equivalent because they have had to pay a significant sum in tax. 4. The any new tax as current tax does will be on the increased dollar value on the increased actual value. Just because the property has increased by 30% does not mean the owner would have 30% more purchasing power. Due to inflation the "value increase" of the money would be significantly less than 30% but that would not be considered when the tax is paid. Consider hyper inflation, if a property increase in dollar value by 1000% it doesn't mean that the property owner could sell the property and buy 1000% more food than they could before yet the tax would be on the 1000% increase. 5. These taxes (particularly the land tax) would be a burden to farms more so than city developments. Development of land increases pollution and the need to do so due to requiring a higher future return. Two properties of the same value will be taxed differently if one's value is significantly higher in improvement values. Thus any increase in costs for farmland and any other land will need to be met with an increased revenue to pay for this cost putting proportional more pressure on environmental outcomes and likely mental health outcomes of farmers increasing subdivision and intensification of land. The pressure on farmland concerns me as most of the worlds food is produced on commercial farmland which is daily reducing in area to feed an increasing population. This adds to this pressure which will increase pollution, food cost and a possible shortage of food in the future. 6. Increased taxes on these items will become a tax on people who have saved their income (which has already been taxed) and gained long term assets as a result. Isnt this something we want to encourage all NZer's to do? INCOME TAX 1. Nearly half of all NZers make no net tax contributions after credits etc. Any increase in income tax will be the burden of those who do already contribute. Any increase in tax will make it more difficult to save money to be able to buy a farm or even a house making these items even more unaffordable to everyday NZers. Every single day I make sacrifices to have the income I do for which I am currently paying approximately $27,000 a year in tax. Working 10hr days plus studying after work and trying to stay healthly leaves little time for a family and social life. The alternative would be to take a lower paying job without the stress and time commitment make the most of the tax credit system, live what would definitely less stressful and probably a more enjoyable life but effectively pay no net income tax. Any increase would make that option more appealing. 2. While my current savings rate is very high, if my partner and I decided to have children the loss of income and increased costs would significantly reduce this and a tax increase could significantly reduce my/our ability to save money for the future making housing and land even more expensive. 3. I very rarely go to hospital, have never required any government assistance other than receiving a student loan which is now paid off, I have never cost the country much (highest cost was most likely education) and have always paid my tax and not tried to avoid contributing to my country. Any increase in income tax would negatively affect my life and future despite trying to do my best and in the process contributing to NZ. If this money is not enough when will it be and maybe the politicians need to stop promising the world during election campaigns. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 1. Increasing taxes now while in a growth cycle will make the government and the country more dependent on tax spending which generally has a negative impact when reduced. It is a lot easier to increase spending than decrease spending which is often painful financially and politically. If there was a downturn a spending decrease may be required and any tax increases now may reduce the ability to raise extra revenue to reduce the shortfall when it is really required. 13 2. Any increase tax now will also reduce the governments ability to increase tax rates to pay for items such as wars, natural disasters or economic contractions if they were to occur in the future. 3. To meet a personal budget it requires trade offs and sacrifices and is not always easy. It is not possible for me to just take more money when I do not do that. I believe I pay a fair amount of tax. Considering there are also may other taxes than come out of my "after tax" income (GST, rates, road user charges etc) I am fundamentally opposed to a tax increase as I do not think that NZers get value for money for the tax they pay. Like myself the government needs to control the spending so that it is sustainable. 4. Increasing tax does not fix the problems that the money will go towards. Massive infrastructure upgrades are the result of a significant increase in the population. Encourage families with no more than two children and reduce immigration. Property value speculation would better be fixed by addressing the problem than taxing those just trying to get into the market to work their way up etc. Kind regards Matt Vincent Commercial Contract Services Ltd \[1\] 14 From:Matt Vincent Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:12 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax working group Submission Submission of Matthew Parkes Vincent, 28yo saving to try and by a farm one day, self employed earn approx $110,000 and living with parents as is financially beneficial for both parties.

Any increase tax now will also reduce the governments ability to increase tax rates to pay for items such as wars, natural disasters or economic contractions if they were to occur in the future. 3. To meet a personal budget it requires trade offs and sacrifices and is not always easy. It is not possible for me to just take more money when I do not do that. I believe I pay a fair amount of tax. Considering there ar e also may other taxes than come out of my "after tax" income (GST, rates, road user charges etc) I am fundamentally opposed to a tax increase as I do not think that NZers get value for money for the tax they pay. Like myself the government needs to control the spending so that it is sustainable. 4. Increasing tax does not fix the problems that the money will go towards. Massive infrastructure upgrades are the result of a significant increase in the population. Encourage families with no more than two children and reduce immigration. Property value speculation would better be fixed by addressing the problem than taxing those just trying to get into the market to work their way up etc. Kind regards Matt Vincent Commercial Contract Services Ltd \[1\] 16 \[1\] \[1\] 17 From:Timothy C Bartram Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 9:30 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the Tax Working Group by Tim Bartram My details email: First name: Timothy (Tim) La st Name: Bartram My submission Thank you for the opportunity to put forward my ideas about the New Zealand tax system. I put forward my thoughts as a private citizen. I imaging there will be a vast quantity of submissions on a capital gains tax and other tax areas of obvious contention. I do not have anything to add to these arguments that have not been made elsewhere. My submission is focused on four areas which are unlikely to have had much attention. 1. Tax relating to superannuation pay back; 2. Tax system levelling 3. Wider application of GST 4. Fringe benefit tax exemptions for commercial vehicles I do this because I believe these areas have been overlooked, specifically in terms of the established criteria for reviewing tax:  Efficiency  Equity and fairness  Revenue integrity  Fiscal adequacy  Compliance and administration costs  Coherence 1. Additional mechanism to assist with the looming “Grey Tsunami" On a number of occasions your paper, Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper, identifies the well-known issue of public expenditure increasing to pay for New Zealand’s ageing population in terms of both NZ Superannuation and, also, increasing health spending. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 18 My proposal is to have estates partially or fully pay back NZ superannuation upon death. To make this fair, I propose repayment only commences above an agreed threshold and only after death or the passing of the surviving spouse/partner (if any). Payback would be progressive depending on the total value of the estate. Below is my proposal for this mechanism and my reasoning for why this is equitable. Superannuation payback mechanism My proposal for the partial or full repayment of superannuation is as follows:  The repayment is applied after the passing of a single person OR, if there is a married or de facto couple, the repayment is only applied after the death of the surviving spouse or partner. If say a husband or partner were to pass in 2028 and the wife or other partner were to pass in 2036, the mechanism is not applied until after 2036 for the combined remaining estate.  The repayment is capped at 100% of the value of superannuation received by the person, or the couple (whichever applies). Interest would not be applied.  Shortfalls cannot be recovered if the estate cannot meet the value of superannuation received. Any outstanding amount from the above calculation would be written off, with inheritors not liable for any shortfall.  I propose that the repayments from the estate would be collected on a progressive basis up until the point at which the full amount of superannuation is fully repaid or to a point that the estate has funds to pay. I propose that: o There should be a portion of the estate that exempt from any repayment. In effect, a portion of the estate would have a repayment rate of 0%. I propose the exempt amount, say $500,000, is free to be distributed to the estate. The proposed mechanism would not apply to the first $500,000. If an estate leaves $499,999.99, no Superannuation clawback would apply. o After this point (e.g.$500,000), the estate would have to pay back the Superannuation on a progressive basis. The system would need to be set up so that it is not unduly punishing moderate savers i.e. those who have saved just over the exemption threshold. An example may be to require payback of 40 cents in the dollar of the total estate for any amount over the exemption threshold. o At a point, 100% of the Superannuation received by the person and/or couple will be repaid.  There should be recognition of a time period to release assets following death, fitting in with any existing estate rules.  The government should have priority for payment ahead of inheritors Examples To show how my proposal would work, I have developed four examples with assumptions of $500,000 exempt from repayment and a repayment rate of 40 cents in the dollar. Mary and John No Superannuation Clawback  John passed first and Mary two years later  Total superannuation received by both: $1 million  Estate at the time of death of $300,000  Estate is less that the $500,000 threshold  Repayment total $0 – it is written off  The estate keeps $300,000 Portion of the estate Percentage clawback Percentage retained by the estate Portion of Estate Estate Retains Super- annuation Clawback $0 - $500,000 0% 100% $300,000 $300,000 $0 $500,000 to fully paid back 40% 60% $0 $0 $0 Fully paid back 0% 100% $0 $0 $0 Total $300,000 $300,000 $0 19 Sally and Sarah Partial Superannuation Clawback  Sally passed first and Sarah one year later  Total superannuation received by both: $1 million  Estate at the time of death of $2 million  The first $500,000 of the estate is exempt (0% repayment rate), effective estate value available for clawback becomes $1.5m  The estate retains $900,000 in addition to the exempt $500,000  Repayment totals $600,000 – the remaining $400k is written off  The estate keeps $1.4 million in total Portion of the estate Percentage clawback Percentage retained by the estate Portion of Estate Estate Retains Super- annuation Clawback $0 - $500,000 0% 100% $500,000 $500,000 $0 $500,000 to fully paid back 40% 60% $1,500,000 $900,000 $600,000 Fully paid back 0% 100% $0 $0 $0 Total $2,000,000 $1,400,000 $600,000 Pete and Jeff Full Superannuation Clawback  Jeff passed first and Pete six years later  Total superannuation received by both: $1 million  Estate at the time of passing of $3 million  The first $500,000 is exempt (0% repayment rate), effective estate value available for clawback becomes $2.5m  The estate retains $1.5 million in addition to the exempt $500,000  Repayment totals $1 million – this is a full repayment  The estate keeps $2 million in total Portion of the estate Percentage clawback Percentage retained by the estate Portion of Estate Estate Retains Super- annuation Clawback $0 - $500,000 0% 100% $500,000 $500,000 $0 $500,000 to fully paid back 40% 60% $2,500,000 $1,500,000 $1,000,000 Fully paid back 0% 100% $0 $0 $0 Total $3,000,000 $2,000,000 $1,000,000 20 Sione and Moana Full Superannuation Clawback  Sione passed first and Moana two years later  Total superannuation received by both: $1 million  Estate at the time of passing of $5 million  The first $500,000 is exempt (0% repayment rate), effective estate value available for clawback becomes $4.5m  In addition to the exempt $500,000, the estate retains an additional $4.5 million ($2.5 million after clawback plus $2 million with no clawback as the superannuation is fully paid back)  Repayment totals $1 million – this is a full repayment  The estate keeps $4 million in total Portion of the estate Percentage clawback Percentage retained by the estate Portion of Estate Estate Retains Super- annuation Clawback $0 - $500,000 0% 100% $500,000 $500,000 $0 $500,000 to fully paid back 40% 60% $2,500,000 $1,500,000 $1,000,000 Fully paid back 0% 100% $2,000,000 $2,000,000 $0 Total $5,000,000 $4,000,000 $1,000,000 My rationale for the proposed Superannuation payback mechanism The NZ Superannuation is extremely successful. It is simple to administer and ensures that complex rules do not exclude anyone who needs the payments. Previous attempts to move away from a universal payment were not successful. However, although a good many retirees rely on superannuation, some people do not need to receive financial assistance through the state. Someone who has $10, $20 or $50 million dollars does not need state aid, but still receives it. This does not meet the requirement for equity and fairness. More than this, the beneficiaries of a deceased person’s estate should not benefit from NZ Super. Currently, some such recipients of estates do benefit. I cannot see how it is fair that a couple leaving $5 million to their kids when the couple have received, say, $1 million Superannuation. I propose that the $1 million of the Superannuation is paid back and the estate can then distribute the remaining $4 million dollars. Benefits of my proposed mechanism are:  Administration of this mechanism should be relatively simple. There would be no change to the administration of NZ Superannuation. There would be a simple calculation on the passing of retired people and a calculation and payment by the estate at the time of death (or of the death of the surviving spouse/partner)  Increased public revenue at a time of increasing costs specifically NZ Superannuation and health costs associated with retired people 21  This mechanism is equitable. It reduces payments from taxpayers, some of whom struggle, ending up in the hands of beneficiaries of multimillion dollar estates (rich people’s kids) 2. Benefits of levelling out between tax types The analysis in Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper shows that NZ has a relatively simple tax system especially with regards to the three main tax sources - GST, personal income tax and company tax. I am personally grateful for this when I see what hoops others overseas have to jump through especially in countries with states such as the USA and Australia. My proposal is, over time, to make this mechanism simpler still (for the three main sources of tax). Below is my proposal for simplification and my reasoning for why this is equitable. Further simplification of the tax system My proposal is as follows:  Over time the tax rates for GST, personal income tax and company tax should be the same (or within one or two percentage points of each other)  I am not in a position to calculate the rate but I would assume a charge in the order of 19% to 22%  This change should happen over a period of, say, 5 to 7 years, in incremental steps  Should a capital gains tax be introduced, the rate should be the same  Specifics by tax type include: o A threshold should be implemented below which no personal income tax is applied. No income tax should be applied to, say, the first $20,000 or $30,000 of income we all earn. o Should it be desirable, personal income tax could still be progressive with a higher rate of an additional 1% or 2% after, say, the current $70,000 My rationale for levelling out between tax types I believe there are a number of benefits to moving towards a common tax rate across tax types:  GST is a tax that is incredibly effective at minimising avoidance. NZ, like most countries, has tax accountants spending huge portions of their time trying to help individuals and companies minimise tax reducing the tax payments from individuals and organisations through mechanisms such as working through a small company to reduce the tax rate. An increase in GST is unavoidable for these people and organisations  I would also imagine that tax evasion on GST is difficult for similar reasons  In NZ, individuals take steps to arbitrage between taxes. In addition to the points made above, this is incredibly wasteful. Untold hours are being spent by individuals and their accountants with no economic value  I propose a tax-free threshold for income tax of say somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000. My rationale is: o Such a threshold would reduce or remove the impact on poorer families and individuals of increasing GST o When I look at the charts in Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper I cannot figure out why such significant effort is applied to tax people on lower incomes, only to turn around and apply benefits. It would be simpler and fairer for all to have a tax-free threshold. o This further reduces the incentive for people to set up companies to minimize their tax. In almost all circumstances, an individual would be better off paying personal income tax Benefits of my proposed mechanism are:  Increased efficiency – too much time is spent with small companies and accountants arbitraging tax rates. Instead they could focus their efforts on growing their businesses.  Reduced tax evasion  Fairer for low income earners 22 3. Wider Application of GST I propose two amendments to GST - application on electronic actions and application on all imports.  GST should be applied to all imports, even goods with values less than the current threshold. This would include internet purchases. These transactions have boomed due to the internet. Mechanisms could easily be put in place for offshore companies to pay GST. Large internet companies such Amazon could easily collect GST and pay the IRD each month. This would make up the vast majority of such imports. For smaller companies, mechanisms could be put in place. Firstly, the IRD has made payment very easy and even a small company could easily do this. Alternatively, mechanism could be set up on the border for these smaller companies.  GST should include electronic actions that take place on NZ soil, including ad click-throughs on the internet. If I click on a Goggle or Facebook advertisement, that transaction has taken place here and GST should be applied to that transaction. My rationale for levelling out between tax types  This creates a more level playing field for NZ retailers vis a vis international suppliers. A company such as Amazon is likely making a large number of sales to New Zealand. It is unfair that they do not collect GST just because each transaction is small as this gives them an unfair advantage over local retailers (who are local employers) and it reduced New Zealand’s tax take.  International commerce is growing and will only become a larger component of New Zealanders’ consumption.  Companies such as Facebook and Google do operate in New Zealand (as well as many others). Such companies have employed mechanisms globally to avoid corporate tax. As outlined above, GST is very difficult to avoid. Applying GST to Facebook, Google and the like would guarantee at least some tax revenue from these companies.  Facebook and Google (among others) make money based on mouse clicks. The mouse click for an online ad on their platform leads to a sale for Google, Facebook and the like. The idea that a mouse click does not happen in New Zealand is wrong. If there is no click, there is no sale, there is no revenue. Like all transactions that take place in New Zealand, GST should be applied. The idea that, through light waves, the transaction takes place elsewhere is doubly wrong. This is just an issue of supply chains. The ad was sold in New Zealand. The person’s eyes and ears are in NZ. The GST should be applied in NZ. Benefits of my proposed mechanism are:  Increased tax revenue  Greater equity between New Zealand retailers and overseas retailers  Consumption tax is a fairer form of tax 4. Fringe benefit tax exemptions for light commercial vehicles The current rules state that work-related vehicles are exempt from FBT if they meet three criteria, including that the principal design of the vehicle isn’t for carrying passengers. This exemption is being put to good use by many small businesses purchasing utes, some of which are purchased because of tax advantages, rather than legitimate business need. They can do this because their business address is often their home address. The evidence of this is in the statistics:  Last year the number 1 and 2 vehicle types sold in NZ were utes - the Ford Ranger was both the top commercial vehicle model and the top model overall with 9,420 registrations compared to 8,106 for the Toyota Hilux. By comparison Toyota Corollas numbered 7,797 registrations.  New vehicle registrations in New Zealand are now lead by SUVs, followed by light commercial vehicles. It is unfair that private citizens in salaried/waged jobs paying PAYE have to pay for all costs of their private vehicles, and yet small businesses can use the tax loophole to purchase a twin-cab ute and call it a light commercial vehicle, thus be exempt from FBT and can claim vehicle related expenses through their companies. In addition, creating a tax incentive that has led to the increase in sales of large engine vehicles is poor climate change policy. 23 I propose that FBT exemptions for light commercial vehicles for twin-cab utes and only applied to single-cab utes. 24 From: Sent:Monday, 30 April 2018 9:21 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Good morning Tax people, When I started my business I had returned home from Australia penny less unable to get any Government assistance as a returning Kiwi during the GFC I started a business out of desperation with twenty dollars and employed my Nephew who was battling mental health issues. Getting him out of bed actually doing something productive teaching him a very valuable skill and putting money in his pocket saved his life. I employed my niece who was struggling to live on Student allowances. It allowed her to eat most weeks. I was working seven days eighteen hour days to pay tax on something I had to estimate tax on work I hadn’t even done or was unlikely to do. I actually paid so many different types of tax I paid more tax than Google. And then I had to pay Provisional. Then I had a relationship with the IRD. I have never had a parking ticket. Never been to court, Never even had a warning, never missed a payment. Never missed a day of work Paid everything on the dot. Paid more than what I was obliged to pay Treated like a criminal For Contractors a pay as you earn is very important as I didn’t know from one day to the next how much I owed I payed 50% straight to IRD and I still owed. If you ask anyone no one has had a good interaction with IRD or paying their tax and it just keeps rolling on for years and years and years. There is no way to say hay I want to stop. The end, I give up. All people want to do is impr ove their lot & you are taxed to death. People work to improve their lives and the more you work the more IRD turns you into a criminal. Now I work for a monopoly and I actually work less than four hours a day and make more than when I was Contracting working eighteen hours a day seven days a week Working and earning a living off you’r skills should be celebrated, you are feeding your family passing on your skills showing the way to youth. Employing people. In New Zealand We crucify people to the point of turning normal hard working blokes suicidal. New Zealand’s tax system not fair to small businesses. The company I work for now pays no tax at all. Contracting means your at top of your game taking on all comers or you don’t get paid. You really are very good at what you do and know your stuff backwards. These types of people are the very ones you want to encourage not property developers selling overpriced houses. Encourage the people who make & do teach & employ In the end I was too small to be small & not big enough to hop to the next level. New Zealand is a poorer place for me not being in business as I was chief Draftsman for Asia pacific with ABB and that’s what I tried to replicate with my business. Now nobody does it, it’s done over seas.

Before I went on provisional tax I could budget for my tax. I understood where and when payments are due. Now I am on provisional I am completely lost and have never gained a basic understanding of the system. I feel as if some one could rip me off and I would not know it. My income fluctuates there fore my payments alter and I randomly get a rebate then it gets taken away again???. Suggestions. 1 Make provisional tax optional ( As larger companies prefer it) 2 Raise the base line for provisional to $120,000 per year (Incomes have increased, but the base line has not and now includes people who would have once missed out ) Thanks John Wells Sent from Mail for Windows 10 \[1\] 27 From:Warren Snow Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 7:30 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Amended Submission. Please discard the earlier version To the Tax Working Group I’m grateful that I live in a democracy and have this opportunity to have my say. Tax should as much as possible directly encourage rapid change towards a sustainable and more equitable society. Business likes certainty and so any imposition on business by way of taxes should ensure no particular business is disadvantaged unduly by allowing for freeloaders or through favouring a sector or business over others. Having said that, taxes should encourage all businesses to internalise environmental and social costs. Why should farmers get a free ride on the environment because they are our dominant exporters? Why should children not be able to swim in the river at the front if my home at 90 Mile Beach because about a dozen farmers are filling it with farm nutrients, and run-off from chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Why also should massive retailers be able to push more and more unrepairable short life products on to the market that mostly end up as waste within a matter of months or even weeks or days. And why should we have to ensure vast quantities of packaging that is mostly ending up in landfill or the litter stream – even worse in the marine environment. My suggestions follow: 1. Tax energy sources that create CO2 – this probably comes under the ETS I think but overall I think environmental taxes can be effective. This includes taxing resource use. 2. Tax landfill methane emissions (separately to the current landfill levy) at a proportionately higher rate given that they are around 30- times more potent than CO2. These can be measured. Gas captured from landfills is not renewable energy because it’s created as a result of the destruction or renewable and non-renewable resources and only captures a very small proportion of the gas generated by landfills.( I note that landfills are part of the ETS) 3. Require that buildings that are demolished (as hundreds of perfectly usable ones are very year in particularly Auckland) and that are not re-sited or properly deconstructed, pay a carbon fee of a certain amount per square metre (to preserve the remaining utility values of the building and the embodied energy that was used to create it). This fee needs to be high enough to make it cheaper to deconstruct or re-site than to demolish. 4. Require mandatory product stewardship schemes on tyres, appliances, electronics, clothing beverage containers, building products etc. Producers should be responsible for the whole life cycle of the products they put into the market. This will not only create many thousands of jobs, it will reduce our waste volumes and encourage local retailers, wholesalers etc. to demand reparability, more durability and recyclability of products they import – plus of course less waste. Voluntary schemes don’t work apart from token amounts by those that are involved such as glass, packaging, paint, farm wrap etc. because of freeloading which results in low commitment by participants and poor outcomes. This would apply even to what some people would think are ‘goods’ like solar panels. These need to be designed for disassembly in 20 to 25 years at the end of their life. At present they are looking like they will be a huge problem because no-one thought about end of life dismantling and recovery of materials or even re-use in the rush to produce them for the new demand – a typical example of unintended consequences. The same with electric car batteries. Specific examples of product stewardship which could be implemented immediately to good effect, \[1\] 28 a. Introduce a mandatory product stewardship scheme where all beverages must have a refundable deposit of say 10 cents added to them to encourage recycling. This will take us from less than 40% we are currently recycling to at least 85% - an increase of 750 million containers. It will create more than 2,000 new jobs and massively reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment. And will save ratepayers in NZ between 23 and 40 million dollars annually, not to mention massive reductions in landfill disposal costs for councils. Remove GST from food b. Require retailers to pay a tax on all appliances and electronics they import which can be avoided by offering a full sales and service regimen where customers can have things repaired rather than discarded. Proper product stewardship per item 4. might suffice to achieve this. c. Introduce a mandatory product stewardship scheme for tyres that includes all producers/importers and has penalties for ‘free-loading’ d. Put a levy on plastic bags – UK and many other countries are doing this 5. Introduce a capital gains tax on sales of homes apart from the one home the owner lives in. There’s so much discussion on how well one world work, but even if it doesn’t have a huge effect on costs of homes, it might slow down the flicking of homes by speculators and put a tidy sum into the consolidated fund to help run the government. 6. Introduce a Financial Transaction Tax. Such a tax of say .01% of all transactions would be easy to collect because of trading automation and can help stop the kind of financial activity that has zero benefit to society and exposes us all to significant risks(1)’. 7. Make sure multinationals like apple Amazon etc. pay their fair share of tax in NZ. I’m sure there are ways to achieve this 8. Bring Farmers into the emissions trading scheme. Farming is destroying habitat, stream and waterways at an alarming rate and sends thousands of truckloads of soil down to the sea at each river entrance in bad weather. It’s time they are not rewarded for these externalities of doing business. I support stages but much quicker than over the last few years. I also think we should explore the idea of the state buying some farms that are causing the most damage or are in very sensitive environments. It’s incredible how quickly they can repair and perhaps the cost can be covered by the increase in tourism. At present farmers that are prepared to fence off their streams in Northland are only required to fence off 2 metres. This is almost meaningless – it needs to be at least 5 metres and ideally where possible, the queen’s’ chain 9. Require inbound tourists to pay say $20 each to visit NZ and enjoy what we are trying to preserve – perhaps if they are spending more than one week here. More funding for DOC and even the consolidated fund. 10. Remove the tax break on advertising for companies that don’t have an effective CO2 mitigation and waste reduction strategy (if it’s practical to do so). 11. Apply import levies/tariffs on products that come from countries that do not have fair labour and decent OSH and environmental standards. For example companies can avoid costly environmental, labour and OSH requirements simply by packing up and moving to a low wage low compliance economy. This has gutted our manufacturing base and is patently unfair. If these same factories that we get most of our products from where in our towns, we would be aghast, but we turn a blind eye to them when they are in China or Vietnam or Bangladesh. I don’t know how this would be implemented but we need to create fairer more equitable and sustainable world economy somehow. This is also related to item 6. 12. This is not so much a tax issue but let’s stop penalising beneficiaries for earning a little extra money to help them get along. A generation of people now see work as a dirty work you get penalised for – wrong signal! Or increase how much they are allowed to earn -say bring it up to $200. I hope that tax review is also looking at a national dividend or wage which could solve this issue. 13. As an underlying principle, tax unsustainable use of energy and resources more and labour and initiative less. 14. Evaluate the idea of a national dividend or universal basic wage 15. Everyone needs to pay tax but I think those that have inherited large sums or have become very successful financially have multiple advantages over those that have not been so lucky – so I think there 29 should be a way to redistribute some of that wealth through taxes such as through death duties - without going too far. Many people think all taxes such as the landfill levy should be hypothecated. I agree but only up to a certain limit. When they introduced a landfill levy in the UK some consultants from the US moved there to ‘wastefully’ mine the resulting easy money. There is a call to increase the NZ landfill levy by a significant amount. I agree with it being increased but not for it all to be hypothecated. If say it was to be increased to $40, then I would say no more than half should be hypothecated back to fund resources recovery projects, research etc. Otherwise a perverse incentive will have been created and some funds squandered. Best to use the ‘bad’ of waste to help fund the overall ‘good’ of running the government I think.

Warren Snow \[1\] 30 From: Sent:Monday, 30 April 2018 7:10 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Sir Madam My only submission on this work is to increase the GST threshold from $60,000 to $75,000. This would allow small companies like the one my wife and I own to operate without the worry and cost (in time and money) of filing GST returns and adjusting our rates to fit this. Many companies with this level of turnover are sole traders (or whatever the modern term is) and are in addition to the core PAYE tax job that these folk hold. We still pay the right tax at the annual tax return process so aren’t avoiding tax, we just pay it in one lump sum. Please consider this in your working group deliberations.

Most of the poor families are maori that have been moved from there land base for work or for the simple fact that there is no land left for them to live on most losing their culture along the way. Look at Vattel and then try to say how GST on food fits The end or object of civil society is to procure for the citizens whatever they stand in need of, for the necessities, the conveniences, the accommodation of life, and, in general, whatever constitutes happiness, with the peaceful possession of property, a method of obtaining justice with security, and, finally a mutual defence against all external violence. It is now easy to form a just idea of the perfection of a state or nation: everything in it must conspire to promote the ends we have pointed out. Emer de Vattel, The Law of Nations, Or, Principles of the Law of Nature, Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns, with Three Early Essays on the Origin and Nature of Natural Law and on Luxury (LF ed.) \[1797\] Simply put it is like giving a man just enough water to live on each day then taking 15% back of him. he will live but not well and not for long Is it not enough that we must pay more for food produced here to match export market prices sending our best overseas.

Yet in doing this we add to the problems of Auckland the housing the roads the gangs the drugs there are so many of our people lost their already we do not need to add to them give us a chance Give tax incentives for companies to set up in place like Kennedy bay low taxes in places like ours would bring work to us where there is already a work force that has its own homes that we don’t have to rent. lower cost in land, wages, no lost time on motorways, more work time, higher production, more exports and you can sea fright to any port in New Zealand places like Coromandel would grow there is nothing to lose just gains then when a disaster strikes like in Christchurch and Kaikoura ever thing is not in one place plus you have small sea ports around the country to replace the roads. Working for benefits This can be done for a gain but is not at the moment most will do some course that they never work in just to tix a box. Use this to bring Maori back. Forcing people on some benefits back to Maori organizations like marae to gain a cultural understanding will be more of a gain than teaching them a course on how to make coffee getting them up each day to spend time at the marae making them more as a person giving them a better grounding solving some of there family problems with a better understanding of who they are allowing them to want to be more productive thank you for your time DANIEL BENSON \[1\] 33 From: Sent:Monday, 30 April 2018 1:53 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Submission Please see my submission below ... -Introduce an additional top tax tier, applicable to income of over $180000 at say 42% or 39%. -Tax Global Companies operating in NZ but sending profits offshore, paying little or no tax. -Tax profits made by business' owned/operated by Charities above a certain threshold; say $50000 so pseudo corporates like Sanitarium can't make millions in profits and pay no tax. -Never introduce a capital gains tax on the family home and land. -Remove GST on Local Government rates, it's a tax on a tax.

Please consider my views and I thank you for your work. kind regards Joseph McDonald ROBIN HOOD TAX (FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX) Who Pays: Banks and foreign exchange speculators. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzZIRMXcxRc How much: .01% on all finance transactions. Ease of Collection: Collected from less than 200 financial institutions. Tax collected: $Billions Voter Effect: Loved by Labour, Green, NZ First voters and anyone who loves Robin Hood. Costless to the majority of voters. OIL, GAS and GOLD ROYALTIES How: Renegotiate mineral royalties. Why: Because a government can. How much: Simply double the existing royalties. Ease of Collection: An accounting entry. Tax collected: $500 million Voter Effect: Putin did this in Russia and it certainly didn’t hurt him at the voting booth. BANK PROFIT EXPORT TAX Why: Aussie banks export $4 billion of profits per year. The majority of this profit derived from housing mortgages. This is $4 billion of investment capital lost to the New Zealand economy. Scenario A: Tax: A 50% tax levied on repatriated profits. Tax Collected: $2 billion Use of Funds: $2billion per year for a State Advances Corporation to low interest finance the building of 4,000 affordable ($500k) homes per year. Scenario B: Tax: A 50% tax levied on repatriated profits unless the banks reinvest half their profits into NZ Shares, NZ Small and Medium Business, NZ Venture Capital Funds. Dividends from this reinvestment would be taxed at the normal rate. Pushback: Bank lobbyists would claim capital flight but really, would the banks not want to stay and take only $2billion profit? \[1\] 35 Benefit: Affordable homes or a pool of job-creating business investment. Who pays: Aussie banks and international banks – whats not to like! Voter Effect: Loved by NZ First, Labour, Greens voters. GST - FOOD EXEMPTION Tax Exemption: No Gst paid on any retail food, meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables and cleaning products. Collection: Simple exempt supermarkets, dairies, greengrocers, butchers and fishmongers from collecting GST. Excluded: Restaurants, fast food, wholesalers, farmers. Benefit: The poorest members of the population have their food costs reduced by 15% Voter Effect: Loved by the poorest voters, though all voters receive some benefit. Supported by the majority of fair- minded voters. INCOME TAX 1. Exempt the first $50,000 of earnings from any income tax at all. 2. $50,000 to $200,000 pay 30% 3. Top tax rate of 45% on income over $200,0000 Voter effect: Liked by the huge majority of the population who earn around or less than $50,000. TECH COMPANIES PROFIT TAX Who Pays: Amazon, Google, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Spotify, others ... Why: Tech companies currently avoid paying significant income tax in New Zealand via various cost transfer tax schemes. How: Levy 5% tax on Gross Revenue. Exempt them from any other income tax. Ease of Collection: Require collection by NZ issuers of NZ Consumers Visa, Mastercard, Amex cards. Avoidance: If tech companies pushback by charging NZ customers 5% higher prices than international customers this would be deemed income tax avoidance and subject to a penalty of 5 times the tax avoided. Tax Collected: $Billions Voter effect: Costless to the majority of voters CAPITAL TAX Why: The rich receive their income as capital gains on land, property and investments. The increasing scarcity of resources and compounding interest gives them increasing capital gains every year. Currently, this income is not taxed which is unfair. Ease of Collection: Collection of unrealised capital gains is complex. A simple capital tax rather than a capital gains tax on individual transactions would make an easier collection. Tax Rate: Levy an annual 1% tax on a person or entities net worth. Who pays: Property speculators, landlords, capitalists. Individuals, companies, trusts, family trusts. Exemptions: Family home. Anyone with a net worth under $2million. Charities. Tax Collected: $billions and $billions Benefits: Collect lots of tax. Side effect - incentivises better returns on investment. Voter effect: Majority of voters outside the net. FOREIGN LAND BUYERS TAX Who pays: Non-New Zealand Passport Holders. Trusts and companies where the beneficial owners are non-New Zealanders. Tax: 25% of the purchase price of land and buildings. Ease of collection: Require collection by lawyers and conveyancers. Either the purchaser can show an NZ passport or cannot. Tax collected: $billions 36 Benefit: Reduce foreign demand for NZ housing. Stabilise house prices. Voter effect: Costless to New Zealand passport holders. WORKERS EDUCATION EMPLOYER TAX REBATE Tax: Apply 50% tax rebate for all paid worker training hours for employers of apprentices, staff undertaking uni study while working, staff on tech courses while working. Benefits: Increase the nations human capital. Voter effect: Liked by workers and employers. PRIMARY EXPORTERS INCOME TAX RATES Tax: Levy 33% tax rate on income derived from export of ‘commodites’, eg. raw logs, milk powder, carcass meat, raw wool. Levy 28% tax rate on income derived from ‘value added’ further processed primary exports eg. milled framing timber, infant formula, branded supermarket ready cuts of meat, wool clothing. Benefit: Incentivise faster movement to value added exports thereby increasing the value of the nations exports and overseas income. Increase investment and jobs. Voter Effect: Long term this will encourage increased income for farmer voters. CYCLIST TAX :) Why: User pays. Auckland City wants to encourage cycling and has announced it plans to spend $750 million on cycleways (A better encouragement could be to buy one million $750 ebikes and give them away to the ratepayers). Cyclists currently are not expected to pay for any of this investment directly. This is an unfair burden on petrol tax and road user charge payers. Who pays: Cyclists and ebike riders. Tax Rate: $100 per year. Voter effect: Loved by car drivers. 37 From:Angela McPherson Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 10:46 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I want to see the tax system being a major part of achieving a more equal, healthy and sustainable New Zealand. These are the changes I would like to see implemented: Closing the inequality gap. 1. Introduce a financial transactions tax. A flat tax @ 0.01% on all financial transactions. 2. Reduce GST to 10%. No other changes to GST. I am against removing GST from certain items for 2 reasons – it would make a simple system much more complicated and I don’t think it would necessarily help people who do not now buy healthy food. 3. Income Tax - <14,000.00 NIL, look at other bands with the aim of the middle earners paying less and the highest earners paying more. 4. Houses – empty house tax. Accumulation of houses for capital gain is a scandal. 5. Capital Gains Tax – urgent Creating a healthier country In the last 2 months we have learnt of the shocking state of the health system buildings. One way we can cope with this is to try to make people healthier. 1. I propose that tax be levied on sugar and excitotoxins. 2. That the minimum price that Alcohol Action proposed 10 years ago be implemented on alcohol and all advertising be banned 3. That current taxes on tobacco be maintained 4. That strenuous efforts be made to introduce healthy food to schools, that school gardens be promoted and supported and that all children be encouraged to be active from an early age (Realise some of these measures are not strictly tax issues) Creating a sustainable New Zealand 1. Plastic bag tax at point of sale as soon as possible – not 2019 as some big users are proposing 2. Carbon tax/emissions tax/climate levy. I don’t care what or how, just do it.

Angela McPherson \[1\] \[1\] 38 From:Nicola Russell Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 10:25 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To whom it may concern In the last 10 years in particular, NZ has become a difficult country to live in. Living costs have skyrocketed and there seems to have been something of a sea change in attitudes. Many in NZ now believe it is ok to make as much money as you can as quickly as you can. That there is nothing immoral about making money and that ‘greed is good’. There is a real disconnect between the morality of taking while others suffer and the understanding that money needs to flow from top to bottom for any country to remain healthy. Otherwise, the end result of poverty is crime, slums, health crises perhaps even civil disobedience. The same make a buck attitude is beginning destroy our environment. What I am trying to say is that governments have a moral obligation to have a healthy society and not just an economic obligation. Those who are struggling and those who are doing well are afraid of more taxation. This is understandable but sometimes a reset is needed so that a better way forward can be achieved. In my opinion, NZ is in the worst state it has ever been in. The gap between rich and poor is huge with the bulk of the wealth bypassing the middle and going straight to the very top. Socially, this has had terrible consequences which have been ignored for many, many years. We need to have a tax system which stops property speculation in its tracks. It has happened because successive governments for at least 25 years have ignored the vast inequality around property investment taxation and income tax and to an extent all tax avoidance vehicles. I know of a few people who have rental properties and don’t declare the income. I personally know many people who own multiple properties (3 or more). For 20 years I have been aware that the problem would lead us to homelessness, poverty, latchkey kids etc. The things I instinctively understood have come to pass and it is much worse than I could have imagined. Thus, the tax system needs to ensure salary and wage earners pay the same amount of tax on their earnings as the self employed and those that invest in or rent out properties. With Trusts and other avoidance measures, this doesn’t happen currently. Infrastructure, health, education and housing all need a lot of investment as does climate change so if we need to increase tax to lift the whole country out of the mire then we need to do so. We should all be prepared to pay more tax even though nearly all of us would feel it keenly if it happened. Taxes at the very top need to increase. Whether that be an asset tax, income tax, company tax or whatever, we must find a way to get the bulk of the money out of the hands of a few and that money needs to go towards things that benefit everyone. Rents also need to be controlled to ensure costs aren’t simply passed on. The amount of foreign debt tied up in housing also needs to be reduced. Rapid and larger scale immigration has also had a very negative effect on NZ. Immigrants should be required to pay a settlement tax which goes towards funding the additional costs involved with large population growth. Wealth category immigrants wanting a bolthole or retirement could contribute significantly eg: $50K or more. They will come here regardless. Tourism is great but its also ruining the country because we have no money to put towards it so further visitors tax is appropriate or perhaps an additional tax for all those who rent campervans which don’t have their own facilities, for example. We have an overabundance of ‘cheap tourists’ so taxes should be aimed at these rather than tour bus type tourism. Maybe foreign bookings of rental cars could attract a small tax. \[1\] 39 Pension savings should be non taxable as they are in most of the western world. Eventually this could result in state pensions only being paid to those that need it. Diesel cars for non business use should attract a particular carbon tax and the government should provide tax credits to those who buy purely electric cars or green energy systems for their homes. I personally believe that tax on the first $30K should be lower than what it is currently as so many people are struggling. A sizeable tax fee allowance would also help students and those who are on a benefit. GST on food should be removed again for the same reasons. Our food bill has risen by about 20% over the last ten years so people with low incomes must really feel the increase. Choosing some foods over others is probably logistically difficult to enforce so GST should be reduced or eliminated on all supermarket food. GST could have variable rates on luxury items as this would effectively be a wealth tax. On a personal note, we live on one income as we had a child with some issues and this was something we needed to do. We lived in London for a while and at that time, a couple could aggregate tax allowances and tax rates to get a tax advantage and whilst I realise it is probably not important to the country, it certainly would be advantageous to those of us that struggle along on one wage for whatever reason. Ultimately, please let your love of country and our people guide you in this undertaking and try to withstand the need for a politically acceptable solution. If our country needs change, recommend it. It is up to the Government to show leadership and to thoroughly communicate that need for change to all New Zealanders. Yours faithfully Nicola Russell 40 From:Simon Vincent Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 10:18 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax working group Submission Submission of Simon Mark Vincent: GST: 1. Consumables purchased from overseas should be subject to GST just like consumables sold through retailers in NZ. 2. There should be no change to exceptions to GST 3. GST is a consumption tax. For environmental reasons we need to limit consumption. Also GST does not limit peoples’ ability to save money for their future and it also obtains income from tourists. CAPITAL GAINS TAX: 1. I agree with the bright line test and perhaps it should be increased from 5 to 7 years. 2. I am against other forms of capital gains tax. If a capital gains tax it is introduced it should only be a REALISATION TAX actual selling the assets and leaving the industry. 3. Any capital gains tax must not be an accrual tax. The reason is that much of the best environmental farming practices in New Zealand give low financial returns. In Europe farmers are subsidised by the state for such activities. In New Zealand they are not. An accrual capital gain tax have to be paid on any increase in the land value even if the owners never intended to sell and even of the owners never made any money from their farming operations. This would financially kill these operations. These farms would then have to be made more intensive to cover the additional costs which is bad for the environment. 4. While I strongly oppose any capital gain tax, if it was introduced it should equally apply to Maori Land. I live and work on the land and that is treasured thing to my family – taonga to my family. 5. I also object to capital gains tax because even if it is introduced at a low rate politicians will increase these rates even though they promise they won’t. LAND TAX: 6. A land tax SHOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED. The reason is that much of the best environmental farming practices in New Zealand give low financial returns. In Europe farmers are subsidised by the state for such activities. In New Zealand they are not. A land tax would have to be paid on the land value even if the owners never intended to sell and even of the owners never made little any money from their farming operations. This would financially kill these operations. These farms would then have to be made more intensive to cover the additional costs which is bad for the environment. 7. While I strongly oppose any land tax, if it was introduced it should equally apply to Maori Land. I live and work on the land and that is treasured thing to my family – taonga to my family. 8. It must be remembered that the land owner has already paid substantial tax on the purchase price of the land. For example, if a farm is work $2 million then at 33% tax rate has had to earn $2,985,074.62, pay $985,074.62 in tax and then buy the land for $2 million. 9. A land tax is not equitable to farmers as they would be taxed on their land (excluding the land around their house) but an expensive house in Auckland may have an unimproved land value higher than a farm, but these people would pay no land tax on that land. 10. I also object to land tax because even if it is introdu ced at a low rate politicians will increase these rates even though they promise they won’t. A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE PAY MOST OF THE TAX 11. New Zealand is dependent on a small group of high-earning people who pay a large proportion of the tax. While, more than one in three households are contributing nothing to New Zealand’s tax take, 663,000 – or 40 per cent – receive more in tax credits and other benefits than they pay in tax. Thousands more are neutral contributors, or are close to it. \[1\] 41 Kind regards Simon Vincent \[1\] 42 From:Ian Wilson Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 9:31 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the group Thank You for the chance to make a comment. As an apprentice from the 1960s I have seen a lot of changes in New Zealand. Many have been good for us and many have been detrimental to most "working class" (yuck) kiwis. When I completed my time in 1970 I went into the National service scheme and was trained in preparation to go to Vietnam. Thanks to Prime Minister Sir Kieth Holyoake that did not eventuate. Probably the only time I have thanked a National party member. I was earning, because of 80 and 90 hour working weeks, enough to be paying 66 cents in the dollar tax. I was still earning 34 cents. When Norm Kirk came along and promised no more tax than I paid in my 40th hour of work I voted for Labour. That was watered down so much it was worth to next to nothing for me. That was the last time I voted for them too. The high tax did not worry me as I thought it was being paid equally by everyone and was all going to make this an even better country. The Lange government changes fundamentally changed or maybe brought out a mentality of me , pure greed was pushed by them and Kiwis were caught up in it.The "trickle down theory " was taken hook, line and sinker by these greedies and promoted by Douglas. The alternating governments since that era have effectively wiped out any potential input the average worker had in his workplace and the ability to use the withdrawal of labour nullified. It is even illegal to resign en masse from your place of work for heavens sake. Any tax reforms that would be fair to ALL those kiwis who create the wealth in New Zealand should address the unequal ability of those on a wage compared to those with income from other sources. We have a working family paying (tax paid)interest on the most expensive basic necessity they will have in their lives, a house, and an investor claiming as an expense on a income they can offset against other taxable income and then sell a house free of capital gains tax equivalent to the worker. We have entertainment, Adverting, promotional gigs, free seats, corporate boxes etc for executives that are tax deductible. And this is fair and related to work? Big stretch there IRD. Having worked for a chartered accountant for 16 years I have seem so much "legal" but in my book, not moral, taxation expense claims. We have major firms in New Zealand that employ so many expert accounting and legal tax minimisation employees and international accounting firms that the IRD accept what they say they are going to pay not even able to match them at any point. We have massive, and are going to have more of them, businesses rorting the GST and taxation system here and worldwide with sham invoices and accounts with bank accounts in tax havens, (including this country for gods sake). No on e wants to pay tax and shouldn't have to pay more than their share, but when one segment dodges then all the rest are unfairly affected.. As I have seen in the past with some in the trucking industry avoiding paying road user charges and Certificates of Fitness and undercutting the honest operators paying the charges the end result is people dying in accidents and honest business owners going broke. A fast track to the bottom. I would like you to set a fair to everyone, level playing field that has a properly equipped policing unit to enforce it. Laws are useless without backup to ensure they are carried out. Regards Ian Wilson \[1\] \[1\] 43 From:Gail Duncan Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 9:29 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to tax working group Retaining the simplicity and comprehensiveness of the New Zealand tax system is important. The purpose of taxation to support health, education, legal systems, police, defence, functioning of the economy in provision of essential services is vital. A move to every individual fending for themselves according to their ability to pay would not build community. General comments regarding the burden of taxation: GST is a regressive tax because it places a high burden on the lowest income in terms of earning power relative to the tax collected. However it is a tax which is imposed without exemptions. Income tax graduated against earning power is not a regressive tax as it collects tax in proportion to income, but it is also laced with exemptions many of which are used to avoid paying a fair share relative to their demand on social services. Those with higher earning power also have the ability to store and gain wealth in NZs current capital gain tax free environment. Restriction of exemptions and the imposition of a modest capital gains tax would balance the tax burden more fairly as well as allowing better distribution of returns on earning power by the possible reduction of GST without impacting government revenue. Reduction of GST would less en the regressive affect of this tax on low income earners. The scale of measures New Zealand is taking to strengthen rules on taxing investment in New Zealand is to be applauded. Focus on investment gains and capital gains, meaning any mechanism that is stored wealth, is needed. Regarding matrimonial property, at the time the agreement is made the parties would have to agree to the capital gains. Capital gains should not include things like cars, furniture, general household goods and other which depreciate in value very quickly and have had GST imposed already. Capital gains tax should apply wealth such as property, excluding the family home, investments and other means of wealth storage. There should also be a levy on estates. This prevents accumulation of wealth from generation to generation e.g. estates worth more than $1m would have a 40% or 50% death duty. This stops cascading wealth. To conclude this submission supports the simplicity and comprehensive of the present New Zealand tax system, however the taxation system needs to be rebalanced by including suitable taxation of wealth and investment. Prepared by Sent from Mail for Windows 10 \[1\] \[1\] 44 From:Nickola Murray Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 9:28 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to New Zealand Tax Working Group Dear Sir, I have grouped my feedback under the same headings as the Background Paper. 2 The future environment I see the ageing population as the major challenge to be addressed by the Working Group - understanding that tax revenues will need to keep pace with future expenditure. While recognising that Maori, Pacific and Asian populations may provide a youthful, growing cohort it is important not to exclude any other cultural groups (e.g. African, Pakeha, Latin) when identifying how to improve educational, employment and income outcomes for all New Zealand residents. Your Background Paper recognises increasing globalisation and the reality of today's ‘gig economy’; the Working Group should also consider that many individual New Zealand tax payers may simply chose to sell up and move to another country if New Zealand’s future tax regime becomes punitive to their personal wealth and detrimental to their standard of living. This is particularly true for experienced professional people whose skills are in high demand overseas, and who can readily find roles which are much better paid than here in New Zealand. The online ‘sharing economy’ (e.g. individuals earning money in NZ via Airbnb or Uber) should certainly be subject to NZ taxes - as per any other NZ income. This income should be recognised as effectively an organised ‘business activity’ - quite discrete from ‘community sharing/ bartering’ activities such as selling Girl Guide biscuits to raise funds for a school trip or trading a surfeit of fruit for fresh vegetables with a neighbour, which surely should seen as a healthy part of being in a community and should not be taxed. It should be recognised that introducing incentives to reduce personal carbon emissions - such as for purchase of electric vehicles -are likely to most benefit higher income city-dwellers, who can afford an expensive new electric car and its charging technology and usually make short journeys, rather than people who live in the country and need longer-range vehicles. Increasing taxes (in general) will only be acceptable to taxpayers if they believe that the government is spending the tax re venue wisely; as an example the introduction in December 2017 of the Winter Energy Payment to all pensioners plus those receiving state welfare payments with no consideration as to the actual needs of any recipient appeared to be an grossly inefficient use of taxpayers money. 3. The purposes and principles of a good tax system I agree that testing any potential changes to tax policy against the ‘Living Standards Framework’ should result in an outcome which is more holistic than a focus on purely economics and $s. In particular, consideration of ‘social capital’ including trust and community connections will be \[1\] 45 important in ensuring that intergenerational equity issues are addressed and the very different requirements of ‘rural’’ versus ‘city' dwellers are considered. New Zealand’s rate of company tax should be lowered to be competitive with that of other ‘comparable’ countries in order to attract investors (both foreign investors and NZ residents). When considering the costs and benefits of potential tax reforms in my view the most important criteria are  1) equity and fairness  2) coherence, including ensuring that local council taxes do not overlap and cause ‘double taxation’.  3) implementation approach and longevity of the tax (my addition) - in particular that any reforms must be implemented and continue to apply over a long time period/successive governments and are also transitioned effectively to ensure that people who have already planned for their retirement, made significant life decisions in order to take responsibility for their own financial futures and grow their personal wealth consistent with the current tax rules are not subsequently penalised under a newly introduced tax regime. 4. The current NZ Tax System NZ's current broad-based, low-rate system with few exemptions for GST or income tax has worked well for NZ for the last 2 decades and generates a high level of revenue. Also, this system is (in comparison to other countries) relatively straightforward and understandable - having lived and worked elsewhere with horribly complicated rules and a myriad of exceptions this is a great advantage and allows most NZ individuals to readily understand their tax position without relying on multiple advisors and paying huge (wasteful) fees to take advantage of the possible loopholes. At 15%, New Zealand's GST rate is low in comparison with most other countries (Australia a notable exception) but this is effective in generating NZ tax revenue and - since it is levied on almost all consumption - is fair to all consumers. Although it is not in the remit of the Tax Working Group, series consideration should be given to raising the GST tax rate as an alternative to introducing new taxes - it is already being collected and administered. 5. The results of the Current NZ Tax System New Zealand residents should be encouraged to contribute more to their superannuation accounts (regularly, starting at a young age, higher %s of income) than is currently the case: the incentives to do so are minimal in this country (PIE and KiwiSaver accounts were a good start but insufficient) and this tax review should explore what can be done to incentivise all individuals to make larger contributions. I agree with the principle that superannuation should be available to all New Zealanders (not means tested) as it is an important safety net for our old people. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate very clearly that higher-income individuals are making a large contribution to tax revenues and drawing relatively little from the system in return.... pushing this curve too far by increasing marginal taxes will have poor results overall in that the incentive to generate additional income diminishes rapidly - I would chose to take more time off work rather than work harder only to pay significantly more tax! Measures of Inequality are very much hyped and your report indicates that statistics are unclear on this - tax decisions should not be made based on poor or inconsistent data. Figures 17 and 19 illustrate that for the top quintile of household net worth, the median family home in this quintile is worth ~$750,000. These expensive homes are generally sited in the major cities (Auckland, Tauranga, Queenstown, Wellington) - most regional/rural homes are worth significantly lower than this amount. It must be noted that those who who live in lower-value 46 homes benefit proportionally less from the exclusion granted to the ’tax-free’ capital gain on sale of the family home. 6. Thinking outside the System Hypothecating tax revenue in the form of levies for particular services/ infrastructure - in principle I believe that this is a good idea, effectively a ‘user pays’ approach. This could be utilised to fund urban transport systems e.g. the planned light rail system for Auckland could be paid through a road-user charge through use of Auckland's motorways rather than being funded through the proposed additional 10c/L on fuel throughout the whole country; few South Islanders will regularly get to use the transport/ infrastructure facilities paid for by their higher-priced fuel. 7. Challenges Housing affordability in the major cities of New Zealand is indeed a problem but the issue is concentrated in urban centres, and prices may not continue to rise so quickly in future - many other ‘hot cities’ around the world are currently experiencing a ‘reset’ and some NZ cities may be seeing this too now. Rural property prices have not risen at such meteoric rates. Due to housing affordability (plus environmental concerns and/or lifestyle choices) there has been a growing ’sea- change’ or 'land-change’ by individuals or families who have moved away from the main centres and purchased (often less expensive) rural properties in the regions. Often the (unimproved) value of the land is a higher proportion of the total (capital) property value than the land value represents for a typical city home on a small section. For most of these newly rural-property owners, less of their personal wealth is now tied up in their home/ primary residence, thereby less of their personal wealth is ‘protected’ by the tax-exempt status of the family home. It would therefore be particularly unfair if an additional, new land-tax were then levied on the land surrounding the family home, as many rural properties may also be sited on significant acreage (e.g. thereby facilitating growing your own vegetables/ a degree of self-sufficiency). A land-tax would proportionately hit the rural-dwellers hardest, thereby creating a disparity of equity between the tax treatment of rural versus city taxpayers. Charging a new capital gains tax on the sale of property (other than the family home) would reduce the returns/ incentive for landlords to make the investment in property assets and deal with frequently- troublesome tenants and maintenance issues (other investment types such as shares may provide higher returns and require less work). A capital gains tax would possibly thereby reducing the supply of rental properties and making rental housing affordability even worse for would-be renters. (My personal goal in investing in a single rental property in Wellington 13 years ago was to provide additional income and a ‘safe investment’ for my retirement years: clearly this was not property ‘speculation’. Instead I am playing my part in providing accommodation for a young family in the nation’s capital. It would significantly reduce my standard of life in retirement if the tax rules were to change in future years so that any capital gain on the sale of the property were taxable.) I would be happy to be contacted to further discuss these points, if appropriate.

The first thing that has to be thought about with tax is the the philosophical structure under which taxation takes place. The reason for this is that the government has as a fundamental concern the responsibility to protect people’s property but through taxation it is also taking people’s property without consent. At the moment the taxation system is Hobbsian - there is one entity that is allowed to take without consent and that is the Government. This creates a lot of resentment and tax avoidance issues and so it makes sense that all tax should be voluntary in the sense the people have contracted in to paying it. The main argument against tax being voluntary, is that if it is people won’t pay it, and since the government needs money to function it must be paid regardless of whether people want to or not. However the benefits of living under a government are so obvious that it shouldn’t be hard to get people to contract into living under a government and paying tax. The only counter example to this would be ‘what if they don’t’. Well in that case their person and property wouldn’t be under the protection of the police. They would be pretty much in the legal situation of someone who is a refugee, trying to get into a country. Tax should be voluntary in the same way as your electricity bill is voluntary. So once people willingly or begrudgingly consent to paying tax the next question is: “how much tax they should pay?” Generally, people want to pay as little tax as possible and there is a question as to why they need to pay any at all. This being because the government creates the money supply, for example by printing currency, so the obvious question is why the government doesn’t simply print more currency and spend it rather than take taxes? The obvious answer to this of course is that the government can’t simply ‘print’ money for its needs as this would cause hyper-inflation and for people to lose faith in the currency. This is only a partial answer however, it simply means that the government can tax in two different ways - it can either tax in the traditional way of taking a portion of the money circulating around the economy and spend it or it can create money, spend it and then remove the same amount of the spent money from the economy by some means such as taxation. It wouldn’t have to be taxation though it might be that money expires after 30 days or something What it does mean is that we can turn the whole conversation around from “how can the government get money” to “how can the government best manage money”. I believe it is best managed in an efficient and productive manner. Traditionally tax has been levied where it is easiest and least painful to levy. Don’t pay someone and then \[1\] 48 ask them to pay tax - Tax them during the payment process so that they don’t notice it as much e.g PAYE. There is another motive to taxation and that is to discourage certain behaviours such as smoking. Finally there are things people must do in order to live and those are seen as convenient to tax. These two last methods are in conflict with one another. It would be easy, for instance to say that we should put the burden of the tax system on things that we don’t want to happen as in the maxim: “Tax waste not work”. We want people to work. We want people to be gainfully employed. So why do we tax work along with things we wish to discourage? To answer this let’s imagine that we did truly put the burden of the taxation system onto things we wished to discourage. Putting the burden of the taxation system on something like that would mean that as the undesirable behaviour decreased there would be a greater level of taxes levied on the remaining behaviours in order to get the same revenue. That could infact mean that the behaviour was taxed out of existence or effectively banned just as it would be if cigarettes were $1000 a packet. To explain this further imagine that we wanted to tax carbon emissions instead of income. The first thing that would happen would be that the cost of owning an ordinary car would become incredibly expensive so no one would any more - people could do something about it and they would. People would get electric cars for instance. Not everyone would be able to afford electric cars and so the tax would end up being paid by those that could least afford it. So the entire \*burden\* of the tax system shouldn’t be placed on undesirable behaviours but a portion of the tax system certainly should. Another principle is that taxes should not be set so high that it is worth avoiding them. My belief is that when taxes exceed 10% of the taxed behaviour tax evasion becomes a problem. It is much better to have 4 taxes at 10-15% than 2 taxes at 20-30% For instance it would be better to tax income at 15% and sales at 15% as opposed to just sales or just income at 30%. Against this there is the extra cost of collecting and administering different taxes. The problems in the existing tax system Some of the current taxes are all right and I wouldn’t change. For instance fuel taxes and GST are probably about right. Income tax is too high and company tax is too high. There is no capital gains tax which is good but there should be a tax in capital itself. I will deal with each of these issues in turn. Both income tax and company tax is set so high that it is worth avoiding it. In the case of company tax it is also the case that companies have their expenses as tax deductable. It should be set at a lower rate but there should be no deduction for expenses, therefore companies would have the simple goal of making as much profit as possible. The only problem with that is that it could make export companies noncompetitive against companies they are competing with overseas and thus there should be a carve out of companies that earn export income. Importantly, in the case of capital gains tax it is a bad idea because it is effectively a tax on inflation. The more inflation is generated the more money the government will collect. This is a perverse incentive. Inflation is already like a hidden tax. A capital gains tax makes it worse. On the other hand a tax on capital means that capital will be used in the most effective money making way. It won't be lying around underutilized. A tax on capital gains, slows down transactions in the economy. A tax on capital speeds it up. I hope these simple suggestions are useful It would be acceptable for the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to contact me to discuss the points raised, if required. 49 Regards, Andrew Rutherford -- --------------------- \[1\] 50 From:John Scott Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 8:30 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To the Tax Working Group Members Studies by various learned people into the capital gains taxation methods around the world shows that a capital gains tax has not made any difference to property values. One study which looked at depth into the Capital Gains Taxation in countries like Australia, USA, Canada, Europe and UK came to the conclusion that New Zealand by not having the Tax was one of the few countries which was handling the Capital Gains Taxation correctly. As the Tax Working Group is to be established to undertake a comprehensive review of the whole tax system I suggest that a review of the Taxation rules that allow large multinationals to set up Charitable organisations that allows them to pay little or no tax be changed to stop this happening. There is one large multinational group in the South Island claiming $90,000,000 profit and no tax paid on that. There are many more and I am sure that the combined increased taxation would help the Minister of Finance. Thank you John Scott \[1\] 51 From:Matt Walkington Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 6:55 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, Please find below my submission. You may certainly feel free to contact me to clarify any points or for any other reason. Sincerely yours, Matt Walkington (1) Changes to the tax and transfers system must always be made to benefit the many not the few and to promote real long term environmental sustainability. (2) New Zealand should strongly consider abolishing GST. The decision should be taken by a binding referendum. (3) Likewise, NZ should strongly consider abolishing business tax in favour of an income tax regime that applies uniformly to income regardless of the recipient. Again, the decision should be taken by a binding referendum. (4) NZ should also strongly consider removing tax exempt status from all entities that claim it - with the decision taken by a binding referendum. (5) The main or only tax revenue source for government should be income tax payable by individuals and all taxable entities, where the definitions of taxable income and taxable entity should be expanded to be as broad as possible. Individuals, business, trusts and other entities should be treated uniformly. There would be no need for a special business tax, per se., though it might be necessary to consider measures to prevent the possible proliferation of small business entities designed to split income into lower tax brackets. (6) As now, the income tax brackets would be set according to the social and revenue goals of the tax and transfers system. ((A single flat tax rate would be a significant simplification and eliminate the possible proliferation of small business entities mentioned in (5). A flat rate would be consistent with an income redistribution system based on payments by government rather than tax relief and progressive tax brackets.)) (7) The new broad definition of taxable income should include imputed income on assets, including imputed rental on all real property (including the family home). The definition should also include all gifts and transfers between individuals and entities (including inter-generational transfers). Above a certain low minimum in a period, there should be no system (of tax credits) that allows for tax free transfer between individuals or entities. \[1\] \[1\] 52 (8) The rate of the imputed income should be a percentage of the value of the asset determined with respect to the prevailing interest rates. An asset or aggregated assets that return income in excess of the imputed rate should be taxed on the actual income. (9) All nation-wide "life-style" taxes should be replaced by a universal fee and dividend scheme that gathers no net revenue. Fees designed to modify behaviour should be collected at the appropriate point of consumption, place of manufacture or port of entry, according to what is the most straight forward in any given case. All revenue minus administration costs should be paid back monthly as an equal dividend into the nominated bank account of each qualifying citizen. The scheme would be universal in the sense of collecting fees from any number of different activities from smoking to sugar consumption to carbon emissions, with different fee rates particular to each activity. (10) Regional fee and dividend schemes would also be possible. (11) A Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) should be introduced on all financial transactions; possibly one to a few percent of the value of the transaction. As a service industry (like, e.g., the trucking industry), the financial sector need not be any larger the smallest consistent with its role: efficiently allocating capital to the productive economy. An FTT would tend to push the financial sector in the direction of greater efficiency by eliminating or restricting unnecessary trading. It would also broaden the tax base by introducing a simple tax that can be collected electronically at little cost. (12) Careful consideration should be given to transitional arrangements when introducing significant tax changes. For example, consideration should be given to allowing tax due on imputed income for certain asset classes to be deferred for some period or until the sale of the asset. (13) A public debate should be encouraged and maintained to help eliminate a range of prevailing dis-or mis-information related to tax and government expenditure. An prime example of such misinformation would the household budget model of government expenditure. Another would be that tax changes and new taxes cannot be introduced in a revenue neutral way. Another would be that business tax cuts stimulate the economy better than government spending. (14) NZ should seriously consider how Universal Basic Income and Universal Basic Services can best be incorporated into to the tax and transfers system. 53 From:Richard Shaw Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 6:43 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Thank you for providing the opportunity for the public to make submissions and the ability to have this free form rather than constrained by a questionnaire. This shouldn’t just be about taxation but about balancing the books, a government that looks only at ways to raise more money while splashing the cash around is going to have a hard time getting buy in to new taxes. Payments that are percieved as buying votes, that are not means tested and fly in the face of good fiscal responsibility take away the credibility that the proposed taxation changes will need. If the current taxation system needs to be changed to meet future needs then the government needs to behave in a manner that legitimizes increases in taxation, but if the governments intention is to raise additional taxes so it can provide hand outs to select demographics to hold onto power then this whole exercise is a waste of everyones time. For my submission I have listed what I consider the taxes which are easiest to implement and broad based and then tried to identify deficiencies in what is trying to be achieved; If taxation changes are going to be made then the new or additional taxes should be ran ked based upon those which are most likely to survive the biggest threat to their longevity i.e. a future change of government. Introducing a Land Tax or Capital Gains tax will be contentious and unpopular and is highly likely to become a major political issue upon which the next election will be fought. To have one government introduce a new tax only for the next to revoke it achieves very little in the long term other than angst, frustration, wasted time, effort, energy and tax payers money. The Tax Working Group has started from a weakened position before it ever got started, the election promises, commitments to co-alition partners and pandering to special interest groups/voter blocks has meant that some of the most effective tools and methods of taxation are off the table/not available. How do you think that you can convince the New Zealand populace that you have a credible approach when you are hamstrung before you begin? I fear that the outcome will be one consisting of poor selections because many of the good options were not allowed to be considered, GST increase, retirement age increases Taxes GST - an increase to 17.5 or 20%. Not very popular but easy to implement, gets additional funds into government quickly enabling implementation of many priority social, environmental, infrastructure etc. Provides the flexibility for the government to then adjust social payments to compensate for those adversely impacted by the increase in GST. While the argument is made that the greatest burden of GST falls on the poorest, the wealthiest tend to be the largest consumers and so will contribute the greatest share of increased GST intake. The GST increase would also allow social exceptions to be introduced such as no GST on fresh foods and contentious items currently subject to GST such as ladies sanitary products. If the government increased GST it would probably be one of the least contentious approaches and it would probably avoid the current outrage about the fuel levy and the revenue from this going to the wealthiest parts of the country to the detriment of the regions. Once collected the government is then able to distribute as it sees best. The other advantage is that the millions of visitors to New Zealand are also paying this, not just burdening New Zealanders with the additional tax. Add a 2% - 5% GST increase to the $14.5 billion expended by international tourists to New Zealand in addition to that contributed by the general populace and you would \[1\] 54 have a very significant increase in tax - a relatively simple increase in an existing broad based tax rather than introduction of a new complex one with increased costs of application, calculation and compliance. Gambling - In addition to increasing the tax take it is also complementary to the existing taxation of alcohol and tobacco with the intention of behavioural modification. Cannabis - usage of cannabis is so widespread in New Zealand that continuing to list it as an illegal substance is a denial of reality. I don’t concur with the Greens proposal to make it acceptable for individuals to grow, it should be controlled and taxed along with alcohol, tobacco and gambling. Off Shore and Internet Provided Goods & Services - e.g. Amazon, Facebook, Linked In and on-line advertisers such as Google - charging GST and import duties/taxes/levies on overseas internet purchases, levying charges/taxes on off shore companies with no presence in New Zealand but who sell goods and services into New Zealand and generate profits here in New Zealand upon which they pay no taxes. On-line business - Taxation/GST charges on business such as Uber and Air BnB The internet based businesses field is going to continue to grow, this is not necessarily an easy tax to apply/impose and enforce but a necessary one and one that a taxpayer base should expect their government to be capable enough to capture as a primary revenue opportunity. Reduction in Expenditure Superannuation - while I am not much more than a decade away from retirement age I recognize that with the increases in life expectancy and ageing demographics it will be necessary for the population to accept a longer working life and a later retirement age. The taxation working group should not have any constraints upon what it is able to consider e.g. Superannuation - taking this off the table when most other OECD countries recognize this as a necessity denigrates the groups credibility and again impacts on the governments image of pandering to specific groups Winter Energy Payment - embarrassingly this is already being ridiculed in the media, sure if you live in Invercargill you could really do with some winter heating help, for the bulk of the top half of the North Island looks like you’ve got a free holiday coming up courtesy of the taxpayers. This sort of payout flies in the face of justifying new taxes - read it and then look tax payers in the eye with a straight face https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/99155422/Put-your-hand-out-for-your-free-700-if-you-re-a-pensioner Fees-Free Study in 2018 - another tough to justify handout if we are facing such a dire fiscal situation in the future. But if you were going to do it why not give it to third or final year students who had already proven their staying power and determination rather than to new students many of whom may decide to defer the realities if life and will flunk out on a tax payer funded year out. Introduce 26 weeks paid parental leave - An incredibly expensive policy, previous generations have got by without this, you really have to ask is this something that the country can afford while it claims that tax intake is unsustainably low. The current workforce has been paying for the superannuation and health care of the retired, governments saw fit to implement taxes for Superannuation but not to save any of this for those making the payments, this folly was bound to catch up at some point, looks like it isn’t far away. The warnings have been made for many years now regarding the changing demographics and many have been careful to provide for their retirement, new and increased taxes on those savings is wrong and isn’t justified as a fix for a generation of government fiscal mismanagement - cut out the finger pointing, a whole number of governments has spent what it doesn’t have and cannot afford. Stop funding unnecessary expenditure and consider fiscal prudence as just as/more important than increased revenues from taxation. 55 Socially Divisive/Unequal Taxes Many of the other proposed taxes on paper look appealing but the reality is that unless they were in place from day one then you are going to create some big losers who get caught up in the introduction of new taxes Land Tax Creating/exascerbating societal divisions - lets use land tax and recent proposed changes to fuel levies as an example; Person A has a multi million dollar penthouse apartment in Auckland and pays zero future land tax Person B has bought a modest house in a rural location with some acreage on which the family can grow fruit and vegetables, keep a small number of livestock, they have a wood lot that provides self sufficiency for winter heating and they have planted native vegetation to encourage wildlife and prevent erosion on steep sections of the land. Their land value is higher than the value of their house value, they are potentially going to pay a disproportionate amount of tax based upon a land tax model while the city dweller pays none and commutes to his/her highly paid city centre office on the new light rail system that the rural dweller has disproportionately paid for. When the city dweller drives his/her new shiny electric vehicle and pays no fuel surcharge which was levied to pay for the light rail system Person B has paid a huge amount as they have an old four wheel drive vehicle which they have to use to cover the often heavily rutted 10km of unsealed road to take the family long distances to obtain medical, social and everyday needs - no public transport is available from their rural location. A land tax appears easy to apply based upon local councils having rateable information already on hand but it may create unintended outcomes, if one individual has opted to invest the majority of their savings on a large house on a small land area and another on a small house on a large land area but both have made the same investment then the government would potentially penalize one of them and make them a higher tax payer than the other - a double whammy if both land tax and capital gains tax are introduced. The large house owner pays neither, the other pays more tax and has the value of their savings reduced as a consequence of government taxation changes - the family home often includes the “family land”. Individuals who have purchased land as part of their retirement savings face financial losses if the government introduces land taxes due to a new tax and a reduced sale price, destruction of hard earned savings by the introduction of new taxes will create a backlash that any government needs to carefully consider. District Council taxation in the form of rates already imposes a Land Tax, recent earthquake impacts in parts of the South Island have had a significant impact upon many districts, the rates increase on our household for 2017/2018 to 2018/2019 is in excess of 28%. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Capital gains tax is a really poor choice, it is a very unfair tax as it taxes both savings and investment, it is complicated and costly to administer and those most likely to have to pay it will find ways to avoid it so it will raise far less money than is promised. This is a tax that also acts as a discouragement to business and wealth creation - why bother if the government is going to take the bulk of the upside. Capital Gains tax keeps being proposed in part due to the fact that New Zealand does not have it and lots of other OECD countries do. While this is true New Zealand is also relatively unique amongst its OECD peers in not providing any tax relief on retirement savings, this seems to be conveniently forgotten whenever CGT is raised. New Zealand taxes income before it is invested in superannuation and taxes any gains while invested. Compare that with Australia Superannuation of UK pension funds, no capital gains tax is the way a large portion of New Zealanders manage to have a standard of retirement that while not on a par with 56 Australia and New Zealand doesn’t drop us to the bottom of the OECD league tables. Those who have worked and saved to provide for their retirement may find themselves with less money available to fund their retirement than planned if a CGT is introduced. Those with enough funds and good accountants and money managers will find ways to avoid CGT and there is a risk that Kiwis may start to look at retirement abroad to avoid a swath of new taxes which will potentially rob them of their planned retirement income. Broad based taxation works, it is difficult to implement many other forms of taxation without victimizing some, including those who cannot afford it, while finding that those who potentially can afford the additional taxation just reorganize their affairs and finances to avoid these new taxes. Something more light hearted to end on; I would like to refer you a Monty Python skitch titled "Dennis Moore” A satirical portrayal of Robin Hood “he robs from the poor and gives to the rich”.......

We have no issue on taxing a residential property provided it is clearly part of a portfolio of two or more properties excluding the family home and essentially run as a business. However, we believe owning one additional property other than the family home, being used for the purpose of augmenting a retiree’s superannuation should not be subject to tax, if and when it is sold. T he cost of living continues to rise and whilst government superannuation increments are very welcome they simply don’t keep pace with continuing price increases for essential goods and services. For most retirees, who have generally worked hard and long in their lives to enable them to actually purchase an additional property the added income (which of course is taxed anyway) provides additional income to help maintain a measure of financial independence. It is a proven and successful method of obtaining additional income whilst no longer a member of the workforce. Even so, whilst this may still be construed as a business by government it should be recognised that the ultimate sale of such properties are in the main sold to provide assistance in some form when older people require home help or enter a rest home. We therefore believe there is at least a moral obligation on the part of government to recognise these particular circumstances and make financial allowance accordingly. We can see no valid reas on for yet another tax under these particular circumstances. Simon and Janet Pay (retired) \[1\] 58 From: Sent:Sunday, 29 April 2018 6:11 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Future of Tax submission Dear Tax Working Group members, I request that you consider the following matters in your deliberations: Inflation-adjusted taxation Inflation-adjust earnings from dividends and interest so that savers are only taxed on genuine gains. You have a great opportunity to eliminate a long-standing distortion and disincentive that penalises savers and those living off savings in their retirement. Regional inequity of untaxed capital gains on the family home Our current tax policy of not applying a capital gains tax to the family home, unfairly advantages people living in Auckland (high capital gains in absolute $ terms) compared with the rest of the country. A good tax avoidance retirement fund strategy is to buy and live in a house in an expensive suburb of Auckland, relying on capital gains as a tax-free retirement fund. This is simply adding to the pressure on the Auckland housing market. I know that it is outside the scope of the TWG to recommend a capital gains tax on the family home, but is there anything within the scope of its terms of reference that the Tax Working Group can recommend to redress this inequity? Alternately, at least noting the inequity in its findings would help advance public debate. You are welcome to contact me to discuss the points raised. I request that my name and personal details not be publicly released, as who I am is quite irrelevant to the matters I have raised, and I wish to retain my privacy.

Marilyn Smith \[1\] 61 From:Christine Larking Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 4:47 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on "Can tax make housing more affordable" I believe that the problem with the current housing situation is about supply and demand - not enough houses for the people that need them. The issue with using tax to try to make housing more affordable, by introducing measures to increase the number of houses for sale, is that, whilst it may be good for first time buyers, it may have adverse affects on other groups of people. I believe that if a retrospective CGT, based on the difference between purchase price and sale price, is introduced it may have the following effects: 1) A large number of rental properties being sold before the tax is introduced and less after, which will advantage the first home buyers for a short time and then the situation will be back to what it was before, because there is still the supply problem. 2) With the sale of a large number of rental properties homelessness will become more of an issue. 3) People with re ntals have made decisions about those properties based on the taxes as they are now, e.g. to spend money on double glazing, that will have increased the rental properties value by more. If there is no account for this in a CGT they would be disadvantaged, potentially loosing money. If a non-retrospective CGT, based on the difference between purchase price and sale price, is introduced then I believe that 4) For the same reason as 3 above, landlords may decide not to improve their rentals more than the minimum standards, leading to a poorer housing stock for rental. 5) There is the issue about what to do with tax on people that have held onto properties that they originally bought to trade. There is the issue of what tax should they pay. If there is a CGT rather than the current system, then it does simplify the situation where, a property bought to trade is subsequently kept. This is a disadvantage of the current system as it is complex and administratively difficult to meet tax compliance for these properties. If other taxes are proposed 5) It may have the effect of limiting those investing in housing to only those people that are already rich as they have more resources to ride out any of the risks associated with housing that can happen e.g. increases in interest rates, tenant problems, downturn in property prices. This may lead to the rich getting richer and the poor/ middle class not able to invest in property. In other words, houses will still be bought for investment, but only by those that have more financial resources. My final point, is to do with not charging CGT on the family home. A lot of people have family homes in family trusts to protect the homes from litigation and claims from their children's partners and also their own subsequent par tners. It is also a tool where the transition of the property to the next generation is easier. If a CGT is introduced I think the exemption of the family home should be extended to those settlors/ trustees that live in a trust property. Interestingly, my mother has 2 properties she lives in, neither are rented and she spilts her time between both equally. One is an apartment in Wellington and the other is a house in Paraparaumu. This must be a situation that is quite common, as both are her family homes. What will you do about this situation? Thank you Christine Larking \[1\] 62 63 From:Simon Schollum Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 4:19 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: No to Taxation & Means Testing of Pensions Dear Taxation Working Group I wish to make a personal submission to the Working Group contemplating taxation policy & practice in New Zealand. A New Zealand citizen with 40 years military & law enforcement service commenced at the age of 18 in 1976 I wish to submit on the following three points: a) Taxation of Pensions (including National Super & GSF) b) Means Testing of Pensions c) GST & general taxation of imported items under $NZ400.00 Submission background: The Retirement Commissioner and others continue to correctly focus citizen attention on maters of retirement and superannuation. Those of us over the age of 50 but not yet receiving National Super are concerned that (future & present) incomes from pensions such as GSF & National Super are subject to tax and combined unfairly for the purposes of Means Testing. Retirees receiving National Super and / or a Government Superannuation Pension are not wealthy. In particular those receiving GSF have paid income tax on their contributions and these should not be re-taxed when taken as annuities or the combination of both pensions used as means testing which currently is used to exclude those elderly in need from reasonable assistance to remain living independently at home: Taxation of Pensions (including National Super & GSF) Living standards among elderly citizens (over 65) are particularly vulnerable to impacts of taxation and cost of living increases. The elderly no longer have the time horizon available to anticipate, plan and engage forward looking contingencies to the erosion of what a dollar buys from year to year. Taxation of Pensions and especially Government Superannuation Pensions (GSF) is offensive. In particular the GSF contributions such as made by GSF members were after income tax had been paid before being invested in the GSF and should not be subject to further rounds of taxation when drawn down in retirement. I submit taxes on pensions where the money was taxed at source should not be re- taxed when being received out as annuities No Means Testing of Pensions Elderly folk receiving (over 65+) National Superannuation and GSF are being denied social medical assistance on the basis their combined pensions is rendering them ineligible for assistance in the home such as walking frames; toilet / shower hand rails or any assistance normally available to elderly frail individuals through local DHB’s. I submit pensions (in particular National Super & GSF) should not be combined and used as a basis of a means testing exercise that excludes elderly folk in need from reasonable healthcare interventions to help maintain them live independently in their own homes. \[1\] 64 I submit that National Superannuation & Government Superannuation Pensions not be combined for purposes of Means Testing No to changing the current GST & of imported items under $NZ400.00 New Zealand is a geographically isolated country. Most of what we make that is good is exported and everything else has to be imported. I submit that the present application of GST to imported good over the value of $NZ400.00 is reasonable and that smaller consumer items under that figure should not have GST applied. The NZ retail customer benefits from the competition pressure that international sellers bring to our marketplace. Local Retail has exploited our relative isolation for long enough and has plenty of opportunity to make their offerings interesting and competitive to maintain relevance to the NZ consumer. I submit the TWG resist recommending applying NZ GST to imported items under NZ$400.00. If you have any questions or would like further information, please contact me via this e-mail address.

IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS You can't seperate out tax collection, complexity,intent and actual results from implementation and the interaction with the benefits system . I am struck by the fact that currently the tax system encourages poor behaviours and effectively 'fiddling' to avoid the intent /spirit of taxation. Example ... many people putting money into family trusts and property to lower their effective incomes to obtain benefits. Family trusts and tax gifting needs to be made tax/benefit neutral. This could be through wider powers for IRS or tearing up the trust structure.An overarching rule that actions should not be and cannot be soley to avoid taxation. Perhaps a minimum tax based on either wealth or income against which deductions can only be made under clear cut programs. Tapered effects for money put into trusts ( ie it does not pass to the beneficiaries immediately but the tax liability reduces to the the giver over 10-15 years say) 2. Capital Gains tax Experience overseas says .. well yes it delivers. New Zealand has always been bold on taking the very best of what they have out there. Really it has to be on everything . If you exempt family homes and farms and Maori trusts etc. you exclude so much of the economy as to render it a marginal tax. 10% on everything balanced by higher tax free thresholds on income. Noone should expect to make gains on shares or property inexcess of say 500,000NZD wihtout some contribution to the tax base ... 3.Encouraging investment in real productive business instead of 'property'. New Zealand capital formation ( venture capital, debt, securatisation, share market etc.) is one of the greatest weaknesses we have and yet addressing it will not be politically a vote winner. 4. Property taxes. If its politically unacceptable to tax housing gains then some modest increases in stamp duty on both purchase and sale should be considered. 5. ACC ... no one truly understands it. It ought to be a social levy to cover health care.Ive always thought that offering a basic healthcare that clearly outlines what is covered and more importantly what isn't at least is honest. \[1\] 67 6. The role of Maori bearing in mind that whatever words you choose to use many of us can't and don't speak the language. Step up to the responsibility of owning and administering 100 billion in assets transparently!. The power of change could be enormous. Good luck...MMM ! Maybe its not easy to keep it simple. William Byfleet 68 From:Alex C Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 3:26 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: TWG submission I would like to see a clarification for the reason Fringe Benefit Tax is such a high rate (approx. 50%) compared to income taxes. Surely fringe benefits should be treated as another form of income? Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, The "New Zealand Taxpayer's Association" has been sending me propaganda urging me to ask you to keep tax rates low. I do not subscribe to the ideology that taxes are inherently evil. But I feel compelled to write something of my own to help counterbalance the NZTU propaganda. It's a shame that tax gets such visible attention when there are myriad other issues facing the government that are all equally important to the future of New Zealand. I am a recent graduate student now working full-time in my first job in the technology sector. Of course, I am not intimately familiar with all the intricacies of our tax system, or tax in general. This submission is structured around the NZTU form submission as well as the questions in the Background Paper. Apologies if some parts are a bit rambly. What do you see as the main risks, challenges and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? I think a significant risk is driven by the relative likelihood of different people to submit their feedback. As mentioned above, I'm writing this in response to propaganda (written by high income individuals) urging me to ask for lower tax on high income individuals. I haven't seen anything from low income individuals, urging me to ask for higher tax on high income individuals. This worries me because this sort of lopsided influence to the government has driven increased income inequality in other countries - the "rich get richer" effect. Other challenges, such as fairness, are already outlined in the Background Paper and I have no further comment on them. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag I do not see any problems with the NZTU's suggestion that tax brackets should be annually adjusted for inflation. This seems like common sense. \[1\] 69 New Zealand's highest income bracket is quite low relative to the average range of incomes. Perhaps New Zealand should have further brackets. Some countries have tax rates as high as 60% for people with very high income. On one hand, this is somewhat unfair to people with high incomes; on the other hand, it's more fair overall than if this money had to be raised from people with low incomes. Company taxation I support a progressive company tax as an incentive for small businesses. Make sure to frame it as helping small businesses, not penalizing large ones - marketing is everything. (In particular, don't increase the large business tax rate while decreasing the small business tax rate) However, this will not be simple. The system must not be able to be easily "gamed". For instance, if a progressive tax is levied based upon company income (or any other measure of company size), companies could simply split up into smaller subsidiaries that are each within the lowest tax bracket. Expensing of capital I'm not opposed to the NZTU's suggestion of full capital expensing. Capital gains tax Capital gains are a form of income. I do not see why they should not be taxed. I think there are two types of investment in the world - there is productive investment, where money is spent to directly create value over time. And there is parasitic investment - where money is spent to reap the rewards of someone else's productivity. Where possible, Capital Gains Tax should have exceptions for those investments which directly add to the economy. Examples of productive investment are opening a new store, or repainting a house. Examples of parasitic investment are most financial market investments, actually, so they can't be made to go away. (One can argue the entire financial sector is parasitic) In the case of housing:  A homeowner who lives in their house is getting real value from the house (it allows them to live close to work, for example). If they grow a garden, the house is now better off. Real value has been added to the house (it looks nicer) and surrounding neighbourhood.  A landlord who owns a tenant's house and pays a property management company to maintain it. They have little involvement beyond purchasing the house, watching its value go up and watching the rent come in. The landlord does not create any real value - only the management company (and/or the tenant). Part of the tenant's rent goes to the management company, which is payment for real value (maintaining a quality living space). Part of the tenant's rent goes to the landlord's profit, which is entirely parasitic - the landlord has not done any work to earn that profit.  A landlord who owns a tenant's house and maintains it himself - acting as the owner and the management company from the previous example. Some of the rent is justified to pay for the service of maintaining a quality living space; some of it is parasitic. (Some landlords don't care about the quality of the home, and neglect maintenance; in this case it's entirely a parasitic investment as nothing has been done to earn any payment) 70 (Somewhat related - New Zealanders who are parasitically investing in foreign countries should be incentivized, as this brings wealth into New Zealand) Taxes on savings No comment. Environmental taxes I'm not opposed to using taxes to compensate for environmental externalities. Lifestyle taxes I'm not generally opposed to tax increases or new taxes for "nice-to-have"/"luxury" products if they are seen as damaging society, such as cigarettes. However, in the specific case of tobacco, it should be reviewed how the tax increase will impact smoking addicts. The goal is not to punish people who fail to quit. We don't want to make the poor even poorer. I wouldn't advise adding a tax to fat, as I have relatives who have found that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet was the most effective way for them to lose weight. Overall, there can be a small role in the tax system for taxes to modify behaviour. It must be verified that the tax actually has the targeted effect and that the New Zealand people support the targeted effect. Capital gains tax - again Capital gains should be treated as income - because they effectively are income, for the groups of people who rely on them most. At first I thought the idea of a CGT made sense - then I looked around my house and thought of all the things I might want to sell later, and how much hassle it would be if the sales were taxed under CGT. I think a capital gains tax will incur an administrative nightmare for individuals. Large businesses are likely prepared for it (the same as they handle depreciation), but small businesses might not be too. Therefore, it should be very limited to a small set of assets. Perhaps it could even be limited to real estate, at least initially - wasn't real estate the main motivator for CGT? I don't know the cost of most of the items in my household and I've thrown away the receipts. CGT should be limited to items that are frequently bought in anticipation of reselling them at a higher value - such as real estate - and then only items over a certain value, such as $10000. This would cut down massively on administration overhead and I'm still not sure if it's sufficient. In case the seller doesn't know the cost of the asset, they should be able to use an initial cost of $0 in the CGT calculation when selling it. Basis - At realisation, for the following reasons:  Assets that are not expected to be resold should not be taxed. If my business buys a photocopier, it should not pay tax when the price of the photocopier goes up following a shortage. 71  Assets bought without the intention to resell them are often resold anyway. If we allow assets not- planned-to-be-resold to not pay CGT, then we must allow all of the CGT to be paid at realisation time.  Some assets may not always have an easily determinable market value until they are sold.  As a consumer I do not want to track the market value of every asset I own. However, I would like to have the option to use accrual. This is because a long-term investor (such as a landlord) would like to spread their capital gains across several years in order to pay less income tax. Transition rules - I am opposed to excluding assets prior to their introduction, and also to retroactively charging tax. Therefore the most fair option is to use the value at the time of introduction of the tax. Allowance for inflation - this is a very tricky one! I can see several pros and cons. Overall I'm undecided. If there is no allowance, this discourages people from holding onto assets they don't need that aren't gaining inflation-adjusted value, because they'll still be taxed on the inflation. It also discourages people from selling assets they don't need because then they'll have to realise the inflation gain. Yours sincerely, Alex Campbell 72 From: Sent:Sunday, 29 April 2018 3:26 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission from Michael C Gibson Good morning I would like to make the following submission with regard to the Tax Working Group's review into taxation in New Zealand. Background to this submission New Zealand is now a ridiculously expensive place to live, despite what spin is put out by statisticians and politicians. The country began to slip into this situation simply by business and politicians hopping into bed together around 1984, thanks to Rodger Douglas and Douglas Graham, from that point forward NZ became increasingly more expensive for normal people. A free market developed, corporates flourished and state assets were privatised then began to lift prices, again and again and the average kiwi's wages simply did not stretch close to making ends meet. From this time wage and salaries were deliberately kept right down, the CPI adjustment became the buzz word. The corporations both NZ and offshore based that operate in NZ have done very well, there are many examples that have been made public where many of these entities pay little or no tax, to the average middle income kiwi (that pays the largest share of tax), has been virtually the only group taking hits consistently during budgets or adjustments, this group has been the governments wallet to take from. Now you ask why am I stating the above? It is simple, something has to give to get NZ back to being affordable for kiwis, this taxation review MAY lead to an opportunity to level the playing field. Taxation in NZ is too complicated, it has become an industry for the legal and accounting professions to practice the art of dodging and looking for loopholes, and most of all it is entirely UNFAIR. Taxation generically - Mike Gibson's thoughts The New Zealand government need to take on board the fact that there are too many dodges and loopholes creating the platform of unfairness, given how expensive NZ is to live in now, real household savings for average kiwis need to come from somewhere. My thoughts are, taxation needs not to be complicated, one wonders why it is so complicated and the only answer I can think of is because of accountants and lawyers looking to reduce taxation for clients, times up on this one please tax review! So the Tax Working Grou p in my view needs to go back to absolute basics, get rid of all the complexity and end up with a really transparent taxation solution, it also in my view needs to be formalised by the people, not parliament. This is too big for the government and affects so many, let the people decide? The number one outcome for taxation in New Zealand in my view is, there is more than enough taxation revenue generated to achieve first world standards for kiwis across all areas of society, in a manner that does not overtax the taxpayers UNFAIRLY. \[1\] 73 There should be a minimal number of taxation types, keep it simple methodology and that will enable FAIRNESS and transparency. I believe that taxation that affects incomes of individual should be equal and proportional to the actual income, no bands or groups or ways of dodging or finding loopholes, all pay the rate set eg. 10%. Taxation going forward MUST include allowance for the millions of kiwis that have worked, and paid tax to have a reasonable pension for the remaining years they have, the pension eligibility needs to remain from 65 years of age. Taxation should not be applied simply because the OECD maintain statistics or other countries have a certain tax, NZ has been following other nations or practices for years and we have got the ridiculous situation we are in. NZ can solve taxation on its own with a tailormade solution that does not keep people poor. New Zealand Superannuation NZ Superannuation must be retained at all costs, millions of kiwis have worked their lives and especially since 1984, many do not have savings, this will obviously apply to young kiwis going forward as most cannot afford to buy a property, they will either have to move offshore or rent. The commonality is they will all need a pension. It is imperative that the NZ Government continuously plan and factor NZ Superannuation in. The government must also not give the superannuation entitlement to immigrants that have not worked and paid tax in NZ nor to people that have never worked in their lives, further in my view it needs to be means tested but to a realistic level where a multimillionaire will not receive it. It is illogical why people that have the means also need to drain the availability of funds further just because they meet the current criteria. Types of taxation for New Zealand going forward  Transaction tax - A new concept and not widely known perhaps. This should be investigated and given real thought. A transaction tax via all banking and currency transfer methods and all good and services could replace the GST. It should be established where a low percentage of perhaps 2-3% is taken from all financial transactions (through electronic or computerised systems), it should ensure there is no refund, all individuals, companies and organisations pay it, no rebates or ways out of paying. This would be fair and would likely make a significant contribution to taxation revenue. It could potentially replace or at least significantly minimise the percentage rate that has been set for GST.  Income tax - Income tax should be modified to be one rate, no deviation or rebates, that way it captures all income levels for all income earners, the income tax rate should be lower eg. 10% because the new taxation structure will have ample revenue to sustain NZ to a first world standard and all inclusive.  Company tax - Company tax definitely needs to be simplified, by your own figures companies do not pay their fair share, the current system is fraught with tax lawyers, accountants all gathering ways to not pay tax, it appears to me that the corporate culture in NZ needs to change, it is time for the government to direct them, be assertive and legislate to reinforce the new and fair taxation structure for NZ. Companies should have to pay a set taxation rate, eg. 10%. Company tax could also have the provision that rebates or credits could be applied where they bring additional long term revenue to NZ either directly via the particular company or via other companies. Research and Development could be an area where a company could be given rebates or credits if they prove to have viable R & D potential that requires a boost to implement. NZ should encourage great ideas that could ultimately turn into revenue streams.  Capital Gains Tax – In my view Capital Gains Tax is necessary and should be separate from Income Tax, it is after all technically from a different source. CGT should be based on assets that are tangible e.g. Businesses, physical properties that are purchased and sold after a short period of time, (including farms, forests and agricultural and aquaculture). Capital gains tax should be applied for all assets above what is the average assets of kiwis e.g. A house and couple of vehicles, it should be applied where people with multiple properties and assets can profit from regular sales and repurchase. Capital Gains Tax should also be applied 74 to trusts held by the wealthy and corporate entities that use a trust as a means of avoiding tax liability. The rate for CGT should be on a sliding scale proportional to the value of the asset.  Asset or Land Tax – Should be applied to encourage longer term investment and promote the retention of assets and land from being sold on a regular basis e.g. Property boom times. The tax should be reflective of the overall tax structure e.g. 10% of sale or asset value.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) – Could be maintained at a lower percentage if the above taxes were not sufficient to provide the first world outcome for the tax review, preferably GST is discontinued however in my view.  Excise Taxes – Fuel, alcohol, and cigarettes, often taxed in the pretence its for health or road safety, its lies and a simple grab of more tax. These taxes need to be levelled out and match realistic levels as other taxes I allude to above. 10% is a healthy figure. In Closing No New Zealander mind paying their fair share, it has to be across the board though and that is what irks people so much because it is not done fairly. Taxes need to reflect, as you rightly state in the background paper the environment now and in the future. A smaller tax percentage across the board is far better than larger chunks to the most commonly hit, these are the people that are only surviving in this country, they are not living as they should because of the extremely high cost of living in this country. Business will resent paying their fair share, offshore conglomerates will also try to get out of paying their share as will online entities. It is up to this tax review outcome to ensure it is fair and equitable, and again smaller tax percentages with no out clauses, rebates or dodges will make it possible. I would appreciate feedback on the progress of this tax review process, I am very keen to see NZ’ers be given the chance to get ahead and not keep suffering. Also (tongue in cheek), the authors of the 1984 Rogernomics should be held accountable for the shambles has NZ become and still is. Regards Mike Gibson 75 From:Brit Bunkley Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 2:51 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Mark Twain once wrote, “The only difference between a tax man and a taxidermist is that the taxidermist leaves the skin”. Twain lived during an era when taxes were minimal and taxation was flat (so that the poor and middle class paid most of the burden). Poverty was high, and health and education was for a select few. Government benefits were minimal at best. Taxes were universally despised. This perception changed by the last century. Thanks to citizen and union action, equality through public participation became the social democratic goal. Progressive income taxes (in which the wealthiest pay a larger percentage of income or wealth than the poorest) were introduced in order to redistribute wealth throughout society. The top end tax remained high in the developed world. Here it sat at 66% until the 1980’s. Although neo- liberal globalism has taken its toll on all nations, this top rate was not too far off what many European nations still have today. Denmark's top marginal effective income tax rate is 60.4 per cent. Austria is at 50%. Australia is 48%. The economist rock star Thomas Piketty recently argued for an even higher 80% levy on high earner income in a recent op-ed for The Guardian. MIT Professor emeritus Noam Chomsky once explained that ideally "a very good measure of how democratic a society is to ask about its attitude toward taxes. If you had a free, functioning democratic society, tax day would be a day of celebration. The people have saved and set aside a pool of money. Here we are getting together to fund the policies that we decided on.” Tax is the engine that makes modern society run. It pays for roads, police, firemen, the super fund, healthcare, education, relieving poverty, prisons, the arts, film, radio, TV, defence, programs for mental health and prison, law for those who can’t afford it, housing for the homeless, libraries, parks, and many other fundamental aspects of life. All of these areas have suffered due to defunding due to the dramatic loss of tax revenue - resulting in high crime, long waiting lists, falling education outputs, and skyrocketing child poverty. Health funding was slashed by $1.7 billion between 2008 and 2014. The latest OECD statistics show New Zealand has fallen to the bottom half of developed nations for investment in primary school education. The Herald recently reminded us that we in fact have “the lowest income taxes in the developed world” and as a whole the lowest “tax burden” next to Chile and Mexico. “The average married New Zealand couple with two children and one income pays the least amount of tax in the OECD when family benefits are taken into consideration.” We also remain the only developed nation without a capital gains tax, a glaring tax loophole for the affluent whose wealth is created in a large part from capital gains. Additionally, as warned by the IMF last month, without a moderate capital gains tax (with its “sand in the gears” effect on the housing market) the current housing bubble may well pop. In 2008, National slashed the upper income brackets. They increased GST while failing to make up for the shortfall of the income tax cuts. GST’s burden falls heavily on the lower and middle classes (the top incomes can only spend so much). Many nations sensibly adjust spending to annual inflation and increasing population, but not NZ. The cost of living increased 15% since 2008. The population increased 12%. I grew up in a state in the USA, RI without sales tax on clothes and food. Eliminating this tax on such items – a regressive tax that affects the poor far more than the rich, is essential. I hear people telling me that this is too difficult, yet I never heard anyone complain in the food or clothing business implementing these exemptions in RI when I was young (well before computers). Most importantly, our government spending for the most part has fallen dramatically. According to Treasury, spending as a proportion of GDP has fallen to below just below 29.4% (as a per cent of the country's GDP it is even lower 28.8 per cent, in budget 2017 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/92951932/budget-2017-nine- years-of-spending-under-national). We are now tying with Ireland as the lowest in the OECD. National wanted to cut it further to just 26%. To put that into perspective most developed nations have government spending levels between 45% - 60% of GDP. \[1\] 76 Mysteriously, and against all facts, many here have the media spun perception that we spend too much, our taxes are too high and we have too much public debt. It is simply not true. According to OECD data, we have among the lowest government debt to GDP ratios in the developed world, the lowest taxes and the lowest ratio of government spending to GDP. And our trickle-down economics has done squat for the economy. Yet, all political parties are now falling all over themselves to either maintain the low tax burden or lower taxes even further. Yes, we now have a small surplus, but it was the last surplus that allowed NZ to sail through the 2008 global crash. Such market “corrections” are cyclical. In fact, when looking at the average cycle we are overdue, so complacency on the budget is foolish. Refusing to increase taxes for the top 10% income earners in line with the developed world is even more foolish. And keeping the government spending absurdly so much less than successful OECD states with robust economies and high social outputs (as Scandinavian nations) is disastrous. With health and education outputs rapidly declining (U of Auckland falling nearly 150 points according to the THE ratings in 10 years), and homelessness and poverty at among the highest rates in the OECD, you get what you spend. http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-highest-taxes-in-the-world.html http://money.cnn.com/interactive/pf/taxes/top-income-tax-rate/?iid=EL Best, Brit Bunkley \[1\] 77 From:Christine Avery Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 2:26 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Rates My submission is as follows: Keep tax rates simple. Lower and flatter taxes to ensure wealth creation to lift prosperity of the economy for ALL New Zealanders is essential. Small businesses are the backbone of the country and the environment they are working in is hard enough now. Please do not take us back to the days of Robin Hood. If any additional tax should be created, the billion-dollar Maori tribal corporations set up from Treaty of Waitangi payouts should now be taxed. Many millions of dollars are already being written off by Councils on Maori Trust lands. I am yet to see Sir Geoffrey Palmer's "trickle- down" theory take effect from Treaty of Waitangi compensations. And please, no Capital Gains Tax on the family home. Christine Avery \[1\] \[1\] 78 From:Nick Martelli Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 1:33 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Tax Working Group Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission. I do not profess any particular expertise in tax, and I submit in the capacity of a ‘lay citizen’ drawing on general life experience, and my experience as a civil servant. Broadly speaking, I was very happy with what the document covered, particularly the principles the group have identified for a good tax system. I trust the expertise of the working group, with the help expert and lay submitters alike, to provide a sensible set of recommendations to the Government. I won’t be making specific tax suggestions. Instead, my submission focuses on two points for the group to consider when forming their recommendations: 1. Regional disparity 2. Concepts of inequality and fairness. Regional disparity Overall, I felt the paper was mostly focused on the ‘national-level’ and did not fully consider the different implications for taxes at the regional/district level. I can see the logic behind this. New Zealand’s population is, afterall, roughly equivalent to Sydney. However, in my view a perfectly balanced national tax system could very well be undermined if the issues in the regional/district tax system are not addressed. There are two interrelated challenges here. Demographic change The group should consider where people will be living and working in the future, and how the tax system should account for this. The first regional challenge is demographic change. The group rightly recognise this as a key pressure on the future tax system. However, they do not include changes to where people are living as part of this pressure. Changes to where we live will affect where our tax dollars come from, and where they need to be spent. Almost every day I hear how our urban centres are bursting at the seams and unable to adequately respond to rapid growth, while ‘the regions’ (ie rural New Zealand) struggle with the opposite problem of declining populations. Indeed, we’ve become an increasingly urbanised nation, and our subnational population projections predict continuing population growth in our urban areas, and decline in many of our rural areas. The Productivity Commission outlined this challenge in their report on Local Government Regulation. In a nutshell, medium and high growth councils are struggling to fund the infrastructure that will enable their cities to cope with the growth, while areas facing decline are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their existing infrastructure. This leads to the second issue. Local-level financing constraints The group should consider Local Government rates as part of the tax system, and review the tools Local Government have available to generate revenue. \[1\] 79 Secondly, the group’s terms of reference do not cover Local Government rates. Nor do they explicitly exclude them. Rates are of course another form of taxation, and part of the wider New Zealand tax system. In a way, if Central Government does not provide a particular service using nationally-levied taxes, it is up to Local Government to provide them. Obviously the relationship is not that simple, and the two levels of government have different responsibilities, but the point is that the two are intertwined and should not be considered in isolation. To do so risks undermining the other. As outlined above, Local Government is facing a range of fiscal challenges as a result of demographic change. This has resulted in substantial increases in local body rates across the country for some time. In the Consumers Price Index (CPI) The ‘Property rates and related services’ class has risen almost 60% in nominal terms over the past decade, compared with just under 20% for the all groups CPI. Increases like this would not be considered sustainable for a national-level tax. The increases do not appear to be abating - the recently released Wellington City Long-Term Plan, for example, proposes an average increase of 4.1% over the next 10 years, which roughly equates to a 50% increase in rates over that period, compared with 22% CPI inflation, assuming an average 2% per year. Needless to say this is, in effect, a real tax increase for ratepayers. Central Government has little control over how much Local Government can levy as rates outside of heavy- handed intervention (a step too far in my view). However, it can determine the tools available to Local Government to fund their services and we’re starting to see these tools expand with the recent announcement of the Ackland fuel tax and greater use of Public-Private Partnerships. I encourage the group to consider how a change in our tax system can better equip Local Government to address their funding challenges, and to provide greater certainty to ratepayers who are facing increased financial pressures under the current system. Concepts of inequality and fairness For the sake of clarity, the group should carefully consider how it defines inequality and fairness. Further, it should consider very carefully whether it is possible and/or desireable to directly target inequality as part of its recommended changes. The paper briefly mentions addressing inequality as part of changes to the tax system. I would encourage the group to be very precise in its definition of ‘inequality’ and ‘fairness’ if it is to do so, as there is a lot of potential for confusion, and the two are quite different (yet interrelated) concepts. In my view, the inequality mentioned in the paper with reference to the Gini Coefficient, is an inequality of outcome - ie wealth/income. A better word for this is equity. Total equity would be everyone earning the same amount, or holding the same amount of wealth, or both. Where the paper mentions fairness, it is really referring to an equality of opportunity. The idea that we’re all on a level playing field without undue barriers to fulfilling our potential. Fairness would be people earning a wage that is commensurate to their skills/performance/aspiration and paying a level of tax that is commensurate to their level of earning. It is the feeling that you can put in the same amount of effort as another and achieve a similar outcome. Maintaining an adequate level of equity and fairness is a challenge for any government. Too much inequity can lead to societal instability, while too much equity can reduce motivation, competitiveness, and innovation. Fairness and equity are also related. A lack of fairness can lead to greater inequity, but total equity is unlikely to be fair. The challenge with addressing inequity directly is knowing what is and isn’t an acceptable level of equity. A Gini Coefficient doesn’t necessarily tell us this - wealthy individuals in the vein of a Bill Gates of a Jeff Bezos, operating in a fair system, may skew a Gini Coefficient towards greater inequity, yet the services they provide are such that their ‘rising tide lifts all boats’ and that we’re all better of with these outliers, 80 despite the resulting inequity. On the other hand, the presence of a powerful drug cartel operating in an unfair system may produce a similar Gini Coefficient, but with dire social outcomes. In my view, the solution is around focusing on fairness over equity. If we agree the rules are fair from the beginning, then we work towards a fair level of equity that isn’t everything equal, or every thing to a select few. If we focus on inequity itself, we risk doing so at the expense of fairness. Therefore, the group need to be careful when considering the tax system’s impact on equity. Partly because transfers are out of scope, and are the other side of the ‘inequity’ equation, but also because we do not know what an acceptable level of inequity is. If the group do want to seriously consider this, I encourage you to ask how we can best define an acceptable level of equity (or equality as you may choose to refer to it), and to also ask who gets to make and enforce that definition. These are very tricky questions that I suspect we may not have satisfactory answers to. Conclusion Thank you again for the opportunity to have a say on the future of our tax system and for producing what is in my view a great background paper. I wish the group the very best in discussing what will no doubt be a long list of complex and thorny issues, and I hope that the Government will actually take notice of your recommendations this time around.

Why have you done this? Is it to deter people from sending in views on more that one section? Please explain. I now have to rewrite approximately 2000 words which is a huge waste of my time. What does the future of tax look like to you? We need a tax which taxes carbon at source. The Emissions Trading Scheme was totally ineffective in reducing carbon emissions. A carbon tax will give certainty to business and consumers. It will also discourage future coal and oil use and encourage a transition to renewable energy. The carbon tax take could be returned to citizens to offset the rising costs of the necessary transition to a low carbon economy. The current storm of protest from low income car owners about the petrol tax could be ameliorated by money raised through a carbon tax. Future taxes will need to pay for infrastructure damage caused by more intense storms. Tax people on higher incomes at a higher top tax rate. Are we taxing the right things? We need to consider that currently the richest 1% own half the world’s wealth or as Oxfam notes: eight men own the same wealth as half the world. This is outrageous. Multinational corporations pay little or no tax in New Zealand. Every effort must be made to tax these corporations. A Financial Transaction Tax would address this to some degree. Tax evaders and tax haven use must be deterred with punishment such as large fines and imprisonment. It is past time to remove GST from unprocessed (raw) fruit and vegetables. Rising inequality in income in New Zealand is leaving many families unable to feed their children properly. Calculate the current cost of providing an apple a day for three children. Many cannot budget for this. A tax on tourists using our environment - huts, tracks etc is essential to provide DoC with enough funds to provide facilities. \[1\] \[1\] 82 CaCan tax make housing more affordable?taz make housing more affordable?an tax make housing more affordable? An Empty Homes tax, as in Vancouver, would address the current scandal of houses bought for capital gains being left empty while thousands of citizens cannot pay rents. This has to be at a level which will significantly deter this practice. A Capital Gains Tax on investment properties sold within five years is necessary to end property speculation. Lynne Dempsey \[1\] 83 From: Sent:Sunday, 29 April 2018 1:18 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Proposed Tax Changes Dear Tax Working Group A broad tax base allows governments to raise substantial tax revenue with relatively low tax rates. Simpler tax systems with fewer exemptions reduce compliance costs and provide less opportunity for tax avoidance. I am gravely concerned that the goal of the Tax Working Group review is to find new ways of increasing taxes to pay for higher levels of Government spending, including wealth redistribution. One only has to look how the economy and business growth in the USA under President Donald Trump has flourished with Tax cuts. Returning to failed socialist ideals of the past is to be deplored. I have been self-employed for 39 years, and only twice in that time have I received a remuneration that I consider equivalent to what I am worth, both times after Tax cuts have been made. I also submit that giving preferential rates to Maori businesses is to be deplored – how is that not discriminatory and racist? There is no justification for any Capital Gains Tax in New Zealand, and I implore that if it unwisely is, then the family home should never be included in any Capital Gains Tax proposed, particularly when the Government has run short of money, due to poor fiscal management. I also submit that the importance of lower and flatter taxes will incentivise wealth creation and lift prosperity for all New Zealanders. Please hear the voice of reason, not the panic of a Government dedicated to running the coffers dry to achieve so called equality. Yours sincerely Craig Walker \[1\] 84 From:Peter Plunket Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 1:07 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: The Future of Tax Dear Tax Working Group I don't have access to Word so I hope this submission is suitable in this form. I made a submission to a Savings Working Group in, I think 2011, in which I stated that I knew I was wasting my time but submitted anyway.I believe the same position exists with this submission but in this case please do not reply trying to reassure me that I am not wasting my time because I know I am.Having said all of that I would like to submit anyway. As a person from a working background it has been important to me to have savings in the bank. In retrospect I would have much wiser to have invested in property but that was something I was reluctant to do. I believe investment income should be treated fairly by the imposition of a Capital Gains Tax or if that is not palatable then there should be some tax relief on the income from interest on savings. As a taxpayer I am not interested in tax cuts in any shape or form. Tax cuts equal cuts in services. Personally I have no problem with Tax actually increasing as long as it is fair across the taxpayer spectrum. I want an increase in tax so that health services, in particular, can be better funded. When I mention Tax increases or adjustments they should occur within the personal tax system. I definitely don't want any increase in GST. I understand that Airlines that fly internationally pay no fuel tax. I realise that it would be incredibly complicated to tax this fuel fairly but I would like to see the government make overtures to the relevant international authorities and other Countries to start a discussion on this issue. Of course this all assumes that I am correct regarding this issue. If I am not please disregard this section. It would be outside the scope of this working group but I would like to see a $250 levy imposed on every person who enters the country on a visitors visa. This money could be shared between local councils and the chronically underfunded DOC. This would probably result in less tourists but that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. I think it's an insult that the National Party finance spokes-women thinks we are already paying enough tax. It's a disgrace that in their nine years in charge they borrowed money to finance tax cuts while simultaneously deliberately running down our public health system and other services. Lastly I want it noted that I am a member of the Green Party. I am a member, not because I have an strong feelings about the environment or sustainability issues, but because I want to vote for somebody who I believe has some level of integrity in their decision making. I think it's highly unlikely that we are likely to see any change towards to a fairer tax system when the two major political parties are involved because they are really only interested in remaining in government, returning to government, and looking after their vested interests. This is to the detriment of the country as a whole.

Because of an aging work force it has been suggested that government be more reliant on taxing capital gains and less reliant on taxing wages. In this 21 st century it has beco me more critical to stop government borrowing and to minimise credit creation by modernising money and taxation. Government bonds can never be assets if the debt is never repaid. It does not matter whether credit (money) is created as debt or debt-free as both cause inflation and reduce the purchasing power of our currency (invisible taxation). But debt- free money has three immediate benefits. It stops the payment of interest to banks, allows the modernisation of taxation and controls inflation by being sp ent into the economy not lent. By stopping the diversion of tax revenue away from consumption and tangible capital investment allows personal income tax to be abolished and goods and services tax to be upgraded (20- 25%) to tax the economy fairly as it was designed to do (no loopholes). There would be no need to consider inheritance tax, capital gains tax or wealth tax. Only the wealthy would say the poor are disadvantaged by such a proposal but really it would be the wealthy that would be disadvantaged as they have more wealth and income to spend. The “ wealthy experts” must stop thinking of themselves. Steve Laurence \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 86 From: Sent:Sunday, 29 April 2018 12:48 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: My submission (without typos) Q: What does the future of tax look like to me? A: This is the tragedy. While many were/are all getting rich off the "housing boom", what they are really doing is bidding up the cost of living for everybody. We effectively implemented a tax on ourselves. The best part is the impact of the insanity hasn't even been fully felt yet, that will keep ratcheting up as more people transact houses at the new prices and more existing home owners cash out their equity for boats and holidays. J Now you might say, what happens if it's a two person world and I don't bid more and I miss out on the house? Well here is the thing, it's an arms race. You leverage more, your opponent leverages more, your parents guarantee, their parents guarantee. The point is someone always gets the house, bidding up the price just sets the toll society has to pay. And it would perhaps be fine if at the other end the beneficiaries - those with increased equity or sale price - invested their money wisely to balance the debt the buyers were taking on but I doubt that happens. So my argument, long as it is that every $1 house prices increase is a tax increase on New Zealanders. The best decision we could take is to introduce debt to income limit which would lead to better economic decisions. Lower house prices = a lower cost of living and a wealthier New Zealand. Just to illustrate my point, imagine two scenarios in a world w ith one person and one house. If a person's hard limit on buying a house is 25% of their income then they will have 75% to spend on other stuff. If their mate tells them "just borrow and do whatever you have to to get on the property ladder because otherwise they'll be more expensive next year" and they borrow to 35% of their income (talking repayments here) then now they only have 65%. The difference between 25% and 35% is solely based on willingness to pay (soft constraints like personal heuristics) and ability to pay (hard constraints like bank lending limits). In a world where people were prevented from borrowing more, house prices would remain lower and collectively we would all be better off. o, NONE of us live in a vacu NONE of us live in a vacuum or a single state of control over our lives! We ALL influence and manipulate the outcomes for others by our OWN actions as a collective. That is the very foundation of the definition of "society". Societies values are what allows or disallows what we each make of life in many ways. You never have total autonomy. NZ has become a very sad and materialistic place since the days when I grew up. I would go back in time in a heartbeat. NZ is becoming just a another soulless US idolising getto of despair for future generations, piece by piece. \[1\] 87 Q: What is the purpose of tax? A: To provide government income for the EQUAL benefit of ALL citizens! Why should ANY of my or anyone elses taxes go to propping up the private property portfolio's of parasitic landlords via ambulance at the bottom of cliff benefits such as WFF or the Accomodation Supplement? Anyone using public funds to make profits for themselves is a parasite. I'm all for welfare for those that need it but not if a private landlord is standing in the middle with their hand out cause they want to retire with 50 to 100 properties under their belt paid for by the NZ taxpayer! Fiat Currency is paper tender with no intrinsic real value yet your homes value is based on it. In 2008 what happen? What was meant by the term GFC? or credit crisis? Capital Gain, the thing YOU and others thinks will go on forever relies on one specific thing. Perpetual borrowing from banks that fund mortgages based on previous borrowing. When the 'funny money' creation game (credit) runs out of steam you will see negative equity. For house prices to continue to climb forever.....so must wages (inflationary) or you must find richer and richer foreigners to sell to. Construction doesn't get cheaper until again the credit stream to build runs out. Supply and Demand economic fundamentals yes..........but when our entire monetary system, banking system and credit system is modelled exactly....EXACTLY to that of a ponzi scheme (property ladder or property pyramid?) then the end game will be the same as a game called "monopoly". What happens in a game of monopoly when the bank runs out of cash? Q: Are we taxing the right things? m or a single state of control over oAAANAAoAA A: No, your'e not! But I don't believe ANY government is going to do that! You only care about the short term because so do most of the voters. Politicians are basically just "sales people". 88 Many voters live week to week, month to month. They are not thinki ng 50 years out. If you want voters to think longer term..........you need to educate the masses into wanting a national vision, one for them, their kids and grandkids. Something they are not learning in school is how the actual Financial System works, particularly "Fractional Reserve Banking", "Fiat Currency" and how a bank produces money into the system based on this fraudulent system which essentially is a Government sponsored Ponzi Scheme. Q: Can tax make housing more affordable? A: Yes, it can but unfortunately when our OWN MP's across the board all have personal skin in the game with portfolio's of multiple property investments themselves then I don't believe any of you will do anything of any real change. Even Mr Cullen himself in a recent interview with The Spin Off remark that: "The last thing you would really want to see happen is a collapse in house and land values" thus he is setting up this tax working group for UTTER failure! Because he refuses to addresses or own up to the fact housing and land prices have become overvalued due to a very poor tax system which incentivises property speculation across the board, inparticular.....the 'family home'! Q: What tax issues matter to me most? A: Having a fair tax system that incentivises real productivity. Not what we have now that continues the perpetuation of increasing peoples debt levels generation on generation to prop up a global Housing ponzi scheme so those that made personal choices of taking on huge debt are financially protected more than those who chose to live within their means without burdening or exploiting others....just to save a few private banks! Kind Regards, Ross Mathews, \[1\] 89 90 From: Sent:Sunday, 29 April 2018 12:28 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Have my say I consent to being contacted and my opinion being published in full. ...... my submission follows .... PROTECTION OF OUR HOME - The Top Line New Zealand needs to be protected for the future. I struggle to see anybody disagreeing with that statement. This means our resources ( Land, Maori Culture, Native Bush, Clean Green Image, exports and probably the sheep) must be sustained. It seems to me that education and self policing is the best way to achieve this as a natural balance could be maintained. I don’t have a high confidence of this method acquiring and the alternative requires funds to provide oversight. So there does not seem to me to be a way of avoiding taxation for the purpose of protecting our natural assets and resources. Protection of these resources give us a premium brand and some uniqueness to boot, in the global market place. This is good our “Top Line" Currently there are many changes (attacks) underway that will change our top line. The internet is one. When this hit, nobody was prepared primarily because it unfolded over 5 decades and it was hard to understand for most people. Even those in the industry, I qualify this statement because its the reason we are having this discussion at all. The word is changing. In my opinion, if tax were to modify social behaviour, this is the one to push. Intellectual Capital is limitless if a little hard to get going. Our unique understanding of the world is an asset to New Zealand. To give another example. 3D printed milk. I imagine this is not news to anyone reading. It is happening now, albeit in its infancy, and in this case the 3D printers that are being used are actually GMO yeast. That the printers are made of GMO yeast is not relevant, you can simply imagine them as much more efficient environmentally friendly cows, the point is they will just get better as time goes on. 3D printing is a clear threat to our top line with the only stalwart being our Clean Green Image that allows us a premium brand. In the face of this it is almost pointless having a conversation about tax because there won’t be any money. The dairy industry will be the first to be affected closely followed by the meat industry, this will knock off a chunk of GDP, and the splash damage from that event will probably continue for years and knock off a larger percentage overall but of the 50 Million people or so we can feed with our food industry globally its hard to say how many we will retain in the face of much cheaper 3D printed product. 3D printing will, of course, continue to other foods and buildings, toys, the list goes on. So contrary to what I said above its not really about the milk or meat, It is about the 3D printing. There will be opportunity to carve out niches based on our premium brand and there will be opportunities that arise from this new reality, but re-tasking a nation is not without issue. How is this relevant to the discussion? Protecting our natural assets is important, regardless of what context they are discussed in, but our physical assets are limited and \[1\] 91 dwarfed by our intellectual assets and our intellectual assets need to be able to participate in society at a level that encourages them to be self propelled...segueing to my next point... ABUNDANCE - Cashflow is king Top line is well and good, but if the at least some of populace is struggling to live ( and as of this writing, they are ) and people are living in the streets ( as of this writing they are ) then I would say the top line is not a main consideration in most peoples minds, why should they? It is not their concern. wrong. It is their concern. But without money in their pockets or a roof over their head it’s hard to care. As a country we are not different than a business. A simplistic view of a business is that it is comprised of a business engine and shareholders. A business engine is made up of multiple things staff, the business model, trade secrets, IP and the list goes on. The 3 things a that business must do to survive are are grow the business engine and maintain the business engine beyond that it must return excess cash to the shareholders. We, the people, are both the shareholders AND the business engine. Maintaining the engine in this scenario is a balance between policy settings and happiness. So I am advocating for more cashflow in society. This means paying less income tax. And I mean Zero, Including Corporates. Up to a certain rate, probably $100,00. EG: the first 100G you earn is tax free. This is a major boon for individuals and incentive towards for small business. For larger businesses tax revenue would not change a lot if this idea was applied to them, but exactly what this would mean for a large business I am less certain, but anything that gets them spending money and increasing cashflow in society is good for society. A large corporate asset- izing everything to avoid tax is not beneficial for society. In my opinion this means an increase in consumerism and therefore an increase in revenue opportunity from GST to compensate for the loss of individual income tax. My guess is that approximately 10% of individual income tax would be retained by the highest earners paying on income over 100,000. Also in my opinion a hike in the GST rate seem appropriate and this also gives a more “in your face” opportunity for social behaviour modification (\*1) and 20% GST does not seem out of line. This would recover another 5 or 6 Billion more of less, if consumption does not change. Tax revenue would still be down about 25 billion. A large sum of money for sure. But that means 25 billion is back in the hands of consumers who are now in a much better position overall. So you could expect GST revenue to increase through extra consumption. NOTE: I am basing my figures on the table found here http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/external-stats/revenue-refunds/revenue- collected/ If I have misread the table my figures can be adjusted. In my opinion certain products, healthy food and beverages should be completely exempt from GST. Also in my opinion this should include restaurants generally but not fast food chains. Is this fair? probably not but neither is dying from macdonald’s induced heart attacks. \*1 ASIDE: the sugar issue is hard, because its not sugar that is the primary issue. Its the incessant lifestyle marketing and incentivising of overly sugary products. CONSENT - nobody votes for more tax The definition of the word consent has become more concrete and clear in the general vernacular in recent years. In my opinion, clear enough, to say that just because the government got in on the majority vote ( which the current one didn’t ) that what they say YES to is not the same as the consent of ALL. In fact it is the very definition of the opposite. The fact that we must democratically acquiesce is not the same as consent. Dutifully paying tax as is required of us should also not be considered consent. There is no choice given. I for one have never been asked if I wanted to. This opportunity for the people to have their say about tax cannot also be considered consent. Primarily because you won’t hear from all people. More than 10% would be a Christmas miracle. What should we do about this? Ask if people want to pay tax seems the obvious answer. Beyond that I have no clue, but the notion that taxation occurs with the consent of all New Zealanders 92 is not a valid one and nobody can rightly think it is until all citizens actually do consent. SOCIAL CONSCIENCE - it’s our job to care, not to be fair. When talking about wealth transfer, it is never going to be considered fair. And it should not. Nobody should think it is fair, least of all the people who are on the receiving end. It is the mindset that leads to generational welfare. That is a detrimental societal meme. However, people who make bad life choices or had bad situations forced upon them should not be left to starve. It is a MORE detrimental social meme to think otherwise. we exist as a society to be collectively something more than the sum of us all. So even people who need help now may contribute later. My mother used to say to me that life isn’t fair, and irritatingly that is a truism at least some of the time and sometimes people need to be supported otherwise why did we bother with collective society in the first place. Personally I think New Zealand does quite well in this area and that the government as whole is quite progressive. That traditional cultural values are even being considered in this context is a pretty amazing achievement in the current world climate. To be clear here I am not suggesting payouts to tribes. Im suggesting that championing our culture is an unprecedentedly wholistic point of view. I also think that we can do much more in the way of educating people out of the welfare mindset. Sure extreme poverty is not a just mindset and not only exists just because of poor life decisions, but educating into dependency - ironically by providing welfare in the first place causes some of the problem. It is a difficult problem to solve, probably impossible and not all people are dragged into the welfare mindset so I am very hopeful that New Zealanders can bite off a large chunk of this problem. It should be noted that I consider the health system, police, government social services and like bodies part of the transfer system. Having an educated population is the only way to relieve the pressure from these services and chip away at the problem, of the need for welfare, in the first place. NOTE: Yes I understand I am saying that EVERYONE is dependent on some sort of welfare, in the model described above, but is there a more wholistic way to frame it? FINALLY: To give some context, I am of Maori descent and consider myself Maori, albeit a city Maori and I personally don’t find much value in the culture that benefits myself. I actively encourage my children to get involved however. But it will be their choice in the end wether they want to or not. I also earn over the 100,000 rate that I mentioned above, so while I would personally benefit from a tax free threshold I would not I would still end up paying income tax. I have 3 children so I am also supporting dependents and I am receiving help from the government via the 20 hours per week of free nursery time. Though I pay for more than that and have done since before receiving that benefit. There are many more issues here that are related to the taxation discussion but I am trying to keep this as short as possible to get the main ideas across. You have asked some very complex questions some tactical and short term and some for the strategic longer term. I have taken the point of view of the long term. I hope you find my thoughts ordered and self consistent. I have struggled with these idea for the better mart of a month, and the notes I made prior to this finally rendering had to be condensed down a lot. I am very happy to resolve any inconsistencies or ambiguity if required. Below I am directly answering some of the questions posed by the brief that I believe fit with my overall message above. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Are people homeless and/or struggling to feed their families? To be clear I don’t think the tax system is responsible for homelessness. But if, as stated in the brief that a tax system is good for a society then something is very wrong with society when homelessness increases - in a first world country - therefore if a robust tax system is good for society it must not be working very well if homelessness exists. 'Taxes also fund a safety net that maintains a minimum standard of living. In this way, taxes could be seen as a payment for a kind of social insurance that mitigates the impact of unexpected economic shocks with the intention that everyone regardless of income can participate in society.’ This principle is not being met - look around. 93 As expressed through the political system, it is clear that New Zealand as a society accepts that a progressive tax system (where those on higher incomes pay higher proportions of tax) is a fair system. Why is this clear? no-one campaigns on this idea. Not one government would get voted in by championing this loudly. I read a quote that said “The typical way of framing tax, regardless of who pays it, is of a payment grudgingly given, an unfortunate inevitability of modern life." This obviously just an opinion of somebody, it is hard to disagree with it. It is important that tax is not evaded through participation in the ‘informal’ sector – also referred to as the “grey” or “black” economy. In my model the informal sector ceases to exist. Transfers The problem with addressing inequality is that welfare creates a climate that ultimately increases inequality by making dependents more dependent. Long term this dependency is bad for everybody. Ageing population This should really be a no brainer. Have more children. Anything that improves our chances of this is a worthy consideration in my opinion. Actually I think this has to be one of any governments highest priorities. In a country as small as ours it becomes an existential threat that immigration does not solve. I would seem the government is doing a lot in this direction already, but I don’t think enough. Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? Unfairness, in this context, is an extreme disparity in prosperity ( cashflow ) as opposed to wealth ( assets ) of a societies citizens. Example: Is it fair I can’t feed my children whilst my neighbour wheel spins his Ferrari down the street. conversely Is it fair I pay to feed my neighbours children because I worked hard to get my Ferrari. To be clear, I am not saying that personally building asset based wealth is a terrible thing or that we should tax personal assets. I am saying that when you are surrounded by people flaunting their wealth and you can’t particularly see that you have done anything wrong as far as life choices are concerned and you are contributing to the country by having children, paying taxes then the definition of fair becomes very subjective and unclear. However if I can pay to feed, cloth and educate my children and have some breathing space then I am only a little bit jealous of other success and what is fair becomes less of an issue. Still not an ideal mindset, but more healthy than the alternative. To overly emphasis, if I am earning 60,000 ( a seemingly good wage ) and I pay exorbitant amounts on housing because the government let property speculation go rampant during the 90’s and somehow doubled the cost off living over the last 10 to 15 years, without enabling pay rates to go up proportionately (IE: the government hasn’t done a great job) and then I’m paying 6000-8000 dollars in tax on top of that it is hard to see the concept of “fair” with anything approaching objectivity. Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? No, that ship has sailed. The time was in the 90’s when something could have been done, within the law and fairly. But somebody chose not to enforce the laws that were in existence. Which by the way was a clear case of not being fair. In fact I can see how someone could draw correlation between property speculation, local body rates and some entity choosing not to enforce existing laws to control said speculation. 94 From:Sharyn Barclay Sent: Sunday, 29 April 2018 12:18 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION To Whom-it-concerns In all eight broad areas of the NZ cultural milieu, significant democratisation is needed. A greater say or input into the apportionment of tax dollars is far more participatory. Base level funding should be given to those areas identified as critical to continued functioning of society. Those foundational aspects of society, crucial to a well-managed and balanced way of living, will of course remain with funding. Non-negotiable public providers include such areas as the public health & education portfolios and the departments of conservation and housing. Negotiable would be entities such as (random examples) PAM (Petroleum and Minerals) and Statistics. Funding beyond that baseline is more a values-based and personalised assessment. Each individual ought to be given the choice for destination of their hard-earned money as they see fit. A person who sees a Government funded area, say Justice, as a higher priority than another public entity, say the Ministry of Transport, is able to reflect this in apportionment of their tax dollar. The weight of people power would then be democratised. According to public pressure some areas would fluctuate in relative importance dependent on timeliness and even ‘fashion’. E.g Arts, Culture and Heritage may see greater support when rising sea levels are no longer of concern in the Pacific Peoples portfolio. In this era of corporate lobbying, sway and spin being projected onto political parties and figures, a spread of the weight of that pressure over all tax-payers is far more equitable. With the internet of all things being accessible to all, or the vast majority, of kiwis, this provides a perfect platform for communication of areas of choice of tax expenditure. Kiwis should be able to choose to convey their tax wishes or not, whether via the web or an accessible postal means, every financial year (or perhaps every Government term, with choice being given on voting ballots....). This is obviously an area for discussion. If choice is not exercised a ‘default’ allocation would be made, determined by a cross-party tax allocation steering committee. In regard to specific comments re taxes... Very strongly, NZ Tax should reflect ‘The Polluter Pays’ principle. This recognises the critical role of the environment on the NZ economy. Of great importance is recognition that ACD (Anthropogenic Climate Disruption) is the largest challenge for central Government EVER! Climate change poses an existential threat to humankind. That statement does not allow for importance of biodiversity, the need for stability in climate for food production, the risks inherent in coastal communities, the likely huge insurance increases, danger posed by extreme weather, floods, droughts and wildfires, ...any and all problems associated with the lived effects of ACD . Accordingly, I advocate a Carbon Tax. Those who behave directly or indirectly (e.g coal mining) to increase atmospheric load of carbon (or equivalent carbon in the case of methane) are not currently paying for that wholesale climate damage and ought to be taxed accordingly. Those who behave directly or indirectly to decrease atmospheric load of carbon (be it by planting trees, not using their private car, following a climate diet,... implementing any changes within their home or business) ought to see tax cuts based on these changes. This ought to apply across the board from individuals who begin \[1\] 95 composting, to businesses with an EV (electric vehicle) fleet, to municipal councils who have climate friendly cafeteria food. A ‘reward’ and ‘penalty’ system is the tax answer to how NZ tackles greenhouse gas emissions. Please contact me if further clarification is needed. I’m very strapped for time to submit my ideas.

If their mate tells them "just borrow and do whatever you have to to get on the property ladder because otherwise they'll be more expensive next year" and they borrow to 35% of their income (talking repayments here) then now they only have 65%. The difference between 25% and 35% is solely based on willingness to pay (soft constraints like personal heuristics) and ability to pay (hard constraints like bank lending limits). In a world where people were prevented from borrowing more, house prices would remain lower and collectively we would all be better off. o, NONE of us live in a vacu NONE of us live in a vacuum or a single state of control over our lives! We ALL influence and manipulate the outcomes for others by our OWN actions as a collective. That is the very \[1\] 97 foundation of the definition of "society". Societies values are what allows or disallows what we each make of life in many ways. You never have total autonomy. NZ has become a very sad and materialistic place since the days when I grew up. I would go back in time in a heartbeat. NZ is becoming just a another soulless US idolising getto of despair for future generations, piece by piece. Q: What is the purpose of tax? A: To provide govenment income for the EQUAL benefit of ALL citizens! Why should ANY of my or anyone elses taxes go to propping up the private property portfolio's of parasitic landlords? Anyone using public funds to make profits for themselves is a parasite. I'm all for welfare for those that need it but not if a private landlord is standing in the middle with their hand out cause they want to retire with 50 to 100 properties under their belt paid for by the NZ taxpayer! Fiat Currency is paper tender with no intrinsic real value yet your homes value is based on it. Here's a little something for people like you all to think about, 2008 what happen? What was meant by the term GFC? or credit crisis? Capital Gain, the thing YOU and others thinks will go on forever relies on one specific thing. Perpetual borrowing from banks that fund mortgages based on previous borrowing. When the funny money creation game (credit) runs out of steam you will see negative equity. For house prices to continue to climb forever.....so must wages (inflationary) or you must find richer and richer foreigners to sell to. Construction doesn't get cheaper until again the credit stream to build runs out. Supply and Demand economic fundamentals yes..........but when our entire monetary system, banking system and credit system is modeled exactly....EXACTLY to that of a ponzi scheme (property ladder or property pyramid?) then the end game will be the same as a game called "monopoly". What happens in a game of monopoly when the bank runs out of cash? Q: Are we taxing the right things? m or a single state of control over oAAANAAoAA 98 A: No, your'e not! But I don't believe ANY government is going to do that! You only care about the short term because so do most of the voters because politicians are basically just "sales people". Many voters live week to week, month to month. They are not thinking 50 years out. If you want voters to think longer term..........you need to educate the masses into wanting a national vision, one for them, their kids and grandkids. Something they are not learning in school is how the actually Financial system work, particularly "Fractional Reserve Banking", "Fiat Currency" and how a bank produces money into the system based on this fraudulent system which essentially is a government sponsored Ponzi Scheme. Q: Can tax make housing more affordable? A: Yes, it can but unfortunately when our OWN MP's across the board all have personal skin in the game with portfolio's of multiple property investments themselves then I don't believe any of you will do anything of any real change. Even Mr Cullen himself in a recent interview with The Spin Off remark that: "The last thing you would really want to see happen is a collapse in house and land values" thus he is setting up this tax working group for UTTER failure! Because he refuses to addresses or own up to the fact housing and land prices have become overvalued due to a very poor tax system which incentivises property speculation across the board, inparticular.....the 'family home'! Q: What tax issues matter to me most? A: Having a fair tax system that incentivises real productivity. Not what we have now that continues the perpetuation of increasing peoples debt levels generation on generation to prop up a global Housing ponzi scheme so those that made personal choices of taking on huge debt are financially protected more than those who chose to live within their means without burdening or exploiting others....just to save a few private banks!

By email, phone to or in writing to > I believe that the major problem taxation needs to address is the gap between the haves and the have-nots that has grown astronomically in New Zealand I find it offensive to live in a society where a substantial and growing 'wealthy' class can afford massive homes they don't need, yachts, supercars, expensive holidays, top class private health etc, while at the same time a much larger percentage of the population is struggling to acquire the basics of housing, food, clothing, education, health and welfare. Had it not been for the recent change in government, I would for this reason alone have been planning to return to live in Europe. I accept that this is difficult to reverse but I would offer the government the following ideas, which I believe would help it achieve its objectives. They are not necessarily in order of importance, just order of coming to mind! Starting maybe at the end I realise that enforcement is a big issue but I think that a lot more effort at the high end of fraud would be more appropriate than targeting struggling tradesmen doing the odd "cashie" I was very enamoured a few years ago by an Italian government tax initiative. They asked their police to stop every supercar and find out who was really using it. These people were then targeted for intense investigation. Apparently it was extremely cost effective in revealing tax fraud, loopho les their tax department didn't already know of and general crime! Turning to policies, I would prioritise taxing luxuries over necessities. For example no GST on 'ordinary' family needs but increasing GST as selling price goes up on luxuries, especially those imported from overseas. Clearly a political decision but for example no GST on a locally used 'normal' car that sells for $5000 rising to maybe 100% GST on a just imported supercar. No GST on local accomodation providers rising to 100% GST on overseas holidays costing in excess of $20,000 per week per person Income tax is a real hot potato as so easy to conceal but it should be progressive. I like the UK model of no income tax up to a certain level Then I would tax according to a combination of need, earnings and 'usefulness to society' of the means of acquisition. Again a political decision but for example on the same earnings - a disabled solo parent pays less tax than a working couple with no dependents a doctor, teacher or social worker pays less tax than a real estate agent or currency dealer Anybody should pay a much higher percentage tax on an income of $500,000 pa than on an income of $50,000 pa, at least double or triple \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 101 I think it's too difficult for tax to solve the housing problem. If this country has to rely on wealthy immigration, rather than skilled immigration, (which appears to have been the policy of the last government) then it should have had the policy of the UK channel islands, requiring I think ten years of residency before house purchase is permitted, but that's really for another forum. Similarly, I think incentivising environmental improvements is not a matter for direct tax to address but more a matter of government expenditure. But who am I to say whether our taxes should go to electric vehicle intrastructure or to health needs? As an EV owner who has just been turned down for an appointment with an orthopaedic specialist because the government thinks I'm not disabled enough I have mixed feelings! However I'm glad that our government has both a socialist party and an environmentalist one so they can fight it out for me!

Consideration is needed on the total tax picture looking at options for addressing rates as well. Taxing the capital and land value of properties which have no relationship to the services provided is not the appropriate system for local taxes. Year on year increases in rates at twice or more the rate of inflation is a significant concern. There seems to be no means of securing financial discipline on local government in the expenditure of rates. Section 32 analysis of costs and benefits are little more than descriptive stories with little or no quantitative elements. Also there appears to be little ratepayer control of the excesses. May I suggest an approach that sees any request for rates above the rate of inflation voted on by ratepayers, easily done through postal and electronic voting. Each proposal would need a detailed cost benefit done on it and presented to ratepayers. Also a fiscal responsibility legislation for local government under the Local Government act should be implemented.

Countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system.  New Zealand must stand in solidarity with developing countries and call for a new generation of global tax reforms.

Gross profit being shipped off shore. 2. The misuse of the charities act, charities, churches and Iwi having bonafide businesses which pay no corporate tax as the profit is returned back to the principal charity, supposedly! > The charities act should only be for a not for profit charity, not businesses, the is a major loophole that is exploited on a daily basis costing the country billions in revenue. 3. The misuse of trusts to avoid taxation by wealthy businessmen, companies, churches, Iwi ect. 4. The tax bracket levels. The majority if middle wage earners are now paying top rate tax. Wages have increased although the level at which you pay top rate tax has not over the years. The level for low wage earners has been adjusted before tax is paid but not the bands above. This should be addres sed for a fairer system. Having it currently set at $70000 means the majority of New Zealand is paying top rate income tax. 5. GST should not be paid on groceries and every day items as well as children’s clothing. GST was meant for luxury items not for essentials. Clean up in tax avoidance, then a little can be given back to make a fairer system. Regards Alan Dallas Sent from my iPhone \[1\] 107 From: Sent:Saturday, 28 April 2018 10:51 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group To the Tax Working Group My background I have had considerable experience with New Zealand taxation as a taxpayer, importer, services exporter and private purchaser of overseas goods. In addition, I have worked in the field of commercial property management. I am open to being contacted to explain any aspects of my submission. Goods and Services Tax In my view GST is an inefficient, outdated tax which cannot be adapted to meet the basic criteria for an effective tax in the age of online shopping and international transactions. IRD has worked extensively with large retailers such as Amazon to integrate GST collection on New Zealand sales but these measures are easily avoided (even legitimately) by means of forwarding services, gift card purchases or international credit cards. Many vendors even offer to modify packaging slips to misrepresent purchase price in order for purchasers to evade paying customs GST. It has been reported that IRD has proposed the implementation of a $1.9Billion IT solution aimed at identifying GST evaders. This will only marginally improve compliance because of legitimate loopholes remain. Unfortunately, domestic retailers and manufacturers are less able to legally avoid GST and therefore the current tax system is dis-incentivising local business in favour of imports. I believe this is an unfair and irresponsible taxation practice. It is my belief that the strength of a tax is in simplicity and the lack of exceptions. For this reason I favour a low-percentage (<1%) financial transactions tax (FTT) levied on all transactions without exception. This tax would replace GST completely and would utilise the current banking system mimicking current bank levied FTT in the form of service or credit fees. The strength of this approach is that all transactions both local and international would be subject to the tax so no bias would exist against local business. Because almost all transactional value is now undertaken electronically, applying the tax would be inexpensive, reduce compliance cost to businesses and reduce enforcement costs to IRD. The tax would also recover revenue from real estate, sale of companies, stock trading and other untaxed economic activity. Importantly, it is likely even to tax illegal black market business which is notoriously hard to tax. In order to overcome claimed disadvantages such as increased market volatility, capital retreat and tax evasion through cash purchases, FTT cannot be implemented at high percentage rates. Its efficacy must therefore be through universal application. If the government was to replace GST with FTT as I suggest, additional expenditure by IRD on GST evasion would be avoided and would not be required for FTT. Taken together with it’s other inherent efficiencies for New Zealand businesses and individuals, I believe FTT is a natural replacement for GST in the internet age. Combined Family Income Tax At present income tax is calculated on the basis of individual income - not combined income - while Working for Families tax credits are allocated on the basis of family income. This is a confusing and complicated contradiction which penalises full time care giving and single income families. For example if an individual parent earned $120,000 p.a. while the other parent did not undertake paid employment, the family income would be $120,000 p.a. and income tax payable would be $30,520 p.a. On the other hand, if both parents work and earn $60,000 p.a. each resulting in the same combined family income of $120,000 p.a., the annual taxation would be significantly less at $22,040. \[1\] \[1\] 108 The New Zealand Government recognises the value of unpaid caregivers and stay-at-home parents. I therefore recommend that income tax is levied on combined joint family income rather than individual income. I acknowledge that there is a risk that individuals could falsify relationships but this would only be beneficial over a relatively small potential tax take. I believe acknowledging unpaid parental contribution outweighs these minimal disadvantages. 0% Income Tax Band as a tool for low income earners. I have experienced Working for Families as a recipient and although the benefits of government support were valuable, I believe this system is a disastrously cumbersome, complex and confused mess to work with. I experienced effective marginal tax rates exceeding 100% on several occasions. Although I appreciate Working for Families is like outside of the terms of reference for this Working Group, I would like to suggest an initial taxation free threshold. I believe establishing the first graduated taxation band at 0% has the advantage of reducing the need for complex redistribution systems such as Working for Families but still benefits individuals and families on low incomes. Financing New Zealand’s Natural and Cultural Assets Having travelled internationally and experienced other country’s fees and taxes on visitors, I believe New Zealand does not adequately recover costs associated with our conservation estate, heritage and public exhibitions. For example, in the United States visitors generally pay a fee to enter national parks. I do not favour this model but instead support the establishment of an arrival tax of between $50 and $100 per person which would contribute to a fund for the provision of these services. Taxation of Property Assets I believe taxation should be used to manage unproductive, speculative investment, either in real estate or other assets. I favour taxation tools which recognise the economic services of land ownership in the form of an annual land tax on property owners. I also believe that all financial gain on property, irrespective of the time elapsed or the property use should be taxable as income on realisation of this value. I expect this might not be popular but the continued disproportionate investment in property as a means of capital gain seriously impedes productive investment in business, research and technology. Differential Taxation for Regional Growth I believe taxation can and should be used to encourage regional productivity and avoid unmanaged expansion as has occurred recently in Auckland. One way that this could be achieved would be through differential taxation of the regions. For example, company and income tax for companies and individuals based in Westland could be taxed at a lower rate than in the rest of the country. This would incentivise headquartering of companies in the region without the need for costly state intervention. By fully realising underutilised regional infrastructure through creating a taxation incentive structure, uncontrolled expansion in main centres could be greatly mitigated. 109 From:Anna Macrae Goodwin Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 10:32 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Philosophical directives Under the Common Law, the right to tax is said to be “the right to kill”. As a tax and rate payer, my interpretation of this statement is that taxation is intrinsically hostile to the interests of those paying the tax. In westernised democracies, we elect governments to oversee our public services and infrastructure development, and we acknowledge that these services require payment in the form of taxes. We pay willingly for these things and even acknowledge that we should give a little to those who are temporarily struggling (and haven’t chosen "the benefit" as a way of life). We assume ongoing benevolence in our elected leaders, and give them our sacred trust not to kill us with the power we have allowed them. We assume that, because we elect them to represent us, that they have our interests at heart and are not simply serving themselves with lavish budgets, pet projects, unmerited bonuses, unlimited (unaccountable) expense accounts, and economic favours to their friends and cronies. Inevitably, our leaders are corrupted and forget the sacred trust that we have granted them. Our elected government, from the smallest city council to the central government, has demonstrated contempt for taxpayers by failing to disclose how our money is spent. The Auckland “Super City” is a prime example. Budgets and projections are smoke and mirrors that bear no resemblance to reality. Too often, we are consulted as a symbolic gesture and the government defies our collective will and does as it pleases. In this sense, government has committed legislated theft against its own citizens. Our trust has eroded. We must, as citizens and residents, live within our budget, pay our bills on time, and learn to make funding priorities. If we cannot afford something most of us simply don’t buy it. We are not allowed to, nor should we be, enslave the next generation of our family to our unbridled spending and debt acquisition. We are not allowed to make demands of our neighbour to pay our debts. As such it is ultimate hubris that the NZ government would continue its shameless bureaucratic expansion and refuse to live within its own budgets and “10 year plans”. Priorities must be set in place, and the government must tighten its belt and live within its budget. It must give an accounting of how our money is spent and the value that this achieved. It is our money after all, and our government is meant to be acting as our fiduciary, not simply helping themselves and their cronies. It is generally true that if we want more of something, it should be taxed less. If we want less of something, it should be taxed more. This has worked with tobacco, and we have seen a continued drop in cigarette smoking. A sugar tax makes perfect sense and would be far better for reducing dental caries than forcing water fluoridation upon communities. Carbon taxation however, is a regressive tax that will not do anything to help the planet. Carbon credits are a joke and have lined a few pockets and caused us to cover the north island with Pinus radiate and resulted in an ecological nightmare and loss of habitat for native birds and plant species. Decentralising energy production and incentivising individuals to use less energy and produce less waste will have a greater impact in the long run on helping the planet. NZ should be helping to subsidise solar, wind and geothermal (when feasible) power. We have so many options in this country. Making energy should not be JUST be for the profit of Primary industries or state owned enterprises, however. Individual kiwis could realise a personal l gain/cost saving with solar panels on their roof and some simple strategies to keep heat from being lost from their homes. The leaky home debacle keeps costing us dearly and adding to the tax burden of kiwis. The uniform Commercial Code has worked well in America for establishing responsibility and liability for payment in situations wherein a building has failed to perform. This could easily be adopted here going forward. The Christchurch earthquake rebuild is a quagmire of unaccountability and spending excesses in the CBD, and yet individual people and families are still displaced and cannot get legitimate funding to rebuild their lives. Better oversight and accountability around what has been spent and how this was allocated should be put in place. \[1\] 110 Thank you for your consideration, Dr Anna Goodwin 111 From:Rupert Rokeby-Johnson Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 10:05 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Thoughts for the Future of Tax Review As a relatively recent resident of NZ, I am generally in favour of the approach to taxation favoured by Governments of all persuasions over the last 30 years broadly reflecting the Roger Douglas reforms of the 1980s. Micromanagement and over complicated systems a la Muldoon or Gordon Brown/George Osborne in the UK demonstrably do not work. The broad approach with limited exemptions and low rates by International standards leads to low costs of compliance and opportunities and mostly minimises avoidance. I would like to make a few points on the current system that the Group might wish to consider: 1 A Nil Rate Band Currently there isn’t any leeway. A 16 year old working on Sundays in a shop for the minimum wage is taxed on her $150 a week earnings at 10.5%. Most other countries have a nil rate band of some sort which is both progressive and also reduces the overlap between tax and transfers. It would be a boost to low income earners and, if felt necessary, adjustments could be made to minimise any benefit to higher income earners. 2 Automatic adjustment to tax bands This is common in most advanced economies. In New Zealand the bands were last adjusted in 2010 and then as ‘compensation’ for the increase in GST. The last real changes were in 2008/9. Fiscal drag is not the issue it was in the high inflation environments of the 1970s, but it was misleading of (then) opposition politicians to describe the changes proposed by then Finance Minister Joyce in his 2017 budget as tax cuts. They were long overdue adjustments to the tax bands which just about reflected inflation over the preceding 8 years. I would suggest that tax bands are automatically adjusted for inflation every year unless Parliament decides otherwise. 3 GST The NZ GST system has the huge advantage of simplicity. They are no cases like the notorious UK cases on whether a ‘Jaffa Cake’ biscuit was a cake (0% VAT) or a biscuit (standard rate) eventually decided by the House of Lords. Cold takeaway food is 0%, warm takeaway food is standard rated. The examples are legion. It is considered regressive, but that can be and, to an extent, is compensated for elsewhere in the tax and transfer system. 4 FIF and FDR on overseas income As a recent arrival with overseas assets, I have yet to find anyone who fully understands the logic behind this system. In my layman’s view, it appears to be a way of ensuring that gains from overseas assets falls within the tax net in the absence of CGT particularly those assets where there is no income stream, only capital growth. However, it is effectively a crude wealth tax with an out of date deemed rate of return of 5% and limited recourse if the value of overseas assets fall. The principle of CGT in NZ has now been established with the bright line test on property which isn’t held as a primary residence. It would therefore be sensible to extend this to cover gains on foreign equities when rea lised and tax any income arising the same way as dividends paid on NZ shares. It would be fairer and simpler. 5 Possible New Taxes Stamp Duty on the acquisition of Property is cheap to administer and can be difficult to evade. It would have a negative effect on housing affordability. \[1\] 112 Targeted Sin Taxes - have either not been a success (Danish fats tax) or are selective in their implementation (sugar taxes limited to soft drinks) because they are difficult in practice to implement. Land Tax - great caution is needed as this could end up being a Gareth Morgan style ‘asset tax’. Sadly, we can’t all be early investors in Trade Me and many landowners are asset rich and cash poor. A land tax may well encourage more intensive farming which is just what is not needed to reduce CO2 emissions. Environmental Taxes - a lot of proposals seem driven by ideology. Carrots need to be provided as well as sticks.

If you take the risk of investing in assets, such as kiwisaver investments, housing and shares then the result can be: Great when their value goes up, as has been the case in the last few years (but only if you sell) or Terrible as was the case following the GFC and in the early 2000s and the late 1980s etc (but only if you sell) There is only a gain or a loss when you sell an asset. You don’t know till you sell how you’ve done. Hopefully you will have protected your asset, and therefore most often your retirement fund, from inflation and also increased the value of your asset. But unlike income there is no outcome guarantee. 2. You are likely to have invested income (in preference to consumable spending) that has already been taxed. Even kiwisaver contributions are effectively partly taxed. 3. As far as I am aware capital gains taxes elsewhere are complicated, costly to administer and produce a relatively small amount of revenue. 4. They also tend to be one-sided. Tax the gain but no refund for the loss. No government in the world would be prepared to “refund a notional tax on losses” Way too risky in a downturn. 5. Keeping out of capital gains & losses tax is an incentive to forego some spending and to invest and we need people to do that if they can for their future & NZs future I advocate that it is not a good thing nor an effective tool to seek to tax gains & losses from long term investments B Borrowing for the prospect of capital gains However, I do see an inconsistency of interest tax deductibility when assets are purchased on the back of a loan primarily for the prospect of capital gain, even though the transaction may be presented as an income earning investment. I do consider that it may be reasonable to restrict or deny that tax deductibility. So, whilst there is no capital gains & losses tax, there is also no or partial interest tax deductibility for these investments. So, for example, simplistically, I am not a tax expert, interest on borrowing for property ownership & share purchase non- deductible whereas interest on borrowing of other business activity deductible. PS Those who do pay income tax at full rates on their sales are other businesses. The devils would no doubt be in the details, making this work. Ideally keeping it relatively simple and averting the need for a raft of anti-avoidance provisions. \[1\] 114 From:Fraser Johns > Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 7:20 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To The Tax Working Group, For a lot of middle class people rental properties are one way (if not the only way) to ensure an income in retirement. Wages are relatively low in NZ, meaning putting away a portion of income for retirement is often unrealistic (although Kiwisaver is a great initiative as long as those who have Kiwisaver at retirement are not means tested for the pension), however leveraging equity in the family home to purchase 1-3 rental property's is doable for the average mi ddle class couple / family. Not everyone can be self employed or own a company, which is traditionally the other way people build wealth / increase income. There are currently huge tax benefits to company owners and the self employed that are not available to wage earners. Clothing, footwear, safety equipment, tools etc are expenses to both wage earners and self employed. For self employed people these items are purchased with pre-tax money and are claimed as expenses, for wage earners these are purchased with after-tax money and cannot be claimed as expenses. Wage earners have to pay to purchase vehicles, maintain and fuel them with tax paid money to get to and from work. Companies and self employed claim all vehicle related spending as expenses. I appreciate FBT is payable for private use, but the FBT rate does not reflect the true benefit. Anecdotally most people stretch the rules around FBT. Getting invoices for repairs to other family members vehicles or boats made out to a business vehicle is common practice. As is purchasing fuel for boats, motorbikes, the wife's car, lawn mowers etc and claiming it as a business expense. How many of the drivers of sign written double cab Utes parked at the boat ramp on the weekends have signed letters from employer's s tating the vehicle is only for travelling to and from work and is not to be used in the weekends. Most often the letter signing is followed by an off the record conversation along the lines that they are welcome to drive the vehicle in the weekends but if caught by IRD the letter will be produced. Changing the Tax laws to stop rental owners claiming expenses for R&M is heavy handed. A rental property is a business (all be it a marginally profitable one), selecting one business type to penalise this way is totally unfair. There is far more tax revenue to be found by tightening up loop holes and adequately policing Companies and the self employed than penalizing rental owners. House prices are a reflection of supply and demand. If the Govt wants to influence house prices work on supply (freeing up land for development, cut red tape and invest in infrastructure) or curb demand (react faster to control ingratiation numbers). Also consider giving benefits to companies that move operations to the regions. Closing the loop on foreign companies paying very little or no tax in NZ before penalising mum and dad investors trying to get ahead by purchasing a few rental properties should be the Govt priority. Would the cost of improvement to make rentals comply with minimum standards (heating and insulation etc) be considered an expenses? I look forward to hearing from you to speak further on the matter.

As a student and someone who has grown up with not a lot of money, a lot of my food choices are based on price. Unfortunately, it is a lot cheaper to buy chips than to buy a combination of vegetables to make a much healthier salad. That's only one example. Would the imposition of GST be a lot fairer if it was not imposed on basic commodities, that a household, that is less financially capable, needs:  Fruit  Vegetables  Senataries  Bread Removing GST from commodities like these would relax the regressive effect of GST and would relax the significance/proportion at which it adversely affects those with lower incomes. Kind regards, Diana \[1\] 117 From:Drew Tierney Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 4:33 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Sir/Madam, If you really wish to address inequality in NZ, it is very easy. Just follow the recommendations of tax advisors you hired to review the NZ tax system in the past. Some years ago (6 or 7), these advisors said that a capital gains tax needed to be introduced. NZ ignored it, primarily because those in power were too busy lining their pockets with capital gains from their housing portfolios. Housing is completely non-productive and serves to do two things: 1) keep those in debit poor as they pay off unsustainable mortgages; 2) keep those who already own a house and can leverage against it rich. Having lived in Canada for the first 33 years of my life, I do have experience of another system. Here is the Ontario model, which is pretty good at helping to address inequality and raise the standard of living for all. Capital gains:  The family home is ring-fenced. Any capital gains on it are non-taxable.  Capital gains on any other properties are taxed in the following way: 50% of the capital gain is attributable to the taxable income of the seller. So you made $100,000 capital gain? Then, $50,000 is added to your income for the year and is taxed at whatever your tax rate is. There is no way around this – no trusts, no other legal subterfuge.  If I own a house, then buy another and the second one becomes worth a lot more than the original (a case with many who own baches) can I switch my designated ‘family home’? Yes, but you pay the capital gains on the new family home as compared to the value of your original family home when you make the switch.  I would recommend NZ adopt this scheme. What about the people who own multiple houses now? They entered into their housing portfolios in good faith, therefore, they should have a degree of protection. Grandfather it so they still get to keep their capital gains as is. Over 20 years, the price of houses would at least plateau and there would be far fewer bidders at auctions as instead of people owning either 0 houses or 4, we would have most people owning 1 house – as I do! Savings:  Registered Retirement Savings Programmes (RRSPs).  In order to prepare for your retirement, you should put aside some of your income. There is little incentive to do that when you are already being taxed on it and need every penny just to survive. So, let’s allow for a certain percentage of your taxable incometo be put into an RRSP. It will be removed from your taxable income and is only taxable when it is removed. Therefore, when you retire and are not earning, you will tax out money from your RRSP and likely be paying a lower tax rate on it as it represents a reduced amount of ‘income’. In essence, you would be in a lower tax bracket at that time. Rules for RRSPs:  10% of previous year’s taxable income allowed to be put into RRSPs. This is accruable for up to 5 years.  RRSPs almost always consist of mutual funds which are chosen by the client. All RRSPS must consist of a certain amount of Canadian (in our case, NZ) content – perhaps 25%. This is a huge asset for NZ business as there is a ready pool of available funds for business to borrow from so they can open up business, have funds for R and D etc, etc. Also, provides the bank with money to lend for mortgages. Therefore, reduces foreign borrowing. \[1\] 118  First time home buyers can borrow from their own RRSPs at 0% interest, and must pay the money back at equal amounts over 15 years. I had $15,000 in my RRSP when I bought my first house, so had to pay it back at $1,000 per year over 15 years. Since I moved to NZ, I paid the whole thing back after about 3 years. Summary:  More money would be available to NZ businesses and banks.  Less reliance on foreign borrowing.  Cost of housing plateaus or even takes a small dip (over 20 years or so).  Kiwis more independent in retirement and less reliant on super.  Greater equality and less inequality in a country once known as having the greatest equality before the neo- liberalisation policies of Roger Douglas and co. If Canada is so great, why don’t you just live there? (the inevitable comment form some of my less-erudite NZ colleagues and friends). I married a Kiwi. I moved here for love, definitely not for money! Drew Tierney 119 From: Sent:Saturday, 28 April 2018 3:51 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Not sure what tax free means or gst or whatever but I think it’s along the lines of putting out free feminine products? And if this is the case I think that that is a great idea because us women cannot control our bodies from our monthly flow and the fact that we need to pay for something that is out of our control is absurd. Not only that, but homeless women or families with very little money are not able to get these products which are a necessity. No women should have to deal with not having pads or tampons. We can’t force our bodies to stop pouring out blood unless you take some sort of pill for it, but that’s besides the point. Most women and girls need pads and tampons. We should not have to pay for something that we need. However, all humans also need food, soap and other everyday stuff like that which technically if I am saying feminine should be free because they are a necessity, then those products should be free too. However because were on the topic of feminine products and feminine products only, I think they should be free. This will help so much women that are homeless, don’t have a lot of money or are wanting to save money (which is everyone). Thank you. \[1\] 120 From:Paul Hickson Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 11:05 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Working Group Submission Dear Working Group I have briefly read part of the background papers and since then read various press articles. I will comment on a few areas. Tax Overview – Unfortunately many New Zealanders seem to think tax is a necessary evil rather than in simple terms a cost we all need to share in paying to run the country. At a basic level we need to educate people from school age of the importance of tax. It is interesting that in my accounting practice the clients who pay the most tax see that is a measure of their success and have no problem in paying tax. Why do we not publicly encourage more people to think like that? Future environment – Perhaps the biggest problem is that if unemployment grows through the use of robotics etc we need to have a fair system of taxation so that wealth may be redistributed so that we all share in the benefits of technological change. Society will also have to look at paying for much of the work currently done by voluntary organisations eg. Fire brigades, St Johns Ambulance and Surf Lifesaving. More funding from the tax base would mean these organisations could employ more staff and reduce their need for fundraising. Broad based system – Current system seems reasonably fair to me. Things I would look at but are perhaps out of the scope of this group are (a)– Financial services tax on credit card and bank transactions for purchase of goods offshore or GST being imposed at lower thresholds on these online purchases. (b) – FBT should be paid by the recipient of the benefit, not the employer. Why should a farm employee be taxed on the use of a farm cottage when an employee receiving a company car which may be used privately not pay tax. In the case of a government department the state receives no net benefit. Productive v speculative economy - The country has a shortage of houses, and because too many people want to live in places like Auckland an affordability issue in those prime areas. Why does this paper and other commentary talk about rental housing investment as speculative and non-productive. I have a number of clients who own a few rental homes and our family does too. In each case these owners are self- employed people who to diversify their risk from their prime business, e.g. farming, have chosen rental property investment. They prefer this to indirect investment through a plethora of middlepersons who invest in other things, including property, to leave little return at the end. My experience is that after purchase these rental investors incur costs like painting, carpet replacement, insulation and asbestos checks. This change of ownership results in continual upgrades of the rental housing stock. Interestingly, in contrast to commercial property expenditure, the state receives a net GST benefit of 3/23 of the expenses as rental property is an exempt activity for investors. I think any steps to ring fence losses or have other forms of targeted taxes on those who invest in the sector in most need of investment is unfair and counterproductive. Extending the bright-line test to five years is enough. Tax and business – Many of the recent and proposed changes in the tax system like Aim and Payday reporting are good for bigger businesses but a problem for small business particularly those in areas with inadequate cellphone and internet coverage. IRD fail to recognise this and should allow more flexibility. Most businesses allow for different means of delivery – one size does not fit all. I cannot think of any businesses who benefit because of excessive deductions, as the changes in the 1980’s bought in evenness between sectors. I am a little concerned that anomalies will develop if certain sectors are targeted to encourage investment etc. As a matter of interest Government benefits in the kiwifruit industry at present with the release of G3 licence as I assume Zespri is taxed on the sale of licences in the year of sale while growers have to amortise it over the years to expiry of the license (2039). Of course if you wanted to encourage more horticulture \[1\] 121 investment etc you could accelerate the amortisation of development expenditure or allow full deductibility. This certainly works but does create unfairness between industry sectors. Capital Gains Tax - Not keen personally. If imposed it should be on realised capital gains only. Intergenerational changes with families or associated persons should also not be taxed as we should encourage family groups to look after themselves. Land Tax – Not keen personally. If imposed care would have to be taken as it could affect the viability of certain sectors as they each currently have different returns on capital. Environmental Taxes – Good idea but I am not sure how you construct them. The farming sector has been targeted but it is important that the contribution of grass cover and shelter belts be included as offsets – at the moment I do not think they are. From an environmental perspective is a hectare of farmland with a couple of cows grazing on it doing more damage to the environment than a hectare of Wellington CBD. Progressive Company tax - For small business there is effectively a progressive tax up to $70,000 as many take out profits as shareholder salaries. There is a case for aligning the trust, company and personal tax rates and for simplification where requiring no RWT on dividends if imputation credits are 28%. I could support higher personal tax rates for the super salaried and super earners. GST – Leave the system as it is in the meantime as it is working. However in the future if GST has to be increased for any reason I think food may have to be exempted so the impost on lower income families is not unfair. In summary I have noted a few points which concern me. The challenge is to have a system that is fair, that we are all taught that our taxes are needed to run the country and that in the future there may not be jobs for everyone and those people without jobs will need to feel part of our society and be remunerated in some way.

I am a chartered accountant who has been in public practice or associated with public practice for the whole of my career. I have been a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and its predecessor organisation for forty years. I believe I have insights from a practical point of view that may be of interest to the Working Group. I set out my submissions below. Summary and Conclusion Tax policy alteration is beset by the problem of the unintended consequence. My suggestions will not be any different. In a few words:  the ability to process vast numbers of transactions cheaply is the key to future taxing policy  income taxes will be around for a long time yet, and can be made more robust in the digital age and the age of the gig economy  electronic processing can be the key to further driving cash out of the economy, thus capturing a larger percentage of all transactions  taxes can be used to fund specific outcomes and to change behaviours more simply than ever before  the tax system will not fix the housing situation, it is a failure of supply  instituting a capital gains tax that exempts one specific class of asset will only lead to over- investment in that class  encouragement of more equitable distribution of wealth is a long term project, but the perceived problem might be improved by strengthening the incentive to save in asset classes other than property, at the same time increasing the pool of funds for development and further asset creation, and providing for retirement that is not state-funded. 1. The Future Environment The future is never predictable. Some trends do appear to be more likely to be sustained into the medium term future than others, however. Sustainable trends include:  ageing demographic structure of developed counties’ populations  continued rapid advances in technology, which  enable the continuation of the move to the digital economy. \[1\] 123 Each of these three trends individually has significant implications for taxing policy. Much less certain are which technological advances are going to be mainstream in the near to medium future:  “lab-grown” milk and meat (threatening the very existence of New Zealand’s pastoral economy)  blockchain and cryptocurrency developments (threatening the position of the existing banking system and financial transactional structure)  driverless electric vehicles (threatening to displace most of the world’s taxi drivers, changing the face of car ownership and public transport and potentially cityscape design, along with the virtual elimination of liquid fuels excise taxes). All these developments are in progress now, all are foreseeable mainstream economic prime-movers in our life time, not all may develop as we think. Governments have enormous difficulties “picking winners.” It is notoriously difficult, and has led to numerous failures, not least of which are the extinct socialist planned economies and our own mediocre “Think Big” projects. Winner picking is best left to the market. In order to make a coherent submission, I have chosen to address the two major trends as I see them which will definitely affect the future of society and the future of tax: demographic trends and the advancement of the digital economy. For the latter, I will have to cherry-pick some advances that I think are more likely to be sustained than others. Intersection of Demographics and Technology- Demographics and technology are both likely to change the labour participation rate. Demographic Effects Advances in health technology and life expectancy mean more older workers will stay in the work force for longer, many of them out of choice. This trend is well established, and will continue. The corollary in an ageing population, though, regardless of aged-people’s participation in the labour force, willing or not, means undeniably fewer workers providing income tax as a proportion of the population as a whole. At the same time, other advances may lead to less certainty and continuity in employment. This could cause the further expansion of the “gig economy” where labour is employed on contract, or ad hoc for specific pieces of work. This trend could affect young and old alike, meaning experienced workers are picked up to do specific projects and inexperienced workers may struggle to become experienced. The implications of this are social as well as taxing. Youth unemployment in the European economies is a major problem, as well as the perhaps better known displaced middle class workers in the US. Both these trends threaten the present notion of employment, however. The PAYE system as a cheap and effective way of gathering income tax from what is at present the vast majority of people employed in a structured and formal employment arrangement. This may well not last. Technological Effects- Whither Seekest the Tax Man (Person)? Regardless of whether a larger or smaller proportion of the population is employed in the work force as we know it, some trends are so well entrenched that they are now mainstream and “normal.” The ability to process more and more information at a cheaper and cheaper cost is one. The most powerful force at 124 work at present is the information revolution made possible by the digital age. Information is power, in the same way as oil is at the end of the petro age, and coal was in the steam age. The future of tax unquestionably lies in the electronic identification, collection and processing of data. Two of the fundamental principles of tax, broad-based application and efficiency of calculation and collection are the defining characteristics of big data. If technology displaces employment as we know it now, at least the necessity to reduce reliance on income taxes will be matched by the ability to identify and tax virtually any other transaction of the state’s choosing. 2. Taxes of General Application Transaction Taxes Taxing transactions is relatively straight-forward in an environment which processes virtually every transaction electronically. In the modern world, vast numbers of individual transactions are processed electronically. It would be a simple matter to re-impose a transaction tax on every transaction undertaken in the country, such as was the case in a way when many payments were settled by cheque. Such a tax would be collected from the banks monthly, making administration very cheap. It would also be easy to police: the daily transaction files from all the trading banks times the levy rate equals the tax to be paid. The transaction tax could also be set at a low level (say 5 cents, the rounding figure in a cash transaction, or less, meaning the disincentive to settle transactions electronically is low). The sheer volume of transactions would compensate for its low value. A transaction tax would also need to include cash receipts. This could be paid to the Revenue with the business’s GST. As cash is in decline generally as a means of settling transactions, the leakage would unlikely be significant. And, as for GST, if inputs are purchases that are then sold in a non-captured environment, all of the intermediate transactions in the chain are reported. Very small suppliers, those not registered for GST and the community cake stall, may escape the imposition of such a tax, but the effect would be negligible since the purchase of the ingredients (and their inputs) was captured. As the tax is levied on every transaction, it captures transactions offshore and tourists purchasing goods and services domestically. At one cent per transaction, every one million transaction raises $10,000 in tax. It is cheap and easy to collect, since the trading banks collect the majority of it. It is of universal application, and generally applied at a rate that is small enough not to distort behaviour. Taxes on Income- Countering the Gig Economy Income taxes have been the mainstay of tax gathering in the western world only since the beginning of the twentieth century. PAYE was introduced in New Zealand only in the 1950s. Income tax deducted at source is an efficient and cheap way for governments to collect cash regularly throughout the year. It takes a major disruption to our thinking to conceive that this system may be near the end of its applicability. Despite the rise of the gig economy, in my opinion income taxes are likely to remain a significant tax stream for many years to come. Many forms of employment, from University professorships to hospital cleaners, can be done either by someone working on contract or someone working as an employee, but for the foreseeable future, these positions are likely to be filled by someone. 125 It is acknowledged that collection of these taxes, and taxpayers’ compliance, may gradually become increasingly expensive. The real counter to the gig economy is likely to be electronic capture of transactions and inputs by the purchasing organisation. The IRD apparently estimate that self employed taxpayers under report their income by 20%. This implies that the future policing of this (because some short term employment will be in the nature of contracting work, by self-employed contractors) can be countered in two ways, both dependent on technology:  every contractor/short term “project” employee requires a New Zealand bank account and a New Zealand tax number  payments for such work over some small minimal amount (say $20) must be made to a bank account  the contractor is either self employed, and renders an invoice, or casual, in which case the worker produces an IRD number and is subject to withholding tax  in either case the employing entity must look up the IRD number and enter it as part of its record keeping  extend the existing regime of withholding tax deduction to cover any form of non-permanent work, that is not an employment relationship, and simplify the rates applied so a flat rate is deducted- for example a flat rate of 10% or 15% with exceptions (higher rates) for specific work types  counter the cash economy by making it illegal to pay for inputs over the de minimus sum other than by bank transfer. The IRD’s tax number system should be accessible by any tax payer: for example, a cafe wanting an itinerant baker for three weekends should be able to search the candidate’s IRD number, prove his/her name and address, and that the person presenting for work is a registered tax payer. Electronic filing and processing power should enable the taxing authority to match payments made on behalf of a taxpayer to that taxpayer virtually instantaneously. Bona fide contractors therefore also have to provide a searchable tax number when they “register” to provide services. The above comments apply to organisations obtaining inputs. Private individuals getting work done are now theoretically required to obtain a tax invoice for any supply. Inevitably, the cash economy will take time to stamp out, but the leakage should be small and getting smaller. The above comments though beg the question: if I can connect my phone, laptop, desktop, tablet and TV, and link them all to other members of my immediate circle, why can we not use the internet to track all transactions? If every transaction is registered against a unique identifier, the IRD number, the IRD number collects all transactions, debit and credit. The key to policing tax compliance is electronic data processing of “big data”: the means is now at hand to implement this. The Rise of Consumption Taxes The possible, gradual loss of PAYE and the reduction of reliability in PAYE collections might have the effect of reducing the tax take from NZ’s largest present source of tax revenue. If work is displaced, leading to a gradual demise of income taxes, consumption taxes would have to fill the gap. While income taxes may remain important, they might become more expensive to collect and to police. The attractiveness from a Revenue point of view might decline substantially. If the future of work and employment, and the efficacy of the PAYE system, does undergo change, then the PAYE system may no longer be the way to deliver benefits and redistribute income (see below). One 126 result of technological displacement of human labour that has generated discussion abroad is the concept of some sort of universal basic or minimum income for every citizen. While this is outside the scope of these submissions, such an eventuality may well force the jurisdiction more towards consumption taxes than income taxes, and more towards transactional or even asset-based taxes to capture the benefits of the technological shift. However, income taxes are not dead, and in my view predictions of their imminent demise are greatly overstated. Taxpayer Type: Does it Matter? Company Tax Pressures: Comparative Rates Small business tax rates are a myth. This is stated in bold and in italics, because there is no such thing as a small business tax rate. Small business is subject to the same tax rates as everybody else: Josephina Blow, plumber, working as a sole trader, pays tax on her assessable income at exactly the same rates as Henrietta Squires, orthopaedic surgeon. If Josephina and Henrietta operate through companies, their companies pay tax at 28%, exactly the same as any assessable earnings Fletcher Construction may report. There is no concession for being “small.” There is a concession for being a “person.” Personal taxpayers pay tax at a variety of rates (the graduated scale) until the top rate of income tax is reached. Application of uniform top tax rates across all entity types would address the perceived problem of small business. The ideal would be to reduce the top personal and the trust rate to match the company rate. In my experience, small companies are talked about in the same breath as small businesses, as if they are one and the same. In many instances they are, but the company is only one of a number of legal structures the business could be conducted through. From a tax perspective, should it matter? If income earning becomes more fragmented, and the “gig” economy displaces traditional single employer-employee relationships, the question of form of entity may become more important for taxpayers, since there may be a far higher proportion of the population earning at least some proportion of its income through a contracting arrangement. The use of entities other than the taxpayer’s own person to earn that income may proliferate. When the highest personal tax rate was raised to 39% but the company and trust rates were left at 33%, the obvious response by taxpayers occurred. Top tax rates should be uniform. It should not matter whether a person earns their income through a trust, company or as themselves (either as personal taxpayer or partnership): the taxing result should be the same. This takes away all the nonsense about income attribution, who earned what, expenses deductions etc, and where to retain surplus income. The vast majority of very small companies are formed for the purpose of conducting one-person businesses, and the total earnings are extracted by way of shareholder salary every year. The real reason for the company is to obtain the (often illusory) benefit of limited liability. Applying different top rates to different types of entity is a recipe which asks for income diversion. Uniform rates means the tax base is unaffected, and taxpayers can structure their affairs according to other (commercial) considerations. In this context, imputation of company dividends with no further taxation (unless there is a marginal rate difference, as now) is completely fair and logical. 127 Could Companies and Trusts Use the Same Graduated Scale as Personal Tax Payers? They could, but the rule would need to be that the benefit of the graduated tax scale could only be allocated once, either to the entity, or to a taxpayer, in the case of a trust or a closely held company. A public company would receive the benefit of the reduction in tax charge, and reduce the amount in its imputation credit account that it could distribute accordingly. Because both trusts and companies can pass income to personal taxpayers in a variety of ways, they have one rate of tax and the personal taxpayer is able to access the rate concessions attaching to low income. Full imputation of income distributions already addresses the perceived high tax rates applying to “small business” in NZ to some extent. Profits, which, if distributed, would incur the top marginal rate of personal tax, can already be left in the company, subject to various rules (such as Penny & Hooper). These can be distributed on retirement in theory, incurring no further tax. This would still be the case if the company rate were reduced. If we are to pursue other countries (the UK, with an impending 18% tax rate, Australia) in a race to the bottom with “small business” tax rates, it is a no-win game, creating pressure to leave the income in the company. This then has to be followed (eventually) by an excess retentions tax, which we have tried before. Nobody wins, least of all the Revenue, or the taxpayer in the end. Lower tax rates for companies, if that decision were taken, is addressed through the imputation system, which ensures the final recipient pays his or her marginal rate of tax on the underlying income. This is one of the best systems in the world of its type, from my observations. If the company rate of tax were to be reduced, I am of the opinion it should be matched by a reduction in income tax rates across all entity types. Different top rates will only encourage income diversion and sheltering, as Sir Michael Cullen must be fully aware. It happened on his watch. GST I do not need to say anything about GST, other than do not tinker with it. As the owners of one of the few broad-based, no exceptions, model value-added tax systems in the world, we have a system that works well, is readily comprehensible, is easy for most to comply with and is relatively easy for the Revenue to police. Its best feature is the no exceptions policy: we do not have ridiculous sums of money spent defining the difference between meals eaten in or out, children’s versus adults’ shoes, “bread” and “bruschetta.” GST is a regressive tax, in that poorer people who consume a larger proportion of their income than wealthy people, pay a higher proportion of their income as tax. For this reason, the broad-based appeal must be tempered with a commitment to a low rate. 15% is probably about as high as GST can go and still be described as a “low rate” value added tax. 3. Equity and Distribution New Zealand’s targeted government support system I thought would have delivered better equity and income distribution results than seems to be the case from the background paper. This is not a result that needs the baby to be thrown out with the bathwater: the mechanism (redistribution through the PAYE system in effect, meaning that many beneficiaries in work receive their income top-up through a negative PAYE deduction) is good, what might need adjusting is the rates at which benefit redirections kick in (a political welfare, not a taxing question). 128 I agree that part of a taxation system’s function is to redistribute income in an equitable fashion. A tax system might be able to address wealth disparity, through a variety of means, but should it? 4. Behaviours- Stimulating Change and the Tax System The tax system presently is little used to change behaviours: the excise taxes may be seen as an effort to redirect behaviour away from consumption of harmful substances. Tobacco and alcohol are harmful to the individual, and consumption is discouraged. These consumption taxes may be thought of as a way to compensate the state for providing health care. Similarly, liquid fuel excise probably started as a way to finance infrastructure, limit consumption of scarce overseas funds, and tax a supply that everyone is forced to purchase. This is now changing, and in the future liquid fuels excise taxes might be seen as a “green” tax to reduce carbon emissions, and stimulate the transition to a lower carbon economy. The ease with which these can be levied has been amply demonstrated this month. Gambling duty tends to be a hidden tax on behaviour. How many machine gamblers know that of every dollar fed into the machine, slightly more than fifty cents goes straight to the government, without ever possibly forming part of the prize pool? These taxes raise the pertinent questions: which behaviours should we be encouraging? Which behaviours should be discouraged? Is the tax system the right place to do this? These questions are the equivalent of “how long is a piece of string?” I will address in this submission three broad areas of thought: environmental behaviour, things we might want to change, and economic behaviour. The question also needs to be asked: how successful are such policies? Has the incidence of gambling reduced? Do people consume less liquid fuel? Do they smoke less? The answer might be provided by the last example: only when the price becomes extreme. Environmental Behaviour: Should the Tax System be Used to Modify Behaviour? Broadly speaking, macro-economic incentives toward behavioural change in carbon-related environmental matters should be directed through the Emissions Trading Scheme. Emitters should be required to purchase units, and surrender these to the government for their emissions activities. This area is the subject of a separate review, and the Productivity Commission is working on it. User-pays charges relating to other scarce environmental resources should endeavour to impute the social cost of the consumption of these to the person who benefits from using them. Undesirable outcomes, such as dirty water and degraded air quality are best addressed by making the activities that cause the problem pay the cost of mitigating the effects. Clearly, it is no simple matter to define the “cost” and set an appropriate charge, but we have to start somewhere. Environmental resources have always been viewed as a free good in New Zealand. The inevitable result is that a good that is free is perceived as having no value, and therefore abused. A whole raft of user-pays charges could be initiated: from water royalties for irrigators to discriminatory DoC charges against foreigners for using publicly funded huts and walks in national parks. Again, these user pays charges need to be easily and cheaply collected: a service charge where something is purchased with the tax/charge being collected by the selling body is usually the simplest. And here, I should submit that New Zealand usually looks to be afraid of its own shadow. The row over increased airport security charges was instructive. Why does anyone think that there is a material difference between collecting $15 and $50 per inbound passenger to fund airport infrastructure? The price 129 elasticity of demand for foreigners holidaying in NZ is not that fragile. The marginal one or two travellers this increase might dissuade from coming here are not likely to be economically desirable tourists in any case. Are these charges even taxes? Probably not, since there is a direct connection between a service consumed and the charge levied. Once a charge is levied, however, the payer is likely to demand to know what he gets for his money. Even worse, he might want a quality output. We should be in a position to tell him, and demonstrate that the quality of the experience is worth the cost. Packaging Packaging is something the tax system could and should address. Why do we tolerate non-recyclable or non-biodegradable packaging? Why do we tolerate excessive packaging? The last might be difficult to define and target, but the first two should not. It should be possible to tax out of existence non-recyclable and non-biodegradable packaging. Either these materials fit within the definitions of what can be recycled or will degrade in a land fill, or they do not. If they do not, punitive rates of sales tax (applied at the wholesale level, meaning either at manufacture or import) and starting at a low level but with a rising scale over time to allow for substitution should see their use effectively outlawed in this country. I do not believe in this day and age, that there is no bio-degradable or recyclable alternative for all the packaging that we presently see that is neither. Consumer Choices-Targeted Taxation Electronic processing of large tranches of transaction data enables the targeting of taxes at specific taxpayers, or specific products. For example, a consumption tax on sugary drinks could be levied through point of sale equipment, as could a penal tax on specific businesses considered to be “not paying their share.” The “sugary drinks” issue is an example of using taxation as a means of redirecting social behaviour, in the belief it may lessen the incidence of obesity/diabetes. This is philosophically no different to the imposition of excise taxes are used to discourage smoking, or the gambling duty used to reduce the incidence of community-based gambling machines. Universal bar codes describing the product can be used to record the quantity (grams per litre) of sugar in the liquid/product. The rate of tax could vary on the detrimental health effects considered likely. For example, pure fruit juice, with no sugar added, may be at a level that is below the taxing threshold. Any sugar-added beverage could attract tax on a sliding scale. The object of such a tax may not be to collect revenue, but rather to impose a penalty on the drinks deemed to be “anti-social.” High sugar drinks packed in a one-use plastic container could be hit twice. Why stop at drinks? Sugary products could be captured in exactly the same way. Any product (eg sugary breakfast cereal) with a sugar content per serving size (or 100 grams, or whatever measure is chosen) exceeding 10 grams may attract a tax of 20 cents per gram. Those with 20 grams per unit, may attract a tax of 30 cents per gram, and so on. These are discriminatory sales taxes. They are levied before GST is applied. They can be applied at any percentage to any criteria that is readily identified because the information exists and is in a standardised form. It is the availability of the data that allows for the collection of the tax. 130 The point is that the information is available, and not difficult to collect. As the vast majority of sales by unit occur in retail outlets which have sophisticated point of sale equipment, the leakage would be low. This is particularly so, when it is remembered that some outlets, such as Pak N Saves, operate as de facto wholesalers for other, smaller and less sophisticated, retail outlets. Foreign-owned taxpayers which appear to shift profits offshore via mechanisms such as excessive IP payments, supply payments and foreign “Management fees” at what appears to be excessive levels, could simply have a tax levied against their sales at point of sale. For example, 10 cents added to every item. The instrument might be a regulation passed under the auspices of the main taxing legislation: in other words, simple and quick to implement once the Minister is satisfied of the necessity. This mechanism could also be used to retaliate against cases of unilateral infringement against WTO or other rules: an import duty on NZ products by, say, the USA, could incur a sales tax against every taxpayer with an ultimate holding company in the US. Alternatively, every cup of coffee or hamburger (or any other product) could incur a sales tax not levied against domestic competition where a product royalty or similar charge is remitted to a parent ultimately resident in the offending country. Local franchisees could pay a penal rate of withholding tax on every remittance of royalties/IP/management fees paid offshore where locally owned franchisees operate locally-owned businesses tied into international master franchises/business corporations where there is evidence to suggest these payments are attempted base erosion. Extraction of payments to technology giants who are considered not to pay their fair share, in the absence of satisfactory resolution of issues through OECD mechanisms, could also have withholding taxes of 50% (or any other rate) levied against all payments. The ability exists to identify those liable and the transactions caught. These should be easy to identify, easy to discriminate against, easy to write regulations for and easy to collect. They might also send powerful messages, particularly in concert with other (eg OECD) countries. These taxes are much easier to apply than they were formerly. Every business in NZ has an identifier number, as does every product. Every transaction is tracked electronically somewhere. Discrimination (against either products or taxpayers) is a political question, but the means exists and the regulations would be relatively easy to write. Even better, the taxpayer discriminated against collects and pays the tax. Build it and They will Come Funding infrastructure, be it with a $1 a night bed-tax charged on all hotel, motel, Air BnB and the like- provided accommodation, or swiping your bank card to use a clean toilet, is the norm overseas. Why not here? Technology (solar power, remote access Eftpos card reader machines) enables charging in places and for activities or facilities where it was not feasible a few years ago. We constantly hear that tourist destination regions struggle to fund the resource needed to cope with the numbers. The necessary infrastructure usually falls to the local authority, with possibly national government help with roads funding. The local authority receives no revenue from the tourists other than indirectly through business rates and some direct charges for activities. There is an actual financial disincentive for councils to expand the infrastructure to cater for tourists, because they are a drain on their finances. This same phenomenon has a bearing on land and house prices (see below). 131 Our problem as a nation is that we have not built it and they’re already here: we are abysmally bad at planning, although very good at report writing. We never seem to anticipate the obvious. User pays to fund additions to what is already required is just catch-up, but better than having the taxpayer fund it all. Economic Behaviour Taxes world-wide stimulate behaviour, a lot of it undesirable. Usually, the problem is with definitions, thresholds and margins. Therefore, the less complicated any of these are, the better. Our version of the VAT-type tax (GST) is one of the world’s simplest. There are few exceptions, and it is consequently broad-based. It is also set at a relatively low rate by international standards. Having discussed and advocated various types of transaction and sales tax above, I merely wish to reiterate here that GST applies to everything, including the underlying transaction/sales taxes. Desirable Behaviour- Saving: Should Asset Type Matter? The analysis in the Background Paper comparing different tax treatments for different asset types is misleading in my opinion. The assumption appears to be a 3% real rate of return for every asset class, and the marginal tax consequences of that assumption are graphed. The assumption is clearly nonsense: historical rates of return are not equal, and the tax consequences would look quite different had a realistic set of assumptions had been used. It is quite true that fixed interest is over taxed, which is why this is an unpopular investment class for many people. There is not enough information given to make a meaningful comparison of the effectiveness of the asset types. The lack of disclosure of the assumptions made to calculate the returns in the analysis render it meaningless. For example, is the risk free return of 3% the only return? What proportion of assets classes make up the modelled superannuation fund? A layman looking at this would instantly (misguidedly) withdraw their money from a Kiwi Saver fund and buy a rental property. Yet that is not the experience of the investor. Real people act because of how they perceive the environment affecting their own circumstances. Most do not perceive Kiwi Saver accounts as being highly taxed (because they’re not) but they do perceive that in times of inflation, fixed rates on term deposits are a wealth destruction disaster. Shares and property at least protect against inflation. This analysis seems to target property as an investment class. Is there an unstated bias towards instituting a capital gains tax? Since the government has ruled out home ownership as a taxable class, that leaves investment property. The nub of the question is therefore: would a capital gains tax make any difference? Anecdotally, it does not appear to have done so in Australia, Canada, or the UK; all similar societies, all with similar property price problems in their most popular locations. There are reasons other than tax why investment property appears to behave differently from other capital asset classes, although this will not appear from the assumptions in the analysis in the background paper. The following is also relevant to recommendations regarding ring-fencing losses from rental property made in another paper put forward by the IRD recently. Banks only lend on bricks and mortar. Although it is theoretically possible to mortgage shares, in practice, the banks will not lend, unless secured by property as collateral. Therefore, it is nigh-on impossible to buy shares with less than 100% equity, unless, for example, an incoming business owner can put up collateral or obtain a guarantee from the outgoing owner. 132 For ordinary investors, it is easier to buy a rental property investment than share investments, because they can finance the deposit using surplus equity in their own home (or other available property assets) with the balance secured by the rental property itself. They could not achieve the equivalent value in shares. The attraction in either case, of course, would be the hoped for increase in value being financed by the bank in nominal dollars. Capital Gains Tax A fair capital gains tax (CGT) system needs to strip out the inflation component and tax real gains. Most people realistically can only hedge themselves against inflation by owning a house in which they live, which is off limits in terms of a taxed asset class here. Similarly, elimination of the undistributed earnings is required before a true capital gain can be measured on shares. There are no undistributed earnings inherent in property, but the amount of equity growth of a share since acquisition is represented by undistributed earnings accretion, and the inherent capital gain. In the case of a New Zealand shareholder of a New Zealand share, undistributed revenue reserve growth could be distributed imputed to the extent of available tax credits, meaning a partially or wholly tax paid receipt. Instantly, the complexities become apparent. In an ideal world, the tax would be calculated on only that portion of the gain which did not relate to accumulated revenue reserves plus the undistributed revenue reserves not fully imputed. Altogether too hard. It is worse for foreign shares. These are presently taxed for some tax payers on income distributed and for others on the Fair Dividend Rate, a creation of fiction, which taxes foreign shares at 5% of their opening value regardless of their distributions. On long term trends of 6-8% per annum, the tax paid represents about a 28% tax charge at a 6% growth rate. It would be impractical to separate retained income and actual capital growth, since many people who own them do so through foreign investment funds. Presumably, to be fair, a CGT would also have to be levied against increases in value against designated superannuation funds, such as Kiwi Saver funds. It is well known that government subsidies or concessions are capitalised into the asset they refer to: a historical analysis of New Zealand’s experience with agricultural subsidies confirms this. There is no reason to think the superannuation industry is any different, and the government subsidy of fund managers’ fees appears to have been appropriated by the fund management industry. To impose a CGT on investment asset classes, but exempt superannuation funds, will distort economic behaviour. This would mean that you could own the same assets via a fund, exempt of tax, but pay tax if you own them personally. It would take some time for the market to re-calibrate itself to the new equilibrium, but it would stabilise at new levels. In the meantime, there would be large numbers of winners and losers, the antithesis of good tax policy. It should be noted that many people save for their retirement in ways other than a designated Kiwi Saver fund. Others, who have such a fund, have never thought to invest in more than a default fixed interest fund. At the end of the day, policy, including tax policy, can only go so far. Policy can include stimulants, penalties and incentives, but people ultimately make their own decisions. However, it is clear that imposition of a CGT in the way foreshadowed in the paper will only lead to overcapitalisation of owner-occupied homes and adverse impacts on renters. 133 A capital gains tax, coupled with the ring fencing proposal and the existing measures put in place, that targets rental and other (farming?) property will add to the impetus to leave the rental market. This will impact to the severe detriment on renters, as the lucky few first home buyers who can afford the deposit snap up the available stock as it comes onto the market. Does Tax Policy Affect Property Prices The answer clearly is yes, but I don’t think a capital gains tax is the answer. A tax on the result dictated by the market is not going to affect the underlying factors at work. One of the reasons rental properties might be in short supply is the disruption caused by the likes of the short term accommodation websites such as Air BnB. Some operators will undoubtedly be in for a rude shock when they receive their please explain letters from the IRD. The real reason that house prices are too dear is that there are too many buyers, and not enough sellers. We have not built enough units each year, for years. There has been a failure in the market. Why is this? A clue might be found in an analysis of the final price of a new build, between the house and the land it sits on. The land value is too high, in areas of high demand, considerably above the $150,000 that might be thought representative. One reason for this might be the process of rezoning new residential land. Another might be the intensification of inner urban land. A third might be that that the Resource Management Act is more appropriate to rural settings than urban. Or not, depending on your point of view. Another reason there are too few houses built might be the way we concentrate on university educations instead of vocational training, and the emasculation of the trade-training apprenticeship system years ago. The supply failure is not a tax issue. However, from a taxing point of view, one issue does appear: a new subdivision involves the local council in considerable expenditure, to develop or connect the developer’s infrastructure to the existing reticulated services. If the council is in a popular residential area, it may be already near the limit of its borrowing capacity. It has every incentive to slow things down, or not proceed at all. There is no financial or market incentive for a council to fast track new developments, or develop them at all. Central government may have to incentivise local government to do better. Sharing GST revenues would be one way: the GST raised by local government services could be returned to local government, giving an additional 15%. Or, in a more directed fashion, subdivisions in “areas of high demand” (to be defined) could have GST revenues attributed towards their completion by local governments. Normally, I am not in favour of government interventions, but this is more of a revenue sharing enabler than a market intervention. The design of such an intervention needs to provide the incentive to local authorities to complete subdivisions, within the terms of the Resource Management Act, once the approvals are obtained. For example, a “bounty” of so much per section could be paid to assist the authority to provide the infrastructure connectivity required. Wealth Equalisation Income redistribution and a more equitable distribution may be a goal worthy of aspiring to for tax policy. Wealth equalisation is simply not possible, it will only fail. 134 The comments made above about the capitalisation of any government incentives into asset prices are worthy of note under this heading. First home buyer subsidies in Australia simply led to a faster increase in the prices of houses in the bands first home buyer s were likely to be purchasing; elimination of stamp duty on the first GBP 250,000 in the UK to assist first home buyers simply led to inflation of the price of chattels that were included. Numerically, a vast increase in the number of houses changing hands at or just under the band price was noticed. New Zealand’s wealth distribution can be improved only if the volume of wealth is increased. The disproportionate level of farm “values” in this country and the fact that it is held by a relatively small number (farmers) must distort the distribution statistics. House prices in certain locations will not have helped. People need to be educated to save their wealth in asset different asset classes. Financial asset saving has the additional benefit of creating a pool of investment capital that can be used for development and innovation, enhancing further wealth creation. Taxes such as inheritance taxes, gift taxes, and other forms of tax paid on capital assets have been applied in New Zealand and in othe r jurisdictions historically, and do not appear to have had an appreciable effect. The distribution of wealth is not equal, has never been equal, and will likely never be equal or equitable. Taxes on capital assets will distort behaviour, and lead to attempts at evasion. A better way to encourage the creation of wealth that gives everyone a share of that wealth is through the compulsory enrolment in schemes like Kiwi Saver, which provide for the future of the population and may ultimately enable the universal element of National Superannuation to be phased out. Incentives that might be considered once enrolment in an approved scheme is compulsory:  a tax deduction for the first, say, $10,000 personal contribution  a PIE tax rate of say 10% across the board for all designated superannuation funds  continuation of saving and financial literacy education for first time (compulsory) and other workers and contributors  the government fee subsidy is conditional upon regulation of management fees charged. 5. Conclusion I thank the Working Group for the opportunity to make this submission. Yours faithfully, Christopher Worth Chartered Accountant \[1\] 135 From:Alan Forster Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 10:20 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the Tax Working Group. Dual Taxation system. The basic aim is to improve the tax system in order to. 1. Make the system fairer and address inequity. 2. Provide transparency to the system and prevent tax evasion and avoidance 3. Keep money in circulation rather than allowing excessive accumulation. 4. Fund all current government operations and services. 5. Fit within and modify the current system with least disruption. 6. Provide a rational and understandable system that is easily understood by all tax payers. These would be achieved by converting or expanding the current GST system into a comprehensive FTT ( Financial Transaction Tax.) and establishing a Holding Tax (HT) on savings or holdings above a reasonable set limit. These two taxes would replace income tax, business tax on profit and the current GST system. The FTT would apply to every transaction whether internal or international, in stocks, bonds, cash or electronic payments, and all monetised commodities. By widening the catchment in this way the tax burden can be reduced on the individual. Businesses and banks remain in there current tax collection rolls, with the addition of managing the HT (Holding Tax) by banks, overseen by IRD and the reserve bank as it is now. The FTT and HT taxes could be adjusted on a regular basis as necessary to stabilise the economy. It could be applied at a rate that equals the current tax take A FTT would provide a simpler mechanism of government control and more accurate monitoring the economy. Since all activities are included in the FTT system it will be more transparent with regard to criminal and unethical uses of money , while the HT also makes storage of such funds in the banking system unattractive. The levels at which HT starts for individuals and companies would be different and a formula for setting these would need to be researched . It is not desirable to have exemptions to either of the taxation methods, some may feel disadvantaged by them and their concerns would need addressing in the context of the greater good, This text is introductory and much more work would need doing to verify its validity however the people I have spoken to about these see these changes as a positive way forward for the New Zealand economy. Thank you for your time, Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information.

Currently my pension is taxed at 40 % as it is a second income. Would it not be more of an incentive to allow all military pensions to become tax free, if the person has been in service to the crown? I am still serving the same queen in the RNZN, and as such my boss has not changed. All that seems to have changed is I am now getting less money for my service. If this incentive were to passed on to all pensions, the incentive to save for retirement would rest to the individual to start saving as early as possible. Sent from my iPhone \[1\] 137 From:Brian Porteous Sent: Friday, 27 April 2018 11:36 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: My say. My Say Company tax should be treated like an individual. If a company profits less than $14,000 then that company should pay 10.5% tax on that profit, however if a company profits more than $70,000 then the company should be taxed 33%. This will accomplish two goals; One, it will limit tax sheltering and two, it allows less profitable companies tax relief to help them grow. One might argue that as a company grows they will not be motivated or inspired to become more profitable out of feeling punished by being taxed at a higher rate but if you apply that same argument to individuals it is quite clear that there is no substance to this. Additional individual tax rates need to be created. $70,000 at 33% as the top bracket is not high enough. The government is missing out on millions of dollars. As an example, we could have a $100,000 at 35% bracket and a $250,000 at 38% bracket. There are other countries around the world that have as high and higher tax brackets as this, see France and Japan for instance. We have an ageing population and therefore will need to fund a greater number of superannuitants. The revenue required for this will be from a small group of working people and therefore need to be taxed at a higher rate or taxed for a longer period. The age of retirement will need to be increased even greater than currently planned for. Another point to consider is no one who is in full-time employment should be eligible to receive superannuation. Currently this “double dipping” practice does happen, I have seen it first hand. It takes unnecessary funds out of the superannuation budget. Charitable businesses need to be taxed. There are high profit making companies (Sanitarium, Ngai Tahu, Tainui Group Holdings) that should be paying tax on their income. This tax will go to the government who will then use that revenue to fund social security and welfare, health and education to name a few which should be seen as charitable purposes that benefit all New Zealanders. These companies also benefit from not paying income tax by their ability to under-cut competitors, for example, when bidding for contracts or pricing their products at a lower price point. This may bring about backlash from smaller charitable companies so one method that may work is to tax those companies that profit $1M or more before they have given to their chosen charity. Capital Gains Tax: It is perceived that all landlords are multimillionaires who snap up any property that goes on the market for a premium price and drive up the market thereby making huge capital gains and become even richer. \[1\] 138 From an article by Bob Hargreaves in 2017: The private sector dominates the rental accommodation business in New Zealand with 453,135 rental dwellings in 2013, more than 83% of the market overall. Most owners are “Mum and Dad” landlords and may only own one or two rental properties. So the reality is that half a million dwellings are mostly owned by working class parents having to top up their mortgage payments because the rent doesn’t cover it. They are using the residential rental property market as a savings vehicle for their retirement, believing that the age of retirement will keep increasing (as it has to) and the NZ superannuation payments will not be enough to keep them alive, healthy and warm. They are relying on capital gains and at the same time providing housing for over a million people. There is a requirement to stop speculation which does drive the market up and this has already been addressed by the bright-line policy. I believe this is, or is close to being, a 5 year period where a seller has to pay tax on any capital gain. Another option to this could be to have a diminishing percentage of tax to pay as time goes on. E.g. 100% CGT if sold in first year, 90% CGT if sold in second year, 80% CGT if sold in third year and so on, or a variation of this. GST: A step in the right direction with regards to our health system is to reduce GST on fruit and vegetables. This will encourage the behaviour of buying better food. It must be stated that to qualify, the food would have to be unprocessed in any way, it must be in the same form as it grows. To counter the lost revenue from the above reduction, an increase in GST for all sugary food needs to be applied. It is simply unfair to only apply extra tax to “fizzy drinks”. A fair system would be to apply an excise tax on food and drink that contains sugar above a certain percentage in an increasing fashion as the sugar content increases and divided by the number of servings per package. This would take into account the likes of a bottle of tomato sauce at 26% sugar but having 37 servings verses a can of cola at 10% sugar but only 1 serving. A sugar tax like this will have the effect of reducing our obesity levels, reducing our diabetes, reducing our dependence on the public health system and increasing the health of our population as a whole. The physical presence of a company shouldn’t matter, if they are conducting business in NZ they should pay tax to NZ. For an on-line company a line needs to drawn as to where the business is occurring. The same should occur for a person, for example, if a tourist on a working visa is here working their way around NZ to fund their holiday then that person needs to pay tax to NZ. Had the job been performed by a NZ’er then they would have paid tax probably via PAYE. The tourist should then not have to pay tax in their home country as it is not fair to be double taxed. The same should occur if a NZ’er goes to Australia for example and works there for a limited time. They should pay tax to the Australian government and no tax on that income in NZ. Hypothecation tax is a good idea to get extra funding in certain areas however, if the same amount of revenue can be gained in other ways then hypothecation tax should be disregarded. Hypothecation tax puts a limit on where the funds can be spent which may not benefit all NZ’ers. Contractors should not have to pay their own tax as some I know simply do not comply. This results in lost government revenue. The business that has hired them should pay their 139 tax as though the contractor was an employee of theirs and tax them at the highest rate and the contractor can claim a tax return at year end if they earn less. An argument can be made as to whether a contractor is really self employed or are they employed by the company that they are contracting to. ACC earners levy should not be capped. This financial year the limit is $126,286 or $1755.37 or 1.39%. Why not keep this fair and equal for all levels of income. A CEO for example earning $5,000,000 should pay 1.39% ACC earners levy or $69,500 which is equal to the percentage that the majority of working NZ’ers currently pay. With the current rule, that same CEO would only pay $1755.37 or 0.035% Lastly, tax rules based around maori need to be exactly the same as tax rules for non-maori. Without similar rules for all races, we will not be an equal country and it will be a step towards division between maori and non-maori. Company’s directors could also place the company in a maori persons name just to access tax breaks. Good luck with the job you have ahead of you, I do not envy you. Thank you for the opportunity for me to have my say. Regards, Brian Porteous. 140 From:Hayley Mitcheson Sent: Friday, 27 April 2018 10:28 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Working Group Submission To whom it may concern, There are many different aspects that need to be looked at as part of the tax overhaul where there is more equity for all New Zealanders, regardless of where they live and what they do for work. My first and largest concern is GST. This needs to be removed from fruit/veges/meat/dairy, essential baking items as well as standard hygiene products (including sanitary items, soap, shampoo, toilet paper, simple cleaning products). This will encourage more people to bake, cook and buy more healthy options for their families whilst maintaining hygienic standards. On this note, why can some people claim back GST, yet the standard everyday person is unable to do this, even if they kept all of their receipts, why can some people and businesses get away with doing this? It is not a fair system for everyone. Working in the education sector, we can claim ours back, but it becomes such as process, whereas why is it charged to start with, it will lessen the paperwork involved in the process. The next aspect of our tax system also relates to a lack of equity and inequality in our system. Why are we charging an incredibly high tax rate for those that work more than one job? Especially those that work a succession of small jobs to pay their bills. A suggestion would be to possibly move this idea of secondary tax if they earn in total over a specific threshold or work a certain amount of hours. Yes I choose to own a car, but the exorbitant prices of fuel continue to sky rocket and when you are trying to budget around this, this makes it incredibly difficult. I live in an area where there is no public transport, so that is not an option for me either. Clear and consistent prices across New Zealand, where we can budget accordingly, especially knowing the price of oil as a commodity. Also having one standard motorcycle costs a lot annually, when my husband has an excellent riding record, why can this system not be adapted to meet the individual needs of the rider that is registered and insured. Lowering the cost of ACC levies on motorcycles in a similar why to that of cars. The majority of the time, cars are at fault in motorcycle accident. Why are some so-called charities like churches and trusts that compete in the pri vate sector not paying tax, they openly flaunt their money with possessions rather than putting their money where their mouth is as such. It is coming back to the old adage of the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. This is quite well known in New Zealand, yet the standard middle class person is not even able to purchase property in some cases or feel like they are getting ahead without living in constant debt. The system needs to be overhauled to ensure that we have equity across all businesses and individuals, where they can be treated in a fair and equal way. I see the purpose of tax, but at the same time the distribution of this is not always fair. As someone that lives in the bottom of the South Island, very rarely do we see the amount of taxes we pay going towards our end of the country. This is quite a frustrating point for those that are down here. If you do require, I am happy to get in contact in regards to my points made. Regards, Hayley Mitcheson \[1\] 141 From:Angela Kneeshaw Sent: Friday, 27 April 2018 9:27 PM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Angela Kneeshaw Subject: Deductibility of childcare Hi Summary My submission is that the cost of childcare should be tax deductible for these reasons; 1) Society and organisations benefit from gender diverse work forces 2) Individuals (especially woman) gain significant financial independence when they work 3) Government benefits from having two working parents as the ‘tax take’ is doubled and the output of an economy is higher 4) There are well documented benefits to children being in early childhood education Submission I would like to take this opportunity to comment on one area of the paper around Taxes and Behaviour. Your question is “Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes?” My response is that the tax system should encourage and support woman in the workforce. If childcare was tax deductible it would significantly improve the economic outcomes of woman returning to work after having children and therefore encourage woman to return to work. The Tax Working Group needs to consider the makeup of our work force in 2018 and beyond. We, as a society, are starting to significantly change the way we think about gender equality in the work place. We are now finally recognising that a gender diverse work force in all types of organisations is incredibility positive and productive. This is exciting and inspirational for women of my generation and for women of future generations as we progress to having men and woman able to take up the same employment opportunities on a remuneration basis that is equal. As a background to this, woman and men, still have the basic human desire to start a family and raise the generations of the future. These children are the governments taxpayers of the future. Having two workings parents is positive for; 1) Families - as children grow up seeing their both parents engaged in their work and children reap the financial rewards of a two income household. Studies show significantly improved education outcomes for children in early childhood education. 2) Government – as tax revenue is being generated by two individuals (as opposed to the older model of single earner households) 3) Individuals (especially woman) - who are now able to earn their own money and achieve financial independence from their spouse / partner. Working woman have the ability to financially provide for themselves and create an income stream for themselves which de-risks their financial profile in the event of a relationship dissolution for any reason (and de-risks the governments burden to provide for them). Based on all the above, it is positive for parents, children and government when mothers and fathers work therefore tax policy should encourage this. The question in my mind is why doesn’t the government recognise that there is a cost to this. That cost is childcare. \[1\] 142 Childcare is provided by, in many cases, private organisations who charge for their services. The cost of childcare to a working parent is a cost directly related to going to work. I am a working mum of two delightful boys who are in childcare for some of the week. Childcare is the biggest cost to me in going back to work and luckily my role means my childcare costs are more than covered by my remuneration. Not all mothers are so lucky. For some mothers, the cost of childcare is the majority of their after tax pay. If we believe that woman working is positive for individuals & governments then shouldn’t tax policy support and encourage this? The way to encourage this would be to make the cost of childcare tax deductible. I would be very happy to be contacted about this submission to discuss my points further.

All members of The Tax Working Group. ALL MP’s. MY SUBMISSION: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make a submission in the desire, as you and the members of The Tax working Group recommend, “to help make the New Zealand tax system fairer,” more balanced and equitable for all New Zealanders. \[1\] \[1\] 145 Firstly I would like to say that the Tax System as is currently: is complicated, totally unfair and hampers innovation, expansion and economic progress, also disadvantaging ALL of the people in NZ . There is how ever a very simple system that would significantly increase the total revenue collection in NZ, increase economic development and provide far greater resources in education, health care and benefits to all people. It is very simply 10% All PAYE becomes 10% (Wage and Salary Earners) All net income/profits/returns from all sources including investments, interest, rents, share profits etc. Companies, small business, self employed etc 10% of Net income. All International companies in NZ 10% of Net income after deduction of costs occurred in NZ only. Any moneys leaving NZ shores have to be deemed as Tax Paid (at the 10% as above) All trusts that receive income and non-profit 10% of net income. Lending institutions and Banks would be taxed also at 10% of their all interest earnings from loans but not on the principal repaid. All gst would be abolished. (Which has always been unfair as it is a tax on taxes especially items such as rates and fuel) All ACC payments abolished instead ACC would receive a % of the overall tax take. All other Govt tax revenue would be abolished including taxes of fuel, alcohol tobacco etc. 146 There would be a 10% tax on all imports at the cost paid for those imports in NZD. This would stimulate business and manufacturing in NZ reducing needs for some imports.. (I remember years ago that in NZ there were thriving industries manufacturing all sorts of items including clothing and shoes. They were protected from cheap imports through tariffs, which corrected the imbalance between the cost of manufacture and labour offsetting the lower costs of manufacture and labour of the exporting country. The NZ items were often of a superior quality but a bit more expensive than the cheaper lower quality imports. The stupidity of removing the tariffs destroyed many manufacturing businesses and great loses of jobs and PAYE income. To empathize this aspect I have in the notes placed some Newspaper articles below) My suggestions would encourage manufacturing to operate plants in NZ providing more revenue and many more jobs. There maybe other aspects of income that I am not aware of and some suitable arrangement on local taxes such as rates would need to have some similar type reforms. This would place income earners and beneficiaries in a far better financial situation having more money to spend and a decrease in the cost of living through the removal of gst and fuel taxes etc. The increasing burden of Govt employees salaries such as Teachers, Doctors, Nurses, Police would be wiped as these moves would give them an instant income boost and more discretionary dollars. Companies would have savings from no gst, no acc, reduced accounting costs, savings of fuel costs and a reduction of the price of plant and equipment and locally manufactured products. This would boost the economy allowing money for business to expand create more jobs and in the end result contribute more to the betterment of the country. In the case of small companies such as mine: which is gardening product manufacture and supplier. 147 Our products that we import or source would cost us less. The products that we wholesale for retail would reduce in price making them more affordable to the consumer thus we will turnover more goods. This would need us to employ additional workers which means more people paying the 10% tax. Our weekly salary/wages paid is $1970 a week so the PAYE on this would be $197.00 a week. (2 staff ) Where the current PAYE for the two is $369.04 a week making them better of by $172.04 a week in their hand. With gst gone they have much more spending power which will increase economic development which in turn would increase Govt Revenue. A sudden change to 10% and no gst would likely not be wise so it should be implemented over a two year period. First year half the GST to say 7.5% and remove one year later. Reduce PAYE to 15% or what ever lessor rate some maybe on which would stay the same. A year later to 10% for all. Company Tax reduce to 15% and a year later to 10% If these changes were made there would be a lot of more money in the hands of individuals and I would suggest a new Govt Guaranteed Investment Bonds for a fixed period of 5 years returning 10% PA and paid annually less the 10% tax. This would allow neglected Infrastructure work to be done and repair of hospitals etc. The small interest rates the banks offer is no incentive for savings where a 10% return would put a lot more money back into this vital area. I would further suggest that the Maximum interests rates lending institutions/Bank could charge would also be 10% PA applicable to credit cards/HP/business leases on cars and plant etc. These appear to be radical changes but in actual fact a very simple and logic move. It is a fact: that the more people are taxed the less taxes are collected. Reduce down to 10% and people are going to be happy to pay that amount on their income sources. We also need more controls on how the Govt use the tax dollars as there is too much wastage such as hiring consultants whom often are people that use to work for a Govt department and left to become a highly paid consultant? 148 One Fact remains: There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production. Thank you for allowing this opportunity to submit and below are some notes to clarify my points. TAX HISTORY IN AMERICA PROVES THIS PROPOSAL: There is a distinct pattern throughout American history: When tax rates are reduced, the economy's growth rate improves and living standards increase. Good tax policy has a number of interesting side effects. For instance, history tells us that tax revenues grow and "rich" taxpayers pay more tax when marginal tax rates are slashed. This means lower income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden - a consequence that should lead class-warfare politicians to support lower tax rates. Conversely, periods of higher tax rates are associated with sub par economic performance and stagnant tax revenues. In other words, when politicians attempt to "soak the rich," the rest of us take a bath. Examining the three major United States episodes of tax rate reductions can prove useful lessons. 1) Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue. The tax cuts of the 1920s Tax rates were slashed dramatically during the 1920s, dropping from over 70 percent to less than 25 percent. What happened? Personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, despite the reduction in rates. Revenues rose from $719 million in 1921 to $1164 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent. According to then-Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon: The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people. The Kennedy tax cuts President Hoover dramatically increased tax rates in the 1930s and President Roosevelt compounded the damage by pushing marginal tax rates to more than 90 percent. Recognizing that high tax rates were hindering the economy, President Kennedy proposed across-the-board tax rate reductions that reduced the top tax rate from more than 90 percent down to 70 percent. What happened? Tax revenues climbed from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, an increase of 62 percent (33 percent after adjusting for inflation). According to President John F. Kennedy: Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits... In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high 149 today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now. The Reagan tax cuts Thanks to "bracket creep," the inflation of the 1970s pushed millions of taxpayers into higher tax brackets even though their inflation-adjusted incomes were not rising. To help offset this tax increase and also to improve incentives to work, save, and invest, President Reagan proposed sweeping tax rate reductions during the 1980s. What happened? Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation). According to then-U.S. Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY), one of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts: At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production. 2) The rich pay more when incentives to hide income are reduced. The tax cuts of the 1920s The share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose dramatically as tax rates were reduced. The share of the tax burden borne by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. The Kennedy tax cuts Just as happened in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased following the tax cuts. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent. The Reagan tax cuts The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988. Harmful Spending & Complexity Lower tax rates are important, but they are not the only critical issue. Both the level of government spending and where that money goes are very important. And even when looking only at tax policy, tax rates are just one piece of the puzzle. If certain types of income are subject to multiple layers of tax, as occurs in the current system, that problem cannot be solved by low rates. Similarly, a tax system with needless levels of complexity will impose heavy costs on the productive sector of the economy. This WebMemo is excerpted from the author's, Daniel J. Mitchell's, Backgrounder, The Historical Lessons of Lower Tax Rates, published July 19, 1996. The original publication, found here, contains footnotes and numerous charts. Note of Tariffs. 150 Companies such as Sunbeam here in Palmerston North : NZ Herald 26thMay 2004 .. Sunbeam is shutting its Palmerston North electric blanket factory with the loss of 122 jobs as it seeks to benefit from cheaper manufacturing overheads in China. Sunbeam's general manager of New Zealand manufacturing, Craig Dais, said the firm would now make its electric blankets in China. The staff, including himself, would be out of work by late June and early July, Mr Dais told NZPA today. "Spirits are as high as can be expected," he said. This was just one part of the company as it was making many appliances here in their factory in Palmerston North. All departments closed and all manufacturing relocated overseas. Here is another article extracts on the subject: When asked what the Government could have done to alleviate the company's situation he said “There are only two things that could have been done; one was to use tariffs, the other was tax relief.” (This is in regards to Sunbeam) There has been a pattern of closures in the manufacturing industry since the New Zealand government started pursuing a free trade agenda. Click Clack Ltd, another Palmerston North factory, is also ceasing to manufacture goods, although its head office will still be there. It is estimated that over 30 jobs will be lost. Like Sunbeam, the company has been working hard to relocate workers to other plants, and to other jobs in the Manawatu. While there have been a number of Regional Development projects which are expected to provide some jobs in the Manawatu they will not help ease the impact of 150 job losses. George Larkins from the Manufacturing and Construction Union (Wellington Branch Secretary) who has members in the factory said “The workers are devastated. They aren't in highly paid skilled jobs, they will find it very hard to get work in the Manawatu. The main cause is government policy, which, for example, has allowed the dollar to strengthen beyond what exporters have budgeted for.” When asked what he would like to say to ministers like Jim Sutton who promote a free trade agenda, Larkins said “It is all very well to be looking at the big picture, but come up here and look at the devastation you are causing these workers, and tell them why you think this is acceptable.” As Robert Reid from the Clothing Workers Union said “The closure of the Sunbeam factory is one more example of the closures that have been happening since the Rogernomics period of free trade policies that started in 1984.” There is controversy over the much heralded New Zealand/China Free Trade agreement. The government seeks more access for New Zealand's primary products, essentially farming produce. Rod Donald from the Green Party has criticised Helen Clark directly for not pushing for fair trade and raising the awareness of China's “awful labour and environmental record” when she signed the first document towards the agreement last week. With the majority of clothing and manufacturing goods coming from China, the New Zealand/China Free Trade Agreement effectively makes any industry tariffs completely redundant. Craig Dias from Sunbeam did not believe that the Free Trade Agreement was critical to the closing of the plant. However, as ARENA (Action Research Education Network of Aotearoa) researcher Bill Rosenburg said "All these free trade agreements certainly have a racheting down effect on our economy, preventing us from now or in the future ever supporting a New Zealand manufacturing industry, including textiles and clothing. For the Sunbeam factory it might not have been what closed the factory, but it denied hope of any relief in the future." 151 Political parties like the Alliance Party and Green Party have worked hard to keep tariffs in place, including the placement of a freeze on tariff reductions in the clothing industry from 2000-2005, and to avoid free trade agreements. They propose instead to look to fair trade deals which focus on avoiding exploitation of workers and the environment in all participating countries. However the Labour government seems to have entirely ignored the concerns of the local community and political advocates for caution and restraint. Wally Richards New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Part II of the Act covers a broad range of Civil and Political Rights. As part of the right to life and the security of the person, the Act guarantees everyone: • The right not to be deprived of life except in accordance with fundamental justice (Section 8) • The right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, degrading, or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment (Section 9) • The right not to be subjected to medical or scientific experimentation without consent (Section 10) • The right to refuse to undergo any medical treatment (Section 11) If people let government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take,their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny. Thomas Jefferson Democracy, by its very definition, cannot be imposed by force. Remember Kissinger’s infamous saying in the early seventies: “Who controls food, controls the people, who controls energy controls entire continents, and who controls money controls the world”. \[1\] 152 From:Warren Snow Sent: Friday, 27 April 2018 5:01 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To the Tax Working Group I’m grateful that I live in a democracy and have this opportunity to have my say. Tax should as much as possible directly encourage rapid change towards a sustainable and more equitable society. Business likes certainty and so any imposition on business by way of taxes should ensure no particular business is disadvantaged unduly by allowing for freeloaders or through favouring a sector or business over others. Having said that, taxes should encourage all businesses to internalise environmental and social costs. Why should farmers get a free ride on the environment because they are our dominant exporters? Why should children not be able to swim in the river at the front if my home at 90 Mile Beach because about a dozen farmers are filling it with farm nutrients, and I’m sure run off from chemical fertiliser. Why also should massive retailers be able to push more and more unrepairable short life products on to the market that mostly end up as waste within a matter of months or even weeks or days. And why should we have to ensure vast quantities of packaging that is mostly ending up in landfill or the litter stream – even worse in the marine environment. My suggestions follow: 1. Tax energy sources that create CO2 – this probably comes under the ETS I think but overall I think environmental taxes can be effective. 2. Tax landfill methane emissions (separately to the current landfill levy) at a proportionately higher rate given that they are around 30- times more potent than CO2. These can be measured. Gas captured from landfills is not renewable energy because it’s created as a result of the destruction or renewable and non-renewable resources and only captures a very small proportion of the gas generated by landfills.( I note that landfills are part of the ETS) 3. Require that buildings that are demolished (as hundreds of perfectly usable ones are very year in particularly Auckland) and that are not re-sited or properly deconstructed pay a carbon fee of a certain amount per square metre (to preserve the remaining utility values of the building and the embodied energy that was used to create it). This fee needs to be high enough to make it cheaper to deconstruct or re-site than to demolish. 4. Put a levy on plastic bags – UK and many other countries are doing this 5. Introduce a mandatory product stewardship scheme where all beverages must have a refundable deposit of say 10 cents added to them to encourage recycling. This will take us from less than 40% we are currently recycling to at least 85% - an increase of 750 million containers. It will create more than 2,000 new jobs and massively reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment. And will save ratepayers in NZ between 23 and 40 million dollars ann ually, not to mention massive reductions in landfill disposal costs for councils. 6. Require mandatory product stewardship schemes on tyres, appliances, electronics, clothing beverage containers, building products etc. Producers should be responsible for the whole life cycle of the products they put into the market. This will not only create many thousands of jobs, it will reduce our waste volumes and encourage local retailers, wholesalers etc. to demand reparability, more durability and recyclability of products they import – plus of course less waste. Voluntary schemes don’t work apart from token amounts by those that are involved such as glass, packaging, paint, farm wrap etc. because of freeloading which results in low commitment by participants and poor outcomes. This would apply even to what some people would think are ‘goods’ like solar panels. These need to be \[1\] 153 designed for disassembly in 20 to 25 years at the end of their life. At present they are looking like they will be a huge problem because no-one thought about end of life dismantling and recovery of materials or even re-use in the rush to produce them for the new demand – a typical example of unintended consequences. The same with electric car batteries. 7. Remove GST from food 8. Require retailers to pay a tax on all appliances and electronics they import which can be avoided by offering a full sales and service regimen where customers can have things repaired rather than discarded. Proper product stewardship s per item 6. Might suffice to achieve this. 9. Introduce a capital gains tax on sales of homes apart from the one home the owner lives in. There’s so much discussion on how well one world work, but even if it doesn’t have a huge effect on costs of homes, it might slow down the flicking of homes by speculators and put a tidy sum into the consolidated fund to help run the government. 10. Make sure multinationals like apple Amazon etc. pay their fair share of tax in NZ 11. Bring Farmers into the emissions trading scheme. Farming is destroying habitat, stream and waterways at an alarming rate and sends truckloads of soil down to the sea at each river entrance in bad weather. It’s time they are not rewarded for these externalities of doing business. I support stages but much quicker than over the last few years. I also think we should explore the idea of the state buying some farms that are causing the most damage or are in very sensitive environments. It’s incredible how quickly they can repair and perhaps the cost can be covered by the increase in tourism. At present farmers that are prepared to fence off their streams in Northland are only required to fence off 2 metres. This is almost meaningless – it needs to be at least 5 metres and ideally the queen’s’ chain 12. Require inbound tourists to pay say $20 each to visit NZ and enjoy what we are trying to preserve – perhaps if they are spending more than one week here. More funding for DOC and even the consolidated fund. 13. Remove the tax break on advertising for companies that don’t have an effective CO2 mitigation and waste reduction strategy (if it’s practical to do so) 14. This is not so much a tax issue but let’s stop penalising beneficiaries for earning a little extra money to help them get along. A generation of people now see work as a dirty work you get penalised for – wrong signal! Or increase how much they are allowed to earn -say bring it up to $200. I hope that tax review is also looking at a national dividend or wage which could solve this issue. 15. Apply import levies/tariffs on products that come from countries that do not have fair labour and decent OSH and environmental standards. For example companies can avoid costly environmental, labour and OSH requirements simply by packing up and moving to a low wage low compliance economy. This has gutted our manufacturi ng base and is patently unfair. If these same factories that we get most of our products from where in our towns, we would be aghast, but we turn a blind eye to them when they are in China or Vietnam or Bangladesh. I don’t know how this would be implemented but we need to create fairer more equitable and sustainable world economy somehow. This is also related to item 6. 16. Everyone needs to pay tax but I think those that have inherited large sums or have become very successful financially have multiple advantages over those that have not been so lucky – so I think there should be a way to redistribute some of that wealth through taxes without going too far. Thank for this opportunity. I am happy to respond if there are any clarifications required. Warren Snow \[1\] 154 From:Michael Barnett Sent: Friday, 27 April 2018 4:58 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Preamble I am saddened by the Americanization of New Zealand society over the past thirty years and the widening gap between the wealthy few and the rest of society. We have continually been told that the free market and less government is the only answer to our economic problems. However, there is clear evidence that the market has failed to benefit all but a few and left escalating social issues in its wake. The challenge for the current and future governments is to refute this ideology and stress the important role that government pl ays in providing for sound economic and social development. A Vision for New Zealand My vision for New Zealand in the 21st century is: A society where every member of our society, shall have access to a rich and rewarding life, regardless of gender, race or ethnic origin. A Society that:  Provides economic opportunity for all  Provides for and ensures the physical care and education to enable the young to seize and exploit that opportunity.  Provides for and ensures the welfare and care of it’s elderly citizens  Encourages sustainable economic growth and ensures the fruits of that growth are shared equitably among all its members  Where no one can be allowed to starve or be without shelter.  Recognizes the importance of having a strong and effective State sector.  Has a strong international dimension and contributes to world peace by working cooperatively with all nation-states toward this end. To achieve such a vision, what is needed are leadership and policies, which acknowledge that community values should be cherished and encourage a fairer sharing of the wealth created. Specific Policy Objectives Taxation Policy: When it comes to taxation, in most western economies politicians continue to be influenced by high paid consultants, who advocate taxation models that favour the rich and the powerful. I challenge this conventional wisdom and suggest that the market model economy should be replaced by a new model that generates sufficient tax revenue for governments to provide the services needed that will benefit all in society. In the process the poor should be taxed less and enjoy a higher incomes to help lift \[1\] 155 themselves out of the poverty trap. A tax on capital gains tax is a step in the right direction, but it has some anomalies and doesn’t go far enough. The way I see it, there are two economies out there: the real economy where we produce goods and services that create jobs and prosperity for the masses. Then there is the phony economy of the financial fraternity that manufactures wealth out of nothing and moves investment in and out of the country at whim. It destabilizes our currency and makes life difficult for our exporters. We need policies where the State takes back greater control of money creation and the cross border movement of investment funds. I believe this could take two forms: a tax on all banking transactions (with the possible exception of savings transactions) and a tax on speculative currency movements in and out of New Zealand. I believe a universal tax on land should also be considered, as a source of Government revenue. There is much historical precedent for this. William the Conqueror funded his Kingdom out of land rent and set the basis for taxation during the feudal era. In 1776, Adam Smith argued that in the enterprise economy public revenues and services would best be served by a tax on land. He identified Economic Rent (the difference between the cost of production and the revenue derived from a value adding enterprise) as a source of revenue that would not distort peoples’ incentive to work, save and invest. Forty years later David Ricardo another prominent economist of his day explained how it worked and also pointed out the fact that landowners enjoyed all the economic benefit of capital gain resulting from public investment in infrastructure no effort on their part. I believe the implementation of these forms of taxation could provide a source of significant revenue to fund the bulk of government expenditure including investment in social policy. Ultimately this should generate sufficient income to reduce and even eliminate the need for GST, which in reality is a regressive form of tax that adversely impacts on the poor and the marginalized in society the most. The Debt Problem: All the argument focuses on Government debt, when in reality the real problem is the National debt for which the private sector is by far the main contributor. Over the past 25 years we have witnessed the sale of many of our strategic assets to foreign investors, who then proceed take there profits offshore and offer little in return. I believe there is a strong case for tighter restrictions on the foreign purchase of our productive and non-productive land. Welfare: Welfare is an emotive and difficult issue. The welfare reforms of the first Labour government helped to establish the kind of society where the benefits of economic growth were more equitably distributed. However, subsequent welfare measures have tended to be introduced ad hoc and today we have a mish mash of policy that is inefficient in its delivery and favours some sectors of society at the expense of others. I believe there is a drastic need to review and reform how welfare is delivered in the 21 st century. Answers to this problem may lie in some the ideas of Gareth Morgan and Susan Guthrie. Miscellaneous  It is a travesty that most of our tertiary students come out of their studies burdened with huge debt. There is a need to review how we fund tertiary education and a good starting point would be to eliminate course fees and look at the funding and bonding schemes that existed during the 1950s and 1960s.  Re-introduce the concept of low interest loans (2-3%) for first homebuyers, as was policy in earlier times.  Promote the planting of trees on Crown, Maori and private land and provide incentives for doing so. It is labour intensive and we would be creating a valuable asset for future generations.  Governments can and do make a difference and they can influence how incomes are distributed. There is a need to restore a strong and vital public service sector.  There is a need to seriously address environmental and climate change issues. 156 Michael Barnett \[1\] 157 From: Sent:Friday, 27 April 2018 4:58 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the Tax Working Group Importance: High Good morning, I wish to make the following submission: 1.

Tax should be proportionate and provision needs to be made of social, environmental and cultural credits.  What is the purpose of tax? Provide equality across the board. If you are a company operating and trading in NZ you should pay tax regardless of who and what type of business you are, i.e. the Googles and Amazons need to pay their fair share of tax.  Are we taxing the right things? No. Paying GST on everything is day light robbery. Tax the things that cost our economy both financially and socially. Tax sugar, tax smokes, tax gambling and other negative contributors more. GST should not be charged on everything.  Can tax make housing more affordable? No not in the current environment. NZ must be one of the only countries in the world where you don’t get taxed on your largest asset. Capital gains taxes can subsidise first home buyers and low income earners into homes. Look at examples overseas where housing is not an issue and how their governments subsidise or tax to support their people into homes, i.e. Finland, Australia etc.  What tax issues matter most to you? From a business perspective, provisional tax and GST have always been an issue for me. We pay for past tax current tax and future tax. We should be taxed on what we make during a financial year and that’s it. Running a small business is hard work in NZ. The work we do has massive positive outcomes for the economy in the long run. There are no tax credits for the educational, environmental, social and cultural outcomes that our company achieves and not having a tax provision to recognise this is wrong. Companies who create better opportunities for New Zealanders and who provide better future outcomes should not be taxed as much as companies that do not have a social enterprise focus. GST rebates or some form of social rebates should be introduced to address this and to ensure that companies have a more socially focused lens.

My one small suggestion is that the top tax bracket for income is changed. I think it is utterly ridiculous that somebody on $70,000 per annum is paying tax at the same rate as someone earning say $400,000. I think that people earning that much should be taxed at a much higher rate.

With tribes not paying tax on their businesses like every other New Zealander successive Governments have now swung the pendulum in the opposite direction so there are now racist policies in favour of a minority of New Zealanders against the majority of New Zealanders all behind “Charity’ status. Wrongs needed to be put right but not taxing ALL businesses in New Zealand at the same rate is not righting a wrong it is creating an uneven playing field. The tax not paid by tribes in NZ amounts to millions of dollars. So instead of taxing individuals more I would suggest you look to ensure all those who earn income are taxed at the same rate so we all carry the burden together.

One Thing I urge the taxation working group to remember one thing above all, it is people's hard earned money you are planning on taking by force. (Unless you are going to recommend a voluntary tax - which would be great). The money was, most often, earned by someone trading their time (skills and energy) to earn it. So it represents a part of their life - the most limited of resources. The power exercised in the collection of tax is one no one else in society wields. It is akin to slavery - taking a part of someone's life against their will! would you be happy owning a slave, and benefiting from the work? You are taking pieces of peoples lives through the threat of violence. Only do so with the greatest of care! Your job is not to think about what great good you imagine could be done with the money, but where you are taking it from, and how. I submit a reduction and simplification in all forms of taxation can be your only moral recommendation.

It is simple, easily collected, difficult to evade and administratively cheap to operate. Rick Robinson Ex-IRD Tax Inspector \*\*\*There is no statistically significant relationship between the decrease in top marginal tax rates and the rate of productivity growth in the Anglo-Saxon countries since 1980. The rate of per capita GDP growth has been almost exactly the same in all the rich countries since 1980. UK and US have not grown any more rapidly than Germany, France, Japan, Denmark and Sweden who did not reduce their top marginal tax rates and the rise of top incomes do not seem to have stimulated productivity. The idea that all US executives would immediately flee and no one with the competence or motivation to run the economy would remain is not only contradicted by historical experience and by all the firm-level data at our disposal, it is also devoid of common sense. Capital Thomas Piketty p 512-513 167 # New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 were 24.1 percent higher than 1990 levels. Gross greenhouse gas emissions from human activity for the year were 80.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, compared with 64.6 million tonnes in 1990. New Zealand's gross emissions per person were the seventh highest among the 41 industrialised countries.Gross emissions includes carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxide and fluorinated gases from agriculture, energy - including transport and electricity production, waste, and industrial processes - and product use such as refrigeration and air conditioning and carbon dioxide emissions from mineral, chemical and metals production. It also includes land use change and forestry, which can remove emissions because vegetati on acts as a carbon sink. Agriculture and energy produced approximately 47.9 percent and 40.5 percent of the pollution respectively in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, agricultural emissions increased 16 percent largely due to an 88.5 percent increase in the national dairy herd size, and a five-fold increase in the application of fertiliser, which contained nitrogen. Emissions from the energy sector increased 36.7 percent as a result of increased road use and manufacturing using fossil fuels . NZ 7th-worst on emissions of 41 nations 12:0126.5.17 A Cli mate Change Commission is to be tasked with coming up with recommendations for how to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Net Zero in New Zealand report by Vivid Economics sets out the policy track required to actually arrive there by 2050 - it is pretty eye-watering. By 2050: Coal electricity generation: Zero; Gas generation: Down 73%; Hydro: up 21%; Geothermal: up 161%; Solar: Up 21,000%, Dairy livestock: Down 20%; Diary livestock productivity: up 25%; Dairy emissions inhibited by new vaccines: Down 30%; Dairy emissions inhibited by selective breeding: Down 15%. (Similar numbers for beef and sheep) Farmland: Down from 12.4m hectares to 10.6m, while Forestry rises from 1.7m hectares to 2.9m and some livestock farming is replaced with Horticulture. Plus vehicle and train electrification. “\[This track\] is heavily reliant on a series of technological advances which, if they fail to materialise, would make this scenario unattainable So another track was suggested. This required a shed-load more farmland to be converted to forests (as well as renewables targets, livestock productivity growth and electrification). There’s a catch:“The substantial change in land-use patterns implies significant social and environmental challenges. Socially, it would imply profound changes to rural livelihoods and New Zealand’s rural economy.” That, in a nutshell, is A big challenge.

My submission refers to the Fringe Benefit Tax. As a large employer, Capital and Coast DHB is trying to reduce its environmental footprint. One of the largest contributor to CCDHB environmental (and carbon) footprint is the use of private motor vehicles for our staff to come to work. My job is to promote and incentivise sustainable transport options for our staff. While we have made advances by providing adequate bicycle parking facilities, showers and changing rooms. We have reached a stage where more sophisticated incentives must be brought it. One of them is the provision of subsidies (part of all) for our staff to take public transport, have access to more environmentally friendly modes such as bicycles or electric bicycles or be rewarded with shoe vouchers if they walk. Unfortunately, the FTB sees car parking an exempted from the FTB. This acts as an incentive for staff to drive to work. All the measures named above, to support a transition to carbon neutrality in our travel patterns require CCDHB to pay FBT. This is a perverse incentive, as it is q uoted as the #1 excuse to do nothing by employers large and small. It would be ideal if the FTB is not payable in employer subsidy schemes that support a transition to carbon neutrality. This should move beyond transport into other areas where employers can lead the way to a carbon neutral future. Many thanks for your time.

One of our big problems is social inequalities Sent from Mail for Windows 10 Submission; Preamble; I found your web page very informative, and well presented! Thank you! I think there is a need for our tax system to get back to influencing societal, environmental, and personal issues. One of our big problems is social inequalities- eg. Many children below the poverty line whilst others are greedy as pigs at a trough with luxury yachts and holiday homes in Hawaii. Tax could provide more incentives and disincentives to provide favourable outcomes for society, individuals, and the environment. Although some of these taxes might be difficult and expensive to implement, the social flow on effects could be large. For example; if a suitably large tax is put on sugar, and possibly other unhealthy foods, the reduction in obesity and diabetes would provide great savings in health. Environmental concerns and global warming are also very important.( As president Marcozy said ”There is no planet B”.) I think the emphasis needs to be shifted to fencing off the top of the cliff, rather than providing more ambulances at the bottom! (As the previous governments have been doing.) We need the government to take firm action, firmer than they have done so far, and the task force could make strong recommendations, allowing that the government may well water down the recommendations. I am strongly in favour of a Tobin tax. Thank you for asking my opinion! Best wishes for the task ahead.

As I am sure you are aware, many small businesses fail within the first one to two years of trading, mostly due to being under funded. Trying to get started on a tight budget can be extremely difficult. A new business even with the best ideas, takes time to grow and to develop into one making a profit which will support itself, and to provide an income for the owner. The larger established business, can factor in the cost of GST much more so than a smaller one who is making little profit.

Homelessness is vanishing. The Finns do complain about their taxation system - with a wicked, wry smile. They know that their system is sound and sensible in the long-term.

Your group probably have a brief to look at what is moral and fair . As lovely and utopian as that sounds , taxation is not about morality and even "fairness" is subjective and the more your group will try to achieve that, the more anomalies and unintended consequences you will achieve and you have been given a directive to widen the net and complicate the system. The best tax system is simple, clear and identifies what is "profit" and what is not. Below is an example of an unintended consequence of capital gains tax that will stifle growth and transfer of capital. The Tax Working Group should understand the difference between Gross and Net profit or realised gain and unrealised gain. Capital gain from realised profit should be taxable however capital transferred in "like for like" is not profit realised as the "gain" has not been unlocked. Taxing transferred productive capital as "profit " will have the compounding effect of taxing the gross profit and not the net profit. This is the consequence of treating all capital sales as profit or gain. This will negatively affect many small business owners in NZ. To understand this and illustrate the difference, an analogy is how GST is treated. GST is not a compounded cumulative tax, it is a net tax of the realised or actual value added. A business owner pays GST on the value added to the end product that they have produced but he or she claims back the value added or cost that has been transferred to them by other businesses in the supply of their goods and services. Those other businesses have already paid GST for their value added. If the values were simply added or compounded instead of offset to obtain a net value added, the end price of goods and services would double or triple. The same effect will happen with capital gains tax if the transfer of capital is restricted by a compounding penalty treating all sales as gross profit instead of net profit ( or loss ) Effectively this would be a bright line test for commercial property as with selling a family home, usually the capital is transferred into another family home. The best way to look at the difference between realised and unrealised profit is with a practical example. \[1\] \[1\] 173 Owner A runs an engineering business from Property A which he owns. Owner A wants to expand his business and needs to purchase a bigger property and wants to buy Property B from Owner B. Owner A purchased his property in 2008 for $500K. It is now worth $1m. Owner B also purchased his property in 2008 but for $1m. It is now worth $2m. Let's say that capital gains tax is set at 25% on "profit" Tax on property A is on the gain or profit of $500K which is $125K liability. Tax on property B is the gain or profit of $1m which is $250K liability. The total taxable gain or "profit" on this transaction is $375K payable to the Gummint. But this total is a gross profit and does not take into account realised profit or gain. Owner A of property A has transferred his capital and re-invested it in "like for like ". He has not realised any capital gain or profit. Owner B of Property B has decided to retire and bank his profit and spent it as he wishes on travel or whatever suits his choice. His profit has been gained , realised and spent ! So the Government has demanded a gross tax on the transaction of $375 K being taxable even though there is only a net gain of $250K. The Government has therefore taxed the transfer of productive capital that has not been realised and has applied a compounded or gross tax. In this raw state, the Government is taxing both parties based on "profit" yet owner A is not only paying for the increased capital value of property B which has had capital gains tax paid on it but to transfer the capital from his property , he is then paying a compounded tax on Property A which has not yet been realised as profit. The result of this will be to stifle growth in your small to medium business sector and increase their costs which will of course end up being passed on in their product or service. Therefore this type of transaction needs it's own "bright line" test .

First of all, do something about the house rental market. That should NOT be tax deductible! It is beyond crazy! Poor people get government help to pay for the rent, and that goes to the rental home owner. And the rental home owner gets rich. And then the rental home owner can sell the house with a profit, and pays no tax on the profit! Am I the only one who can see that all that government- help to pay for the house of the poor goes straight to the rich rental owner??????? And if you are too scared to fix that, because you think that the house market will crash, well, then make the interest on the mortgage for the home-owner-occupier tax deductible, with a maximum of a $ 500 k mortgage. You will see that that will keep the house prices for that segment of the market high. Of course, a lot more houses should be built and/or bought by Housing New Zealand, or some other entity. But that cannot be a for- profit- entity. And if the house market for the ‘filthy rich’ crashes, well so be it. We should not have filthy rich in New Zealand; keep in mind that there can only be filthy rich people, if there are many very poor people. The big filthy rich people’s houses can then be bought by Housing New Zealand, and make them into apartments. Then we fix 2 problems in one go. Here are a few other ideas: Firstly a Financial Transactions Tax (set at around .01%) which taxes all money going through our banks. This won’t be noticed by any of us day to day but will bring in large sums of money from corporate billionaires and speculators who move billions in and out of New Zealand every day. This tax would replace GST – a vicious tax on low incomes. Secondly, a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax which would tax the unearned income of the wealthy and the super- wealthy. Wage and salary earners can’t avoid tax. We are taxed on every dollar we earn and every dollar we spend. Why not the billionaires? Thirdly, we need a much higher top tax rate – currently we have one of the lowest in the world. Why should corporate CEOs pay just 33% on their vastly inflated salaries in tax when much more is demanded in other countries? (Eg Denmark 55.8%; Australia 49%; USA 46.3%; France 54%; UK 45%) By the way, I do have a roof over my head, and yes, it’s our own. And no, it’s not fancy. And no, I don’t own any rentals, because I have never wanted to get rich of the misery of someone else. And keep in mind that a government should NEVER treat a country as a business, but should treat it as a family. The government is the head of the family, see yourself as the father or mother of the family. Would you, as responsible father of the family let your children sleep in a car because they have a low paid, but honest job? Would you let your grandmother live in the leaky drafty old shed in the back of your garden because she wasn’t financially savvy in her younger years? Would you be proud of the well-dressed son that stole the half of the food of the kids that now sleep in the car and of the grandma in the shed? Would you give that well-dressed son privileges? If you would answer these questions with : ‘YES’, well then I feel sorry for you. Good luck with your tax reform, I hope you can see what a marvelous task you have, and what opportunities you have to make New Zealand Fair Again. \[1\] 176 Kind regards, Marianne Boekhoff \[1\] 177 From:Susan Hutchinson Sent: Friday, 27 April 2018 9:43 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Reallocate the hypothecated ACC funds, tax on net wealth and property investment taxes ACC levies are a hypthecated tax which urgently needs redistribution. Very little of our money invested by ACC is currently spent in this country, and yet our District Health Boards suffer under mountains of debt, and we have very poor fundamental infrastructure such as warm, dry and affordable housing. We are a developed country of less than five million people. There is absolutely no excuse for the level of third world disease, poverty and homelessness we see in this country. I challenge the Tax Working Group to boldly reallocate our ACC investments where the money will do the most good, such as :  investment in essential infrastructure such hospitals, so that staff have safe and healthy buildings to work in and DHBs can pay fair wages and retain staff.  buying land and expanding the KiwiBuild programme in areas that are NOT underneath motorways like Unitec. Other taxes Land and property investment tax I support any tax measure that makes extensive investment in buy to rent real estate undesirable. If a home is not owner occupied, a land tax should be charged and revenue from rents should be taxed at a higher rate also. This "mum and dad" investment model of purchasing properties for rental urgently needs limitations. My hope would be that any taxation levers the government can deploy, will serve to dis-incentivise this type of investment in the future, cool the housing market and free up more stock for people who wish buy homes and settle within communities. This could be an administrative nightmare, but perhaps the tax rate rises after the third investment property is purchased. Rates records held by local authorities would reveal ownership details, and landlords could be required to nominate their first and second properties, for lower rates of taxation, and any subsequent properties would be subject to the higher tax rates. Net wealth tax Perhaps people with a massive net wealth (including from investment properties) are no longer eligible for superannuation? Means testing might reduce the ballooning burden of welfare payments to the elderly. Some people clearly need help more than others.

My idea is to make saving more affordable to low income families without a whole lot of extra litigation specific to any case by case basis currently run through Working for Families, Domestic Purposes Benefits or numerous other systems currently available to support people with low or no income. I raise the idea that current lowest income tax bracket of 17.5% be removed and the revenue be instead be sought from GST by significantly raising it to somewhere around 28% (more or less, this figure is an estimate). Higher tax brackets would remain at current levels. In my view this would allow low income families and individuals not to be taxed on money they save and offset the government tax income to wealthier individuals, tourists and black market enterprise. I think that the existing GST systems and how they apply to business works just fine. These changes could be applied, with some adjustment to calculations, for claiming and paying GST in the future. I understand the thought sounds radical and would need to be calculated out fully to gain more clarity to be implemented successfully. Thank you for your time. Richard Bruce Summers \[1\] \[1\] 181 From: Sent:Thursday, 26 April 2018 9:51 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission My name is Robert Dawson of Auckland. I am a superannuant relying on superannuation payments plus dividends and interest on a modest portfolio of investments. In the present low interest environment, I struggle to make ends meet. I support the general thrust of the submission made by the NZ Taxpayer's Union. Additionally, I make the following two points: 1. As a matter of general principle, every citizen should feel that they are contributing to the broad task of meeting the cost of public services, at a level relative to their individual means. That their contributions are being used efficiently, and that they receive in return reasonable communication to enable them to make objective judgements as to amount of tax they have paid, and to the aforementioned spending efficiency. Unfortunately, the task of government achieving cost effective collection of tax, has meant the tendencies over many years, have been to automate and render taxes as "invisible" as possible. e.g. income tax moved from end of year physical payment to the PAYE system. Cost effectiveness may well determine the need to collect tax in a particular manner. I am simply making the point that cost effectiveness can often be at a cost to the sort of basic principle I have alluded to above. One might say that the government accountants have "won" but the taxpayer has been "dumbed down", In studying the various options of taxation, I ask your committee to keep the above principle in clear view. 2. I ask you to examine the widest range of current modes of taxation, including those of local government. Over recent years there has been a trend toward dividing government services into ones of "public" good, and ones of "private" benefit. The latter costs are often recouped through varying devices under the general head of "User Charges". It is no secret that local government over recent decades, have increasingly felt "squeezed" between the provision of services they feel the public demand, on one hand, and the upper limits they feel able to secure monies from land rates, on the other hand. They have adopted user charges with enthusiasm! I have no difficulty with the principle of government providing services with a clear private benefit and requiring those beneficiaries to pay the fair cost of same through direct, user fees. The idea is worthy, but the application has had a very chequered record. It is clear to anyone of experience in the various areas of local government, that the level if charges often levied bear little relationship to the reasonable complexity and value of the service provided, but are more related to the perceived need of the particular government department budgets! To give examples in just two areas. Firstly Development levies: clearly as land is subdivided & population increases it is reasonable that the full costs to councils of providing necessary services beyond the immediately obvious, are met to reasonable degree at the point of either subdivision or the building of a new house, hence the comparatively new device of Development Levies. Just one experience to this submitter's knowledge...a local farmer had his residence condemned due to land subsidence. He rebuilt a new house in a better locality on the same property and was levied several thousand dollars in supposed "Development Levies", despite the abundantly obvious reality that there was no additional need for any further council services, I.e. a clear "tax grab". Your committee, if you choose to look, will find much broader and expert- based comment on the (im)proper use of such levies. Secondly, relating to "licensing" or other required "fees to operate": a member of my family sought to open a stall in a local farmers market...for about 4 hours each Sunday. The market operator required him, rea sonably, to obtain "approval" from the local council to sell the particular chilled food item. The following six months became a charade which might be funny if wasn't so serious to the one affected! The council staff seemed to have no established "registration" or "user" fee in mind. Their first statement was that he would be required to post an "initial" payment of one thousand dollars! After a protracted period of \[1\] 182 "discussion" a fee of only $600 was settled upon. There followed no inspection of the intended facility nor of the intended product. It seems obvious that once the user had paid the required fee, the authority in question was satisfied! I put it to your committee, that many local government revenue avenues, touted as (reasonable) fees levied to cover private benefit services, have tended to become covert levies of taxes, either unrelated to the level or quality of the particular service, or simply a blatant..."pay us what we want, or if not, forget about receiving our statutory approvals or licences". In part at least they are clearly a form of taxation which needs some reasonable effort on the part of your Committee to quantify.

I'm of the view that major reform involving corporate tax needs to occur, and while this too might be a bit wide of your scope (as I understand from your briefing paper that some "other work" is happening around corporate tax evasion) I nonetheless hope you will not shy away from meaningful recommendations. Corporate tax evasion or avoidance is the single greatest issue we need to tackle in terms of a tax overhaul. Furthermore, we need to get serious about a financial transactions tax. There has been significant research on the substantial social benefits of such a tax, and it is long overdue. Having lived most of my life in the US, a capital gains tax is a no-brainer. The spe culation in property in NZ over the past 10 years is nothing short of criminal. Aside from a family home, housing should be seriously disincentivised as an investment. But at the same time, deferred tax on retirement savings e.g. 401(k) plans are also widespread in the US and deserve serious consideration. I am strongly in favour of removing GST on all food. Then introduce a sugar tax or incorporate other taxes for luxury foodstuffs. GST on food is punitive and regressive. I also strongly believe that taxation on rates is double-taxation. It is a double-standard to say that central government is government but local government is services. We don't have a choice about either one. Finally, I am strongly opposed to any tax spending on the military, the NZSIS, or the GCSB. I believe that these are not appropriate government undertakings and should not be funded by taxpayer dollars. I wish you well with your work. Ngā mihi, Valerie Morse \[1\] 184 From:Chris Ward Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 8:49 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Tax working Group Members. I have an idea to submit that might seem quite radical but when all things are considered I believe you may find very interesting. The concept is to introduce a “RESERVE BANK LEVY”. Its not really a tax but a very effective tool to moderate “free markets” without reverting to Marxism or direct Government control It would also collect revenue much more easily and cost effectively than Capital Gains Tax which is virtually proven to be ineffective as well as costly. Its basically an extension of what we have now in terms of the role of the Reserve bank. Please read the following and consider it carefully. RESERVE BANK LEVY The concept is to extend the powers of the reserve bank beyond setting interest rates to control inflation. It is way better than the old-school macro tools from the past such as LVR’s that people invent all sorts of work-arounds for. There is clearly a need to contain pricing “bubbles” within the economy. Bubbles are destructive economically, socially, personally and even politically, creating senseless and destructive swings and distractions. God knows how many lives are lost due to the personal tragedy caused by loss of home and income and bankruptcy. The Reserve bank contract could be extended to include the requirement to moderate critical markets within the overall economy. The RB would have to be given the tools and the resources to do it, of course. First and foremost is the housing market and I say this because it is an unstable, and in particular (an over-valued) housing market contributes greatly to wealth and social inequality, adds greatly and unnecessarily to the country’s debt, diverts investment from productive real-wealth generating investment, causes severe grief to those who cannot afford a home and untold grief to those who lose theirs when there comes the inevitable crash..... etc. At the end of the day, shelter is a basic human essential and it is cruel and inhumane, in fact, for society to allow people to manipulate people’s need for shelter for speculative gain. It would be foolish to think that everything would be fixed if the housing market was satisfactorily contained because other bubbles, particularly the share market would without doubt burst out with increased vigor. But the housing market would be a great place to start. THE HOUSING MARKET This one is a real beaut. The idea is to apply the levy to local body rates: 1. Almost no cost in doing so. The valuation and collection mechanisms are already in place. 2. I hear gnashing of teeth, howls of derision and angst. That is music to my ears because it is a sure sign the idea would work. Just the mere threat would have a dramatic effect on the housing market. 3. But there are some really smart features to the idea that make it particularly effective and incisive 4. It could be applied at different rates to moderate markets in different jurisdictions according to the issues within each jurisdiction, so the problems in Auckland would not adversely affect the residents of the West Coast 5. It would discourage land banking 6. Overseas buyers would bail out 7. It would encourage local bodies to contain their rates and be more efficient. In fact there would have to be rules about how local bodies gained their revenue to avoid paying the levy. And maybe even a levy on other forms of council income 8. Councils would become hell-bent on doing what they could to contain house prices (and hence reduce the levy applying in their jurisdiction) by encouraging development and investment in housing (whether upward or outward) 9. People would be encouraged to move away from more highly levied jurisdictions thus taking pressure off those markets (and transport etc in Auckland) 10. There would be a natural de facto provincial development effect as levies collected from the provinces would generally be low er than the large metropolitan regions 11. Return on investment for farmers would improve as lower land values would reduce the investment required to operate the farm. The investment in land would reduce in relation to the value of their other farm investment. This would free- up and encourage investment in production rather than land. 12. Wealth hoarders with little other income would be encouraged to sell their mansions and invest in productive enterprise. Yes, this would particularly affect the elderly but only those whose biggest worry is counting their shekels. This would encourage better utilization of the housing stock. 13. The country would acquire a lot less debt and, in particular, pay a lot less interest to overseas money lenders. OTHER MARKETS A levy could easily be applied to share and other financial trading where prices can greatly exceed real asset backing in the form of a transfer fee. Dead easy. No excuses. banks do this all the time. There would no doubt be other effects and considerations but overall, if the country has the will (political, social, economic, and even environmental) to make real improvements in so many ways an d become wealthier, fairer and happier in real terms I urge serious consideration of the above. OTHER ISSUES \[1\] 185 Outlaw crypto currencies they will destroy taxation bases and destroy lives. They are simply a perversion of the block chain technology that surely has better, more valid uses. Reduce reliance on across-boarder taxation or introduce transfer tax on all “non-financial services” overseas transactions (instead of GST which is easily avoided and expensive to collect). Trading over the internet is going to force changes. Of course forming mutual arrangements with overseas jurisdictions is vital also.

It is important to retain a simple tax system. The more convoluted the tax system the more expensive to administer, for both government and businesses, and the additional costs may outweigh any increase in revenues, or at best reduce the net revenue stream. 2. If at all possible retain what is in place with slight amendments to increase tax revenues. 3. A possible increase in the tax bands at the higher end to tax higher earners. E.g. A 40% band for those earning over $100k per year. 4. A tax on residential property purchases over a certain amount E.g. 1% on property purchases over $1m 1.5% over $1.5m etc. the number of bands would depend on the projected revenues. But typically if an individual or company can afford a $20m property they can afford to pay some tax on the purchase. make the selling agent responsible to collect the tax and remit to government. The land registry will know what a property sold for. Some exceptions E.g. Auckland may need special consideration. 5. Tax incentives for companies to decentralise from cities such as Auckland create enterprise zones with rate free periods. This will have the impact of relieving the strain on the housing market in the major cities and spread jobs elsewhere. The government could lead the way with their own departments and offices. 6. Maintain motorway tolls to help raise revenues. Do not eliminate them once the road costs have been recovered. 7. Ensure online and internet companies pay their share of NZ taxes on revenues generated in NZ. The above are just my own thoughts on several topics. I am not an economist and the impact of the above would need to be reviewed and I am sure wiser heads than mine will come up with better ideas. Kind Regards \[1\] 187 Barry Newton \[1\] 188 From:Amelia Smith Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 7:03 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: TWG submission Hello, I would like to submit the following comments: New Zealander's get great value-for-money from their tax - they just often don't realise it because the benefits are taken for granted. Tax can be used to collect revenue for essential services, more fairly distribute wealth and also to encourage/discourage certain behaviours (e.g. smoking, GHG emissions). I endorse the use of tax for these purposes and any others that solve market failures or increase the public good. NZ needs taxes on wealth. Currently wealthy people have many tax advantages to increase their wealth - that is, once you are a bit wealthy, it is easier to get wealthier. This isn't fair as often it depends on what situation you were born into. Perhaps phase in an inheritance and gift tax. I received a significant gift from my parents to help with a house deposit which has put me in an excellent position and helped me become even wealthier. While I would have grumbled about a gift tax, I would have been happy to know it was going to fund our under-funded health services or other important services. A capital gains tax is essential. My views on this are represented in this excellent piece of writing the PSA curated - https://www.psa.org.nz/assets/Campaigns/stand-together/Tax-booklet/Tax-book-2017-LOW-RES.pdf I also think that Gareth Morgan's tax policy in the last election is worth looking into. While I don't like the man, his ideas around tax seem sound. What makes me feel less like I get value from my taxes is when agencies like the NZTE give away money to big corporates without any real sense of what the collective will get out of it. For example, the government giving $500k to Bungy (https://www.stuff.co.nz/southland- times/business/79957103/Queenstown-bungy-to-get-innovations-with-500-000-government-funding). The link between this and collective good for NZ is tenuous - even if it did attract more people to NZ, haven't we got enough people coming?! Let's be happy with the tourism industry we have and diversify a bit! I'm also confident that they would have done this anyway - they have not hestiated to expand and invest in new things in the past. Contrast this with money given to businesses to help reduce their GHG emissions. In this instance there are clear behavioural barriers and the reduction of GHG emissions is of benefit to all NZers.

So this leads me to believe that there should be a tax relief on the premiums I pay for this insurance. Yours Sincerely Sam Esler \[1\] 190 From:Dean Dodds Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 4:30 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I am happy to be contacted in relation to this submission Background Much of the current social welfare system is predicated on the “total family unit”. Superannuation has a different rate based on single and joint living as does working for families considering joint income as does the domestic purposes benefit. However Family Income is always taxed Individually and Income Splitting is not allowed in the interests of fairness surely this must be changed. Example A family with 2 people earning $50,000 per annum pay $8020 each so $16,040 combined A family with 1 person earning $100,000 per annum pay’s $23,920 This difference is $7880.00 per annum a substantial amount yet both families have the same house hold income as would be adjudged in working for families but not for income tax purposes, this does not seem consistent. Conclusion Income splitting within a family is in my mind in need of an urgent introduction in the interests of taxation fairness. Regards Dean Dodds \[1\] 191 From:Wayne Baker Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 4:16 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission - Wayne Baker Our tax is completely unfair. The people who pay the most tax are the poorest and those who pay the least are the most wealthy. There are loops holes coming out of our ears that only the wealthy know how to exploit or can afford the right accountant who can exploit them on their behalf. I propose the following: Remove all GST and consumption based taxes (fuel taxes, tabacco taxes, alcohol taxes) - All of this disproportionally affects the poor and working class people making life even more awful for them than it already is. Especially remove GST from fruit, veges & meat. Close all tax loop holes - No one should be able to pay less tax than poor people because they can funnel money through trusts, business or assets. All income to be taxed - No matter where your income comes from, it should be taxed on exactly the same sliding scale as anyone working for wages/salary. Capital gains, shares, interest, assets, property, trusts etc. Increase Luxury taxes - Excessive wealth calls for excess purchases. These should be taxed to at least 50%. Change the tax rates: $0 - $40k - No tax $40k - $60k - 17.5% $60k - $80k - 25% $80k - $100k - 29% $100k - $150k - 33% $150k - $200k - 67% $200k + - $91% Corporate Taxes - It is disgusting that billion dollar multinational corporations can get away with paying no taxes in NZ. Again, excessive wealth calls for large taxes. Corporations should be paying at least 50% tax on the income they earn from NZ. We need to radically redistribute the wealth of this country so that everyone has a home, healthy food, education and opportunities to work for a dignified income of at least $25 p/h + . People who are celebrated by the capitalist media in the annual rich list should not be paying the tax of someone on $70k as reported by the same media outlets. \[1\] 192 Neoliberal capitalism has got to go. Time for the government to put it's money where it's mouth is, get some guts and tax the rich.

My mother was addicted to alcohol for almost 30 years and died prematurely from the health impacts of alcohol. Alcohol affected our whole family in lifelong ways, and this despite me and my siblings attending Alcohol and Drug service programmes for the families of alcoholics and accessing counselling and other support services. My mother is one statistic, but behind her are 6 others (our family) who are ‘not counted’ in terms of the measurable impact of alcohol related harm. I cannot describe the pain and suffering alcohol inflicted on our family. And this is going on behind the four walls of thousands of New Zealand homes. If we are a humane society, we need to do a lot more to reduce the agony and the impact alcohol has on both the drinker and all those closely associated. I urge the Tax Working Group to substantially increase the excise tax on alcohol (by at least 50%), and to commit to regular increases that will keep the affordability of alcohol as low as possible. We know that keeping the price high results in youth and heavier drinkers buying less, meaning we have reduced harm amongst those that are most at risk. Thank you for considering my submission. I do not wish to make an oral submission.

As such, I submit the following: 1. That any changes recommended by the Tax Working Group do not change the total tax take as a percentage of GDP; and 2. That total government taxation revenue, across all sources, should not exceed 32% of GDP; and 3. That no government may make changes that result in an increase in total goverment tax revenue higher than 2% of GDP in any single electoral period without a single-purpose referendum mandating such an increase; and 4. That company tax remain a single flat rate; and 5. That the main company tax rate of 28% be reduced; and 6. That New Zealand's tax system remain largely broad-base; and 7. That no additional exemptions are applied to the current GST system; and 8. That the GST system remains a single flat rate across all goods and services; and 9. That a 0% bottom threshold be added to the current range of personal income tax bands; and 10. That personal income tax bands are defined in terms of standard deviations from the median annual income, rather than the current fixed dollar amounts; and 11. That no additional taxes are applied to capital gains; and 12. If additional taxes are applied to capital gains, that such taxes are applied to realised gains only, and corresponding capital losses are tax-deductable; and 13. That capital expenses may be fully expensed immediately, rather than being depreciated over a longer period; and 14. That where possible, any and all loopholes in the tax system should be eliminated to simplify administration overhead; and 15. Where loopholes exist to provide for a legitimate social good, this be implemented as a direct subsidy or personal / business income tax credit, rather than as a tax exemption or special rate; and 16. That any tax on interest, dividends, capital gains, or similar long term income is calculated on the inflation-adjusted amount; and 17. That any environmental taxes should be revenue-neutral; and 18. That the proceeds of any environmental taxes are applied as direct subsidies or tax credits to improve the environmental situation that the tax is intended to improve; and 19. That already- taxed wealth, savings, capital holdings (except land), etc. not be subjected to additional taxation; and 20. That a tiered land-tax be introduced, indexed against the owner's income, with a bottom rate of 0% to protect owners with poor cashflow or fixed income; and 21. That the tax system \*not\* be used to encourage lifestyle changes (e.g. sugar, smoking, alcohol etc); and 22. That any changes recommended are for evidence-based reasons, rather than emotional reasons; and 23. That any tax changes should have broad cross-partisan support to ensure the continued stability and predictability of New Zealand's taxation system. \[1\] 2 Beyond the points made above, I also endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Tax payers’ Union.

Yours sincerely, Steven Gilberd -- \[1\] 3 From:Alistair Gates Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:55 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, My suggestion to you is the more you tax landlords the harder it will be to provide adequate housing for those that rent as landlords leave the market. It is well known that rented accommodation usually holds more persons per house than those that are owner occupied. By making owning a house as an investment less desirebale then less will be made available for renters which are those that don’t wish to own a house. There are other ways to help first home buyers by bigger grants or by allowing the building costs of new builds by reducing GST for building supplies and services and by reducing or subsidising council fees. Also by introducing capital gains tax which has been done anyhow by the extension of the bright line test to 5 years you also take houses out of circulation to cover costs. Additionally taking away the ability to accrue losses will only Ensure further costs being included to tenants by landlords. In fact if you made investment housing have less tax with more incentives to landlords then you may encourage more houses to be built especially if you allow foreigners and their capital to buy them. What a fanciful idea eh? Best regards Alistair Gates \[1\] \[1\] 4 From:David Bridewell Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:46 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on Capital Gains Taxes to the Tax Working Group, April 2018 Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, In the course of the discussions over Capital gains taxes over the last few years in New Zealand, I have noticed a tremendous amount of confusion around the issues of capital gains, capital incomes and the taxation thereof and what the purpose of a capital gains tax should be. This is even before the well canvassed issues of the complexity of CGT and the costs of collecting these which have been detailed in previous taxation reviews is brought into the debate. One issue I have noticed is the language creep around classifying capital gains in recent times as income, and that the lack of a CGT in New Zealand on this income is unfair to those who pay income tax e.g., salary and wage earners. Of course this is factually incorrect as New Zealand does have Capital Gains Taxes, moreover as these are taxed at the marginal rate of the individual tax payer, our CGT are levelled at some of the highest rates in the world. But this is seldom acknowledge in discussions on CGT in New Zealand. As I understand it, hundreds of millions of dollars of CGT has already been collected from property investors in New Zealand over the last several years. But this has clearly had little to no effect on moderating house price inflation within New Zealand, which is consistent with findings of other countries where CGT have also failed to reduce house price inflation there. This then begs the question that if a compressive CGT is to be brought in in New Zealand to modify house price inflation, why would you do that when the evidence shows i t doesn’t work. Successful public and taxation policy must be evidence based, otherwise it is just an unproductive exercise in virtue-signalling politics that is doomed to failure. To my mind when did a capital gain suddenly become an income, and who, with accepted authority, says it is? In addition I have read articles, chiefly but not exclusively in the media, on CGT where terms contradict each other, where sentences make no sense, where claims about the nature of capital gains, the purpose of investmen t, returns, taxation and so on say one thing in one part of the article and then something completely different in another part. Or different authors come to completely different conclusions about exactly the same thing. To me this just highlights the tremendous conflicts, confusions, misunderstandings, bias and the lack of hard data that is out there on capital gains and their taxation treatment. Add to that the political persuasion of each author, the left right divide and the whole thing is just a complete and utter mess. The future potential for serious unintended consequences and CGT taxation policy failure I think is very high based on the current standard of the debate here in New Zealand and the confusion and conflicts that are inherent in it. If as a nation we can’t even agree on what we mean when we use x, y or z term, then how are we going to make social and economic progress? One of the arguments for a comprehensive CGT is that this will increase or improve investment in the productive sector and away from housing. Why? Who says so? Where is the hard data to support this argument? If the taxation treatment, i.e., CGT is the same across all assets classes, why would an investor chose to invest in equities for example, or a start-up company rather than property? The CGT treatment is the same so there is no taxation incentive to invest in one asset class over another. An given that most retail property investors in New Zealand invest in property because they feel it is far more safe than the risks associated with investments in equites or businesses, a CGT by itself is not going to increase investments in so-called productive assets, as it does not address the issues of risk, reward and fear that retail investors have. With a comprehensive CGT they are still going to invest in property. Another issue that I have with a CGT that is not considered sufficiently is the effects this will have on the size of the capital markets in New Zealand the quanta of capital that is available for investment. At a marginal tax rate of 33%, a $500 CGT on a $1500 gain in asset value will be taken by the Crown. This of course leaves the investor with $500 less to invest. Is that good for the economy and economic growth as a whole? Where is the data and analysis that \[1\] 5 answers this question? How does this reduction in capital available to the investor encourage investment in the productive sector? As this money is no longer available to be allocated by individual investors, it will now be spent on consumption by the Crown. The question then becomes, how much investment money will be diverted from private sector investment and into the Government’s accounts if capital gains are treated as income and taxed fully? Does this make sense for New Zealand given that we are a very small country with struggling capital markets that are always short of investment dollars? Furthermore, what is the quanta we are talking about here? I have never seen any estimates of the actual dollar amounts that would shift from the private sector to the Government each year in New Zealand if capital gains were taxed in this manner. This is an important question as we know from the evidence from overseas that countries with the largest public sectors and that constitute the largest percentage of GDP are ones which typically are the most stagnant. New Zealand needs to avoid this. Introducing a CGT just because everyone else has one is a very shallow argument. Nobody else has anti-nuclear legislation like New Zealand does, so by that argument we should drop ours? On the basis of the above it is my view that New Zealand should not introduce a comprehensive CGT at this time. Our country is too small, our capital markets are too shallow. They need nurturing and growth. A CGT will also divert an excessive amount of investment capital away from the private sector and into the public sector to be spent on unproductive activities. Moreover insufficient work has been done on what the unintended consequences of its introduction may potentially be, and that previous taxation reviews have not found in favour of introducing one in New Zealand and I believe their arguments and findings still stand. And finally, I have never seen addressed just how many New Zealanders are actually making their living via capital gains? And what sort of money are we talking about here? And to what extent is some or all of this gain captured by our current CGT laws? Surely we should know this before a CGT is designed and introduced? The best public and taxation policy must be evidenced based, otherwise it is likely to fail. Yours sincerely, David Bridewell I am available for further discussion if the committee requires and can be contacted via the above email address. 6 From:Dan M Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:31 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Working Group - Future of Tax - Submissions Hi I have a few last minute (literally) submissions on the Tax Working Group's ("TWG") Future of Tax background paper. 1. A flat rate capital gains tax ("CGT") on property, with exemptions for up to two occupied properties. A CGT that exempted the main residence (family home) as well as up to one more property that is used for residential purposes (this could be a holiday home/bach or apartment regularly used for business). The exemptions could not be used if a property is rented (or made avaialble for rent) for over eg 90 days over a 12 month period. If the CGT is a flat rate (eg 15%) it would be easy to apply (no need to look at the marginal rates) and as it is less than the top tax rate it is less likely to be avoided or circumvented. 2. A new upper income tax bracket for income $250,000 onwards at eg 40%. This would only affect those higher earners who would have the capacity to pay further tax (not far off the 39% rate in place about a decade ago). The current upper threshold at $70,000 is low compared to other countries and so is the 33% rate. This could lead to people diverting income to companies or trusts (similar to the Penny and Hooper tax avoidance cases about a decade ago), so would need some steps to disincentivise people from doing so (in addition to using the general and specific anti avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007). 3. A tax-free threshold of eg the first $10,000 of income. This would provide an overall lower amount of tax paid by earners at the lower end, who are likeliest to need and benefit from this. 4. A progressive company tax rate. The vast majority of businesses in NZ are small or medium enterprises ("SMEs")with no more than five employees. As the revenue in these SMEs would be much sma ller than NZ larger companies, it would seem fair to have a lower rate for companies with lower revenue. 5. A financial transaction tax on all transactions over a threshold eg $10,000. I note the comments on page 30 of the paper that it can be difficult to apply GST to financial services, although this tax could be separate to GST and could apply to all transactions over a threshold. If a default regime required eg the vendor to pay the cost of the tax, parties could be expected to soon thereafter rearrange their transactions (and the consideration component) to ensure the tax cost is allocated effectively. If the taxes proposed by the TWG are intended to supplement existing taxes, so that the overall tax take is basically the same, it would be helpful to clarify that 'more taxes' won't mean 'more tax' paid by the majority of people. In some cases, we might expect some taxes to decrease as the reduction in tax received would be offset by that earned by a new tax. Please let me know if you have any queries on any of these points.

Travaille Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:29 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on Tax Working Group's Review of our tax system 30th April, 2018 A good tax system should be simple, with a broad base and as few exemptions and incentives as possible. I am opposed to the socialistic long- term goal of this government to increase spending but I do support tax reform in the form of tax cuts as is occurring very successfully in the USA at this time. I am opposed to any form of capital gains tax. I am opposed to all tax concessions based on ancestry especially tribal corporations such as Ngai Tahu Charitable Group, who hide their corporate profits under charitable purposes. This is grossly unfair and there needs to be one taxation law for all businesses. I am opposed to using tax policy to address social issues and therefore oppose all new taxes including environmental taxes, lifestyle taxes and land taxes. I hope the tax working group takes notice of these concerns and deals with these discrepancies. Monica Travaille \[1\] 9 From:Andrew Riches Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:15 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Tax working group, As the sole bread winner of a young family which does not receive working for families tax credits, I wish to raise some issues for the working group to take into account when considering the structure of the tax system going forward. In particular I submit keeping personal income taxes modest, a broad tax base and recognising that lower and broader taxes are fairer when considering the broad aray of family structures and life stages across New Zealand: 1. Total household tax take While at various times the concept has been floated of taxing a household rather than individual tax rate, this is problematic as it disadvantages single persons. However I would urge the working group to keep in mind the effect on households should personal tax be increased. In particular two persons earning $60,000 each pay significantly less tax than one earner of $120,000 despite the household as a whole earning the same amount. This creates an incentive for one partner to return to work rather than the breadwiner pursuing promotions, further training or pay rises and may place stress on the family as a whole. Maintining a tax system, that does not significantly increase tax rates as income will minimise the tax imbalance between two earners vs one higher earner. Ultimately a family should be free to choose how its structres its earnings, whether from one or two earners (or more) and not be penalised by the tax system due to one person taking on much of this burden.&nb sp; 2. Shifting tax onto Capital rather than Income There is no logical reason for the tax take to be based on income tax rather than capital other than ease of a ccess. There is no reason a person working hard and earning $80,000 per annum should be taxed whereas a person who has been able to purchase capital which increases in value should not be taxed at all on this capital increase which amounts to income. Income tax should be reduced and capital taxed to compensate. I do not propose at all that capital gains tax should be used to increase total tax revenue, but shifting tax pressure from income earners onto property increaes should gradually extend the tax base while maintaining revenue and taking pressure off workers. This would advantage younger people who have limited or no capital such as shares or land but are attempted to enter this market. By lowering tax on income and shifting this burden onto land and capital, it would be easier for young people to save to own their own home, pay off student loans or place funds in kiwisaver to enable themselves to better their own long term position. This could occur without the pressure on government to subsidise home ownership. 3. Ability to Pay tax is related to state in life not total annual income I do not propose tax should be related to age or status but one matter for the working group to consider if it is proposing personal tax increases is that ability to pay tax is not linked strictly to income but on life stage. For instance using the earlier example, a couple in their 50s may each work 30 hours per week and earn $60,000 each without children at home, student loans, debt or a mortgage. Whereas a person in their 30s working 60 hours per week may be the sole income earner and may be a sole parent earning $120,000 but will pay higher taxes despite having significantly less discretionary income (and quality of life) than the couple on $120k without similar resonsibilities. If the tax working group considers income tax rises they \[1\] 10 will be exacerbating this inequality. A househould should be free to structure their earning as best suits them without penalisation of the tax code. 4. Evasion A significant number of people generally in tades undertake 'cashies' and thereby hide income. This disadvantages those who do not undertake tax evasion in this manner as we need to pay higher taxes to fund the system as a whole. The IRD should deploy more resources to audit persons significantly claiming expenses against income. The recent IRD computer upgrades should assist in this regard. Similarly the government provides subsides on first homes without follow up as to the use of the home, some purchase homes while living at home still, for rental properties while claiming government subsidies. This is effictively benefit fraud and should be targeted by auditors. 5. Bracket Drag Tax revenue will always increase without necessarily an increase in real incomes or living standards due to steadily rising wages, steadily rising living costs and stagnant tax rates. Tax backets need to increase inline with either income rates or inflation or a mix of the two. Failing this it will keep earners from reaping the rewards of increasing income even where there increases maintain pace with inflation. Income tax brackets should be pegged to inflation of income rises or a formula of the two. 6. Supernnuation When kiwisaver reached 10 years of age, this created a group of New Zealanders with ten years of personal savings, government subsidies and employer subsidies. The burden on tax payers of an increasing group of over 65s with universal superannuation needs to be addressed and will only increase the burden on tax payers regardless of any steps taken by the tax working group. The previous government missed an opportunity to begin lowering superannuation payments at this ten year mark but it is not too late. Superannuation payments should be progressively lowered as generations attain retirement age with kiwisaver subsidies. This should take effect immediately and steadily ease the burden on the tax payer so that funds can be used to either ease the increasing burden on tax payers or be used for social services for families and children rather than many who could support themselves over 65 through work or their own savings. Conclusion There are a number of issues facing New Zealand which require significant tax payer funding. However we need to bear in mind the total mix of tax and who is sharing the burden of it. There is a generation of young people who are increasingly shut out from the housing market or enterring it with large mortgages while subsidising a retiring generation with significant property equity and without the corresponding costs of living of mortgages and child rearing. The future structure of the tax system needs to ensure fairness by keeping taxes low and shifting the burden to capital and allowing kiwisaver to take an increasing role in superannuation. Yours faithfully Andrew Riches \[1\] 11 From:Paul Dunmore Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:07 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld, and that all recommendations should be explicitly revenue-neutral. Simplicity of the tax system Anyone who has had to wrestle with the tax system of almost any other country owes a great debt of gratitude to those who simplified the New Zealand tax system. There are huge advantages to having a simple tax system whose job is to raise money for the Government rather than to reward or punish certain types of behaviour. For that reason: (1) I oppose any proposal to complicate GST by exempting specific goods or services or by setting higher or lower rates for specific items. That would be a formula for endless legal battles about whether, for example, a particular food product is a cake or a biscuit. (2) I oppose any proposal to increase the mismatch between taxable business income and accounting income by treating certain revenue or expense items specially. There are already too many such differences, and the effects are to get business owners engaging in tax arbitrage rather than concentrating on producing goods and services that domestic and international customers value. I encourage you to make recommendations that would reduce rather than further increase these discrepancies. An obvious target would be the limited deductibility of entertainment expenses; and ring-fencing proposals of any kind should not be recommended. (3) I oppose any proposal to tax differen t businesses differently (whether by size, by industry, by ownership, or on any other basis). In particular, the special treatment of businesses owned by Māori authorities and businesses owned by churches and charities should be abolished. Bracket creep / fiscal drag I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Lifestyle taxes We have now discovered the limits of the policy of reducing smoking by raising excise tax on tobacco. Up to a point, it was highly effective; but it has now reached the point where it is creating a significant black market, fueling violent crime, and making big money for the gangs. Correspondingly, as people buy their ciggies from the gangs, the policy must no longer be particularly effective at reducing smoking (although it no doubt is effective at reducing recorded purchases.) I submit that you should recommend that the last few \[1\] 12 increases in excise tax on tobacco be reversed, and that no further increases be applied. This is not to support cigarettes or smoking, simply to acknowledge that this policy has run its course and is now creating much greater harm than its benefits. I submit that no other lifestyle taxes be introduced unless there is evidence that they actually work to achieve the claimed goals. The evidence is quite clear that sugar and fat taxes affect the sales of certain products but do nothing to reduce obesity, which is the social goal justifying them. Such taxes should therefore not be introduced; they are regressive, they complicate the tax system, and they do not achieve any valid objectives. Yours sincerely, Paul Dunmore \[1\] 13 From:Brent Barrett Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 11:03 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Hello - Thanks for the opportunity to provide a submission on the Tax Working Group. I submit that 1. The New Zealand tax system needs to change a lot. 2. Money isn’t limiting, natural resources and planetary boundaries are. The tax system needs to reflect that strongly. 3. Build a tax system with the UN Sustainable Development Goals at the forefront. 4. Put tax on pollution, especially a tax on carbon that is in line with the Productivity Commission’s view that carbon will need to be expensive to achieve carbon neutral by 2050. Price of carbon should go up steeply, until it puts us on a clear trajectory to achieve carbon neutral by 2050, with full investment of revenue back into renewables and other carbon positive technologies. 5. A high tax on any extractive industry is needed, e.g. mining. 6. Also tax on pollution of other forms - nutrients or other resources leaving farms and cities are a good example. 7. We need to respond to Thomas Piketty, the major new finding on capital, and raise taxes on wealth. Inheritance, capital gains, currency exchange should all be taxed. 8. We need to recognise that the fundamental role of tax is redistribution, and that is manifest in part through services provided by govt agencies 9. Need to make it possible for local government to raise funds via channels other than just rates, e.g. local govt take a slice of GST. 10. I’d be comfortable with a Universal Basic Income. 11. Strongly curtail regressive forms of tax. 12. Introduce congestion charging in major cities. 13. Stop tax breaks for fossil fuel industry. 14. Tax should be much higher on the wealthy and those with very high incomes. 15. Tax large corporations to a greater extent. 16. Offer major tax incentives for R&D investment until we are in top 25% of OECD in R&D spend. R&D focus needs to be on UN Sustainable Development Goals or similar. Not on coal!!!! 17. Find a way to use tax to break up the monopoly and duopoly provision of goods and services. 18. Tax banks to keep more of the profits in NZ 19. Put a tax / border levy on tourists 20. Put a tax on motor vehicles based on their size: bigger vehicle = bigger tax 21. Once Electric Vehicles hit 10% of the fleet, put a tax analogous to a road user charge on them 22. Tax churches 23. Outlaw the ‘solar tax’ that Unison Networks invented, instead set up tax system to incentivise distributed solar electric and other energy production and trading And that’s it! Brent Barrett \[1\] \[1\] 14 \[1\] 15 From:Stefan Olson Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:51 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Very happy to be contacted if that is useful. My submission is below. It doesn't necessarily follow the ordering of issues in the paper ==== The New Zealand tax system should be admired for its current simplicity. My experience with working with other countries with much more complicated taxation systems has been that they are much more expensive to administer. This is not just at the tax department level but for accountants and other organisations as well. Point 1 - Overall Direction - The Tax working group should keep the tax system very simple. The ideal for income tax would be a single flat rate, company, trust and personal because it reduces the disincentive to work more and is much cheaper from an administrative perspective. Much of the background paper is about creating a more complex tax system. That will result in more expenditure on accountants and other assistance in understanding taxation costs. The better way to do things is to keep things simple with low rates and people will invest less in avoiding it and in the case of businesses invest more in actually growing the business. - The review seems focused on creating new taxes. Whilst I oppose this, if new taxes are created other taxes should be lowered to compensate Point 2 - Thinking Processes - the thinking of the working group appears to have been decided before even starting the process, maybe caused by the limited terms of reference. There is a quote on page 10 that shows a lack of willingness to think differently: “If the Government is to continue providing healthcare and superannuation at current levels, then the level of taxation will need to increase, or spending on other transfers or publicly provided goods and services will need to fall.” Those are not the only two options for how those can be provided. There are three points I'd make in response to this: o A good example of that is the proposal by Sir Roger Douglas and Robert MacCulloch: https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/31890. Whilst not perfect, it proposes a completely different way to solve that problem – and would reduce inequality of access to healthcare and superannuation. Frankly, if it were not for the highly limited terms of reference, this paper would be very good starting point for the tax working group to rethink how we can best help the least well off in our society. o Other key point on that particular thinking is that if you manage to grow the economy on a per head basis you will actually be receiving more tax per head and be able to provide the same or additional services in future o Thirdly the efficiency of government expenditure can be improved. Thus resulting in more goods or services for the same or lower price. Singapore is a clear example of this in the health sector where they provide more than we do at a lower cost. Point 3 – Savings/Superannuation - Superannuation is raised as an issue. Really the solution is to get as many people saving for themselves as possible and (if needed) over time introduce a surtax to ensure that we can still afford to provide for those who need it. - The above referenced paper proposes one solution, even avoiding the need for a surtax. There may be others including increasing the amount going into kiwisaver. \[1\] 16 - The introduction of taxation on savings has resulted in a substantial loss of potential wealth for New Zealand. To help increase the return on savings, taxation on interest should not be levied until the money is removed from an account. This would help resolve the superannuation problem. This could be limited to only pie accounts, but there is an argument to make it across the board. But I suspect the additional costs of managing the later may not make this worthwhile though. - So my suggestion is that interest on all pie approved accounts should be made tax-free whilst the money is still in there. Taxation should be levied at the person's current tax rate at the time of removal. The key thing that this would do is allow capital to build up in the country. People will then be able to save knowing that the value of the compound interest is really there. At the moment with an interest rate of 3% tax rate of 33% you're already sitting at a 2% real rate of return. Then if inflation is at 1.5% you're at a 0.5% real rate of return. We don't get the opportunity to get the value of the compound interest that we would otherwise get. This will allow people to build more capital in superannuation and ease the pressure on the government in future when they will need to implement some form of surtax. It would also allow more money for investment in growing the economy, which in general the private sector does much better than the government. Point 4- Maori tax - I don't think there should be any differentiation between taxation on Maori - or any other ethnicity. Creating different rules for different ethnicities is a dangerous path to go down. Point 5 - Company tax - there is a proposal to have a lower tax rate for small businesses. I think this is not a good idea. If we go back to my point 1, the idea is to have the simplest possible system. That makes the system more complicated. This is even though as a small business I may qualify for lower taxation. It ends up with people trying to keep their businesses small rather than growing them. Whenever you set a tax you set an incentive. If there is a lower tax rate the incentive is to keep the company small enough to stay under that level (or spend money working around it) - Company, trust and personal tax rates should be aligned. As discussed in the document, otherwise people try and avoid these, although the way withholding tax works now does make it more difficult - Company taxes should be lowered to be more consistent with other countries. As a result the other two taxes mentioned on the previous line should also be lowered. This will encourage people to work harder and earn more. - I believe that tax deductible expenses should be re-evaluated. Much modern technology does not last particularly long in constant usage so should be able to be immediately deducted up to a reasonable amount like $5000. Point 6 – GST - please do not make any changes to GST apart from perhaps lowering the rate. It really only takes reading this article to understand why GST should not be changed to introduce exceptions: https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/23-08-2017/outside-the-asylum-chapters-three-and-four-of-an-epic-essay- in-praise-of-new-zealand/ Point 7 - Income Inequality - I am extremely passionate about ensuring that the poorest New Zealanders have the ability to look after themselves and their families. They should be supported in this and should be one of the primary focuses of all government policy. But I don't think income inequality is a problem. In actual fact I want to see more New Zealanders to able to develop businesses that earn huge amounts of money so that they can actually use that money to grow the New Zealand economy. - The question for me is what services are the poorest able to access and how we raise them up to have greater incomes. Taking money off other people does not do this. Do our least well off have access to great education and healthcare and support when they need it to help with their income? That's a larger political question not really a taxation one. Not one I see the current Labour government solving. In fact by removing charter schools they are proving that they do not wish to fix these problems of what the poor can access. But focusing on inequality rather than actual lack of ability to access things like food, or housing et cetera is wrong. We need to ensure that everybody has access to the basic necessities of life. That is a better 17 measure, ensuring that people have necessities of life rather than measuring how much some people have and how much some people don't have. If they are able to meet the needs of their families and have hope that they can improve their situation then so-called inequality is really not relevant. - Working for families distorts our very simple tax system and changes behaviour. I know of large numbers of people who have turned down either improved jobs or increased pay because the loss of some or all of working for families would result in them being worse off. It's not really a very sensible thing to take money off people and then give it back to them. Because in the meantime it's cost money to administer the money as it goes to the government and back again. The most sensible thing would clearly be to get rid of working for families, reduce the overall tax rate and then provide assistance to those who need it rather than to a broad group of people. Point 8 - Capital Gains - I don't want to see poorer people being worse off as they have been over the last 20 years due to the increases in house prices. Other countries like Australia have a capital gains tax but they have exactly the same house price increase problem. It's caused especially in New Zealand and the United States by the attempt to build compact cities where land supply is artificially suppressed resulting in substantial increase in housing costs. This hurts poor people most of all and the last two governments have done nothing about it. - If we continue to do nothing, then people from the poorest households will not be able to purchase houses and that is a massive failure at the government level. And a big change in the last 50 years. There are a lot of societal reasons for this, divorce, for example means that there are multiple houses required where once there was only one. But as above I think the primary reason really is limiting supply by creating compact cities. - So I don't believe a capital gains tax will solve that much. It should not be applied to things that grow the economy like shares. That in turn would result in less investment in the economy and quite possibly create a downward spiral. If implemented should only apply to houses. To be fair it probably should be applied to all houses. But it's not going to solve a supply problem. Point 9 - Income Tax - I believe in a flat tax system - I believe this promotes a fairer allocation of tax. And encourages people to continue working - something that is disincentivised by a progressive system. Another disadvantage of progressive system is it assumes people continue earning the same income. People who might earn substantial amounts of money for a short period of time are unfairly targeted. So an example would be a rugby player who might be earning $200,000 a year for five years. They may not earn very well after that depending on what additional skills they have but because they may have been taxed at the top tax rate, over their lifetime they will end up paying more tax than they would have had the money been spread out over a longer period. - If the existing bracket concept is retained, the brackets should be automatically adjusted on April 1 in the same way that benefits are. Preferably adjusted to wage increases. Point 10 – Charities - it is important I think to continue the tax returns on donations to not for profits. This is an important part of the economy and encourages people to give. Whilst in years past people went to churches and gave 10% of their income that doesn't happen now so an encouragement to continue to give is important. Point 11 – Chapter 6 – Other Taxes - If we go back to point one the answer to the question about other taxes is No, we do not need any additional taxes it would make the tax system more complicated. Point 12 - Land Tax - Please do not implement a land tax - it unfairly disincentivises people from holding land that may have no monetary value. For example native bush. Even in people's own backyards they own land where they plant trees to look ensure that our native ecosystem continues to survive in urban areas. This would end up being removed in favour of income producing activities. Not a good idea. And as with a capital gains tax charged 18 on unrealised income, if charged on all land, then a land tax would hurt poorest people because they aren't going to have that kind of cash available on a yearly basis Point 13 - Sugar Taxes etc.. - Whilst not directly identified in the background paper, I wish to be clear that I do not support any forms of taxes on fat or sugar. These are taxes that both hurt the poor and don't actually achieve anything. Most people can have a little bit of fat or sugar every now and again. Unless it is taxed extremely highly taxes will make no behavioural difference. And you end up with the same problems of exceptions with GST where politicians are going to decide what is taxed and what isn't and you would end up with a legal quagmire. Stefan Olson 19 From:john lang Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:34 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION Tax Working Group Submission: 30 April 2018 Oversight The NZ IRD acts in a monopolistic, heavy handed manner making up tax laws without engaging the NZ population except for when they want to get heavy. Time for a change. There needs to be a regulating Board with power of oversight and regulation. A bi partisan body that avoids party political short termism. A board that engages with the public and expands IRD input from not just the same old corporates and professional self-interests. Culture The NZ IRD is seen as big brother, a regime to be worried about, to avoid, one that is too powerful and unaccountable with an obscure legal framework. There needs to be a culture change where the general population feel good about paying tax to an organization that is listening, responding, helping and advising. Where are the help videos, public notices, easy access to existing tax law, where are the laws? There’s no clarity about some more obscure tax situations. It’s all very well to say ignorance is not an excuse but why don’t IRD publish more guides, open their thinking. Even tax advisors don’t know the answers because the IRD keep things hidden, there's no transparency. Tax reform New Zealand should realign the tax brackets for individuals by providing a tax- free allowance. This would help low income earners and motivate people to take up work. It could be made tax revenue neutral through realignment of higher income bands. Many overseas countries operate in this way, eg UK has a personal tax-free allowance of around $22,000 per annum in the 2017/18 year. There are so many benefits of a personal allowance – it’s a no brainer. Financial Instruments How can a series of Finance Ministers be taken seriously when they know that the Financial Instruments regime law is an ass? So many people don’t understand it and yet, what h elp do IRD provide in trying to work out liability for this ridiculous law from so many decades ago introduced in a different age for reasons that are not relevant today? And as for the cash vs accruals system, $40K per annum, you've got to be kidding me. It is policed randomly and is effectively widely abused. It desperately needs reform. Stop ducking the issue and make changes to this outdated law. Foreign pension taxation The section 70 law on taxation of foreign pensions is draconian, illogical and amounts to theft. You know what I am talking about. The fact that NZ residents who have worked overseas and built up foreign private pensions but have also contributed many more than the 10 years of contributions that qualifies immigrants to a full pension. It gets worse, the reduction of a spouse’s rights when married to individuals with foreign pensions. NZ super is nothing more than a welfare payment, it is not a right because it is unfairly reduced despite the efforts of individuals to provide for their old age. A much fairer system would be to provide all qualifying residents a reducing pension based on qualifying years, eg for retirement age of 65 (and yes you do need to talk about increasing this) 45 x 12= 540/ number of months of actual contribution. So, if someone has worked all their life, their pension right is 100% and reduces by the number of years (or months) of contribution. Any pensions accrued while working overseas would be exempt from those nasty people at Work and Income who also operate in secrecy with imexplicable forms designed to trick and reduce pensions at every turn of the page. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) \[1\] 20 Does NZ have a CGT or doesn’t it? Not even the IRD can tell you the answer to that question. It depends they will say. How ridiculous. Why do you think the housing market is so distorted? For goodness sake, have the balls to introduce a CGT like most countries around the world. No need to invent the wheel – it’s been done already. In conclusion The NZ IRD, treasury and successive governments have been sitting on their hands for too long. There needs to be a complete culture change where the IRD strive to inform, educate, treat individuals with respect and tolerance instead of the continual arrogance and unaccountable monster it has become. Make people feel like they have a stake in the system, make them feel like they count, make them feel like it is good to pay taxes to a fair, accountable, modern organization that cares about people. Sincerely, John Lang 21 From: Sent:Monday, 30 April 2018 10:30 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission First of all thank you for the opportunity to be able to have an input into our future tax regime. I am no fiscal expert, I am an ordinary person & merely approach this exercise from a humanist point of view. I have put some thoughts & comments below: Chapter 2: The future environment Whatever changes happen in the future to the tax system, it is all about making it fairer, so essentially we are looking for a net gain of 0, just more of a re-assignment as to where & how these taxes are collected. It is also about future-proofing society, as with the advent of automation there is a real danger that not everyone will be able to work & earn a living, therefore the introduction of a Universal Basic Income is important not just for the individual but for society as a whole. There is a bit of talk about the differential rates between personal income tax rates , company tax rates & trust tax rates. To minimise tax sheltering we should aim to have similar top tax rates across the board for trusts, companies & persons. In this chapter it talks about the Maori economy, I’m a bit unsure what this is about but it reminded me that there are a lot of iwi, churches etc that own commercial entities that because of the governing body’s charitable status, pay no tax or very minimal tax on profits. I think to promote fairness, as soon as a charity has a commercial arm, this part of it should be ring-fenced & it should pay tax on its profits or be able to off-set losses just like any other company - this is only fair to the entire NZ community. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system We all understand what tax is for & on the whole understand that taxes are good for society. The government needs to operate like a combination of a business & a charity, with we, the people, as its shareholders. Reducing costs to deliver government services, not by cutting corners, but by increasing efficiency, decreasing compliance costs & decreasing bureaucracy. Its ultimate goal to deliver well-being & good living standards to the population. I love the concept of the Living Standards Framework & how Treasury represents the ‘four capitals’. It truly is something that will set NZ apart from the rest of the world, if it becomes an inextricable part of government. The Framework incorporates social & environmental costs & outcomes, not just monetary ones. A fair tax system would be one where everyone has a decent standard of living and survives happily. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system I feel on the whole that the NZ tax system is pretty good - there are improvements that can be made, and loop-holes that need to be shut down, but on the whole it’s not too bad. There is one other tax that should be introduced to influence behaviour & that is a sugar tax - we already have an alcohol tax & a smoking tax because we know that there is harm involved & a price to pay to society for heavy users of these items, similarly we should also address the harm that sugar causes & implement a sugar tax to influence behaviour. I also believe that NZ Super should be means tested - there are wealthy individuals out there who have built up their wealth throughout life either by sheer hard work or through luck or a bit of both, but who do not need to collect a pension from the NZ Government, who wouldn’t miss it. Their pensions can be better used elsewhere. \[1\] \[1\] 22 Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system The GST system in NZ is nice & simple & very easy to apply. Talk of excluding some goods & services form GST would only muddy the waters & would add another level of bureaucracy through increased need of monitoring & implementation of differential rates. There is a discussion about lowering/deleting GST on fruit & veg etc & that having GST on these items disadvantages the lower income earners & yes I would agree with that, but offset this disparity by transfer taxes, rather than making the system more complex. The Government also needs to tackle the low-level consumer imports, we need to get rid of the de minimis threshold as this unfairly disadvantages NZ businesses. The NZ government should be supporting NZ businesses by creating a level playing field. Why have housing costs grown faster than incomes - this is a dark mark on our modern society - the ability to own property is what has allowed the greatest number of people to rise out of poverty throughout history, why do we make it so difficult? Why have some wages in certain sectors risen way more over other sectors? The current administration of tax debt & tax evasion versus welfare debts is unfair - they should be treated equally. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system The digital economy needs to be addressed - how best to tax internet companies & internet transactions - I believe a transactional tax would work best - it doesn’t matter where the company is based, if a transaction takes place in NZ then that is the country that should charge the transactional tax. An equalisation tax could be one example of a transactional tax - it doesn’t matter who bears this tax - domestic residents or foreign companies - if this tax makes goods online more expensive it will influence behaviour & drive more domestic spending? Chapter 7: Specific challenges I understand why the Tax Working Group has been told by the government “hands off” on any form of capital gains tax on the family home or any form of land tax on the land under a family home - this is a political time bomb & this government has wimped out on its responsibilities imo. Any introduction of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) should cover all property, no exceptions; as long as the net tax gain across all tax streams is 0, it will off-set any disadvantages that those of us who own our homes would encounter if we tried to sell. Any productive asset, be it the family home, a piece of land or a business, should be taxed. You either have a CGT or a Land Tax but not both. CGT is better as we want to stop house speculating - combine this with the inability to use tax losses on properties to offset tax on other income. I believe the idea floated of a progressive company tax is stifling growth as you are disincentivising higher turnover/productivity. Keep tax rates the same across all companies. Achieving positive environmental outcomes could be done by having a consumption tax on water usage, electricity usage, having a landfill waste levy & an emission levy. As an aside, vehicular emissions - when conducting a WOF, vehicles should achieve minimum emission standards or otherwise be taken off the roads - there are far too many old vehicles on NZ roads & we have become a bit of a dumping ground for other countries’ less economical vehicles. Appendix 2: I know about the terms of reference, I reiterate - CGT should be across all forms of residential & commercial property, buildings or land. It should be a separate tax, taxed on an accrual basis - this would simplify instances of matrimonial settlements and/or disposal of assets for deceased persons. Assets held by 23 Kiwisaver & other government savings schemes should not be taxed. Private savings schemes should be taxed. Offshore assets should be subject to tax, potentially at a higher rate than domestic assets, to influence behaviour & encourage domestic investment. CGT should apply to all - residents & non-residents alike as it is a tax on NZ properties. Any capital losses should be ring-fenced to be used only against CGT income.There should be no roll-over relief, but if CGT is on an accrual basis this shouldn’t matter anyway. The CGT rate should be the same as personal tax rate if property is held by an individual, or company tax rate if property held by a commercial entity, or family trust rate if held by a family trust. No allowance for inflation in calculating CGT. No de minimis rule, but if CGT is only on property this shouldn’t come into play. If CGT were to be introduced it should be based on the valuation at the date of introduction. Once again thank you for the opportunity to be heard.

I am concerned about proposals to change the tax rules concerning investment property/rentals. Ring fencing tax losses is an example of this. The consequences of this can disadvantage tenants. My reasoning: Each rental property on average has approx 3.5 tenants - in Auckland I think the figure is 3.9 tenants. Owner occupied houses contain on average less people - approx 2.5 and in Auckland the figure is 2.1 people. If you change the tax rules to discourage property investors then they may well sell up and exit the rental market. The average landlord owns two rental properties. If they sell up to owner occupiers then, on average, the seven tenants (3.5 \* 2) will move out to be replaced by five people (2.5 \* 2). Where will the two left over tenants live? They will be forced to compete with the existing tenants who are struggling to find rentals already. So every landlord who exits the rental market could make, on average, two tenants homeless. How can making life difficult for tenants be a good thing? Discouraging landlords can have unintended consequences. It would appear one way to help tenants is to have more rentals available which can result in cheaper rents. One approach to get more rentals available is to encourage existing landlords to stay in the rental business and to encourage more people to become landlords. I don't see ring fencing tax losses will do this. \[1\] 25 Yours sincerely, Richard Watson 26 From:Watson, Richard Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:15 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: A submission to the Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper.

Yours sincerely, Richard Watson \[1\] 27 From:sandra gilchrist Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 10:05 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission In considering the tax system it is important that any changes made to what is taxed and how it is taxed are signalled well in advance of those changes being introduced and are not retrospective. To tax retrospectively means people would be hit by taxes they knew nothing about. They would have had no way to plan for this, to make provision, or to make different decisions armed with the knowledge of what that might mean to their savings. This would be unfair. There has been a lot of talk about a Capita l Gains tax and if introduced, questions raised about how it should be administered. A gain or loss on capital is not realised until the asset is sold, until then it is just a paper gain or loss so how could it be taxed before the asset was sold? There was a suggestion in the working paper that gains could be taxed on an annual basis but what happens if there is a loss the following year, does the tax department refund tax paid in a previous year? How would this work for property which would need to be valued each year. Who would do this and how? How would you ensure this is a realistic valuation? Where would the money come from to pay the tax if the asset hasn’t been sold? Would a capital gains tax factor in the true cost of purchasing an asset e.g. the cost of borrowing to buy it? What about other costs incurred / investments made to a property that contributed to the gain and without which the gain would have been less? Not all second properties are rentals. What about the family Bach, a Kiwi tradition. Some of those properties have been in the family for many years and will be for many years to come. They may have cost almost nothing when they were bought / built by the family but may now be sitting on valuable land. Whilst the tax review needs to determine what is right for the country they must also consider what impact their decisions will have on behaviour. Surely it is good to encourage people to save for their future and their retirement. If you penalise this behaviour people may decide it is not worth it and spend for today and not think of tomorrow. Surely it is good to encourage all that can work into employment. Maybe making it worthwhile for people to work by giving them a private allowance before paying tax will increase the value to them of paid employment over benefits, thus making other savings for the government. Doesn’t the country need some rental accomodation to be provided by private investors? Whilst reducing the number of property investors may result in an increase in property available to first time buyers not everybody is in a position to buy or wants to buy. There are many situations where owning is not practical e.g. a student at university. Without private investors the government will have to make up the shortfall. \[1\] 28 From:David Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 9:46 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To: Tax Working Group My submission will only be concerned with the rural area, the future of which I fear for as I was around the last time a Labour government in the 1980s told us that farming was “a sunset industry” and our children should go and do something else. My father and brother both had to leave their farms, one for financial reasons i.e. 36% penalty interes t rates and our dear dad, feeling totally let down by a party that he had always voted for! Are you about to repeat history with land taxes and environmental taxes? WATER TAXES If you don’t want us to irrigate our land maybe you should just say so but remember that Jacqueline Rowarth believes that water actually benefits the soil. And this farmer of many years thinks she was mostly right, especially in this area of the Waitaki Valley where the soils are good but the rainfall is low. Before the advent of wa ter schemes in the 60s each spring, summer and autumn would see large losses of soil through wind blow, reminiscent of the Oklahoma dust storms. This soil has been worked for many years out of necessity as drought and grass grub would kill off pasture, so it made a lot of sense to grow annual crops such as barley. A generation before, all the flat land would be in oats most years to feed the horses that did the work. With irrigation water the valley has changed remarkably with grass for sheep and cows, cereal crops, stonefruit and vineyards. Pasture is the safest crop as the valley has a lot of out of season frost that have ruined many of these horticultural crops along with families’ dreams! The town of Oamaru is now a busy place with a much larger rating base, demand for houses and full schools (even houses in Kurow are in demand). With a water tax making it too expensive to be viable to irrigate through a season (and many years the cost of production even with irrigation is marginal) there would be a collapse of the population with emptying schools and houses left containing pensioners. I guess it will be easy to read this and be sceptical of such consequences, but I have lived on the banks of the Waitaki for 58 years have seen the benefits of water to our small communities – social, economic and environmental. Why would you want to jeopardise this! LAND TAXES Land taxes would be another penalty on the productive sector as we are only farmers – we’re not there to watch equity grow but most of us are just trying to make an income and improve the living standards of our families and then take something out at the end and hope another generation follows on. I don’t know that you can be too confident that the young people will accept what we did in the 80s as you tried to break us. I think I would advise them to roll up their tents and try something else if they were going to stay in this country. My middle son, who studied agriculture at two North American universities, frequently tells me of the different subsidies and tax breaks his friends in the USA are getting. We must stay competitive on the world scene and any taxes on land and water will make it so much harder to do so. We had a valuer from Australia here two days ago who told of the new government-built irrigation scheme in Tasmania! How extraordinary that a government would want to lift its rural community rather than penalise it. CAPITAL GAINS TAX If you decide to have a capital gains tax, the family house should not be exempt as this reinforces inequality. Someone with a house valued at $10,000000 in Parnell gets a huge tax break over a family in Temuka whose family home is worth $250000. Exempting a farmhouse, being the farmer’s family home just doesn’t compare to a fully tradable house in town – you cannot sell it without the farm and many more factors influence the value of the farm. Hope you find something of interest in this. Regards David Easton \[1\] 29 From:Tom Dobbe Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:54 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Sir Michael Cullen and your Fellow Members, A general comment: New Zealanders already pay a substantial amount in tax. Governments need to become more disciplined in their spending, honest in admitting any increase in what is taken from an individual is a tax and stop under estimating the power of a good education coupled with the power of Public opinion. The summary of my submissions are: 1. Stop the tax creep that insidiously erodes the take home pay of wage earners. 2. Reduce company tax rates and make them the same for large or small companies 3. Close the loop hole that allows Charitable Businesses tax exemptions even when the funds are not directly used to benefit the charity. 4. I am opposed to a capital Gains tax 5. Maori Authorities should be taxed at the same rate as all companies. 6. Any environmental tax proposals should be sector neutral 7. GST should remain structured as it is. Expanding on the summary: 1. Our society used to function well on a good days work for a good days pay, this needs to be encouraged. An increasing trend world wide is more people voting for Governments that distribute more in the way of benefits. This is mistaken ideology and leads to dependency and dissatisfaction. All of which erodes the ethos of the individual entrepreneur or work ethic so important to a balanced life. The benefit from a good take home pay is immeasurable, it allows the growth in Self esteem, allows choice and a chance to adopt a healthy life style. We will live longer and this will become extremely important. It is dishonest of any Government to continue what is known as “Bracket Creep” eroding what is rightfully an individuals take home pay without asking the tax payers of New Zealanders if they agree. Other Nations have done this very successfully. By being honest it will stop any future Government making false “play” from tax cuts. 2. We need to encourage industry, new investment that is determined by the market place not Government directed or influenced, to identify and expand new opportunities and provide work for any age group that is fit and able. Not having work available at a good rate of pay, balanced with encouragement to work, will eventually destroy the fabric on which our society is built. Increasing productivity is essential. \[1\] 30 3. Some of these organisations are huge businesses competing on an unlevelled playing field with full tax paying companies. They are able to accumulate huge assets with only a small proportion going back to the people they claim to represent. 4. Keep the tax system simple. Even exempting the home from Capital Gains tax has not been proved overseas to benefit anyone; it certainly has not reduced house prices long term. People need to be encouraged to invest in productive assets that will benefit New Zealand. 5. NZ has made enormous settlements to Maori and indeed many Tribes now own some of our biggest companies. I believe New Zealanders have been very fair in their acceptance of this directional payment but from now on we need to all pull our weight equally. 6. Politicians should not be given the chance to ideologically favour certain entities within a sector. Farmers are making huge personal investments on their land to improve the environment, let the marketing company make this call, as today’s consumer is very discerning. Individuals with their choice of vehicles, recycling and reduction of wastage are starting to make an impact. Individuals are collecting like minded people to gather and clear the ocean of plastic, funded philanthropically. The advent of electric vehicles is exciting. People understand the advantages over fossil fuelled motors. It took five years in America to change from horse drawn vehicles to the motor car as new opportunities were appreciated. This will not be so dramatic but as technology improves, volumes will increase and the price will drop. 7. A simple tax on the consumer that has proved effective over time. As much as I hate paying a tax on a tax, for example GST on rates, the system we have is easy to administer and should not be tinkered with. Do not underestimate education and the power of public opinion. We are seeing this with health and the willingness to reduce sugar, increase exercise and take control of ones destiny. How many cars do you see on the road today with a bike carrier on the back? 10 years ago you would count them on one hand. Taxes are expensive to operate and implement and there is a reluctance to remove any imposed tax take. Thank you for your time. Yours sincerly, 31 Tom. 32 From:Peter Crabb Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:31 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax written submission Tax Working Group, Thank you for the opportunity to complete a submission. To be future ready, the NZ tax system needs to adapt, with changes planned in simple incremental steps. Changes can offer NZ an exciting and robust international edge. The tax system should be competitive, fair, effective while operating in background so that we can enjoy our busy lives. The current tax system is falling short on a number of major issues and are a growing concern: 1. In the age of automation, a notable effort is committed to accounting services to minimise the payment of tax. There is no shortage in NZ of excel documents. Tax complexity has lead to structural issues and an outcome that is not particularly fair. 2. International corporations have access to the local NZ market, yet are not paying their fair share to maintain it \[not to name Vodafone, Microsoft or Amazon or various International Banks specifically ...\] 3. Complex tax breaks are not achieving the desired outcome; carbon reduction, industrial innovation, local community resilience etc... 4. Charities are granted an exemption, encouraging a route for lobbying or offering dubious benefits in return. 5. Too much capital is drawn to static investments such as land, jewellery, gold or crypto rather than technical or company progress. 6. Significant private profit is being gained from public investment in infrastructure, with limited return to the public. To address the above, I would like to see the tax system transition to include: 1. A simplified and fair tax system that is enhanced by automation in its reach, reduced cost and openness. A taxation that is focused on transactions to include everyone replacing PAYE. A transaction tax designed to encourage a concise and fair tax outcome for the average kiwi while discouraging tax schemes that involve a cascade of accounting services. 2. International companies should be subject to a fair transaction tax upheld as part of having access to the local market. Meeting a requirement to maintain the local market. 3. Tax breaks to specific industries with the aim of encouraging a positive outcome need to be better designed to ensure simplicity; keep tax fair. Any tax breaks should provide a public share in the outcome. 4. Charities should not be granted an exemption. Public expenditure should seek to fund positive outcomes and play an active partnership role. \[1\] 33 5. Capital gain should be subject to a transaction tax to reduce the allure of static assets. 6. The public should have access to the capital gain delivered by infrastructure projects. Additional opportunities for tax changes include: 1. In spending tax, the employment/training of young people should be a mandatory part of all public works contracts. NZ needs a future with a confident skilled workforce. 2. There should be an option for you to nominate what a portion of your taxes are spent on, seeking public engagement on local environmental outcomes. 3. You can only eat so much. Raw food should be the subject of limited tax along with its preparation. NZ could knock the pants of France for outdoor dinning, healthy living and keeping the youth employed while enhancing tourism. There is always a reason to add some new feature to the tax system (just change x to achieve...). The issue is we loose long-term resilience and the opportunity for automation and all the gains that come with it. I am advocating openness and simplicity. Looking forward to real change. Kind regards, Peter Crabb 34 From:Karen Grace Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:24 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Taxation To whom it may concern, My submission is simple. Instead of finding new ways to tax the working citizens of New Zealand, which just continues to reduce discretionary spending and the potential to create personal savings, reverse this ludicrous corporate welfare hidden behind the propaganda of trickledown economics. After more than 30 years of reducing corporate tax rates under the promise of increasing wages, the facts show that tax both direct and indirect has increased for the average working Kiwi, while the corporates and their shareholders have participated in the greatest wealth transfer in the history of mankind. The many have continually contributed to the few and this must stop. Therefore, before considering taxation in any form that will be inflicted on working public, lift corporate taxation. Close the loopholes that corporates us e to shift funds to their corporate Head offices as "licensing fees", trademark fees and all the other dubious tax dodge techniques that are used to create a zero tax liability, (which is a way of shifting funds to low tax states, (such as Singapore). Charge a foreign exchange surcharge on all companies that do business in NZ and use our foreign exchange earnings to repatriate their funds overseas. Corporations use the services that our Government supplies. Education to provide an educated workforce. Health services to provide health care for their staff at no cost to the employer. Infrastructure such as reliable power networks, technology networks, roading, ports, airports etc, sll supplied by the taxpayer. Then their is a taxpayer funded legal system that provides a safe environment in which to carry out business. Corporations and multinationals have a moral obligation to contribute their fair share of tax to maintain and support the land that provides all that they need to profit from It's about time the New Zealand Labour Government remembered where it came from and to whom their loyalties belong, (and its not the enemies of the working classes, be they white or blue collared) Yours sincerely Karen Robson \[1\] 35 From:Daniel Barthow Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:21 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: NZ to support a UN Tax Body to tackle tax avoidance Hi, In response to the key questions here is my submission to your working group... 1. What does the future of tax look like to you? A fairer system for all so that the playing field is leveled and inequality in NZ and the wider world we live in is weeded out. 2. What is the purpose of tax To pool funds from a group of people to be used for delivering a greater good for the country and people who live in it. 3. Are we taxing the right things? No - the global tax system needs to be fixed and the Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated that the lack of tax transparency is a global problem that needs a global solution. We shouldn't see developing countries missing out on $150 billion each year due to multinational tax avoidance 4. Can tax make housing more affordable? If used correctly. Capital gains tax on property outside of the family home and tax on properties owned by people who do not live in NZ could be invested into making housing more affordable to those who need it most. 5. What tax issues matter most to you? Tax avoidance is a key issue for me. It isn't fair that the richest (both individuals and companies) can lower their tax burden because the system allows it. By doing so it deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. This will be most easily done through a new UN-based global tax body which would ensure all countries participate on an equal footing and ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax. It would be acceptable for the Group and the Secretariat to contact me about my submission to discuss the points raised if required. Kind regards, -- Daniel Barthow \[1\] \[1\] 36 From:Ernest Scott Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:10 PM To: TWG Submissions; Peter Scott Subject: Submission Tax Working Party Dear Tax Working Group I would like to make the following submission on the future of tax in NZ. I am a wage and salary earner. I have worked for nearly 42 years and paid tax throughout this time . I have never received a benefit from the Government - unemployment, sickness, or fathered any children to a solo parent. Ie I have think I have paid my fair share. The current tax system is biased with wage and salary earners paying the majority of taxes. Self employed people enjoy tax writes offs such as sharing income between wife and husband to minmise tax. Farmers do not pay their fair share. Refer article below. Fontera is a huge monoploly which does not pay tax. This another tax write off for farmers. Trades people do jobs under the counter and do not pay tax. It is estimated that the black economy is costing approx $8 billion per year in tax. NZ has a immigration policy which favours wealthy immigrants who get approval is investors. All they do is buy houses, which pushes up the cost of houses and rent the houses out under the counter to similar immigrants requiring accomodation, ie not declaring tax income. In NZ the Government expenditure is approximately 50 % of the GDP. ie $100 Billion expenditure out of a $200 Billion GDP. Local Government probably spends another $20 Billion. Hence in total $120 Billion or 60 % of the GDP is spent by the Government and Local Government. This is funded through taxes and Local Government rates. Is this a sustainable level mof taxation. We need to try to keep Government and Local Government expenditure under control. Government and Local Governmnet need to spend taxpayers and rate payers money wisely. For example NZTA and Local Authorities just hand out contracts to preferred contractors. Isn't this just croney capitalism. For example the NZTA $2 Billion Waterview Tunnel project or the NZTA $500 million Road Maintenance Contracts. Or the consultants / specialist expenditure by the Health Boards. The Office of the Auditor General and Audit NZ, needs to focus on monitoring the expenditure by Government Departments and Local Governmnet to ensure that taxpayers and ratepayers are getting value for money. There needs to be more indpendnat monitoring of all Government and Local Government Contracts to ensure that the Governments Procurement Policies are being achieved. In NZ approximately 50 % of the opoulation pay no tax, after all tax breaks are taken account of. ie Working for Families tax rebates. \[1\] \[1\] 37 All tax rebates should be removed. People who have rental properties should not be able to reduce their income so that they are entitled to "Working fo Families " tax rebates. People should not be able to use trusts to reduce their declared income, and claim Student Allowances for their children. If we are going to introduce Capital Gains tax it needs to be applied fairly across the board, not just residential rental property. It should be applied to farmers business owners who buy a business and sell it 5 years later and make a profit residential property owners who buy a property, and subdivide off the rear section weathy people like John Key who buys a $5 million house and then sells it 8 years later for $30 million. shares gold investments precious art and antique investments - basically any collectable which approcaites in valuse over and above the CPI crytocurrency foreign exchange investments commercial property Rather than a Caital Gains Tax, a Profit tax should apply to all investments, if they and bought and sold for a profit within a 5 year period. However the cost of making the investment needs to be deducted to detertmine the actual profit upon which tax is liable. ie if a person borrowed $1 million to buy a rental house and sold the house for $1.2 million one year later. The profit is $200,000 less the cost of the money to make the invetsment. This approach is consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Below is an article on the tax paid by farmers, which shows that they are not paying their fair share. Not only do they get tax writes, they share their income between spuses, the farm pays for their living costs and mortgage and their children received Student Allowance beacsue they are poor. The same applies to business owners. Dairy farmers 'paying no tax' Vernon Small08:58, May 18 2011 Source Stuff. 38 The average dairy farmer is paying less tax than a couple on the pension – raising questions about whether the sector touted as the backbone of the economy is paying its fair share. As the Government prepares one of the tightest Budgets in recent years, cutting into middle-class family benefits and KiwiSaver subsidies, new figures suggest those cuts will hit people who are also shouldering the greatest tax burden – wage and salary earners. Inland Revenue Department figures provided to Labour revenue spokesman Stuart Nash show that, in the latest full year for which figures were available, the average tax paid by dairy farms was $1506 a year. The 17,244 registered as being in the dairy sector, including companies, trusts and individuals, paid only $26m in tax. The figures also show that more than half – 9014 – reported a loss for the 2009 year and another 2635 reported trading income of between $1 and $20,000. Federated Farmers chief executive Conor English said he was not surprised by the figures. "The reason why there's not much tax being paid is because there hasn't been much money made. The average dairy farmer ... made a cash loss of $50,000." There was more debt because farmers had been borrowing from the bank to pay for groceries. "The myth of the stinking rich farmer is simply not true." But Nash said Labour would investigate whether farmers in general were paying a fair share of tax. In the primary sector, 75 per cent made $20,000 or less and 55 per cent recorded a loss in 2009. Of the nearly 72,000 companies, nearly 40,000 were unprofitable. “Either we have a sector in dire financial trouble or the sector is simply writing off a lot of income against expense and not paying tax," Nash said. "I hope it's the latter. If they are facing dire financial trouble then we as a nation are in the poo.” The IRD figures showed the agricultural sector, including forestry and fishing, paid $319m in tax in 2009. That compared with $486m from mining. Industry as a whole paid $9.7 billion tax and $23b came from personal tax. Nash said the primary sector was of huge importance, but its tax bill was an issue of fairness. "It annoys me when Federated Farmers come out and say we need to cut Working for Families, we need to cut this and that, when they in fact are paying no tax themselves. "They need to take a good hard look at the sector and say, \`Are we actually paying our fair share?"' Adding dairy giant Fonterra to the mix did not change the picture. As a co-operative, it pays out profits to its farmer shareholders, who are liable for tax. Figures compiled by the Parliamentary Library show that, over the period May 2007 to January 2011, Fonterra earned pre-tax profits of $1.86 billion on turnover of $61.6b. But it reported an after-tax profit for the period of $1.88b after receiving net tax credits of $28m – equivalent to a tax rate of negative 1.5 per cent. English said the primary sector was responsible for 66 per cent of exports but, for each dollar earned overseas, only 6c went to the farmer. "So the other 94c goes in ... all the cost structures around getting that kilo of meat from the farm gate to the shore." Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said the figures released by Nash did not raise any policy issues. 39 The $26m tax mentioned came from those who identified themselves as in dairying, he said. Those not classified by industry paid another $1.5 billion in tax and a significant number would be dairy farmers. WHAT THEY PAID Tax paid by the 17,244 dairy farms in 2009: $26m Tax paid by the agricultural, forestry and aquaculture sector: $319m Tax paid by individuals through PAYE and source deductions: $23 billion Total government tax take: $54.7b Tax credit paid to Fonterra over 3 years: $28m Average annual tax paid by 17,244 dairy farms in 2009: $1508 Tax paid by an unemployed beneficiary aged over 25: $1229 Tax paid by couple on the state pension: $3136 Tax paid by single person on the average wage: $8020 Tax paid by a single person earning $100,000: $32,869 Regards Peter Scott \[1\] 40 From:Kathy White Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:10 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I am the Waikato Regional Councillor for Taupo-Rotorua, This is my personal view. It is not the view of Waikato Regional Council. I would like to make a submission in relation to environmental taxes and charges. FUEL TAXES I am generally averse to adding taxes that will impact adversely on those in lower socio-economic groups. That is why I'm not in support of adding fuel taxes in places where people do not have access to good public transport, and where they have fewer opportunities to be more sustainable and minimise their use of fossil fuels. People on limited incomes in the provinces don't have much choice about what they can afford to drive, and they need to drive in order to get around. I am hesitant about supporting regional fuel taxes outside of Auckland. POLLUTER TAXES If you're wanting to generate more revenue to ease congestion and reduce emissions, I believe the best avenue is targeting people when they buy NEW vehicles through a polluter tax. Those who choose large engine vehicles with a larger carbon footprint would be subject to a polluter tax. Those purchasing smaller engine vehicles, electric or hybrid vehicles, would not pay this tax. This incentivises people to consider the environment when making their purchase, and ensures that targeted revenue is raised to spend on finding environmental solutions to problems. LEVY on freedom campers It should be possible to levy the rental of campervans that don't have toilet facilities. Such a fund would be able to subsidise the construction of facilities in popular freedom camper locations. Territorial authorities are struggling to pay for the construction and maintenance of the toilet and shower facilities that freedom campers need. If we want to retain freedom camper access to certain locations, we need to find a way to fund the facilities that support them. A levy would do this. WASTE MINIMISATION Car manufacturers, whiteware and electronics manufacturers should be required to manage their own waste streams. There should be stewardship schemes in places, identifying priority products and managing things like tyres from the beginning to the end of their lives. Levies should be applied to products such as tyres, to enable investment in finding waste management solutions to major environmental problems. There are currently levies on tyres but these aren't used for the purpose they were designed. There should be a warrant of fitness system in place that identifies and rewards those that are seeking to be sustainable, and penalises those that try to avoid waste management responsibility. Polluter taxes should always target the exacerbator of the problem. That requires a good waste minimisation system and environmental warrant of fitness system to be developed. WATER TAXES Councils need a greater range of tools in their toolbox. Currently Watercare, irrigators and other large water users have little incentive to reduce or minimise their water allocation from the Waikato River. It's considered a relatively cheap source of water, and this is why we regularly face conflict between users, and antagonism around foreigners wanting to bottle and profit from New \[1\] 41 Zealand water without paying 'reasonable' fees to look after its monitoring and care. There are few economic instruments that can be applied without opening a can of worms around water ownership. In my opinion, no one owns the water. It owns itself. We are fortunate to be allowed to use it but the onus should be on us to value it and to use it wisely. The problem with talking about royalties is that royalties are generally received for intellectual property. It may just be a word but it could create unintended problems in the conversation with iwi around ownership of water. If more charges and levies were made available to regional councils, there would need to be a system that guarantees that all revenue generated goes into a fund to improve water quality and to improve hydrology, wastewater and water allocation systems. These funds should be invested in investigation of new technologies such as safe incineration of sewage, early warning water monitoring systems, and planting of gullies, riparian strips and wetlands. That way, the water itself, its inhabitants, and the people who use it, benefit from the charges. I would also like to see these funds used to fund real-time sensors that detect dangerous levels of contaminants, and advanced technology that enables us to test for pesticides at parts per trillion. I'm aware of how under-resourced our diagnostic testing systems are in New Zealand. Too often, councils have to send contaminated aquatic critters such as koura overseas because we don't have access to domestic toxicological testing systems that provide results at an evidential level. Councils need to treat sources of drinking water very seriously, and yet currently in New Zealand, we say it's acceptable to drop toxins such as 1080 and brodifacoum, as well as other contaminants into waterways. A Water Warrant of Fitness would require pest contractors to comply with the safety data sheet and remove poisoned carcasses from land and water after aerial operations. It would require contractors to avoid contamination of water. A water warrant of fitness could allow for the application of a polluter tax or other kinds of penalties, or it could incentivise good practice by reducing the incidence of regulatory attention. I'm talking about something that is similar to a car warrant of fitness. Kind regards Kathy White \[1\] 42 From:Neil C Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 8:07 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Sirs, I submit the following suggestions and ideas to the Tax Working Group. 1. Start a turnover tax (revenue tax) on multi-nationals There are a number or large multi-national companies that have paid little or no tax in NZ for decades, despite sales in the hundreds of millions or billions. Some have been in NZ for over 50 or 70 years, for example. It’s time to get some income tax from them. A sales revenue tax can achieve this, for example, tax them at a rate of, say, 4% or 5% of sales revenue. And don’t allow any deductibles or subtractions from that tax. 2. Require specific tax amounts to be paid by NZ citizens living overseas if they want access to govt benefits Unless the government more correctly aligns tax payments to benefits taken per user, the medical, hospital and government pension systems will head towards financial collapse, because there will be ever larger numbers of benef it claimants who have not paid taxes equal to the benefit provided. The following is one method of redressing this very serious problem. Tax residency is a 1920’s concept that is rapidly becoming obsolete and very difficult to enforce, so it is much easier to abolish tax residency and bar people from benefits unless they can prove they have paid taxes to match the benefit. This is a much clearer, explicit and visible way for the government to get paid for the benefits it provides free or at subsidy: make people pay the taxes for each benefit. This is aimed mostly at two groups of persons who will want to collect benefits bit are not always paying their fair contribution in taxes. The two groups are: a) NZ citizens living overseas for extended times, eg over 5 years b) New immigrant citizens, some of whom are returning to their country of origin after getting a NZ passport and are not intending to live here until much later in their life, eg, when aged 45 to 60, when they intend to retire here. They want to collect pension and medical/hospital benefits, yet have paid little or no tax to NZ. Taxes payable per benefit could look like the following examples: - For each child at school, eg pay $2000 per year (or whatever is near the actual cost) - For each student at university, eg pay $10,000 per degree course - For subsidised medical benefits (doctor, lab tests, medicines), eg pay $2000 per 5 years’, rising for each 5 years’ of age to reach eg, $4000 per 5 years for age 70+ - For hospital benefits, eg pay $10,000 to $40,000 (build up credit to that point) - For government superannuation, eg, pay $100,000 to $180,000 per 10 years’ of pension rights for the full pension and pro-rata reduction for those only wanting a 80%, 60%, or 50% pension, for example The amounts given above are just for example. The actual costs to government of providing the benefit need to be used (which I do not have at this point). \[1\] 43 3. Reduce size of Public Service Cutting government expenditure by reducing the headcount of public servants is one way to save tax dollars. The headcount of the NZ civil service is in the order of 42,000 persons. It is doubtful that all of these people are gainfully working a productive and efficient 40 hours each week. I have personally worked in or for the civil services of a number of countries and in no case did I see all of the people fully engaged at all hours for all weeks. So it is likely there is room in NZ for the number of persons to be reduced. A reduction of say, 10,000 to 15,000 could be aimed for. This will require new methods and techniques to keep staff gainfully employed with work that is needed to administer the country. Thank you.

Dear Working Group members, I am James Cone, a private individual, living in the Wellington area, with a background in Computer Science, a shallow background in Sociology, and a propensity to notice the world as it goes by. The background paper https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-subm-bgrd-paper-mar18.pdf tells us that: "Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not generally use the tax system to deliberately modify behaviour ..." (p5). This is true, at most, relative to some null hypothesis. Gabriel Makhlouf recognises this, by saying that "what we do is inescapably normative" https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-12/sp-intergenerationalwellbeing-13dec17.pdf (p3). It also shows in your chapter on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). At a Fabian meeting recently, it was observed that the composition of the working group made you- all well placed to address BEPS, either to restrain it or to defend it. I would prefer that it was restrained. As part of that project, in my dilettante opinion, it would be useful to track international hot money. A Tobin tax might well be useful. In addressing equity, there are two interrelated trends, one toward automation and the other toward income from capital. My folk knowledge says that capital income on housing is enabled by capital inflows. If there was a convenient price for signalling the desired amount of capital inflow, that might make production more rewarding, relative to speculative trading. The only relevant price that I know about in the current tax system is the Approved Issuer Levy. Real experts would probably find others. There is a failure mode where, in the second year of a company, it pays two years of company tax. In so far as the goal of the economy is productive activity that meets human needs, there might be a win from addressing this failure mode. Cycling back to the beginning, yes, the tax system should strive to be as neutral as possible, relative to the null hypothesis (NH). That people who hurt themselves with alcohol and tobacco should pay for some of the damage is part of that NH. I would like us to end up in a place where the NH is as explicit as is practical, discussable within the political process, and where it is compatible with our long-term survival. Yours faithfully, James Cone. \[1\] 46 From:BRIAN Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 7:26 PM To: TWG Submissions Cc: James Prestidge Subject: Tax discussion paper Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Dear Secretariat I wish to comment on some tax matters that have been a concern to me and thank you for the opportunity to do so. This will be brief due to time constraints and my personal poor health. My background is that for the past 30 years I have operated a private accounting business specialising in personal and SME taxes. Tax on Bank and Similar Deposits. As your discus sion document discloses, the tax incidence for this type of investment is high compared to others such as; shares, bonds, property, business equity and maybe others. I put this down to the fact that where the investment in the second group is bought principally for a return on investment, then when the investment is eventually sold there is an inflation factor in the sale price which is untaxed. With a term deposit, the initial principal is returned but anything in excess is taxed. I suggest that the first two percent of interest, if this is where inflation is, is treated as a capital gain. Where inflation changes then there is appropriate authority to amend this amount to keep it relevant. In this case, should a CGT be introduced but at a different rate than the personal tax rate, this group of investors will be treated the same as the second group. Family Income Equalisation Families where there is one primary earner are taxed considerably higher than two income families. This has been considered before with considerable work put into it by the Hon Peter Dunne. USA has an option in their tax return filing for families to choose to either file one family return or two personal returns. This may be worth considering for New Zealand. In the abse nce of a change to the tax return, another suggestion is to go partway in correcting the anomaly is to give primary care givers an option to submit their application for family assistance beginning with half of the family entitlement but using only their personal income for abatement purposes. I am happy to discuss this further with the Committee.

Thanks Robert \[1\] 48 From:Craig Milmine Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 6:55 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group To the members of the Tax Working Group, I submit to the Tax Working Group the following points: 1. Please keep the tax system simple. Exceptions from GST on healthy lifestyle goods and services are hugely exspensive to administer and the Australian experience of this has resulted in ridiculous legal battles where the courts have to decide whether ciabatta is a bread (GST exempt) or a cracker (GST included). The same applies to bad behaviour taxes such as sugar, salt, fat and plastics taxes. Aside from the administrative cost and perverse legal ramifications, a government that uses the tax system to di ctate morals will likely and rightly be punished at the polling station. 2. The practice of allowing inflation to increase taxes through bracket creep needs to stop. Income tax brackets should be indexed to inflation. Far too many families on struggle street are finding themselves on the highest tax bracket - yet unable to afford basic necessities. The middle and lower classes are already badly hit by inflation without the government taking an extra slice from their wage rise that is just keeping up with inflation. This would also incentivise the government to adopt policies that grow the economy rather than lax monetary policy that encourages inflation. 3. I worry that the Tax Working Group has been set up to justify an increase to the overall tax take. I submit that there are large numbers of New Zealnders that are struggling with housing and utilities and excessive council rates. An attempt to sock the taxpayer for more will bring misery to many. Taxes are already too high. 4. Don't tax the housing market. With the main housing problem being constrained supply and low interest rates, any extra taxes on the property market are goling to put off investors in new housing and worsen the overpriced market. Capital gains taxes have not dampened outrageous property prices in Canada and Australia.

It is well established law that this applies to income from both legitimate and illegal activities. However, criminals such as drug dealers who can make a great deal of money never seem to be charged with tax evasion. Further, section CB 32 of the Act specifically states that property obtained by theft comes within the meaning of income. Once again I have never seen a thief charged with tax evasion. The law should apply equally to all.

Secondarily, to redistribute wealth for the common good. And next, to incentivise and dis-incentivise, where there are significant needs to do so. Growing new clean business - I would like to see promotion of research and development in New Zealand, through research and development tax advantages. We need to create an environment where new talent and new ideas can grow into productive businesses here at home. Much of new research will be in high tech and clean industries, as this is the mindset of our youth. And we need to retain more of our talented young people, create more options for University graduates, and raise the bar on our technology skill levels here, which I believe still remain rather low. A follow on effect of this may well be a larger set of companies for investors to invest in, as these companies grow and succeed, making our share market broader and more stable, and providing more investment opportunities besides real estate. But, as NZ struggles with this issue of competing with countries that have lower business taxes, it is not a recipe for success to overburden individuals by making them take on the tax burden which has been shifted off of businesses. We need more active and productive businesses. Are we taxing the right things? x- GST exemptions for low income people - I don't think this should be done, making a special case of low-income people so that they can get out of paying GST on some things. There are unintended consequences, and accounting issues. If something should be not-taxed, then it should be not-taxed for all people. Use family and personal tax credits as a means to re-distribute wealth, and assistance for those who need it, as these can be graduated based upon income and circumstance, and not just turned on and off at some threshold. x - GST SHOULD COME OFF OF FRESH and UNPROCESSED FOOD, FOR EVERYONE. This will benefit low income people greatly. Taxing fresh and unprocessed food is a truly regressive taxation. It's well known that it hurts the poorest most. But there is no cause for making special cases for certain people. Keep it simple, everyone gets a benefit for eating healthy. There are many examples around the world for how to make the transition. x - Investment property should be Capital Gains Taxed at time of sale. I strongly believe in this. I have an idea that tax recovered from sold investment property would easily generate more in tax income than that which is lost in removing GST from unprocessed food. However, I do not have knowledge of how people could dodge this taxation, which might involve the use of trusts or other kinds of property protection. \[1\] 54 x - Retirement Savings - I think kiwisaver should be left as it is, and there should be another retirement savings vehicle offerred to the public in which Exempt-Exempt-Taxed is the rule. To avoid excessive loss of taxes, you can limit the amount which can be put in each year to a small amount, say $600 ($50/month). Let it get off the ground, watch what happens, make adjustments. Appendix 2 Captial Gains Tax responses, from working paper appendix, my opinions. x - Capital Gains tax rate should be tied to income tax rate. x - The rules of shifting to capital gains taxation should be only assets acquired post introduction. x - Capital Gains should be taxed only when realised. x - Matrimonial property settlements should be taxed only if the assets are sold/converted, and in any case must also be non-taxed for a family home if one is involved. x - Death - upon death of the holder of investment property, the property should be taxed when sold/converted, or for value above a threshold. x - Gifts should have to meet a minimum threshold in order to be taxed. Gambling winnings should be fully taxed as income when won. x - Capital Gains Taxes should include realised gains on Rental Properties, Holiday Homes, Land held as investment and which is not part of an already taxed business activity. x - Capital Gains Taxes for moveable investment property and objects should meet a minimum threshold of realised gain before taxation. Sold in NZ, taxed in NZ, regardless of tax residence. Also, for tax residents of NZ, gains on property sold overseas should be taxed, but safeguards against double taxation should apply, where applicable. x - Investments held offshore by nz tax residents should be taxed on realised gains, and do away with the FIF rules. To the degree that our current tax rules are taxing unrealised gains, these should be eliminated and replaced by CGT on realised gains only. At a minimum, whatever is taxed by other rules should count as deductions against the Capital Gain. x - Rollover relief for like kind transfer - definitely. x - Capital Gains should be ring-fenced to offset only Capital losses, and allow some amount and years of carryover. x - de minimus - There should be a de minimus for moveable investment property, but not for investment real estate. x - GST on low-value imported goods - It would do to understand some of the positive effects of not taxing low-value imported goods. My focus is on technological advancements in innovative simple, low cost construction tools and materials. 15 years ago, much of what is available to the rest of the first world was not even heard of here. Without the internet, we were at the mercy of what large companies provided to us, what they thought they could make a market in, in a large scale. Often, when I would inquire about availability of tools and materials that are available elsewhere, I would be told "oh our builders don't like new things", or I might be just told "I never heard of it". 55 For a company to create a broad base of uptake in a new product, stock has to be available in reasonable quantity, and companies will only do that if they feel the risk they take on something new is worth it in terms of probability of success. There is a limit to what companies can/will risk and therefore, and alternate form of creating exposure is required. The result of reliance solely on businesses for access to the tools and materials is to, in many cases, limit ourselves to low grade options, because it's what companies will risk. Sometimes, a solution just can't be found within our borders. Speaking for myself, I will hunt very hard for something here in NZ before I will purchase overseas. If I can find it here, I'll buy it here. But it happens sometimes that a NZ solution is simply not available or is inferior. And in truth what I buy in from overseas is typically low-cost. When I use these new items, if I think a market could be made here, I present the item to an appropriate company, and ask them to give it a try. I show, or tell the people I work with about it and so they are exposed to a superior product. I would rather this exemption remain, because I find it good for myself and for New Zealand. It makes it easier to obtain the superior low-cost products, and hopefully, make them available here. I realise this is anecdotal, but worth noting. 56 From:Catherine Low Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 5:54 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Tax Working Group, I believe tax should be used as a tool to improve our country in many ways. In general, I think tax should be used to disincentivise actions that use finite resources, and cause harm. Tax should be lowered (or made zero) for things that as a country we want to encourage as they are helpful. Some examples of this are: 1. Pollution such as greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere and nitrogen going into rivers should be taxed as these actions are harmful, and there is only a limited amount of pollution t hat can be tolerate. At the moment most producers of pollution get the benefits of polluting our environment by earning money, but our whole planet suffers as a result, so the benefits are private, but the harms are shared. This can be improved by taxing p olluters enough to reduce the pollution down to a sustainable level, and some of the tax money could be used to address the problems the pollution causes. 2. Many things people do affect them and their family in the long term, so tax can change people's incentives. Very unhealthy foods like confectionery and sugary drinks should be taxed more than healthy food. This tax method should be done with the guidance of health economists and medical experts, and the impact should be measured carefully to ensure this reduces harm. Similarly, I would like to see healthy food exempt of all tax. 3. High cost of housing is harmful for our community, so taxes can help this by expanding capital gains taxes, so there is less of an incentive for people to invest in the property market. There may be other ways of using the tax system to encourage developers to produce healthy homes that are affordable for New Zealanders who have low incomes. 4. People are also not paying for harm to animals. Many animals in agriculture have terrible lives, many in factory farms, and the benefits go to the farmers of these animals. I would like to see animal products taxed, with a higher rate for those produced in inhumane conditions such as factory farms. This could incentive farmers to adhere to higher animal welfare standards, and incentive consumers to choose food that doesn't cause as much suffering. 5. Use of finite resources should also be taxed more highly. We only have so much mineral resources, so a higher tax on that resource would disincentive use, we also only have so much water available each year, so that should be taxed. Our land quality is also a finite resource, so any farmer reducing the soil quality e.g. by increasing erosion or putting fertilizers with heavy metals on the land should also be taxed. Yours Sincerely, Catherine Low \[1\] \[1\] 57 From:Simon Rutherford Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 5:37 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Working Group Submission. Kia ora, There are significant ways the wealthy and very wealthy pay less tax. Capital gains are in a sense good if they are invested in and or worked for, and the process is taxed. Shares in commercial ventures are working to create income and grow assets and are taxed accordingly. Property, however and particularly housing. is outside the current system and I believe that property which is unencumbered (debt free) should have a tax value. to start with at a low rate say 0.5% annually (payable annually or in instalments.) Property held by overseas owners that is not working and not currently taxed should be charged with a percentage of value annually. Say 4% Income tax PAYE and self employed tax on income should be reduced as a result of the above. I accepted the value of the above as a result of reading and following debate from The Opportunities Party during last years election campaign. Variation on income tax. I believe that once income for an individual has reached the annual income of a Member of Parliament (Currently just under $164,000 before allowances) the abatement allowance for low income earners should be lost and income should be taxed at the full maximum tax rate. Which I believe should be lower as a result of my above submission. I believe a UBI for all is going to be essential and a transition should be introduced urgently for beneficiaries as a starting point and perhaps be managed through the tax system. As part of that process the National super should be lowered as a UBI and those that need more support should have a simply and fair system to apply for more. Those with an income of an MP or more would be a good starting point.

If we are to consider taxation and its relationship to the future of jobs and welfare including the concerns of health and education as they might evolve alongside the potential results of climate change, automation and artificial intelligence noting the social influences and political dictates that evolved such a complex, expensive and illogical tax conundrum, I believe it is essential to consider a flat transaction tax system for efficiency and transparency. If we can consider and agree deductively that money only realises any value when it is spent particularly in a financial system where money is a human construct we should apply that understanding. Though money is a way of equating value it is no longer directly relatable to anything other than a digital entry in a digital ledger, so if the power goes off it ceases to exist and in a rabid dog eat dog world of manipulative competing interests that create theoretical cloud based fortunes we should by now know we are at the mercy of the weather and be well aware of the potential for storms and winds of ill fortune. Tax reform could be the earthquake that wakes the world up to the oppression of the extremes of capitalism and the schism between ideologies. Additionally I believe it is meaningful to consider the long history of a variety of aristocratic domination, the position now occupied by a financial elite via the excesses and failures of capitalism and Governance. So to consider this type of system as a potentially rational solution I have concluded with an indulgent diatribe of historical or hysterical evidence dating back to the dark ages for moving toward such a innovation in taxation. While you may or may not read or agree with this view of history it is almost beside the point except to say there must be change for the sake of our collective sanity and survival. With this in mind if we look at a philosophy of the need and rights the public empowers the Government to tax them, I think most would agree it is logical the tax system should be as fair and efficient as possible maximising transparency and minimising distortions and costs while limiting fraud and manipulation as a legal or illegal enterprise to avoid paying a reasonable and rational contribution to the costs of Government services. Presently world wide our capitalist allusion or delusion accepts our convoluted, distortionary and unfair systems which in NZ incorporates income tax, withholding tax, provisional tax, fringe benefit tax, and company tax which are all distorting reality to various degrees as they tax earnings instead of spending then topped off with the only logical taxes being GST (more so if it was levied across all points of production) and excise paid on purchases as a user pays component simply because as noted above money only realises any value when it is spent. The attempts to balance the results of the present system seems to me to be disempowered by these tax traditions having to deal with this insane level of complexity contributing to the smoke and mirrors within the wider bureaucratic asylum we are all subjected to and the inherent costs of compliance, inefficiency and waste. I believe simplicity is a big part of the answer, accordingly in 2016 I made a submission to the "Making Tax Simpler" green paper organised by the National Govt. propounding a concept I called Te Tari Taake Transaction Tax (or trans theft!!) on all receipts being a system closely related to GST but with a differential in the charge and claim rates of say 50%. Though it may initially seem counter intuitive this is naturally and rationally a progressive tax as it levies expenditure increasing the yields as related to the spending power of a business enterprise or an individual and immediately reflects the value they extract from the Govt. services (as in GST). I am convinced in my belief moving to this version of a flat tax on incomes and purchases as a strategy (and for efficiency) will over time rationalise unjustifiably high \[1\] 60 incomes and prices. Aside a theoretical market rate of consumer prices inflated to pay for some unjustifiably high incomes and inflationary deductibles (e.g. business class travel and perks such as vehicles) those costs result in another form of taxation on the costs of living by for example increasing the prices of essential commodities such as electricity or say building costs which disproportionately affect the struggling masses . As stated in the Green Paper of 2015 Appendix 1. Policy Considerations; the whole section relates to the costs of collection and the distortions in the economy due to taxation (3-4% of GDP and notably $2.5 billion to SME's) and section 1.9 and 1.10 talk of maintaining the integrity of the tax system and then states "The Government has not until now, stood back and had a fundamental look at how tax might best be administered if it were starting from scratch" and from the Future of Tax brief "The Government has established the Tax Working Group to examine further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system". To my way of thinking this concept then becomes the central issue of governance in that how can any Government purport to represent the population if it's funding model is irrational. There are many reasons to promote this type of transaction tax but particularly transparency and simplicity can serve to suppress avoidance and fraud. While it is a big claim it is not to complex to illustrate as all transactions can be reconciled against the tax payed and claimed so I will explain forthwith. The obvious difficulty with simply collecting more GST is one might think it requires lifting the percentage charged, but by applying a differential in the charge (say 15%) and claim rate (of say 7.5%) the yield is much higher. So for an example at the present charge rate of 15% if the claim rate is half of the GST paid by the enterprise (i.e. 7.5% of all costs including wages and salaries) the tax netted is a reflection of the ability and advantage the enterprise has added value and profited from by leveraging all Govt. services. As all tax revenue resulting from business activities and investment is generated by trading in the marketplace including rents and interest there is in my opinion no point in overly complicating the calculations required to evaluate the tax liability. It is also important to note in this transaction tax concept when a company maybe operating at a level where the 7.5% of receipts is higher than the 15% of the sales or "transaction tax", the difference in favour of the business accumulates at the IRD as a deduction to be claimed against future sales, so conceptually no return is paid out by the IRD simplifying the process. This requires further explanation as it pertains to long term persistent losses which are indicative of a business in trouble and thereby potentially a burden to the tax base as it still utilises the externalities. Because about 60% plus of Govt. revenue is netted from business activities when we levy a wage with income tax it is in fact being afforded by the revenue of the employer, so I think most would agree "income tax" is a somewhat specious term because it is in reality a tax afforded by the business activities. Also much of the yield of GST revenue results from the non GST levied wages (as opposed to value added and profits) so the combination with progressive tax on incomes (another levy on the same activity) is I believe a distortion of true labour market costs and thereby makes it difficult for employers to pay better wages. This double tax severely complicates the tax levied on wages as compared to a flat rate on all receipts and ideally the same flat rate on and including all incomes as in this transaction tax concept. I strongly believe the perverse reverse psychology of progressive taxes on incomes contributes to the smoke and mirrors underscoring inequality and the complexity is a confounding and costly distortion to an efficient work force. Presently the tax due on earnings changes every time the individuals earnings increase (or decrease) requiring a annual tax return calculation that ignores previous years earnings (so creating another distortion) for every individual earner, whereas am employer can't conceptually charge a higher contract rate because his employees earnings means the business is paying an increasing tax content on the increased accumulation of an individuals wages. Of course the system has created the need for jobs in bookkeeping but less so in the digital age where a large proportion of accounting is automated. I would say Xero and MYOB may not be happy with the redundancy of their services but equally Doctors may not be completely happy about cures for cancer. If we are to minimise the percentage of an across the board flat tax in a fair manner where the only deduction is the differentiated claimable tax paid to other businesses, it logically requires all payments to be taxed at the same rate including all service charges in the financial sector, all sources of income including capital gains, the second hand market and importantly the proceeds of gambling where the aggregates are 61 offset only by the claim back rate on all costs. Given this is quite radical and would be a somewhat disruptive policy in the short term it may be the differential rate could be gradually introduced over a reasoned time period in conjunction with adjustments to flatten income tax rates. Conceptually depending on the rate of integration, this would quickly assist in a rationalisation of unnecessary costs as the only claimable deduction against the tax charged is the differentiated rate of tax paid on costs of production reducing overly expensive expenditure so balancing production pricing and yields over all sectors. I think it's worth noting here this is not a purely socialist idealism and does not detract from the incentive and reward relationship or the right and ability to profit, but is a pragmatic approach to simplify and streamline the collection of tax. I am convinced a flat rate on income assists the potential for a future of more transient and casual types of employment possibly to be paid via pre taxed Government supplied voucher and thereby a logical evolution of welfare settings and incentives. I do not believe a wage for doing nothing or "UBI" is a practical solution as it offers no incentive and the difficulties of a future of increasing joblessness as they might apply to the equal distribution of potential opportunities may likely be closely related to Govt. social and environmental enterprises sometimes referred to as "work for the dole". While this Te Tari Taake Transaction Tax (or legalised theft) concept may not remove all the distortions in a tax system and may also have dysfunctional aspects, it is in my view much more efficient and transparent particularly as related to the true costs of production and supply so the returns from added value and profit yield are more transparent. While the concept may need to be modeled at different settings of flat tax rates to evaluate returns and it may be logical the formula could include a retainer percentage for efficiency and stability of revenue yield the modeling is very simple even when applied to all the varieties of capital gains. Obviously this would undoubtedly reduce (excessive) company expenditures but I believe this is a much fairer way of balancing aspects of production and profiting going forward and therefore a stabilising influence in the productive sector and the financial services market by defining supply and demand so therefore potentially the whole economy. I even believe it could be a way to rationalise the hugely inefficient and irrational collection of council rates (alongside user pays for council services as per normal) to be distributed based on a per capita or as required basis for urgent or emergency localised needs. From the 2016 AES survey; income for all industries is shown as $603,000million Total expenditure for all industries was $535,000 million Business earned $65,100 million Govt tax revenue totaled $96,805 million from salary and wages $32,500 million GST of $19,100 million and corporate tax $11,600 million (sub total for these sectors is $63,200 million) plus sales other services and earnings $15,300 million The survey shows other revenue of $22,467 million but also states total revenue as $96,805 million though the discrepancy is not relevant as it is the first three sectors we are concerned with. To simplify the calculation I have rounded down the AES figure assuming a tight year of turnover to $600,000 M taxed at 15% = $90,000 M Once again assuming a tight year rounded up and subtracted the tax claimable on expenditure of $540,000 M claiming 7.5% = $40,500 M leaving revenue of $49,500 M While this is a very basic form of modeling you will note this $49,500M is just below the personal income taxes and the GST for 2016 at $51,600M and does not fully compute the potential as related to financial service charges and gambling. 62 Because conceptually under a Te Tari Taake Trans Tax Theft system the first three sectors, Income, GST and Corporate taxes could be replaced by this unequivocal system I have shown the figures at 20% with a 50% differential as this illustrates the potential to include council rates collection. Once again it is notable transaction taxes on financial services, lotto and gambling proceeds are not shown so it is a very rudimentary form of modeling. It is also possible to consider the tax yield on capital gains by claiming the differentiated rate of tax on the yield and costs of purchase, maintenance and running costs (but not depreciation) as a way of balancing those earnings. So once again I have rounded down the AES figure assuming a tight year of turnover to $600,000 M taxed at 20% = $120,000 M Again assuming a tight year rounded up and subtracted the tax claimable on expenditure of $540,000 M claimed at 10% = $54,000 M leaving a yield of $66,000 M While it would not be practical for all companies to simply switch to a new system, smaller companies and sole traders would benefit by an option to calculate their tax this way reducing the complexity and costs of compliance. With digital payments tax can be deducted on payment possibly resulting in a claim on that invoice by a legal business or enterprise (e.g. 50% of trans tax paid) completing the transaction (assuming the claim is a legal expense) reconciling the transaction. This means when a transaction or "invoice" occurs and the tax is paid, either an allowable claim is made or no claim is made in the case of the non business expense. Each and every transaction is registered and reconciled completing the transaction and is therefore trackable as a completed equation. No other summation or rendering is required and therefore the balance sheet for that business entity is not required to calculate the tax as in the GST system we use already. This type of "transaction tax" is naturally and logically a progressive user pays tax as the more a enterprise or an individual spends (thereby leveraging the externalities in the taxpayer supported market) the more tax is yielded being the accumulated tax component of the price paid by the consumer (minus the unnecessary costs of compliance and other distortions). While this could cause stresses to bottom lines of companies operating at tight margins the trading account will exhibit that problem very quickly as the calculations are very obvious and can therefore be addressed quickly through reviewing the businesses model to be addressed through refinancing options or other efficient means. The affect on capital of the same flat rate on capital earnings requires modeling though I believe it can rationalise those yields also and firmly believe we can treat it exactly the same where high earnings and low costs yield higher flat rate tax returns and losses to the capital base are not necessarily a concern to Government aside the provision of essential services and production. I think the various examples of Govt. bailouts of distressed operations such as Southern Cross Finance and refinancing of Air New Zealand are pertinent in this context. The ultimate functioning of such a system could include Govt. support for the period an enterprise needs to initiate or rationalise it's income so to adjust it's trading and projections or in the case of bankruptcy to be liquidated with IRD assistance. This is efficient from Te Tari Taakes point of view as losses to the revenue which are costs to the externalities are easily identified and the companies balance sheet is of much less relevance to the Government. As it is the end user paying the accrued tax content (per item) accrued in the production and sales of goods and services (as it is in the present system) there is no real advantage gained from the exhaustive and falsifiable present calculations required. Conceptually I believe, partly depending on the rate of integration, this would quite quickly assist in a rationalisation of costs and excessive consumption (as total costs are no longer deductible), thereby assisting to balance pricing and yields within all sectors. So with Govt. revenue at approximately $95 billion the $95 billion dollar question is why do we continue to complicate and exacerbate the distortions and problems. Presently income tax and GST revenue is subsidising all businesses expansions by paying for the costs of the externalities the Govt. provide but often through continually rising prices for goods and services that pay for the perks and privileges of some at the unjustifiably high end of executive remuneration as related to their self inflated self worth which in turn distorts the view of others self worth both positive and negative. 63 Obviously the elephant in the room is the removal of losses, costs and depreciation as tax deductions for business which would tend to reduce expenditures and so a challenge for businesses development potentially adjusting the costs of those services to the consumer, but I believe those prices are already subjected to serious distortion. Before the recent removal of depreciation on buildings and going back further fringe benefit adjustments and the LAQC rules now known as look through companies rules, allowable cost deductions were and still are quite irrational in my opinion and have an affect on over consumerism with unfettered expansion and domination by some businesses. For instance the fact petrol and diesel are deductible means business owners tend not to properly consider the waste factor or compute the harm to the environment, the trade deficit, the quest for oil and it's history of war mongering and the fact we are breathing the crap emissions. Now that's what I call a distortion! If we are then to consider the implications of taxing capital yields I believe we can treat it exactly the same where high earnings and low costs yield higher flat rate tax returns and losses to the capital base is not necessarily a concern to Government aside the provision of essential services and production. I think the various examples of Govt. bailouts of distressed operations such as Southern Cross Finance and refinancing of Air New Zealand are pertinent in this context. So to consider this type of system as a potentially rational solution as noted in the first paragraph I have concluded with the following diatribe of historical evidence dating back to the dark ages for moving toward such a innovation in taxation. So once again while you may or may not read or agree with this view of history it is almost beside the point other than to say there must be change for the sake of equality, sanity and possibly our survival. Many of the questions posed in the brief are addressed in context above and many answers I would proffer around the more specific questions are quite obvious if we apply the same Te Tari Taake Trans Tax philosophy or "logically legalised theft concept". For instance BEPS is a mute problem if the only tax due is the trans tax minus any NZ costs (i.e. local) costs are claimable or the deeper issues concerning housing though I intend to expand on those questions and challenges in the near future the deadline approaches and mankind's decline continues so I better send this now. Part two So expenses like travel, entertainment, expense accounts and other perks complicate and distort true costs of production and while they created a lot of mind numbing work for bookkeepers (reduced through computerisation) it is the non legal deductions which can range from cashies or dirty dealings, back handers or bribes to costs of entertainment (claiming fringe benefits on inflated perks) which provides the sharp operators in the market too much scope for graft and scurrilous behaviour. Indeed even some lobbying is effectively tax deductible and scurrilous and certain types of unnecessary advertising which seem wrought with inflated costs such as ridiculously high salaries in that sector for backhanders to be paid. As I am sure most are aware GST taxes the added value all businesses aim for to facilitate their trading and sustainability, and is therefore a tax that levies and is closely reflective of the value of the services provided by Government that empowers the marketplace. As noted above much of the GST yield accrues because there is no GST on wages claimed (then income tax is added) and that component is therefore a tax on business activities under another name. The market is empowered by numerous physical externalities such as roads and security extending to education, health and includes the bureaucratic asylum that is charged with running the conundrum. The complexity even extends to expensive and distorting attempts to address equality and social cohesion requiring accommodation supplements, working for families and other aspects of welfare and the transfer of wealth. There is constant discussion and discontent about the range of pay inequality and differences in access to opportunity which in my opinion depicts a failure of policy leading to the expansion of the the big brother or nanny state paradigm and its associated costs. While I agree the complexity of achieving balance in the welfare system via a transfer of wealth especially as it relates to the future of work and demographics is a huge challenge I would argue the only way forward is much less complexity and I believe the transaction tax system described can set the direction. I am sure it is recognised by most that businesses and investments (+ excises and various Govt. services) produce all tax revenue simply because it describes the mechanisms of capital and trade for the purpose of 64 providing sustenance and progress. The costs of externalities and services to the community as organised by the Government are thereby afforded by the ability to trade or in old speak conduct commerce. If we were to opt for a rational solution to reduce complexity, compliance and market distortions for businesses it seems to me something like the transaction tax described is the only logical approach. As I am sure it is widely understood and not just theoretically, the simple truth is that money only realises its value when it is spent. If Joe Blogger earns a million dollars or leverages the other bastions of the smoke and mirrors of inequality that the law allows for (and thereby encourages) such as undeserved wealth through tax free gambling or tax free gains on speculation, and let's not forget criminal activity such as robbery or drug dealing (if they get away with it long enough), but then alas poor Joe Blogger pops his clogs the following day he has not realised any value for his efforts such as buying a lotto ticket or purchasing a gun. But then if Joe or his beneficiaries had invested those (laundered) funds and derived a income presently they are subject to progressive income taxes peaking at 33 cents in the dollar( at $83k) so the leverage his activities profit from and the value extracted from the marketplace have a profit margin of 67% (after $83k). Nice work if you can get it, that is sitting on one's chuff thinking up the next scam or legalised theft to participate in. It seems we are forced to ignore the smoke and mirrors of the bastions of inequality such as lotto and gambling or profiteering, rackets, grand larceny, graft and all the other perks and baubles such as expense account deductibles which are not to be levied by Inland Revenue or the "game and slaughter" might cease to yield to the already disgustingly rich. And this is all facilitated through the smoke and mirrors as afforded (though unaffordable) through crap governance because the complexity of deciphering who is stealing what ever amounts that are excessive in terms of the services they provide and the overall good they provide for the community is empowered by tax law courtesy of Government. Inequality anyone? Social unrest anyone?? Maybe crime as a career would be good for our future when jobs are due to be decimated by automation. Maybe a UBI will fix the crime related to desperation and motivate the no hopers as we stumble into over population in the 21st century. One can only wonder as to the results of the inertia and denial of those who would be King until such time as there is nothing to be King of nothing The payments of cash in the ever expanding under the table economy of course avoids tax issues nicely thank you very much and is a distortion the system shows a perverse tendency to encourage because "cashies" and backhanders (e.g. such as lawn mowing, cleaning and domestic maintenance) are an efficient form of business requiring no compliance. The fact the IRD periodically threaten to clamp down on the mainly domestic cash transfers for services, so sometimes look for someone to make an example of (and sometimes destroy their lives) does little to arrest the problem and meanwhile the banks seem to specialise in grand larceny, price fixing, racketeering and fraud. The increasing use of electronic payments and this simplified user pays tax system can help to address those issues through transparency and we could then possibly evolve to operate a Government sponsored simple tax paid voucher system in the domestic services market reducing the functionality of cash which could help address issues around potential job losses and welfare. I personally have concerns when we speak about a UBI (to replace welfare services) in terms of incentives to work and fairness so would be unlikely to be convinced by conceptual details, though reducing the bureaucratic asylum would be the only upside in my opinion. So I maintain a transaction tax as recommended here can reduce bureaucracy both in the collection of taxes and the welfare system through the concept of a pre taxed Govt supplied voucher system If we are then to consider the implications of taxing capital yields I believe we can treat it exactly the same where high earnings and low costs yield higher flat rate tax returns and losses to the capital base is not necessarily a concern to Government aside the provision of essential services and production. I think the various examples of Govt. bailouts of distressed operations such as Southern Cross Finance and refinancing of Air New Zealand are pertinent in this context. So to consider this type of system as a potentially rational solution I have concluded with an indulgent diatribe of historical or some might say hysterical evidence dating back to the dark ages for moving toward such a innovation in taxation. While you may or may not read or agree with this view of history it is almost beside the point except to say there must be change for the sake of our sanity and survival. While leaving the implications to macro economics aside at this point I believe unbalanced capitalism 65 particularly in the 21st century is proving itself to be extremely unsustainable and destructive to the wider challenges such as climate change, job losses, health and inequality so all of society and our future as a race. I note Walls St is busy trying to corner the market for Lithium and Cobalt supplies to sell the shares that will leverage the sales return for the speculator's dividends which will likely impede the uptake of electric vehicles. The only nail in the foot of their largess is Chile who I believe have nationalised their substantial reserves but of course the CIA may try to overthrow the Chilean Govt. If that scenario manifests or a similar unbalanced power play occurs in the market as orchestrated by those who worship at the altar of capitalism while the evangelicals shout their hymn to the American dream, greed is God, then I believe the only remedy is a wooden stake to the heart of the vampires on Wall St., silver bullets for the were wolves of London, a fire extinguisher for the Chinese dragon, a aspirin for the Nikkie????? oh and a sausage for the Aussis and maybe New Zealand could lead with innovation in taxation as a balancing influence. I strongly believe the evolvement of capitalist tax systems around the world and the associated law are a relic from the dark ages having evolved through centuries of rule and domination by an aristocracy and via the further evolution of distorted ethics and greed has resulted in it's modern equivalent the noveau aristocracy, an extremely powerful financial elite. In my opinion the excesses, market failures and decades of skullduggery as mismanaged throughout history by numerous governing bodies both Capitalist and Communist, (before and after Glasnost exhibiting the failure of the Marxist utopian fantasy and China's rise to power) is epitomized by the "Greed is Good" mantra from Wall St. I believe most would agree since the eighties the American brand of winner takes all capitalism has been substantively underpinned by neo liberal deregulation (e.g. the Glass Spiegle Act) and even CIA orchestrated domination of some foreign Governments so I consider the 2008 GFC to simply be the most recent manifestation of this history of greed and dysfunction. I also believe most would agree aside GINI coefficients, adverse events, bull and bear markets and so on, this imbalance is convincingly linked to inequality, high costs and low pay rates resulting in serious levels of poverty even in New Zealand, the luckiest country in the world, where as poverty in other countries can mean starvation and death. Would you like tea with your totalitarianism everyone or do you need alchohol and drugs to survive it ? In my opinion these errant tax concepts cause much distortion in the markets such as consumer prices and falsely justify large imbalances in earning potential including high returns on investments. All around the world we see the negative results of extreme inequality undermining social cohesion as a major catalyst for unrest and violent struggles as various systems continue to line the pockets of those in positions of power and influence such as banking, financial services and politics which in turn push the earnings expectations of all professionals and business owners. Then there is the smoke and mirrors and extreme illogic as is blatantly evident in the fact proceeds of gambling and large prize packages are untaxed. The level of some Lotto prizes could just about rescue some small Nations from poverty and as a bastion and excuse for the irrationality of inequality manifests as an evil abomination. The fact that a individual can become outrageously rich based on spending a few dollars and the fall of a few balls underpins the carefully cultivated raw prawn that inequality is normal and fully supported by Govt policy. As noted above the issue is further confounded by the perverse reverse psychology of progressive income taxes, i.e. very high earnings are justified because an individual pays a elevated amount of tax. The interesting proof of this is those costs are transferred to consumer pricing (another form of taxation) making the costs of many services and particularly professional services outrageously high and unaffordable so the many disadvantages of not being well educated or well heeled are reinforced. The real measure of wealth is the "take home pay" as it compares to the cost of living and the ability to save. It seems we are constantly embroiled in arguments and controversies as to levels and details of tax policy followed by discontent over the outcomes by those not favoured generally defined as business verses workers or left and right over the changes enacted by the factions. Tax systems being the mechanics of Government funding are at the core of the ideological schism between styles of capitalism as promoted by the wealthy and communism as the deeply flawed reaction to oppression and inequality where the opposing systems are a reflection of the ideologies and philosophies concerning freedom and human rights as they relate to the balance of incentive and reward. This idealistic schism in my opinion has been instrumental in 66 so much conflict and death so the continuing greed and domination need to be suppressed and economies balanced as related to efficiency and equality. It seems to me the ridiculous complexity masquerading as sound economics is proffered by a traditionally conservative financial establishment which tolerates large distortions in derived incomes and certain excesses of production and consumerism at a severe cost to the environment (e.g. cars and plastics). These settings favouring the already wealthy appear to result in excessive leverage often wielded like a weapon in the marketplace and disproportionately enabled by the taxpayer funded externalities as controlled by Governments. While it might be argued a type of balance and progress is achieved in the long run as had evolved at various stages of the industrial revolution, capitalism is now trending towards a precipice through bubbles and bull runs in the markets marked by excesses of profiteering particularly on Wall St as derived through false instruments of doom such as derivatives and the hype of investing . These marketplace discombobulations are enabled by law and substantively it's relationship to tax law, ie the Greed is God given right to tax the population not only via Te Tari Taake but through a concentration of wealth and power that taxes through consumer prices. But enough about the history and futility of wasted taxes and Governmental bureaucracy gone mad, the question is will we evolve common sense policy such as the leveling influence of a GST style of tax in a workable efficient and logical form. Please excuse my sarcasm though it is appropriate to treat such governance with the disdain it deserves. The difficulty with moving to a substantially more user pays paradigm such as a transaction tax is confounded by the the law firstly and the settings to provide enough revenue to start a leveling of income taxes and I am confident the differential in the collected sales tax and the claimable on receipts is the only rational way to achieve it. As noted all revenue is sourced through business activity or gambling or crime. The fact only the claimable rate of a flat tax transaction tax concept is deductible will I believe surreptitiously cause a lowering of the extremes of remuneration. If we agree that all taxes are afforded by business or enterprises legal or otherwise leveraging the market as provided for by Government is there any real point in the insane complexity of the present system which is another cost and thereby another unnecessary distortion for business and Government to decipher and as noted above as quoted in the brief to the green paper 3-4% of GDP and $2.5 billion to SME's. If there is a serious flaw or distortion in this system then I cannot see it and as mused, simplicity and transparency could be a catalyst to make the world a more rational peaceful and progressive enterprise even assisting to preserve and guarantee our survival.

In provinces like Marlborough which has very little produce grown in the area and the vegetables, fruit etc. are shipped in to the region which makes it very expensive compared to city and areas that grow large amounts of produce. 2). A sugar tax is a waste of time unless it is about 300%especially when comparing a sugary fizzy drink which can be purchased in the supermarkets for as little a $1.50 for 2 litres how do raise the tax on that to equal a 2 litre of Milk. 3). Churches should be paying tax on income just like all business’s in NZ. It is a cash business and is it fair to penalize other business because they are not preaching the bible to a lot of gullible people. Income is Income no matter where it comes from and is taxable for all, not non taxable for the chosen few. thank you reading this Regards Linda Grace \[1\] \[1\] 68 From:Community Foundations of NZ CFNZ Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 5:08 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Submission to the Tax Working Group I am submitting on behalf of Community Foundations of NZ, representing as a membership organisation about 20 community foundations across NZ. We are part of an international network of charitable foundations. LOSS OF IMPUTATION CREDITS The issue we have, along with a large number of charitable organisations within New Zealand is that we are unable to recover imputation credits earned on investments in New Zealand companies. Because our members are tax exempt charities they have no income tax with which to offset their imputation credits. As a result, imputation credits are lost. The imputation credit regime was set up so that taxpayers would pay tax at their own final tax rate rather than being taxed twice, once at the company level and again at the individual level. This system works well unless the taxpayer is tax exempt. Apart from charities effectively paying income tax, even though they are tax exempt, the imputation credits situation also encourages charities to invest in a way that concentrates their portfolio risk - for example by investing in a commercial building, rather than a listed property trust. When the tax system drives investment decisions the result is sub-optimal for the charitable sector. Community Foundations of New Zealand submits that charities be able to recover imputation credits earned through their investments in tax paying New Zealand companies. Many thanks Chris Milne Board Member, Community Foundations of NZ \[1\] 69 From:Andrew Phillips Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 5:02 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Re: Thank you: Future of tax submission I have a further submission in relation to business income of charities. I generally support the introduction of a tax on business income, that takes into account that charities may be building investment over multiple years. I also consider there should be an exemption built in for iwi groups, recognising the unique position of treaty settlement charities seeking to achieve redress for historical grievances and build long term sustainability. Most charities however, that seek to generate funds through either investment or business, should pay tax on income to the extent to which they do not either (1) pay taxes for their charitable purposes, or (2) demonstrate how they are saving for a future charitable purpose. A possible alternative is introducing imputation type credits for business tax charities (as suggested by Talia Smart in her Robin Oliver award winning presentation), seems reasonably sensible. This would incentivise the charities using funds towards their charitable purposes. Charities already have to separate out their business activities for any overseas spending, or FBT reasons, so this shouldn't be too onerous for most charities, and perhaps a de minimis to reduce impact on entities like Op Shops, and charity fundraising activities (that would generally be donated entirely to charities in any case). A review of s tats on the Charities Register shows a number of entities who do not spend funds on charitable purposes directly. I consider this is also a good opportunity to look carefully at the potential review into charitable purposes, and ensure that the tax exemptions are appropriate. The 2001 Tax Working Paper on tax and charities could be revisited in this respect. This may be necessary to ensure that entities that submit that their business activities themselves are charitable can be adequately dealt with. It would be sensible to have a review of all the current exemptions and consider whether they are all appropriate for this day and age, particularly the broader CW exemptions beyond charitable and amateur sporting bodies.

We need to avoid taxing income where possible, and seek to tax wealth, to reduce inequality and more effectively redistribute income and support investment in socially responsible business. Currently, the wealth of the country/world is being concentrated in a smaller and smaller group of hands, this is supported by the broad based tax regime that does not touch wealth, and instead focuses on income. Tinkering as what appears to be proposed by the tax working group is not enough. Although I recognize the political difficulties in attempting to do anything more substantive, the reality is that social problems are only likely to grow. This may be covered later in the submissions, but I do consider the purpose of a tax regime should be beyond ensuring the revenue is supplied, but further focus on creating a more equal society - vertical and horizontal equity seem sensible starting points.

Change in treatment of Interest Background - Financial and Social Problems in NZ There are several issues in New Zealand Society that need attention. Among them are:- The rising cost of housing in relation to income, particularly in Auckland and expanding cities such as Tauranga · A general lack of savings in the economy leading to families being unprepared for adverse events · Investment in productive assets restricted by lack of local capital leading to trend for overseas investors to take over NZ companies · Severe trade imbalance after taking account of financial transactions · Increasing level of private debt to overseas holders · Growing calls for a capital gains tax · Concern about the effect on society of the current level of inequality Common to the cause of many of these problems is the low rate of saving in our society so that · people are looking to start a family or a household without significant savings accumulated over previous years · the supply of capital in New Zealand is inadequate to ensure that the proportion of productive assets in New Zealand ownership does not decline as the country develops Common misperception in considering the problem Part of the problem relates to a common misperception of the effects of inflation. I refer to the belief that inflation brings capital gains to asset holders. In fact, inflation itself alone does not bring capital gains, because the real value of the asset is not going up, it is the value of the measuring unit that is going down. What inflation does is to bring capital losses to the holders of monetary assets. This loss provides a significant disincentive to save. It is this effect that underlies much of the feeling that a capital gains tax is needed. Of course, some assets rise much faster than the inflation rate and it can be argued that there should be supplementary systems to tax that additional gain Capital Gains Tax Option The rapid rise in housing and the concern about inequality have led to increasing calls for a capital gains tax. For a number of reasons that I will not enumerate here, a capital gains tax is of limited benefit in achieving the objective of slowing asset price rises, reducing inequality in the society, or gaining significant tax revenue in relation to the costs and difficulties of administration. Alternative Solution I set out below a proposal I put to the Minister of Finance in and email in September 2013. A reply from Treasury gave some arguments against it which I did not believe were of consequence in relation to the benefits. \[1\] 73 Rather than an extension the aspects of the tax system design to tax capital gains tax, a significant improvement in several areas of public policy and social effect could be achieved by making the first 2% of any interest received non-assessable, and the first 2% of any interest paid non-deductible. Two percent is an appropriate figure because this is the average of the government’s target of 1 to 3% for inflation. The government target should be used since this a statement of the government’s policy for the decline in the value of the monetary unit and because a calculation based on projected or actual figure would add an undesirable complexity to the system. Such a change would recognise that the part of interest received represents a recovery of a capital loss and so should not be taxed. Similarly, that part of interest paid by a borrower relates to the benefit received due to the decline in value of the monetary unit and they should not receive an additional benefit by being able to deduct that portion of the interest paid against income. Financial institutions would have little difficulty in creating programmes that would provide a split between assessable and non-assessable interest on their yearly statements of interest. I believe that such a change in the tax policy would be relatively easy to implement and administer as compared to alternative reforms and be very positive both politically and socially. Its beneficial psychological effect on behaviour could exceed its technical impact. Benefits · Recognise that monetary investments suffer a capital loss equivalent to inflation and that the interest return equal to that loss should not be taxed · Recognise that the incentives to save in our society need to be increased and provide a psychological incentive to do so · Be a credible alternative to an expansion of the areas where increases in nominal value are subject to an effective capital gains tax · Provide a benefit to small savers whose savings are often in the form of deposits in banks, that earn a low rate of interest · Not add to the costs of home owners with a non-deductible mortgage, yet add a small additional cost to those who have borrowed to buy housing for investment purposes · Make company structures with high debt slightly less attractive. It would add about .6% to the effective interest rate as decided by the Reserve Bank from time to time, · Be an equitable policy between savers and investors since it recognises the change in the value of the monetary unit It may be argued that this would represent a disincentive to borrow and invest. But for a normally financed trading company the change in total costs would be small and effectively represent just a .6% increase in the interest rate on the amount of debt owed (assuming a 30% tax rate). It would bear more heavily on property investment operations because they tend to be more highly geared, but that discouragement to property investment would be a desirable effect of such a change. It may be argued that this change would bear heavily on highly leveraged farmers. However, it represents an increase of only .6% in the cost of the first 2% of the interest – a change that is well within the range of variations in financing cost that ought to be expected over any interest rate cycle. Some small disincentive to the current high gearing of many farmers would be an advantage. The balance of effect on the public finances would be close to neutral, but, even if it is negative, the benefits are likely to outweigh the costs. 2. Company Tax Commission on Paye Deductions Background Factors  There have been comments that the rate of company tax in New Zealand should be reduced to improve the competitive position of NZ companies compared to those domiciled overseas or who are able to organise their affairs so that they are taxed in countries with a lower tax rate; 74  A casual view of the profits of companies in New Zealand shows that there are often very large profits being made by companies that employ few staff:  The trend of legislation has been to add greatly to the costs, complications and liabilities of employers of workers and so entrepreneurial activity that employs few workers becomes more attractive, as does the contracting out of any necessary labour force to the detriment of working conditions;  The problems associated with a workforce, including the necessary reporting to the IRD with compulsory deductions for such things as fines, child support, student loans, together with the increased liability under health, safety and other legislation bear particularly heavily on small employers;  Percentage payments for the collection of money or for its prompt payment are common in commerce. Proposal That as an alternative to a reduction in the company tax rate or a reduction in tax on smaller companies or as a justified initiative on its own, the government should allow an employer deducting Paye etc from its employees to retain a percentage of the deduction to compensate for the work involved, the liabilities incurred and also by way of a contribution to the public benefit of creating employment in small enterprises. A figure of 5% would be reasonable and an upper limit of, say, a percentage yield to the company of, say, $2000 per month could be instituted. Transport to Work Background  Many firms provide transport for senior workers, often in a form that gives them the benefit of transport to work. Proposal Accept that the cost of travelling to work is a legitimate deduction from the income earned and allow any employer to reimburse any member of their staff what they believe is a fair estimate of the cost getting to the place of employer but with the provision of IRD guidelines. No additional payments would be allowed to those who have a vehicle already provided by the employer available for home- work transport John Strevens, I am happy to have any representative of the tax working groups contact me to discuss these proposals \[1\] 75 From:Colin Looser Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 4:48 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Tax Working Group, I strongly support a tax on carbon emissions as part of New Zealand's climate change response, with the proceeds going to help fund initiatives that will rapidly transition New Zealand to carbon-neutrality. I support the idea of new taxes to reduce environmental and social harms. Any such tax should be based on strong scientific evidence of the harm. Ideally the tax collected would cancel out the harm, by a) reducing the amount happening due to the increased cost, and b) by remediating the remaining harm. I'd prefer the tax to focus specifically on the particular harm (I believe this is "hypothecation" from the background paper). Ideally part of the tax would also fund regular measurement and reporting to ensure the harm is indeed being reduced. I'm not convinced about the downsides to hypothecation mentioned in the background paper: the Government could always choose to put money from general income taxes towards reducing the harm if the tax was insufficient or infeasible; spending the tax in "more worthy" areas may create an incentive to allow the harm to continue so that the tax can fund those areas. Specifically, for harm reduction, in addition to the carbon tax, I support some form of sugar tax, and some form of tax on nitrate pollution and any other pollution of our waterways. I'd support an investigation into whether plastic & packaging could be reduced using a tax.

There should be a review of the company tax rate with consideration given to introducing progressive rates that individuals face. Top end rates should be aligned with individuals and other entities. By entities I am referring to companies, trusts, partnerships etc. 2. Government approved pension schemes. Kiwisaver has been very successful since its introduction in order to get Kiwis to diversify themselves and save for retirement. Given that the contributions are all post tax there should be a special exemption or reduced rate of tax (10-15%) on the income that is generated from these schemes to their participants. 3. The recent introduction of the accounting income method is helpful but why not allow all tax payers who are not subject to PAYE to be able to pay tax as and when they can during that same tax year with a final wash up by 7 July (for 31 March tax payers) with no penalties or interest being levied. Late payments post this period should be subject to interest and penalties. 4. There is no point in a CGT or other wealth tax. The new extended bright line test should be given time. With kind regards David Willis \[1\] 78 From:Paul Jennings Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 4:42 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Hi, I would appreciate it if you would give consideration to the following comments regarding replacing the current income tax system with a wealth tax system. Facts for consideration:  FY17 Govt income tax was about $28b,  Total household net worth was about $1.65 trillion,  To replace the income tax revenue with a tax on net worth would be a tax rate of only 1.7%.  There is an increasingly large group of people who own many assets but pay little tax because the assets generate little net "income", whilst still hugely increasing net wealth (opinion: this seems to be grossly unfair) Pros:  It would make the vast majority of households (maybe >99%) better off,  This would make it more politically acceptable than a capital gains tax.  It would increase the disposable income of all income tax paying people without increasing business costs,  The people who are worth the most would pay the most, as opposed to the current income tax where only those earning "income" pay (and these people are not the most wealthy, even those on high salaries),  It would remove all income tax from any sources, including wage and salary tax, rental income tax, dividend tax, etc: the impact of this would be widespread and significant whilst not eroding the total NZ tax receipts,  It would automatically adjust for economic growth, thus requiring no adjustment of tax rate bands, etc,  It would be easy to understand and relatively easy to implement,  It would align a large section of tax revenues with the increasing unease in the world that the very wealthy are getting rich through asset growth without contributing to the public good,  People couldn’t hide wealth in company structures as this would tend to generate profits which would be taxed under the corporate tax structure.  The 1.7% tax rate wouldn’t be burdensome on many people (see below in “cons” for some discussion on this) Cons:  There are some people who have little income but considerable wealth (say in a family home) for whom it could be difficult to free up the cash required each year. The possible solution could lie in a sort of reverse mortgage type of product where banks lend these people the annual tax, and are repaid on eventual disposal of the asset.  Valuation of some assets could be contentious. Counter to this is that virtually every asset of material value owned by anyone currently has a mechanism for valuing it and so this shouldn’t be a big issue.  It could lead to hording of assets in secret (cash in the mattress or gold bars in the wardrobe anyone?). However, I’d say anyone who does this to avoid paying 1.7% tax probably has other issues that need addressing, so it probably wouldn’t be a big group.  It might lead to some of the very wealthy moving to Australia or elsewhere. I’m ok with that. If it is levied on all NZ residents, and all NZ citizens regardless of where they live, it’d probably work well. \[1\] 79 The point being, this would seem to be a far fairer and more rigorous taxation system than either today’s income tax or a capital gains tax, and yet no-one seems to be even considering it. There are probably good reasons, but I can’t see why it doesn’t seem to even be on the agenda for discussion. Thanks for your consideration of this discussion. I would be very happy to contribute further to the exploration and development of this idea if requested. 80 From:kate thompson Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 4:42 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on the future of tax Hello, I would like to please make a submission on the future of tax.

All policy should be judged against these words. comments; The tax working group should explore tax methods which will ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. I have read the Child Poverty Action submission and strongly support the aims: in particular: 'The future of tax should have a focus on children'. Our Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has stated that 'The Government is committed to supporting families and children'. The Child Poverty Action recommendations support this ideal. \[1\] \[1\] 83 Housing: I support the recommendation that 'The Government should set up an expert group to design a net equity housing tax'. The Government should consider a tax (‘health levy’) on sugary drinks. That the tax scale be more progressive by increasing tax rates on high personal income AND a more progressive system of personal tax thresholds. To help, correct the current system where low income earners pay a disproportionate amount of their incomes in income tax, GST, fuel and other excise taxes. GST of 15% is applied comprehensively, this should be offset by Working for Families and other tax credits. (see-personal tax thresholds). ‘Māori and Pacific have a much younger age structure than the total New Zealand population’ Comment: Māori and Pacific people die at a younger age than non-Māori/Pacific people. Inequality: See comments re progressive taxes. Retirement Savings: New Zealand has KiwiSaver, however low income families find it difficult to impossible to save. See tax thresholds, Working for Families. Taxes and behaviour: Taxes that are intended to modify behaviour should be considered with extreme care. Comment: The 2010 Law Commission Report and recommendations re 50% increase on alcohol was dismissed by the then government. The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act, 2012 failed to address the issue. 84 From:Colin Ratcliffe Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 3:53 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Part of my understanding of the proposed changes is to make the system "fairer". In light of this I just wish to comment on exactly that, and not necessarily the points that you offer for comment. My wife and I had worked for wages for over 40 years and have saved hard for our retirement. There have never been any opportunities to get any advantages from the TAX system. The previous government obviously had a taxation system designed to help the rich get richer (by being able to manipulate the system) and I have no solution on how to fix the problem, however;\_\_ I see so much going on around me that frustrates me. EXAMPLES:-- A person with a rental property is able to do work around their own house, say - - putting up a fence or getting windows cleaned, perhaps a bit of painting, replacement carpet etc. These can be a charge against the rental property. A builder can get his house painted, a new kitchen installed etc and it is a charge against his company We used to go out regularly for dinner with friends and one of them always used his business mastercard to pay for the meal. We have friends who have an accommodation business. They buy an new refrigerator, get some painting done to their own residence,and recarpet same, and most of their food and alcohol gets charged to the business. While all of this is going on , I imagine that they are able to claim back GST. (although I don't re ally know how GST works in claiming back) In all these examples above, because they charge against the business, this reduces the "declared" figure that they pay tax on. In the meantime if I buy a new refrigerator, get some painting done, recarpet etc (all of the above)I have to pay tax on my earnings before I "buy" these things and also have to pay the GST component.-----So all of these "people" are probably in the vicinity of being 40 or so cents in the dollar better off with so many of the things that they can do or buy. Another situation which I have heard of (OK it is only hearsay) but nevertheless is very believable/possible, is one where a young couple had their new house built by a large construction company which was owned by the parent of one of them, the company being large enough to absorb the total cost (or almost all) of the house. My wife's cousin is a builder and he built a holiday home down the sounds. You can bet your bottom dollar that most, if not all the materials were paid for by his business.( Neighbours-- same thing) People in bigger businesses can work the system even more. Jealous-- envious--- sour grapes--- I guess so, but there has to be a fairer way.

Signed Bruce Johnson \[1\] \[1\] 86 From:Ele Ludemann Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 3:36 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To the chair and members of the Tax Working Group, Dear All, My name is Elspeth Ludemann. I make this submission as an individual. As a general principle simpler taxes are better taxes. Simpler taxes reduce costs for the IRD and taxpayers by making it easier to administer and comply. Simpler taxes reduce loopholes. Revenue neutrality If the TWG recommends new taxes and tax hikes you should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets offsets gains from pay rises and allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. It would be fairer, and simpler if annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation were legislated. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. To encourage greater investment and growth in our productive sector, Government should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. A different tax rate for SMEs would give some businesses an advantage not available to their competitors. Any tax which encourages businesses to spend more time on working out how to avoid or minimise their payment rather than on running and growing their business is a bad tax. Expensing of capital \[1\] 87 The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. The Government has directed that any CGT would not apply to the family home. This would go against the principle of simplicity, reduce its effectiveness and increase both loopholes and potential for avoidance. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings The tax system should not discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I oppose any environmental tax. This would treat those whose with a light environmental footprint the same as those whose footprint is heavier. Any environmental cost should be carried by those who incur it and that is best dealt with by regional councils not through tax. I oppose any tax on water. However, should there be any taxes on water they should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries, users or uses of water. 88 As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. “Sin” taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. New Zealand’s GST is very simple, it should be kept that way. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. The tax has reached a point where it now incentivises criminals to steal tobacco. Yours sincerely, Elspeth Ludemann 89 From:Matt Kennedy Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 3:23 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission from a New Zealander living in Chile Hi all, While penning my submission on my phone, it turned out I had more than 1000 characters to say. Please feel free to contact me about any points I make—or anything else. I’m happy to play any part in the process. — My thoughts on what the future of tax in New Zealand should look like. I believe the following changes are required: 1) The introduction of some form of emissions taxation. The economy has to be forced into the realities that we live in a closed ecosystem and that there isn’t infinite room for growth and consumption. It’s a complex issue, but taxation I believe is most effective way of addressing it. Left to their own devices, companies will “green wash” and most consumers will be none the wiser. Everyone is more sensitive to prices than they are willing to deeply learn about environmental problems and boldly acting on them. So I think taxation is the way to go. 2) A robust approach to disincentivising property investment and speculation. Fewer things are more absurd than getting rich from making it harder for people to afford roofs over their heads. The capital tied up in property should be shepharded towards companies and innovation which might actually improve the wealth of all New Zealanders (through new jobs, R&D projects, and more business opportunities). Capital gains tax might address part of this, but I’m not sure it will go far enough. 3) Trusts and the likes should only offer legal benefits. Not tax benefits. It’s unacceptable that these can be used to hide wealth and income and as such help with tax avoidance. Especially as our current system is graduated, so for it to function correctly richer New Zealanders should be indeed be paying more tax. However richer New Zealanders are also best placed to afford exploring complex tax-shelter and property investment options to avoid paying a large chunk of this tax. In the case of trusts, this probably means the tax rates need to be the same as personal tax rates. Addressing company tax rates seems more complicated—but needs to happen also for this to be effective. 4) Addressing Global Citizenship. I’m writing this from Chile and living between the two countries tax jurisdictions has be incredibly complicated—and I’m certain I’m still not doing it right. These types of situations are becoming more and more common as more people travel and choose to stay overseas for longer periods of time. I think the Tax Residency timeframe needs reviewing (possibly shortened) and clearer resources provided to step you through tax implications of living overseas for stints. The numbers of “Digital Nomads” seem to be climbing annually as well—and I bet many aren’t paying tax in any jurisdiction. Futher, I think the Student Loan overseas processes are based on the notion that people who live overseas are earning big dollars. I’ve been overseas and effectively volunteering for stints (without earning much at all) yet I am expected to be repaying $3,000 each year. If I was in New Zealand I would be well below the minimum repayment threshold. 5) The future of money and agreements are already here. New Zealand needs to be leading the way with clear and straightforward acknowledgement and perhaps regulation of cryptocurrencies and related blockchain technologies. This is an incredibly exciting space for exploration and innovation. However \[1\] 90 exchanges in New Zealand seem to be on pause as banks are unwilling to work with technology which the Government hasn’t reviewed or acknowledged. There are also clearly many tax considerations to be made— it doesn’t seem right lumping cryptocurrency as “property” for tax purposes, like they’ve done in the United States. However if people are profiting from speculation, it only seems right to tax it as a form of income. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are another taxation area which needs further deliberation and clarity provided. — Matthew Kennedy 91 From:Martin Butcher Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 3:10 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: The future of tax Hello, I am so sorry, I accidentally just sent you an incomplete submission. Here is the completed version. Here are my suggestions. 1.GST and capital goods - houses and other dwellings Apply GST in exactly the same way as with other goods and services. This will reduce the (pre GST) price of a house. There will be scope for refunding the GST: for every year you own the house up to five years IRD will refund three per cent (a fifth of the GST you paid). Or five percent for three years. The GST and the refund incentive can apply to householders and property investors alike. 2. Charities Remove tax exemptions from charities and remove the tax relief arising from donations. Many charities are not charitable and exist only to enrich their leaders and to provide them with resources (such as membership data-banks and -bases) by which crimes (scams and so on) may be facilitated. If a charity is worth Government money (effectively by way of tax exemptions) then the Government can instead pay that charity directly. At present, tax exemptions encourage misuse of charity resources; an example: Your charity has a membership data-base and you hire someone to use the data-base to obtain details from members, or you sell access to the data-base to a mail order outfit. Further, IRD involvement will mean that a charity will be scrutinised more aggressively than by auditors (who may have close ties to the charity). And IRD involvement may help bring to light some of the rampant abuse of volunteers that occurs in many New Zealand charities. Tax exemptions assist in this abuse.

Firstly I fully support the proposal to “ring fence” the tax treatment of investment properties. Secondly if a CGT is to be introduced it must include owner-occupied properties otherwise the continual investment bias to property will remain and disadvantage those who invest in productive assets such as shares and other assets. By exempting owner-occupied properties people will be incentivised to over capitalise their investment in their home rather than other productive assets. As an example one person may purchase a dwelling twice the average value (say $1,000,000) for that locality and enjoy significant capital gains over a period tax free, while another may purchase at the average value ($500,000) and invest the remaining $500,000 in other productive assets which would be subject to a CGT. The proposal to exempt the family home just perpetuates the bias towards unproductive property investments. If the family home is to be exempt, then maybe it should only be up to a certain value, say the average sale price for that area.

(addresses 'low income cash flow' issue, p.48 Submissions Background Paper, last paragraph) - the CG tax liability of owners of exempted land can be 'forgiven'. (addresses 'owner-occupier' exemption per TWG Terms of Reference) Reasons for support of a CGT: I support a CGT on all land (but not the improvements on the land) that can be bought and sold (is tradable) because: - it taxes wealth increases which are not currently captured - it is fairer to those who do not own land property yet pay tax on their alternative investments (investment tax equity) Proposed Mechanism: The "Capital Gains Tax Liability Mortgage" or CGTLM - A CGTLM would be attached to all land titles and be payable to Inland Revenue by the land owners at the prevailing interest rate. - Typically, the mortgage amount would be updated by the capital gain when revaluations are done by regional councils. - The CG mortgage is repaid with regular installments like a normal mortgage and settled in full when change of ownership occurs. - Payment of the CG mortgage by owners of exempted land would be forgiven.

When IRD makes a mistake, and they have admitted mistakes in my case in the District Court which I won against IRD, they refuse to pay compensation or make right the wrongs they have caused. The Judge made it clear I did not owe ANY tax. IRD said $300,000 plus. IRD refused to honour the Judge. My home was taken and sold at mortgagee sale due to IRD's lack of ability to correct their errors and deceit on their part to cover up. 3. In the past we have seen commit suicide over IRD mistakes. In my case my brother had a serious car accident at the time IRD raided his home. 4. We have had begrudgingly paid $550,000 years after the fact, and they lost years of their life and New Zealand lost jobs and growth in the economy. 5. The onus of proof needs to be reversed. Innocent until proven guilty but at the moment not if the IRD says you are guilty. This is against Human Rights treaties signed by New Zealand. 6. IRD needs to pay compensation as soon as possible to people. 7. Any other rules the Tax Working Group makes are useless without attention to my submission. Taking money illegally is not the kiwi way to run a country. 8.

Tax avoidance deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. The Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated that the lack of tax transparency is a global problem that needs a global solution. Governm ents must act together to force this system to end. Countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system. This will be most easily done through a new UN- based (an intergovernmental) global tax body. A UN Tax body will ensure all countries participate on an equal footing and ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax as a key step towards a coherent global system and level the playing field leading to more transparency and a better business environment. Therefore, I believe the Tax Working Group should extend the remit of its recommendations to Cabinet to examine New Zealand’s role and responsibility to fix the global tax system by advocating for a UN tax body. More information on why a UN tax body will benefit everyone can be found here . Please, do not hesitate in contacting me may you require any further information regarding this submission. Finally, I would like to tha nk the working group for this opportunity to speak up about the future of Aotearoa/New Zealand and I wish you all the best in your efforts. Kind regards, Artur Francisco \[1\] \[1\] 103 From:Janine Boyden Sent: Monday, 30 April 2018 1:00 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I only have one submission and it is around rental property. I believe that if you are to pay tax at the time you make a profit you should conversely be able to claim a loss at the time you make a loss. In a time we are constantly told nz rental stock is cold, damp etc etc why would you tell landlords they are not allowed to claim their repairs & maintenance expenses. I believe though, if you have borrowed large to purchase a rental house you should not be able to claim the mortgage interest as an expense. You cannot claim the principal so why not apply to the same to interest. This may help with getting rental houses out of investors and into 1 st home owners.

I would prefer contact by e-mail so am not including any other contact details for the moment. No parts of my submission raise privacy concerns. Summary: \* Support a broad capital gains tax on property, think we can design a decent system with reference to all the other systems out there - think it’s clear many people are investing with the assumption of capital gain despite claims to the contrary - fair chance effect on house prices will not be that great considering other non-tax issues that arise - needed to remove unfair and harmful incentives for property investment - will likely also reduce extreme amounts of negative gearing some people are taking on and the flow on risks to NZ economy - do not believe our current regime is necessary or even beneficial to the problems we do face like building more houses \* May only be fair if it also applies to shares and other investment - need to carefully consider the fairness and effects of any implementation considering the exclusion of owner-occupied homes \* Strongly suspect capital losses should only be offset against capital gains, but not something I’ve considered in detail - as with most things the group will consider, a matter of ‘least worst’ or ‘least unfair’ \* Group should consider as far as practicable given limits of the terms of reference, the issue of the owner- occupied exclusion, in consideration of what to recommend to the government such as a future enquiry \* Support land tax. - do not think has to be in opposition to CGT although interaction and also with rates needs to be considered - have not considered in detail since find it a far less likely outcome than a CGT, whatever the recommendation \* As far as possible within terms of reference, group should consider profit shifting and effects of digital economy and how to try and mitigate them - do not think we should only be a follower, worth being a leader if we have good reason to think it may be worthwhile \* Need to come up with solution for GST on online purchases - loss to government revenue - unfairness to local retailers, even if the effect on them may often be exaggerated and it's far from a solution to the problems they face - look at Australia and other countries and other proposals from experts \[1\] 106 \* Strongly opposed to further complexities to GST by reducing or exempting certain items - bureaucratic nightmare with significant compliance cost - perverse outcomes like benefiting something which is clearly luxury over something which is basically essential - plenty of examples worldwide such as classic Jaffa cake one - although something imperfect may be worthwhile, clear that it's not the case here - better to adjust thresholds and rates for income tax, and benefits so that people can choose for themselves where to spend the money even accepting we may not agree on some of those decisions \* Support careful consideration whether other parts of tax system should be adjusted to better target problem of income-inequality \* Support existing pigovian taxation like alcohol and tobacco taxes \* Support other pigovian taxes such as sugary drink tax if there is sufficient evidence or it's carefully monitored - many risks if not careful, similar to GST problems \* Support environment taxes with sufficient evidence or careful monitoring - many systems are poorly designed so great care is needed \* Group needs to carefully consider the perverse incentives in our system and how to deal with them - lack of fringe benefit tax to parking spots obvious example + especially compared to better benefits like for public transport + even without comparison clearly flawed \* Significant challenges posed by 'gig' economy and 'sharing' economy - we already have tax evasion problems especially with tradespeople - greater resources are being put into this which is good especially given fairness + need to take care not to go too far and harm people unnecessarily - need to ensure tax evasion isn’t a significant problem with these new trends whether intentionally or unintentionally \* Existing tax avoidance by the well-off needs to be considered - minimise as much as is fair and practical + do not penalise people for reasonable decisions, even those done to avoid tax - consider use of trusts \* Consider as far as possible within your terms of reference the superannuation and its long-term sustainability - poses significant dangers to our tax system - system was not prepaid for a long time + even after Super Fund was introduced, payments only lasted until another government decided to ignore the issue - doesn't seem to be any way we can make up for not prepaying it in the past + with current trends, hard to imagine how we will sustain current system of high payments without means or asset testing just from future taxes \* Retirement saving incentives need to be carefully studied and improved - even with current superannuation system, people need significant retirement savings \* Wealth tax may work in an ideal world where it's common but will likely just be avoided - study only if sure that's good use of time compared to alternatives 107 \* Do not think progressive company tax good idea - compliance costs, complexities and perverse incentives - start-up tax may have more merit but also likely a bad idea \* Don't introduce excessive complexity to tax system - especially on personal level, but also company level - comparison with other systems shows clear advantages of our system in many cases Main submission: Kia ora, I believe there are currently major problems with the taxation of property in NZ. It seems clear that many people, despite their public instances to the contrary are actually banking on a capital gain. Evidence from this would be the large number of people not even making money from their investment property initially given the costs especially of servicing their mortgage, compared to their rental income. As we know enables them to use these losses to reduce their income tax. There is a proposal to ring fence losses which will limit this (although those with multiple properties and most of those who invest long term will still be able to do so) but even if this is implemented we still have the wider issue. Is it really the case that these people are only buying the property for their future rental income? As said, I find it hard to believe this is really the case for all or even most of those doing so. The proposed increases in the bright line rule may help to reduce speculation. But it will not completely deal with the fact people are incentivised to buy property for the untaxed capital gain. I appreciate that stronger capital gains taxes have not prevented rapid price rises in quite a number of other jurisdictions. I'm not convinced the evidence exists that proves they don't work. As with all things of this sort, a key problem is we cannot know what the situation would be like without the tax. I particularly do not believe the evidence exists that they make things work, provided the system is well implemented. With all the evidence and examples out there, I believe we can design a system which works. I do not think this will miraculously solve the problem we are facing of house prices many times the median income. I'm not even sure it will make a big dent particularly in the short term. But if it removes the unfair and harmful incentives for property investment compared to other forms of often better investment, this will be a desirable outcome. To be clear, I do not believe that property investors are somehow 'evil' or 'bad'. I simply think that our system which gives excessive benefit to them is wrong. While I do not deny cultural issues are also likely a big factor, it's recognised that obtaining capital in the NZ market is difficult not only because of our small size but also because a lot of capital is headed towards property. And often not towards the construction of new property but purchase of existing ones. (Some may be spent on upgrades.) I do not think the property investment climate in NZ is necessary or even conducive to building new homes on greenfield sites, or even to some extent infill house. While we will need investment for these, I think a different system will be far more conducive to it. Besides the problem companies face from getting investments due to our captivation with property, the way a lot of property investment happens with incredible amounts of gearing means that it's easily possible for there to be major problems if there is enough of a fall in house prices. We've seen this in many other jurisdictions when the proverbial 'bubble' bursts. While there may be reasons this is unlikely here in NZ, as it's clear we are still significantly short on housing stock, it's another sign of the problem with our current climate. Some people suggest that changing our system in this way may precipitate such a collapse. I find this unlikely with a well designed carefully implemented system. And if it were true I’d argue it’s evidence of how flawed our system is. 108 I recognise that if an almost universal capital gains tax is implemented on property, it may only be fair it also applies to shares or any other investment. In NZ, we already have the situation where companies tend to pay more dividends (which are already taxed) than overseas and capital gains tend to be lower. So, the effect of this is likely to be reduced. I do think the group needs to consider careful how to deal with the fact that owner-occupied homes will not be subject to any CGT, and how this interacts with any CGT on shares or other investments and whether some adjustment will need to be made for this to produce the fairest outcome as possible that is still in accordance with the terms of reference (ToR). Considering for example, someone who does decide to rent for all their lives for whatever reason will potentially be subject to a CGT on all their capital gains. Whereas someone who does buy a owner-occupied home will not be. I do believe that preventing capital losses being offset against other income is very likely the best choice although I admit it's not something I studied a great deal. I recognise this will be unfair to some people, but as with so many things, and pretty much everything you are considering, I think it's a matter of what's the least worst or least unfair option. In relation to the terms of reference, I do not understand whether you are allowed to consider the effects of a CGT on owner occupied homes in any fashion. If you are, I do ask that you consider it as far as possible with due consideration of your ToR and the time you have available. The reason do so would be as far as possible for you include any conclusions in your report. For example, mentioning it as something which should be considered in the future with reasons why. (If you would only be allowed to mention a further enquiry with limited reasoning given, the time spent should be reduced accordingly although the interaction with your other recommendations would need to be considered.) I recognise that given the way home ownership is seen in NZ, this always going to be incredibly controversial. For better or worse, we are different from places like Germany where it's far more common for people to live long term in the same rental housing. And so home ownership is often seen as important for stability and security. But I do not think we should completely shy away from the hard questions if we don’t have to. On a land tax, I do feel there is likely significant merit to the idea. I'm not sure it has to be in opposition to a capital gains tax although the interaction of the two along with council rates will need to be carefully considered. I admit I find it unlikely it will be implemented even if it is recommended or if it is specifically offset by some reduction to mean no new revenue collection. Or if it is it will be in an incredibly reduced form likely limiting its effectiveness even more than the exemption to owner-occupied homes. For that reason, I have considered it less. I do understand and agree that the group will recommend what you think is best regardless of such considerations but on an issue like this, it’s likely you will also mention alternatives. I do have significant concerns over both profit shifting and the complexities the digital economy pose to our tax system. It seems fundamentally unfair how little tax MNCs often pay on profit that is primarily being generated in NZ. And with the digital economy, this is something that smaller companies, are doing as well. I think we not only need to look carefully at any system overseas and follow them, we should also look carefully at research and proposals and be willing to be first if necessary. I will not comment further since I understand much of this is outside your ToR but ask that you consider it as far as possible. I do believe we have to come up with some solution for GST on overseas purchases. Beyond the amount the government is losing, it's clearly perverse that a big multinational like Amazon has lower prices, at least in part because for low value items there will be no GST (or duties). I recognise that our tiny size and the 109 compliance costs involved and the other complexities especially with companies like those in China who'd be much less willing to voluntarily comply with any law we design make this quite difficult. Still I think we need to do something. I do not believe that this is the only reason, or even the primary reason why many New Zealand companies are struggling. It's clear many of these companies have handled the move to internet purchases poorly. And there are clearly a lot of other issues e.g. postal rates that can apply for items being sent from China vs sending in NZ due to the nature of the international system, low wage economies and those with significantly reduced standards etc. Yet despite all this, I do think it is important we improve the current situation where purchases often up to $400 from overseas are effectively exempt from GST. For guidance, we can look at Australia and other countries, as well as recommendations from economists and others who have studied the issue. The consultation with Minister of Finance suggests that this is already being looked at but it may still be worthwhile considering in more detail depending on what is planned. I do not believe introducing exemptions or a reduced rate of GST for certain items is a good idea. (I’m not quite sure if reducing the rate for certain goods is outside your ToR. While there are differences, I do not consider the difference between an item zero-rated for GST and a reduced rate are significant enough to matter. So, I will consider them together. If you are only allowed to recommend a zero-rating or exemption, this makes no difference to my submission.) As has been seen in other countries, such policies tend to be a bureaucratic nightmare with massive compliance costs. They make the system much more difficult to administer both for the government, and for stores and others who collect GST. They can lead to court cases and silly disputes in trying to decide which category something fits in. And they have perverse outcomes. For example, a common suggestion is to exclude fresh food. Yet this means someone buying a $1000 imported Japanese Kobe steak benefits significantly more than someone buying a $8 NZ Rump steak. While GST is by nature generally regressive, this is undesirable. Especially since the $300 spent on a laptop by someone on the benefit, for their child's education or work will be taxed as normal even though this may be almost as essential as the food. As per my earlier points, I do not believe additional complexities or alternatives to define luxury vs essential will work. Instead they will increase cost for little gain and still result in perverse outcomes. If you include computers or tablets, you again get weirdness like an expensive gaming computer or mining computer being exempted. You’d then find other stuff that is essential since a lot of stuff is almost essential in the right environment. If conversely you tried to define what an essential computer is even ignoring the bureaucratic nightmare you’d find your definition includes a lot which aren’t essential but includes a lot which aren’t since what’s essential is going to vary a lot from person to person. As an example, on a related issue, if GST is removed from unprepared fresh food but applies to prepared food, defining prepared food is a lot more difficult than it seems. More important, while preparing food has numerous benefits, even for someone on the benefit it may be that a combination of work, child care and similar duties and ill health means that it makes sense to buy prepared food on occasion. While a lot of prepared food is unhealthy, it does not have to be. A bean, tau foo (tofu) or lean chicken salad without excessive dressing can be quite a healthy meal. And unprepared food can be prepared in a healthy fashion. Flour, fish, potatoes and oil could be used to make a somewhat health fritter (especially when combined with vegetables) or fish and chips. And in any other example I've read or considered of which attempt to define differing rates for 'luxury' vs 'essential' items ends up with similar problems. I'm sure the group has heard of the Jaffa cake case, and so 110 have also though of the obvious question. Why should it be that a biscuit covered by chocolate should receive the standard rate, but a cake or uncovered biscuit the reduced rate? I’m hoping most members have examined at least at a cursory level the complexities generated by any one of the systems worldwide. I appreciate that even if a system is imperfect it doesn't have to mean it isn't worthwhile. But I do not believe this is the case here. It would be more desirable to make up for the burden of GST for the purchase of essential goods on poorer households by adjusting benefits and tax rates for the low incomes. This effectively allows people to decide for themselves what is essential. People, even those, in poverty may still spend money on items which it's hard to argue are a 'luxury' and yes, they will pay the same GST as on items that are 'essential' and so there isn't a tax incentive for them not do to so, but I ultimately don't think one is necessary. While the transfer system and adjustments to tax rates may be outside your ToR, I assume this does not preclude you saying that it's in part better to handle it there. I would support the working group carefully considering whether there are other areas of the tax system which could better target the problem of income-inequality in addition to our transfer system. As this may include changes to thresholds and rates and the later at least is outside your ToR, again you should recommend this be examined properly in a different enquiry if this is possible and you feel it’s worthwhile. I support our existing pigovian taxation like that on alcohol and tobacco. I recognise that in some particularly with tobacco there is a feeling that it’s primarily a ‘sin’ tax due to questions over whether the level of taxation is really needed to make up for the externalities especially given the reduction of life span and our superannuation system. But even ignoring the morbid nature of such considerations, I feel they do not generally consider wider societal costs of tobacco usage. I recognise the concerns some have expressed about the interaction between the increased taxes and poverty, given that for addiction and other reasons, some people struggling financially may still choose to purchase the items. The effect of this can be felt not only by the purchaser but their family or other relying on them financially. However, I think the taxes are worth it regardless. Completely outside the ToR, but I think that other non-tax measures of reducing the costs and harm caused by these should be considered for the future in preference to simple taxation increases. These can include issues like advertising, branding and medical or other assistance. Some jurisdictions have imposed another form of pigovian taxation, a sugary drink tax. There is some evidence that these have desirable outcomes. I am not opposed to the introduction of such taxes if carefully implemented and there is either sound evidence for them, or they are part of a properly monitored experiment. While these may work and be desirable in a carefully defined way likely as a separate tax, I do not think this applies to a whole system GST level. However, there is still is a strong risk of perverse outcomes or questionable policies along with significant compliance cost and bureaucratic complexities. Yet, if done well I think these can work since even despite the problems, they can be the ‘least worst’ option especially since they are targeting these externalities in a specific limited fashion rather than either some perceived unfairness or trying for excessively overreaching societal goals. Some jurisdictions have also proposed or tried a wider ‘sugar tax’ or a ‘fat tax’ but as far as I’m aware these have generally had significant shortcomings and so have never lasted long if implemented at all. I feel these highlight why there is such a risk. 111 By the same token, I think environment taxes and other taxes with specific aims if done well, properly designed and monitored may work although I have not considered in great deal the options. I do agree with what was said in the working paper of the strong risk of these not working properly. I am concerned with the perverse incentives that encourage bad behaviour, not just to the environment but socially, that exist in our system. For example, I’ve long been concerned with the issue mentioned in your paper about car parks commonly being excluded from the fringe benefit tax. Especially when compared to an AT Hop card or other similar incentive. And noting even if both weren't taxed, I don’t see a good reason why a car park should be exempt. I suspect the group is aware of the somewhat infamous jetski in an Auckland Council carpark and the obvious implications of why exactly them parking a car they drive is better than them commuting via some other fashion and using the car park for this purpose.) It is unfortunate that such necessary adjustments can be turned into political football as happened in the past with previous tax groups, so it’s important we somehow deal with these issues. Although I agree there are significant challenges to our system from the 'gig' economy, 'sharing' economy and other changes, it's not something I've considered a great deal. I do think our existing simple tax system will fortunately reduce the increased compliance costs, but we do need to consider the issue. I do have concerns given how much tax evasion there likely already is from tradespeople and others who often work on a cash and how well we deal with the issue. I am happy with the increased efforts to reduce this and think the government needs to be encouraged to work on reducing these given the clear unfairness. I do also think we have to be careful to not introduce a system where people are excessively unfairly required to account for their income if they've likely done nothing wrong. This is not just due to the compliance costs for all sides, but the personal toll it will extract. While perhaps mostly a matter of IRD policy which is excluded by your ToR, I do think the IRD's new data analysis system needs to be implemented carefully. While the use of electronic transactions can make tax evasion harder, it does depend on the nature of the transaction. Cryptocurrency transactions could be harder to track depending on the design of the system. In addition, even if the records are there, getting access to them raises privacy and cost concerns especially with MNCs and if there is widespread evasion. This could also be unintentional when people aren’t aware of the requirements. It's clear there's also significant tax avoidance especially by the extremely well off who use experts to help them structure their affairs. As with MNC's this behaviour may be understandable. But from a society POV we need to minimise it, as fairly as possible and practical. Without conversely unfairly penalising people for personal decisions even those done to avoid tax. So no ‘class warfare’ only fairness. For example, I've never seen a good reason for taxing citizens wherever they live, as the US does, which is probably why they're one of the only ones who do so. Note that I am not referring to the well-known case where people paid themselves very low wages which was found to be wrong by a court. While I have not studied this in great detail, it does seem to me the IRD handled this in a reasonable manner. Questions that arise are things like, is there a reason this avoidance is fair especially compared to those who are not doing so? Are we able to design a system to reduce this avoidance? What perverse effects may it have? And the typical, how much compliance cost will these add compared to the benefits? An obvious area is with the use of trusts. While some of these are not pure tax issues and may be excluded by your ToR excluding the transfer system, e.g. the use of trusts to be able to gain the rest home subsidy, there is clearly an interaction with the tax system. I do believe we've made some progress on these, the elimination of the gift tax forced more consideration of how trusts should be handled but I strongly suspect 112 things still need to be improved. For the avoidance of doubt, I recognise there are plenty of good reasons why a trust may be used. This may be mostly excluded by your ToR excluding the transfer system and the adequacy of the personal taxation system. But I do think we need to consider carefully the long-term sustainability of the current superannuation regime given the age thresholds and the lack of means an asset testing. Unfortunately, because of how controversial, this is something no government really deals with well. If it is allowed by your ToR, hopefully the group can at a minimum warn of the dangerous to our tax system given expected trends of population growth and lifespans. Especially since the cost of healthcare will also significantly add to that. We all know our original system had no prepayment and relied solely on tax revenues to pay for it year by year, but it’s hard to imagine how this is going to work given the way our population, and our country and world is changing. Correcting this now given the future burden and trends is not likely to be possible. Particularly when future government foolish stop payments to the Super Fund. This should come with a recommendation that this be investigated further if any of it is missed by the group studying the transfer system. I do think it is important that the right incentives are put in place to encourage saving for retirement. Even with our current superannuation system, most people require savings in some form (e.g. a house they own) to live comfortably in retirement or they will need to rely on means or asset tested government benefits. As far as possible, we should try and encourage people not to require such benefits. While we already have the Kiwisaver system, I believe there is still great room for improvement. On the issue of the wealth tax, while I think the idea may have merit in an ideal world, the fact it's never really gained currency anywhere and the unlikelihood of it being implemented combined with the likelihood those who we most expect it to apply to will largely avoid it makes me feel it's not that worthwhile considering. Although this is just my personal view and I'm not saying the group spend time on it if they think it's worthwhile considering your time and other limits. On the progressive company tax, I do not believe this is a good idea. As far as I'm aware this is hardly ever implemented. I appreciate, as also mentioned by your paper, that Australia currently has this in some form, but and your paper again mentioned this, it seems to just be a way to gradually reduce the corporate tax. While I recognise as I've said before that there's nothing wrong with being leaders in a lot of cases, it seems to be the compliance costs, complexities and perverse incentives such a system would create mean it would never be worthwhile. A start-up tax rate may be of greater merit although I do not believe this is likely to be a good idea either. I do think we have to be careful not to excessively complicate our system whatever we are trying to achieve. I hope most members of the group have filled out a tax return before. I think it's quite revealing how simple it tends to be. (I recognise for some people calculating income and losses and other aspects is not trivial.) When you hear of the headaches in other places, especially in the US with all their extremely weird exemptions and complexities by comparison it's easy to recognise the advantages we have. While this applies particularly at the personal level, it also applies to the company level. There is also an interaction with other aspects of the tax systems, for example as mentioned in the working paper, whether it makes any sense for 'payroll tax' on employers in addition to our existing PAYG income tax, considering it's ultimately just a tax borne by the employee. 113 Thanks for your consideration and for your efforts to improve New Zealand by helping reform our system of taxation.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 , 25 th Mar ‘18 Submission to the NZ Tax Working Group Co-operative Capitalism The New Zealand developed concept ‘Co-operative Capitalism’ merges the benefits of capitalism, free enterprise and wealth creation, with the productivity and social benefits existing in co-operative culture enterprises. The concept draws on motivational research findings, socially beneficial frameworks and the practical experience of New Zealand companies. The supporting motivational and social research findings are detailed in the ‘In Depth Proposal document’ of the website www.co-operativecapitalism.com . The above website was created in April 2016, and has percolated from internet search engine obscurity to be the first returned search item on ‘co-operative capitalism’ on all (excluding Yahoo) the popular internet search engines for the past 9 months. Curiously a surprisingly high number of internet sessions from Russia (yandex.ru) amongst sessions from over 40 countries during this time. Air New Zealand Company In 2001 the possibility of Singapore Airlines taking a 49% shareholding in Air New Zealand was avoided by the actions of the NZ Labour Party to rescue our national airline from bankruptcy. Having successfully navigated the first year (2001) following the impending bankruptcy the Board, under the Chairmanship of John Palmer, decided to give all staff a bonus of $500. We do not know if this was a suggestion of the then Minister of Labour, Margaret Wilson, or whether it was an initiative of the Board. Regardless, and to the Board and senior managements credit, it has been the forerunner of possibly nine occasions when the Air New Zealand company has given an equitable distribution of bonus to all employees not currently on an incentive scheme. Last year those employees received $1700. No one can doubt the simply outstanding performance of Air New Zealand, from our own small domestic market, against tough international competition, since those times of imminent bankruptcy. It would be revealing to measure the financial and social benefit of the co-operative culture that has become a feature of the company’s operations. It is very interesting to note that the Board and executives of the Auckland Airport company is now also giving an equitable distribution of bonus to all employees. Politicians have told us that there is no possibility of tax cuts before 2020. This co-operative capitalism concept proposes a 15% tax rate on the equitable distribution of bonus for all employees. It is suggested that this be called a Kotahi Payment - Kotahi meaning ‘co-operating together as one’ in Maori. \[1\] 2 This fixed 15% tax rate will be on the equitable distribution of bonus for ALL employees, RECORDED SEPARATELY from PAYE on tax returns, and is part of a vision for an inclusive co-operative New Zealand. This tax innovation, facilitating a co-operative workplace culture, is constructive rather than punitive. The government has been the recipient of healthy growing dividends from their shareholding in Air New Zealand, and therefore, why not encourage that management style in other businesses. No better way to encourage that management style than to cater for a fixed low tax rate (regardless of employees current PAYE rate) on the annual equitable bonus for ALL employees on Kotahi payments. (Mahi Tahi payments, Team NZ payments, Co-operating payments - whatever they are to be called). Kotahi payments (for ALL employees) are not individual performance bonuses; they are a co- operative culture common bond – the cement that binds the co-operative team together. Performance related remuneration will be reflected in an employee’s contracted or baseline remuneration, although exceptional specific bonuses, e.g. sales, may coexist along with Kotahi payments. Following Air New Zealand's management lead a NZ government can be the first to implement the low tax innovation and thereby be the catalyst for the growth of co-operative capitalism. A co-operative culture will see a giant stride forward in workplace productivity and profitability. - management wins, employees win, investors win and government wins. I have reflected on why I have attempted to promote a tax innovation that provides a framework encouraging a co-operative culture in workplaces? The website www.co-operativecapitalism.com includes guidelines on implementation but also outlines the numerous social and productivity benefits. Additionally when I first arrived in New Zealand in the sixties, the social fabric of the country had more of an egalitarian quality and that was reflected in the character and spirits of New Zealanders. This egalitarian quality, much admired – even envied – by other countries, has been eroded as a result of successive government policies over the last 30 years. Government support for a tax innovation encouraging Kotahi payments, will play a part in redressing that loss of a national, inclusive social and economic aspiration. As a national framework for progressive management teams, Kotahi Payments have the double attribute of improving both workplace productivity and social cohesion and are an opportunity to recover a valuable part of our heritage. All this at no risk to the tax revenue or business profit. I believe that improved social cohesion will have an indirect positive effect on individual’s health and ultimately, in a small way, maybe even the national health budget. 3 A background observation when formulating this simple concept is that New Zealanders have shown that they equal, if not surpass, any nation when they are part of a ‘teamwork’ approach or collective effort. This characteristic is demonstrated in sporting endeavours, in hosting international events, in producing opening ceremonies, in national charity appeals and in community endeavours. Furthermore some of New Zealand’s more significant industries do have a co-operative basis. Therefore why not build on this national trait in our workplaces? Arranging for this simple innovation as part of the national remuneration tax framework needs enlightened politicians willing to break out from traditional capitalist thinking and encourage co- operative culture workplaces. Progressive management teams taking advantage of this option will realise both the productivity and social benefits. As the Kotahi payment concept becomes part of ‘the New Zealand way’ we will see a more robust growing economy and improved social cohesion. Just as the Auckland Airport Company is now adopting the lead of Air New Zealand with its own equitable distribution of bonus, so this concept will spread to other businesses. The most capable employees will hitch their careers with the co-operative capitalism enterprises, as they predictably will be the more successful companies. It would be kudos for New Zealand to become a lead nation for co-operative capitalism and, as has happened before, have an influence beyond our borders. Far preferable that New Zealand is first off the rank to become more productive, more competitive and more socially cohesive than other countries such as Russia or India. This concept puts faith in New Zealanders who after all are New Zealand’s greatest asset. This is an example of the marketplace providing innovation by two prominent NZ Corporates, but will the government step up to provide leadership rather than be backward accommodating? At least it can create the framework as an option for progressive managements and let businesses decide on its applicability. Our country has outstanding natural beauty with widely diverse landscapes. For our small population we punch above our weight in many endeavours. If a relatively small airline from a small consumer base can outperform airlines from large economies then we, as a country, can follow their progressive management style and lift our productivity, improve social cohesion and be a lead example with influence beyond our borders. To create this framework as an option for progressive managements is not a major rewrite of our remuneration tax system. It is a refinement with potential outcomes beyond quantifying.. 4 The level of widespread internet interest in this concept implies that there is an appetite internationally for alternatives or refinements to the extent of neoliberal capitalisms evolution. As Daniel Pink quoted in ‘Drive’ ‘It is an opportunity to reassert our humanity’. Regards, Alan Harding m PS I am surmising that members of the TWG will find the website Blog Post contributions supportive of the concept . \[1\]

Page 1 of 4 Barbara Holland Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission: On the Future of Tax General remarks 1. I support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. 2. I do not believe the current system of taxation that enables provision of publicly funded infrastructure establishment, maintenance, and/or services has been neutral, fair, or just. The fact that we have such a gulf between rich and poor on income and wealth measures; such alarmingly high rates of child poverty, violence, poor mental health, homelessness; and unequal opportunities to put a stake in the ground and engage in meaningful work to create a secure future with real choices confirms to me that the present system of tax-take and allocation for social wellbeing purposes is not in balance. We are a relatively small nation. It isn’t that hard to see that marked inequalities between groups of people and between regions are shaped as much by structural arrangements as by individual will, opportunity and circumstance. We should all be able to expect access to reliable, efficient and effective publicly funded services. Fair taxes are what enable provision of these social goods. 3. I applaud the holistic approach taken to adopt The Living Standards Framework incorporating the four ‘capital stocks’ and associated flows as a basis for public policy direction. I believe this lens should be applied to all government decision-making. 4. I believe this approach is a more appropriate fit with Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and commitment to respect the land and the people, now and into the future. Economic drivers and production activities must also include accountability for their impact on the environment and natural resource sustainability – not just be measured for their financial return. Polluters must pay. We must not let our natural resources (particularly water) be taken offshore without fair returns to New Zealand. \[1\] Page 2 of 4 The tax system is one tool that can more fairly support these wider social wellbeing measures, provided it is more universally and equitably applied. 5. Where significant areas of a region’s landmass are locked up into public conservation lands (PCL) and protected for the benefit of all New Zealanders there must be some kind of benefit-transfer from government back to that region to ensure the limited number of local ratepayers are not unduly burdened with infrastructure costs that also benefit the whole country (eg roads, water supply, communications, civil defence services) yet must meet needs over large distances where other economic and residential activities are not permitted, or are very limited. For example, Te Tai Poutini is sparsely populated and although there is some concession revenue gain from PCL-related activities the region is also looking for opportunities to build/support stronger employment and income growth. This region has no public transport, a low-median income and many more existing on less than the living wage, along with high local body rates so it is challenging for many to seize/develop new business opportunities without external funding start-up support. The current Regional Development Fund will undoubtedly go some way to offsetting this disadvantage. It has been a long time coming but how far will it stretch and for how long? A fairer division of the overall tax take would avoid a short-term lolly-scramble. 6. I support a government change in direction that drives more environmentally sustainable and accountable economic activity. Where private businesses may need to change their focus or even cease their current economic activities because they do not meet the greater good criteria for socially responsible trading there must be a transition strategy, government-led if necessary, so that communities are not left stranded from the exit of employment activity. Immediate changes I wish to see 7. A review of all for-profit businesses that currently have Charitable Status. Multi- million dollar traders ranging from Sanitarium to those run by The Christian Church Community Trust (Gloriavale Christian Community), to name just two examples among the multitude of other for-profit business arms incorporated within this class of charitable trust operators, must start contributing a fairer share of tax for the nation’s wellbeing. 8. Revision of existing targeted tax rates where the alcohol industry reaps vast profits from their private trading activities but they contribute very little through taxation to counter the enormous costs of alcohol-associated harms that are carried by individuals/whanau and the publicly-funded sector. 9. I do not believe the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand fair for the majority of New Zealanders. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of adults) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with the wider costs to society of alcohol- related harm. The government receives excise tax from alcohol ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). Page 3 of 4 10. Further, the government is missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). This anomalous situation needs to be addressed. It is the alcohol content that causes the harm. 11. I believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should more closely reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Of particular concern is the increasing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. We must end retail supply of cheap alcohol. Specific measures to target heavy drinkers would significantly reduce inequalities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Further, low income heavy drinkers would benefit the most when the price of alcohol is increased. 12. All alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) should be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. AWC believes a Minimum Unit Pricing policy would achieve this aim. 13. Recommendations: • That alcohol excise rates are increased by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%; • That the excise rates on alcohol are adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers); • That all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%; • That a minimum price per standard unit of alcohol be introduced. A new targeted tax 14. I suggest government extends the targeted tax model by introducing a tax on sugary drinks and other high-sugar content products to act as a behaviour modifier. Poverty, sugary diets, poor oral hygiene have their impact across children and adults. Management of the alarming rise of pre-diabetes and current diabetes incidence already imposes significant costs on our publicly-funded health system. This burden will only get worse if no action is taken now as a society to forestall these avoidable impacts on wellbeing, employment capability, and life years lost. Future-focussed big system tax changes I want to see 15. (a) A universal basic income (UBI) Rationale: - It is about social justice and basic economic security first and foremost rather than tackling poverty after the fact; Page 4 of 4 - More effective in reducing poverty and inequality than schemes targeted on the poor; - Guarantees basic income for all, paid individually to each man and woman, including those with disabilities, and avoids labelling of deserving/undeserving poor; - Avoids a moral hazard where increasing income to just above poverty level means losing more than the extra earnings – this creates a disincentive to earn extra; and - Immoral hazard leading to hiding extra income. - There are high administration costs inherent in current means testing and application of sanctions. (b) A universal financial transactional tax (FTT) and thereby do away with income tax and the complex collection of GST; it would close existing taxation loopholes; and it would limit banks and financial traders who gain from the globalised economy but are still able to impose excessive costs on the New Zealand public who must use their services to transact their daily business. Thank you for the opportunity to put forward my views. I do not wish to appear before the committee in further support of my submission. • I acknowledge that my submission will be publicly released (with my email address withheld) and I have noted that the Official Information Act and privacy considerations apply.

Introduction Firstly let me compliment those who compiled the documentation the accompanied the invitation for submission. In particular the identification of the challenges, risks, and opportunities. The documents identify the problem of the non-collection of a fair tax from multi-nationals and offshore companies carrying out business in NZ. I would draw attention to: 1.the competitive disadvantage this is to NZ businesses due to the greater tax burden they carry as a result; 2.the resulting increased burden on all taxpayers This submission presents a restructured approach to tax in NZ rather than applying issue specific “Band-Aids” to the current system Specifically, it: 1.Provides a comprehensive, internally and externally consistent tax system that addresses the current challenges with a future proof solution; 2.Builds on existing tax mechanisms; 3.Provides a simple, robust and cost effective approach. This submission is at a high level, intended only to outline the concepts. Should the Working Group be interested in exploring the proposal in any detail I will be happy to provide further material or discuss the submission. 3. Response to specific challenges - Don’t tinker The Government has directed the Tax Working Group to advise on a number of specific challenges: A capital gains tax. A progressive company tax. Environmental taxation. Assist low-income groups by introducing GST exemptions. Unfortunately the approach implicit in the above ‘specific challenges’ instruction is one of tinkering with the existing tax system rather than re- thinking it and making it truly fit for purpose and future proof. Addressing ‘specific challenges’ through one off tax tweaks produces: 1.A cumbersome, often internally inconsistent, difficult to manage system, benefitting only the tax advisors; 2.Distortions in the economy, usually with unpredicted (not necessarily unexpected) effects. 3.Latent problems which will require further patches to fix. The proposed tax system addresses all the considerations underlying the above specific challenges and does so with a composite, internally and externally consistent simple tax system; intended to stand the test of time. 4. Overview of proposed tax system It is proposed that a tax system be implemented with three primary tax vehicles, which all have their roots in the present tax system: 1.CGST, an extension of GST to a broader tax collected: i.As a fixed percentage from the payor on any and all payments. If money changes hands it pays CGST; ii.On a cumulative basis, not as net/value-added like GST. 2.Company income levies (CILs) collected as a percentage of income, not profit, specified by industry group and progressive with income levels. 3.Personal income levies (PILs) collected as a percentage based on progressive income levels for all payees (recipients). The proposed collection mechanism is simple. 1.All CGST and CIL/PIL levies are collected by the transacting banks. 2.Monies (including cash) payments out of the NZ banking system are not exempt from ‘income’ levies, except these are collected from the payor together with CGST. 3.Offshore, internet and multinational companies not registered in NZ for tax purposes are not exempt from revenue levies except these are collected from the payor together with CGST. Tax revenue is based on monies paid and received rather than the traditional ‘earnings’ or ‘profit’, devices which are being rendered unreliable in the changing business environment. 5. Relative share of tax revenue It is envisaged that the relative portion of tax revenue will shift as follows: 1.CGST will become the largest contributor estimated to rise to >50% of tax revenue. i.Estimated at an applied rate of between 1.75% and most likely below 4% ii.CGST. Although a lower percentage than GST it contributes a greater amount due to: a.A wider base. If money changes hands it pays CGST, e.g. share market, house sales, rent, financial transactions, FOREX, share & gig economy etc. b.Being cumulative rather than net/value-added. 2.Company Income Levies (CILs) are estimated to still contribute around 17.5% i.While total dollar amount is up, NZ registered business pay a lower tax rate 3.Personal Income Levies (PILs) are estimated to contribute around 25% i.Shift in emphasis to CGST ii.No levies on low income groups (subsidised via WINZ) 6. Primary benefit targets of proposed system The proposed system is modelled to target six specific areas: 1.Reduction in poverty, specifically child poverty, by reducing the tax burden thereby increasing the disposable income of low income families. 2.Eliminating the present system’s competitive bias against NZ based businesses. 3.Sharing the NZ tax burden with offshore entities by eliminating international e- businesses avoiding tax in NZ. 4.Improving the attractiveness of investment in NZ through low taxes, encouraging retention of money in NZ and fully taxing offshore entities. 5.Simplified and comprehensive tax gathering, avoiding “Band-Aid” taxes, with an all encompassing tax structure and tax collection by the banks. 6.A future proof system. The proposed system is cost effective for IRD and tax payers. The banks will whine but have the ability to deliver as they have can already levy charges on transactions. The cost to the government of bank collections should be nil. 7. Summary of response to extended list of challenges, risks, and opportunities Challenges, risks, and opportunitiesComment Reduces poverty, improves standard of livingIncreases lower income group disposable income Provides for demographic changes Personal levies for superannuation (Kiwisaver) health etc. and potential for means testing user pays services Competitive with falling international business tax rates Reduces tax for NZ tax registered business. Current bias against NZ based/owned businesses Increases tax take from multi-nationals & offshore, improves NZ business competitiveness Current excessive tax burden on NZ taxpayers Shares tax burden with multi-nationals & offshore entities Inherently 'future proof'Embraces internet, shared, gig etc. economies Fully compatible with technology trendsTrend is towards cashless, system is banking based Hypothecating tax revenueLevies largely hypothecated Better progressive capacity for personal tax Minimum wage threshold for levies, progressive subsidy reduction at higher incomes Puts Māori economy on equal footing Improved competitiveness and lower tax NZ together with progressive nature of company tax. Progressive capacity for company taxProgressive introduction of levies. Discourages migration to cash economy Value of applied CGST and levies to money leaving banking system less than present GST. Simpler and more equitable than alternative solutions Preferable to capital gains, BEPS and other tweaks to current framework Encourages investment in NZ Application of CGST and levies to money leaving banking system and low NZ tax rates encourages retention of funds in NZ Discourages market speculation All transactions taxed - housing, equities, other investments and assets Accommodates global business trends Equal treatment of all businesses irrespective of domicile jurisdiction Accommodates environmental challenges Industry levies (e.g. carbon, tourism infrastructure & conservation levy) target outcomes 8. The cornerstone; Comprehensive GST = CGST At the core of the proposed system is an extended GST regime, called Comprehensive GST or CGST: 1.CGST is applied cumulatively not as net/value-added as at present. 2.CGST is applied to all transactions between bank accounts. If money changes it pays CGST. 3.CGST is paid by the entity making the payment (payor) not the recipient (payee). 4.CGST is collected by the banks as a charge on all payments/transfers made from a payor’s accounts – if money changes hands it pays CGST. 5.CGST is also collected on cash withdrawals – payments out of the bank. 6.CGST is also collected on all payments to accounts outside the NZ banking system. 7.CGST will drive economic efficiencies by eliminating GST processing/returns and as businesses respond with fewer steps in transaction chains. 8.CGST estimated at an applied rate of between 1.75% and 4% 9.CGST. As a % lower than GST, CGST will still contribute more tax due to: a.A wider base. If money changes hands it pays CGST, e.g. share market, house sales, rent, dividends, financial markets, FOREX, Share economy etc b.Being cumulative rather than net. The CGST revenue is not hypothecated (i.e. tagged for a specific Vote) 9. Personal Tax – meeting the challenges Tax inroads into the disposable income of the poor has a greater impact on their quality of life and economic participation than on the wealthy. The current personal tax regime is not doing enough to significantly reduce poverty in NZ. The current tax regime does not provide an effective tax progression wedge. Multi-national and offshore company uncollected taxes place greater burden on all NZ taxpayers, impacting the poor most. Reducing the tax burden on lower income New Zealanders will increase disposable income: Reducing poverty – child poverty in particular; Improving participation in the social economy; Improving health outcomes; Improving education outcomes ... •... leading to improved productivity in future; •... leading to greater participation in the digital environment. Income tax based on earnings is not future proof and will become increasingly inequitable (rich – poor divide) as current trends away from traditional wage/salary based employment accelerate more in higher paid sectors. 10. A new approach to personal tax It is proposed to shift from a tax on earnings base to a participation in part funding state personal insurance. All up the proposed levy is expected to total around 17% of income at the upper end. Individuals will be liable for constant percentage of income (subject to government subsidies) for contributions to: ACC insurance (earner levy). Kiwisaver. Health (public system) insurance (from ambulance to GP to tertiary care) whether accessed or not. Unemployment insurance (unemployment, maternity leave etc) Welfare insurance. National education contribution. Collection is through the banks and applied as a percentage (all levies summed) to all payments (note exemptions) into personal accounts. 1.Individual taxpayers are banded into annual income bands by IRD and registered as such with their bank. The band is reviewed annually (?) 2.The levies are applied according to the taxpayer’s band and are progressive. 3.The progressive nature reflects a government subsidy linked to income. At the lowest income level, below the annualised minimum wage, the subsidy is 100%. 4.Individuals not registered for tax purposes pay the highest levy. 11. Company tax shifts from ‘profit’ to ‘income’ based as levies In lieu of company tax a regime of levies is proposed. These levies are applied to the income (money into company accounts) for all NZ tax registered companies. The levies are collected by the banks from the payee on gross revenue/income into registered NZ business taxpayer accounts. Companies not tax registered in NZ have the levy collected from the payor, from all payments leaving the NZ banking system: 1.Domestically as cash 2.Internationally to accounts on non-NZ tax registered entities. All levies are summed, rounded to fit IRD established bands and advised to collecting banks to be collected on all inflows (i.e. gross income) into company accounts. A default (higher) levy is applied to all accounts not registered as NZ business taxpayer accounts. This tax system treats NZ and foreign companies the same and thus meets international trade agreement requirements. 12. Company income levy types Company/industry based levies, rule based and within IRD determined classifications. 1.Industry based levies: i.Such as the. fishing industry levy, intended to contribute to the regulatory, research and support functions of the Ministry. ii.ACC (employer levy), industry linked. Not related to employee numbers or payments 2.“Insurance” type levies: i.Staff based such as KiwiSaver (employer contribution) ii.Staff independent to include contributions to national (personal) insurance for health, unemployment (provides for paid parental leave) and welfare. iii.Environmental levies, (not unlike ACC in concept) based on company carbon footprint and/or other such as water use etc. These avoid the need for complexities such as carbon taxes or trading (which are broad brush, open to speculation and often avoid the issue of improvement through trading). See section 22 Environmental Outcomes. 3.Generic levies can be progressive, selectively applied at income thresholds. i.Specific infrastructure hypothecated levies, directed to part fund the core infrastructure Ministries such as Defence, Transport, Law and Order. ii.Social support hypothecated levies, directed to part fund the big social ministries such as Health, Education & Social welfare. iii.National infrastructure levy, not hypothecated. 13. Levies on monies leaving the NZ banking system, simpler & better than BEPS CILS and CGST applies to all monies leaving the the NZ banking system. A company levy on payments to companies not registered for NZ tax purposes or operating outside of the NZ Banking system will be added to CGST and collected from the payor. 1.Levy is collected on all payments leaving the NZ Banking system – cash or payments to offshore entities. 2.The levy is applied equally within NZ and to offshore entities – complying with trade agreements. 3.A single default levy is applied, which will be at the highest level applied to registered companies. 4.These “non-registered” levies are added to CGST and collected at the same time from the payor by the transaction NZ bank. 5.This method of collection (collected from payor) is different from that for tax registered companies which is collected from payee revenue. This “non-registered” levy, together with CGST, will effectively tax offshore businesses and entities with a commercial interest in NZ. As the “non-registered” levy applies to all payments leaving the NZ Banking system it will apply to all offshore and cash payments, including: 1.Dividends, royalties, professional and other fees, loans etc – if money leaves the NZ banking system. 2.Investments offshore and general funds transfers offshore. 14. Exemptions to CGST and levies. The system is intended to have the minimum of exemptions 1.Transfers from the Government (e.g. national super or wellfare payments) are exempt CGST and recipients from PIL charges 2.Payments by the Government for goods, services etc are exempt CGST 3.Payments to registered charities are exempt CIL on receipt, but CGST when paid 4.Money entering the NZ banking system as cash or from offshore is exempt CGST (as payor is outside the system) but CIL/PIL is collected in the hands of the recipient (maybe exempt??) 5.Transfers of capital (not interest) between bank accounts of the same account holder (e.g. cheque to/from term investment) shall be exempt of both CGST and CIL/PIL otherwise in the current low interest rate environment any benefit from placing funds in higher interest accounts would be lost, distorting investment decisions. Interest is subject to CIL/PIL when received. 6.Transfers (gifts) between family members are exempt PIL on receipt, and CGST when paid. Requires registration with collecting bank (& IRD) of linked accounts.. 15.. Additional taxes and fees The system is intended to have the minimum of additional taxes. 1.Tourist infrastructure and conservation tax. Levied as a dollar amount per person per month of stay on arrival, by arrival authority. 2.Existing excise taxes on specific public harm products e.g. tobacco, alcohol. Collected as at present from company supplying products and incorporated into sell price by them. CGST applies. Yes CGST double dips on this. 3.Existing user pay type taxes such as RUC/fuel tax levied at point of sale (CGST applies) and paid by vendor. 4.User pays fees. Certain public services (e.g. in health and education) may be subject to means tested user part charges. 16. Tricky areas still exist Some areas present problems gathering tax under any system. Examples. 1.Expenditure in NZ from overseas bank accounts. Example, tourist with UK bank VISA card. CIL is applied, and CGST is collected on the NZ processed transaction by the NZ bank processing the transaction on behalf of the credit card company. 2.Offshore company purchases goods/services from its wholly owned NZ registered company, without the transaction entering the NZ banking system. CGST and CIL are avoided. Solution is complex and requires applying a nominal value to the transactions and a withholding CIL until payment is received. Considering that CIL and CGST relatively low there is reduced incentive for these scams. However, imposing withholding or other measures complicates a simple system but cannot be ruled out. 3.Staff of offshore entities in NZ are paid minimum wage and balance of salary held offshore; payments of NZ expenses (e.g. rent) directly from. Avoids CGST and some PIL. Can be policed, but not simple. 4.How to properly collect tax revenue when the whole transaction is offshore: e.g. tourist package sold offshore and delivered in NZ by offshore owned providers. All NZ gets is CGST for inputs at cost. 5.NZ residents/businesses shipping $ offshore and operating all expenditure from offshore accounts. Solution is for it to be an offence to have undisclosed offshore accounts & disclosed accounts require reporting and application of CGST to all monies leaving the account whether back into NZ or offshore. 17. Hypothecating tax revenue. Transparency in the tax system is considered a causal driver of efficiency in Government. The levy system in particular creates the impression that specific government services are being purchased – e.g. ACC insurance. In the long term some of the services may be fully funded by the levies leading to the government departments having to operate on a commercial and competitive basis. With levies such as ‘health insurance’ individual accounts (like KiwiSaver) should be run BUT the levy (except for income progression) should be maintained at a universal level. The universal nature of the levy is perhaps contradictory to the ideal of no demographic cross-subsidy (e.g. age linked health levy) but rather supports the concept of whanaungatanga. 18. Housing affordability Speculation is the housing market is a causal driver of overpricing. A market with unsatisfied demand is highly vulnerable. Not only is the NZ housing market overpriced. Base demand (the number of people who need houses to live in) is a supply and demand mismatch ... but tax structures can incentivise speculation driving churn and apparent demand. 1.Capital gains tax is often touted a the solution. i.It requires quite complex rules. ii.It is difficult to apply to all capital transactions (e.g. collectable wine) – why only housing if it’s such a good idea? 2.By taxing all expenditure and every transaction: i.Churn is discouraged, suppressing one source of demand. ii.Any ‘tax free’ status is eliminated further reducing demand. iii.All investment expenditure has equal tax appeal reducing ‘preferred’ market demand. It’s a bit late to turn the clock back on the current level of housing affordability, but this proposal is a future proof against it happening again. 19. Market performance The proposed tax regime will have a similar impact on the equities market as that on the housing market. 1.Reduce churn. 2.Reduce speculation. 3.Reduce ‘tax-free’ status of some investment vehicles and transactions. 4.Provide tax parity between all investments. 5.Improve market stability. 6.Provide better linkage between value, yield and price ... 7.... providing increased confidence to investors. The tax treatment of multi-nationals in NZ will encourage the greater retention of earning in NZ, leading to greater liquidity and available capital for the market. 20. Capital Gains & Land Tax Capital gains and land tax may appear to be thinking outside of the current tax system, but in effect are little more than applying “Band-Aids” to mask other economic problems. An integrated solution as proposed is preferred. A separate capital gains tax is outmoded and considered an ineffective and distorting tax. 1.There are always problems distinguishing between income from trading in assets (e.g. cars – collectors’ cars) or investing for gain. 2.The CGST approach eliminates the usually arbitrary nature of tests for capital gains or trade activity. The bright line test is so arbitrary that it keeps shifting. 3.Depending on the arbitrary line between trade profit and capital gain different tax rules (e.g.rate of taxation, deductibility of expenses) may apply. 4.Depending on the definitions the market may be skewed to favour certain investments or trades. (e.g. PIE). 5.CGST applies a single rate to all transactions irrespective of their nature avoiding a bias towards any activity or investment. It’s all just money. 6.Discouraging investment in housing through a capital gains tax is likely to flow on to a restricted supply of rental accommodation and further rent escalation. 7.Given the low rate of the proposed CGST there appears to be no material issue requiring the exempting of family homes. Land tax is considered unhelpful and unnecessary 1.Again this is adding complexity. Land on a cross-lease section? 2.This proposal effectively taxes land as part of transactions included in the CGST. 21. BEPS The BEPS solution to uncollected tax from multi-nationals operating in NZ or offshore companies trading in NZ is a tax advisors dream come true. The solution proposed here is simpler and more effective. 22. Environmental outcomes The dominant thinking on influencing business and personal decision making on environmental issues hinges on tradable rights (e.g. water) or taxes (e.g. carbon credits). Creating markets for tradable environmental factors takes the focus of the issues and directs it towards the market. Buying carbon credits (dodgy ones aside) does nothing to reduce carbon emissions in NZ. The causal driver of good environmental performance is businesses taking the right decisions for the environment leading to actually delivering improvements. Common sense dictates that the positive drivers of good environmental performance should be rewarded, and the negative drivers (or absence of positives) penalised. ACC sets it’s levies this way – and it works. Hence the recommendation of industry specific levies with an environmental component. To illustrate: Polluting or high carbon industries should face a higher levy, but one which can be reduced (at a company level) by demonstrating: i.A plan to mitigate – level 1 reduction in levy ii.Successful implementation of the plan – level 2 reduction of levy iii.Create environmental positives and/or innovation – level 3 reduction of levy A. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 2 Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges and opportunities for the tax system? Which of these are most important? See sections 3, 6 &7 How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? Specifically the tax system should not be subject to ad hoc changes to address current ‘hot buttons’. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Tikanga Māori are an integral part of NZ culture and business life and the concepts of tikanga Māori can and should be allowed to influence thinking on a new tax system. One should not be captured by the sometimes expressed view that tikanga Māori are by their nature old and therefore irrelevant to NZ commerce today. The challenge the Working Group faces is to enunciate the tikanga Māori and envisage the extent to which there are specifics that should become objectives of the tax system and work towards them. In this submission an attempt is made to at least acknowledge the values of: Manaakitanga are in part recognised in the tourist infrastructure and conservation levy which recognises NZ as being a special place to visit and share with the people of NZ and should be protected as such. Whanaungatanga are in a small way recognised in the free movement of capital between linked family accounts and in universal individual levies. Kaitiakitanga are expressed to some extent in the progressive nature of the environmental levies and the they way they are applied – been seen to do good – rather than the market focus of tradable rights/credits. B. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 3 Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Equity, efficiency (cost of assessment, collection and payment),positive economic causal drivers, future proof, transparent Defining ‘fairness' How would you define ‘fairness' in the context of the tax system? The tax burden should be shared evenly (universally) by all participants in every aspect of the NZ economy. Those with less should not subsidise those with more (business or individual). What would a fair tax system look like? This submission proposes a fair tax system. C. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 4 Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand's ‘broad-based, low-rate' system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? Broad-based and low rate yes. GST – not appropriate at present. Value-add based, too many exemptions. Income tax is ‘earnings’ (for individuals) and ‘profit’ (for companies) based. Both of these concepts are under threat with changes in the basis of internet and global commerce. If not, what approach should replace it? Simply put, the system proposed here. Specifically, if money changes hands it should be taxed (exemptions apply) and gross income should be levied to reflect the nature of the entity being taxed in their interest in government services. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? Yes If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Multinational/offshore entity responsibility in NZ market & retention of income in NZ as proposed. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? Yes If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? As proposed compulsory KiwiSaver as a levy. D. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 5 Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? No, speculation in assets is encouraged. If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? CGST as proposed. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? No, the proposal eliminates returns (GST & income tax) and the calculation of tax provisions. Plus cost of IRD under present system flows onto business. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? The proposed system, by focusing on money changing hands (CGST) treats all businesses equally as it should. However the assumption at work is that all natural capital is charged for appropriately – e.g. water. The tax system is not appropriate for address problems in government and local government setting charges. At best the tax system can apply some notional value to the resource and attribute a notional payment that is taxed. E. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 6 Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? 1.Undue burden on NZ companies (and individuals) from non-collected tax from offshore entities. 2.Distortions between earnings from capital and production. Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Only in the context of a fully integrated system; no bolt-on or tinkering please! Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? This submission demonstrates thinking outside the current system. While all the taxes proposed have their root in an existing tax the overall system is new. F. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 7 Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? - See proposal section 18 Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains No - See proposal section 20 Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax? No - See proposal section 20 Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? - See proposal section 22 Progressive company tax - See proposal section 11-12 Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? No - See proposal section 16 Addendum – GST applied to offshore vendors Regarding the recent government announcement regarding requesting offshore vendors to register for GST it is appropriate to contrast that approach with this submission. 1.The government approach will: i.Require willing compliance from offshore vendors ii.GST is paid by the payor (purchaser) via the price charged iii.GST is collected and submitted by the payee – in this case the vendor iv.Separate administration by both IRD and vendors v.Tax only the sale – i.e. realise GST 2.The proposal in this submission i.No co-operation is required from offshore companies ii.The CGST is paid by the payor as a charge on the purchase transaction iii.The CGST is collected and submitted by the NZ transacting bank iv.In addition the vendor is taxed as a company doing business in NZ via the CIL applied to monies leaving the NZ banking system. The proposal in this submission is cleaner and simpler than that proposed by government and more importantly: 1. Delivers an equitable treatment of NZ and offshore companies encompassing the equivalent of GST and company tax. 2.Is applied automatically as an integral, consistent, part of the tax system; not an add-on.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Emissions, Road User Charges and EVs – A Strategy The government wishes to reduce carbon emissions associated with road transport. This short paper explores a strategy that would: • Reduce emissions through accelerated take up of EVs • Provide a bridging path to universal road user charging and • Improve NZs balance of payments by reducing fuel imports. Some key factors to be considered are: 1. The eventual widespread adoption of electric vehicles, including passenger use, will mean road transport will continue to be a viable low emission transport option. 2. A key goal is the acceleration of migration to electric vehicles to reduce emissions. 3. Reduction in fossil fuel imports will improve NZs balance of payments. 4. An increasing proportion of electric vehicles will result in petrol tax not providing an effective source of road funding prior to introduction of road user charges for EVs in Dec 2021. Diesel vehicles are already subject to road user charges (RUCs). 5. Annual relicensing could provide an alternative source of road funding but in its present form it does not reflect road usage. 6. There is a desire to charge tolls on new highways to help fund the cost of construction and to set a price reflecting the value in the faster travel. 7. The transport industry is beginning to use technology that tracks distance travelled and the path of that travel. This technology will become widespread in commercial vehicles and could also eventually be deployed in some form for private vehicle usage. 8. Vehicles increasingly include GPS technology and autonomous vehicles inherently rely on GPS navigation. The ultimate goal should be a regime where all vehicle operating taxes reflect the usage of roads. Such taxation could have two components: 1. A fixed annual charge reflecting the value of having local road access that then offers the opportunity to travel. This is much like the fixed charge for electricity connection that provides the facility to use energy from the national grid when required e.g. if solar energy is insufficient. If appropriate, this charge could include an allowance for local road usage. 2. A variable charge that reflects distance travelled, associated carbon emissions, the weight of the vehicle and the type of roads used. An automated collection system applying to all vehicles would be the end goal. 2 A migration strategy for achieving these goals goal might be: 1. Add an emission tax to the current petrol taxes and use some or all of this to subsidise electric vehicle usage. 2. Apply a road user regime to electric vehicles, which in the early stages would provide a credit against distance travelled as opposed to a charge. There is presently no road user charge for EVs but the application of a user charge will ultimately be required in some form. This would be a way of getting early acceptance of a road user charge regime for EVs. Initially, the credit to EVs could be provided via distances recorded on an annual basis by vehicle testing stations and participating garages. New vehicles do not require testing for 3 years but the credit could still be acquired voluntarily by the owner having the travelled distance recorded by approved testing stations. 3. Apply tolls to key routes particularly where congestion occurs at peak times and provide an optional automated system based on GPS devices installed in the vehicles. To make adoption more attractive, a security option could be added to this system to enable stolen vehicles to be tracked quickly. 4. Develop the GPS based toll system into an automated road user charge system for all roads and vehicles. This system could be compulsory for all vehicles after a defined date sometime in the future. Example Financial Model Assumptions used: • Average distance travelled of 14,000km from AA data • Average petrol usage of 8L/100km (mid way between the data provided by the AA for compact and medium cars). • Carbon tax from petrol vehicles is 100% credited to EVs Carbon emission tax rates into the future have been modelled as follows: 3 The future penetration of EVs in the fleet is uncertain. One source quoted 2% by 2021. This model assumes a start of 3% by 2020 rising to 40% by 2040 per the chart below. Based on these assumed forecasts, the modelled result for a carbon tax on petrol consumption and cross credit to EVs would be as follows. If the present road user charge of $62 per 1000km for a light vehicle was applied to EVs the net annual cost would be as shown, being a credit until about 2025 when EVs would begin to pay road user charges. A full RUC for 14,000km pa would be $868 and this would be reached as EV penetration approached 100%. When EV penetration has reached an acceptable level the full RUC could be phased in more quickly than shown in this model. $0 $20 $40 $60 $80 $100 $120 20202025203020352040 Emission Tax/CO2 Equiv Tonne 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 20202025203020352040 Percentage EVs 4 The above chart is simply one modelled scenario but it does show the possibility of greatly improving the attractiveness of owning an EV while providing a modest price signal to reduce petrol consumption. An advantage of an annual cross subsidy is that the current owner receives the benefit rather than just the initial owner. The annual cross subsidy would be proportional to the distance travelled and therefore the saved emissions from an alternative fossil fuelled vehicle. The cross credit could be adjusted such that it made the cost of running slightly positive to avoid a perverse incentive to drive more. In the model used here the credit was in the order of 5cents/km in the first year. Such a credit in early years would go a long way to making purchase of something modest like a Nissan Leaf EV more attractive and would target those who use a significant volume of petrol. The implementation of this cross transfer could be achieved by simply adding EVs into the existing RUC systems. The distances travelled would be collected voluntarily until such time as the net charge became positive. Most EV owners would be only too happy to collect a credit. Impact on Petrol Prices At least in the early years, the impact on petrol prices would be small as shown below. The rising cost is solely driven by the expected increase in the price of carbon emissions. -$1,000 -$500 $0 $500 $1,000 $1,500 $2,000 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Annual Petrol to EV Transfer CO2 Tax on Petrol Car Cross Credit to EV Net RUC on EVs 5 Potential Obstacles: 1. A significant barrier to GPS based usage data might be that the data collected could have an impact on privacy and also the potential use for speed monitoring. A partial counter is the already pervasive use of location equipment in commercial vehicles. Private usage is the real issue and some ring fencing may be required, at least until the whole private transport sector moves toward autonomous vehicles or other similar modes. 2. There is a risk that GPS devices would be detached from vehicles or deactivated. This could be policed automatically through number plate recognition by roadside cameras matched to location of the vehicle from the GPS in the vehicle. If there is no match then the GPS is inactive or missing. 3. The additional carbon tax on petrol could be politically difficult but a carbon tax is inevitable at some stage and the initial impact is small at today’s carbon prices. There is already the precedent of the Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Levy on some types of vehicle air-conditioning as an environmental tax. The suggested initial rate of carbon tax is less than the weekly movements in petrol prices.

Possibly the largest behavioural issue that we all face in the future is the issue of greenhouse gases and this is an areas of very great opportunity that we must not shy away from. As your paper points out, there is already the precedent of the Synthetic Greenhouse Gas levy but we are not doing enough. NZ must play its part along with all other nations if we are to avoid massive future disruption in our lives. NZ is somewhat unique in that our electricity sector does not offer much further opportunity for CO2 reduction and agriculture, while a significant emitter, is difficult to tackle. The one big opportunity we have is transport where the promotion of electric vehicles and development of bio-fuels could make a large contribution toward NZ’s emission targets. It is frustrating that NZ governments have not exploited the opportunity in encouraging faster take up of electric vehicl es (EVs) along the lines that some other countries have. EVs will eventually take over but there is much that could be done to accelerate the take up in the next few years, thus exploiting our low carbon electricity. I suggest that the TWG seriously consider, at an early stage, putting a carbon tax on fossil fuels used for transport and that a large part of such tax be used to encourage uptake of EVs and production of bio-fuels. At the same time the of Road User Charge (RUC) system could be redesigned to take into account all future types of vehicle including EVs and autonomous vehicles. Such a redesign could integrate the annual registration and RUC regime into a vehicle focussed account that applies charges reflecting road usage. Such charges might have a fixed element reflecting the right to use any road and a variable amount depending on the distance travelled, weight and emissions. The variable charge could also automatically take into the use of any toll roads or a rate depending on the actual road. Regarding a carbon tax transfer for the purposes of promoting EV take up in the near term, I have attached a short paper and the associate financial calculations focussed on petrol vehicles. The calculations should include diesel vehicles but that would r equire separating out that part of the diesel market that could be substituted by an EV. This is intended as a hypothetical example but it serves to illustrate the possibility that a modest carbon tax on fossil fuels could be used to achieve a strong acceleration in take up of EVs in a similar market. The model that I have attached starts with a modest 5c/litre carbon tax but the ratio of petrol vehicles to EVs in the early years gives lots of scope for large promotional subsidies, even if they are not applied in the way I have modelled it. My example provides a RUC credit for each EV depending on distance travelled that would taper out to zero around 2025 but the actual date and structure of such a transfer payment is not the issue. It is the concept of using such a mechanism to accelerate EV take up that is the opportunity. For your consideration. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute.

Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission on Future of Tax 1 The Tax Working Group has been directed to apply a particular focus on the future in its work...... - Robotics and artificial intelligence (eg driverless transport) will rapidly transcend the economy, much like computers, the web and social media has transformed today’s working environment. Employment opportunities will arise for new skills, but the number of unemployed in the economy will rise significantly. However the latter will not occur within the Terms of Reference defined period of next 5-10 years. - Pharmaceutical medicines and new healthcare practices will prolong the lifespan of the population. The aged will form an increasing proportion of the population placing an upward pressure on Government to fund NZ Superannuation and healthcare costs. - It is generally accepted global warming and natural disasters like earthquakes are increasing. New Zealand’s infrastructure is at risk and the Government faces the under- writing of most of the cost of disasters as the owner of roads, rail, hospitals.... - Increased unemployment will materially affect families, particularly in the provision of housing. A critical component of a stable society is having a home to house the family, community living and children regularly attending the same school. Housing affordability will become a greater challenge to a larger proportion of the population, requiring even greater Government support in this area. Home ownership will continue to decline in numbers. Government will be faced with building more and more homes which it will own and rent as the present threshold of $600 000 which is regarded as an ‘affordable home’ will not be attainable to an increasing proportion of the population who could never save the required deposit. Nor could they afford the rent on a market rental as rents will rise with landlords facing a lower return due to a capital gains or similar tax. 2 - New Zealand’s education and healthcare system is underfunded and/or operating under business models that are not workable. An example would be the model which funds the new capital needs of District Health Boards. The pressure will increase on Government to spend more in these areas. - Pressures on New Zealand’s future economy will also emanate from overseas. Most of our monies to finance housing mortgages are borrowed from US banks. What if the US banking system collapsed? There are number of military conflicts around the world. What if we are forced to participate? Humanitarian issues continually arise in the Pacific and elsewhere. What is the future costs of our involvement? There will be pressures on the Government’s revenue stream from these sources as well. 2 The guidance in the Terms of Reference is for tax revenue to remain at approximately 30% of GDP. Currently the tax revenue is 32% of GDP and Table 1 shows that if historical spending patterns continue then in 2045 tax revenue must rise to 34% of GDP to achieve fiscal responsibility of a balanced budget. Clearly with the future trends outlined in 1 above, tax revenue as a % of GDP will have to increase beyond 34%. To 40% in 20 years’ time? Treasury to determine probabilities, timetable and dollars required to develop required strategies as these are outside the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference. 3 It is important the Tax Working Group, in its deliberations, does not lose sight of the simplicity and fairness of the current tax regime. For example, New Zealand’s system of widest coverage for Goods and Services Tax is the envy of the world. Introducing exemptions, say for food, will raise a lot of complex definitions and is open to rorts. This means the Government does not simply lose a stream of revenue, it also faces the additional costs of administration of ensuing compliance. 3 4 Areas the Tax Working Group may wish to evaluate to increase local and central governments’ stream of revenue..... - Institutions which are currently exempt now be taxed. Example: retirement villages and the non taxed gains made on turnover of Licences to Occupy; Church superannuation schemes; closer examination that trading profits occurring within Charitable Trusts meet the criteria of charitable - Increased efficiencies of collection within all areas of Government Previously a tax audit could be expected by each business once every 7 years but that does not seem to occur anymore Many new migrants come from backgrounds where paying taxes is more about being caught and then a negotiation follows with the local inspector. Advice on tax obligations as part of the induction process for new arrivals? Penalties for serious tax offenders should be increased as they seem light compared to welfare fraud Hospital admissions for overseas tourists should require prior insurance /credit card payment like most countries overseas (except Australia and UK where a reciprocal arrangement is in place) - Opportunities to increase tax revenue A tax of 5% to be applied to all internet trading within New Zealand. Sales tax of 10% paid by both the seller and purchaser on every property transaction including residential housing. A simpler system to capital gains tax. The buyer of a first home is exempt. Ring fence the tax loss made on any rental property income and hence remove the offset benefit against salary and wage income. Allow Regional Councils to charge (and collect) up to 10% on the room tariff of all hotels/motels/holiday homes/Airbnb to be spent on infrastructure for the community (say 50% of revenue applied to improving water quality) and tourism. This requires holiday homes etc to be registered by local city councils and proper administration put in place. 4 Tourist visas be charged at $100 a day for tourists aged above 25 as part of the focus to change our tourism philosophy from quantity to quality - NZ Superannuation Give 10 years’ notice that the age of eligibility is to be raised to 70. Introduce a means test that the superannuation is not available to those with a separate income of $100 000 or more. Sheltering of income within trusts or companies to achieve capital flows – treat the capital flows as income as part of the means test - Grow the economy To encourage investment and increase employment opportunities lower the company tax rate to 25% - Outside Terms of Reference Is one of the reasons for New Zealand’s low wage economy the fact that any wage increase granted is offset by a lower tax credit and the individual is no better off? Are employers establishing pay structures that maximise the family tax credit at a cost to Government???? Would the payment of a living wage, and the removal of the family tax credit be better for the economy? Introduce a marginal tax rate of 40% for income above $100 000, and increase the trust rate of tax from 33% to 40% Migration needs to be closely controlled with greater use of specified period work permits. New Zealand does not want to add to the potential pool of unemployed which is forecast for the future 5 Implementation of any changes to the present tax regime, as they will generally be adverse in affect, will engender backlash from the various sectors of the population. But over riding same is the fact that the New Zealand population, by and large, is a caring society by world standards. As such they will respond positively to well communicated policies, which when implemented, will improve the lot of deserving people in need. 5 - Adverse changes are more easily made when the country is in a period of growth - If surpluses arise pay down debt and/or add to a rainy-day category for investment in the Cullen Fund (much like Norway) - Maintain the populations’ confidence in the tax gathering system and application of specific taxes. Don’t ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’ as happened with $m160 pa of road charges directed to the Consolidated Fund. - Retain the incentive of reward for effort to keep folk in the workforce. Don’t return to the oppressive tax regime of the early 1980s. - Target the wealthier older population when developing new policies. They have benefited from wage inflation and house inflation. Todays population faces minimal or no wage growth and huge house inflation. - Recognize that 70% of homes in Europe are rented, and that New Zealand’s low wage economy prevents a large proportion of the population from paying of an economic rent. Making up the shortfall of rent falls on the Government and taxpayer. This will be a huge cost area in the long term. 6 Conclusion One envisages a future where those not in employment will still be contributing to society in return for a benefit. Tending to community gardens, running organized sport for adults and children, providing assistance to music and other programmes in schools, planting trees, harvesting grapes and fruit...........interesting times ahead, but we are a resourceful lot and will adapt, survive and be happy.

Land Tax Preferable to Capital Gains Tax on Property. Submission by Peter Sumpter to the Tax Working Group, 2018 Submission: Land Tax by Peter Sumpter Page 1 Tax Working Group Tax Law must be kept simple to avoid loopholes. Capital Gains tax on property is too complex and open to abuse. A suggestion that Land Tax could address problems of foreign ownership. - Trade agreements expect all investors to be treated equally - But tax rebates can be restricted to NZ Resident taxpayers. - The solution to restricting foreign ownership of NZ land is: Tax ALL land but allow bona fide New Zealand resident taxpayers to claim tax back in their tax return. This would make overseas ownership of New Zealand land uneconomic. Proposal: (tax all land) A - That an annual land tax of 4% (specific amount to be debated) of the current rateable value be placed on all land in New Zealand, charged to the registered owner of the land. (The family home is exempt, even if it is a family farm) B - That 100% of the land tax can be claimed as a tax rebate by any New Zealand citizen or permanent resident who lives on the taxed property, provided that no part of the property is rented or leased to any other business or person who is not a direct family member of the land owner. (NZ Companies using land for their own commercial enterprise pay only 5% of the tax) C - That 95% of the land tax can be claimed as a tax rebate by any Company with a majority of New Zealand citizen shareholders and primarily registered in New Zealand for tax purposes, provided that no part of the property is used by, rented or leased to any other business or person. Condition: That the business is a bona fide commercial operation, not primarily a property investment agent. (New Zealand Landlords and property investors pay only 40% of the tax) (Phased in over 3 years.) D - That 60% this tax can be claimed as tax rebate by the owner if they are: 1. A New Zealand resident or 2. A bona fide company registered in New Zealand for tax purposes with a majority shareholding by New Zealand citizens 3. The resulting tax would be almost the same as a capital gains tax (more or less depending on the movement in house prices) but much easier to calculate. It would discourage landlords form owning older homes (sought after by first home buyers) and encourage them to build apartments. Land Tax Preferable to Capital Gains Tax on Property. Submission by Peter Sumpter to the Tax Working Group, 2018 Submission: Land Tax by Peter Sumpter Page 2 Tax Working Group 4. Note: The Landlords’ spokesperson will say that landlords pulling out of the market (and investing in job creating businesses) will cause a shortage in rentals. This is false, since the only way for a landlord to leave the market is to sell the rental to an owner occupier. One fewer rental, one fewer family needing to rent. So it is market neutral. ( Net result: Overseas property speculators pay the full rate of tax. Kiwi property investors pay 40% of the tax and owner occupiers pay no tax.) E - Unpaid tax would attract a 10% p.a. penalty. When the accumulated unpaid tax reaches 30% of the rateable value of the land, the property would have to be sold at auction and the tax recovered. F - The New Zealand Government, Government Departments and Ministries and Local Bodies would be exempt Land Tax. Advantages of this proposal: 1. It avoids the complication that: a. calculation of capital gains is very complex and therefore subject to abuse, and b. capital gains tax must be offset by a capital loss rebate c. Defining the family home is fraught with problems. 2. The tax of 4% p.a. of the value of the land would discourage foreign speculators and offshore ownership of New Zealand land. Foreign ownership of NZ land would be uneconomic. 3. No need to re-negotiate trade agreements to remove foreign ownership of land. The tax applies to everyone equally. The rebate only applies to NZ taxpayers. Like all new taxes it would need to be phased in over several years to allow the market to adjust. Notes to consider. Some existing trade agreements already allow foreign ownership of New Zealand land, and in the interests of trade we do not want to back out of these agreements. This tax would avoid the need for a complex (and therefore open to abuse) capital gains tax. Historically long term, real estate increases in value by about 3% a year in the long term in real terms. In the case of a typical suburban home, this is about 6% of the value of the Land. A 30% CG tax would represent about 1% of the improved value, or Land Tax Preferable to Capital Gains Tax on Property. Submission by Peter Sumpter to the Tax Working Group, 2018 Submission: Land Tax by Peter Sumpter Page 3 Tax Working Group about 2 % of the land value, which equates to the 1.6% paid by property investors in this proposal. (40% of 4% of the land value.) For an apartment, more improvement value, less land value. The taxes would be a smaller percentage of the value of the property, which is fair because the land improves in value while buildings devalue over time. Thus this tax (being on land only) would encourage more efficient land use. In addition, taxing only the land value would have the greatest effect on foreign owned farms, which means that when foreign owned farms (and all real estate) are put up for sale, the prospective purchasers would almost all be New Zealand citizens who could recover the tax. The amount suggested could be phased in over a 6 year period to allow the market to adjust. The suggested 4% of the land value is subject to debate, and may be reviewed as it is phased in. In summary, the long term benefits of this proposal are: 1. A reduction in land sales (including farms) to foreign speculators 2. An increase in the proportion of owner occupied homes 3. An increase in tax received from offshore investors 4. A movement away from speculation on housing and towards investing in job creating industries. 5. Avoids the need for a complex Capital Gains Tax on land which would be very difficult to calculate on an annual basis, 6. Achieves the same goals as a CGT but is simpler, and less prone to avoidance. However it provides a more consistent tax take year on year, and avoids large lump sum tax payments. I urge you to consider the concept outlined in this brief document. Yours Peter Sumpter \[1\]

Our tax system also needs to be more equitable both horizontally and vertically. It needs to ensure current and future revenue needs are met efficiently and equably. In relation to the Maori economic base, it is helpful to recognise that the Treaty of Waitangi confers equal not different rights on Maori. These rights are based on common law and Magna Carta principles (Article 2) and equal rights as Crown subjects under Article 3. The tax system is inequitable for many Maori because of the absence of a capital gains tax as it affects housing affordability. The inalienable nature of much Maori land means owners are precluded from realising tax-free capital gains on land asset sales. Implementation of a comprehensive capital gains (CCG) tax would address this anomaly. Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment The key assessment principles for a good tax system are efficiency, equity, revenue integrity, and the contribution the tax system makes to resource allocation that enhances productivity growth. Defining ‘fairness’ Fairness is largely determined by horizontal and vertical equity. A fair system would look similar to what New Zealand has now, plus a CCG tax, and the alignment of top income, trustee and company tax rates. The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s broad-based, low-rate system should be maintained and enhanced. Maintaining its efficacy and efficiency requires continuous improvement, for example to deal with changes in technology, working life, and new business models. Enhancement requires a CCG tax, and potentially some extension of taxes to change behaviour. It is also desirable to align the top personal income, trust and company tax rates. The existing company tax rate encourages tax sheltering arrangements, and this is both inequitable and leads to resource misallocation. Some will argue for a lower company tax rate on international competitiveness grounds. However, OECD company tax rates have tracked down dramatically since the mid-1980s and yet there is no evidence this has lifted total factor productivity. 2 Others will propose a drop in the top personal income and trustee tax rates to achieve alignment with the company tax rate. However, it is difficult to see how sufficient revenue from other taxes could compensate for the resulting tax foregone. The other way to achieve alignment would be to lift the company tax rate to the 33% top marginal rate for income and trustee tax. This would mean our company tax rates would be near the top of the OECD. Taken in isolation, a 33% corporate tax rate may discourage FDI and reduce capital investment. It is assumed that it would also lead to shifting tax bases offshore to countries with low company tax rates. However, a nation’s competitiveness arises from its overall tax structure, its institutions, resources (including human and natural capital) and how it allocates its resources. Much New Zealand business is foreign-owned, so a disproportionate share of a higher company tax rate would be borne by offshore shareholders. Aggregate capital investment might drop but capital productivity might be enhanced on a smaller capital base. It is possible that IT advances, domestic legislation and international agreements might progressively reduce businesses’ ability to avoid New Zealand company tax. It is suggested that the macro-economic, competitiveness, and tax incidence effects of a 33% company tax be tested through modelling. Taxes and behaviours Excise taxes on ‘bads’ such as tobacco and alcohol are valuable. There may be some modest scope for their extension. Environmental taxes can change behaviour. However, New Zealand already has fuel tax and road user charges, and climate change challenges may be best addressed through regulatory interventions and emissions trading. It is difficult to see how tax instruments might be applied to biodiversity, pest control, erosion, “green space” issues, or non-point water pollution challenges. Environmental taxes therefore have significant limitations in the New Zealand context. Retirement savings Most OECD countries have compulsory savings systems in place for retirement saving purposes. Tax incentives might lift private retirement savings but reduce government savings – yet it is total national savings that matter for us. While it is outside the scope of the Tax Working Party, compulsory savings as part of retirement policy is almost inevitable in New Zealand, given demographics and the unsustainability of existing superannuation provisions. New Zealand has low domestic savings rates and this, coupled with capital misallocation, explains much of our deindustrialisation, poor productivity, weak tradeable sector performance, stagnating living standards, and the social tensions these give rise to. 3 Policies to lift savings must focus on economy-wide productivity. Retirement savings can lift aggregate savings, reduce the real exchange rate, and lift the capital to labour ratio, thereby boosting labour productivity. The Superannuation Act 1974 put in place compulsory savings to supplement a universal pension scheme. Had this Act not been repealed, New Zealand would be far better off now. Ironically, making Kiwisaver compulsory and lifting the contribution rate would get New Zealand close to its 1974 policy settings. Tax incentives to encourage retirement savings would be a political distraction from a much more important policy change that New Zealand needs – some form of compulsory saving. The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance The tax system currently favours the speculative economy and in effect undermines the productive economy. This balance can only be addressed through a CCG tax, top marginal tax rate alignment, and other policies such as compulsory savings. Tax and business New Zealand has made good progress in minimising compliance costs. Continuous improvement is needed, including through making effective use of digital and other technology. The tax system has some modest implications for maintaining natural capital. Lack of a land tax is probably environmentally beneficial. Inalienable Maori land creates incentives for long-term sustainable use, since owners do not have the option of selling land to realise capital gains. A capital gains tax might have some lock-in effects on land ownership, and lead to owners taking more of a longer-term sustainable approach to managing their land assets. Some business forms benefit from low effective tax rates for a range of reasons. Some ‘charitable’ businesses are tax advantaged, as are land and rental property owners. Divergence between the top income, trust and company tax rates, and structures such as PIEs create inequities. Thinking outside the current system The main inconsistencies are lack of a CCG tax, and the divergence between top income, trust and company tax rates. The most important to address is capital gains. Some new behavioural taxes might be justified, but they will have minor revenue effects. Hypothecating tax revenue misaligns revenue and means it is spent inefficiently. Wealth taxes are ineffective, and are on the way out in OECD countries. They should not be further considered. 4 Specific challenges Housing affordability High net inwards migration and restrictions on new housing developments are the main causes of low housing affordability and related social depravation. However, housing costs are also inflated by the lack of capital gains tax on rental property and associated speculative housing investments. A CCG tax would have a modest but positive effect on housing affordability. Capital gains tax A CCG tax is justified on horizontal and to some extent vertical equity grounds. There are also strong productivity arguments favouring such a tax. New Zealand’s relative economic decline since the early 1970s and its stagnating productivity largely results from its low domestic savings rates and from capital misallocation. The absence of a capital gains tax means scarce domestic savings are invested in inflating the price of existing inelastic assets such as farmland and housing rather than in wealth-creating business growth. Capital misallocation reduces productivity and therefore living standards. For example, current tax rules mean that farmers have incentives to pay interest rather than to pay tax. They have incentives to borrow money to buy more land, and to recoup the cost in future through tax-free capital gains. In 2017 this misallocation saw around $40 billion in on-farm debt alone in the dairy industry. How much better off we would be if such capital was applied to new wealth creation and economic diversification! The main economic impact of a CCG tax will be to improve capital allocation in the economy, and therefore lift productivity. Land tax While fine in principle, a land tax is probably not feasible in New Zealand because there would be too many politicised claims for exemption. These exemptions would likely include residential land, the conservation estate and Maori land. The only significant productivity benefit might be to encourage lifestyle property owners to make more economic use of their land; however this putative benefit is not guaranteed and could only be marginal. A land tax imposed on lifestyle blocks owners might have negative environmental impacts, for example encouraging a switch from protected natural areas to more intensive farming operations. Environmental taxation Environmental and other taxes to change behaviour are supported. However, there are significant attribution problems and compliance cost challenges. Given New Zealand’s industrial structure, the revenue gains from environmental taxes would be minimal. 5 Progressive company tax We should not romanticise the contribution of small businesses to the economy. If anything, the international evidence suggests that larger businesses are more productive than smaller ones. Even start-up and venture capital-supported businesses are typically based on ideas, technologies and skilled people from either larger businesses or public research institutions. Progressive company tax would increase the complexity of the tax system, and would be gamed by businesses. It should not be supported. GST exemptions for particular goods Our GST system is broad-based and efficient. The only exemptions should be for goods or services where GST cannot be levied efficiently. Beyond this, exemptions for other particular goods would encourage political lobbying based on questionable public good or other analytical grounds. For example, would exemptions for food include luxury foods? Who defines ‘luxury’? If healthy foods were exempted, who would define whether a particular combinational food such as an apple pie, muesli bar or fruit ice cream was healthy or not? Exempting specific goods from GST would increase administrative costs and reduce revenue, with negligible public benefits.

I am frustrated by the limitation of the Group’s Terms of Reference which exclude consideration of the Personal Tax System and seems to be in conflict with the assertion on page 20 that fairness can only be assessed when the Tax System and the Transfer System are considered as a whole. My submission follows the questions posed in Appendix 3 of the Background Paper. I have recorded the questions in italics. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to long-term? I agree with the eight items listed on page 9. The Tax System needs to retain simplicity; that all income earned or created be taxed on the same basis; that the deficiencies of the present system be constantly addressed. What of these are most important? The changing nature of work; need for equality; that Labour income and Capital income be consistently taxed. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities identified? The tax system should be changed so that Labour income and Capital income are taxed on the same basis. How could tikanga Maori....help create a more future-focussed tax system? Our Treaty obligations are such that tikanga Maori must be catered for in a future-focussed tax system. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Fairness and consistency; that all income, both Labour and Capital is annually assessed. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? \[1\] \[1\] 2 Fairness must be defined by considering both the tax and transfer systems. I agree with the principles of vertical and horizontal equity (fairness) as outlined an pages 19 and 20 of the Background Paper. What would a fair tax system look like? One in which each taxpayer entity is paying tax on a consistent basis. ...‘broad based, low rate’ system. Is it still the best approach for New Zealand? Yes Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? Yes. Like the tobacco tax. I would support a sugar drinks tax. A tax on housing capital profits would modify behaviour by discouraging speculation. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? I’m not in favour. I would support the reintroduction of financial incentives by Government to encourage membership of and contributions to Kiwi Saver. Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? No. Housing is part of the speculative economy and investment in that to achieve capital gains has skewed the market and rendered many houses unaffordable to many New Zealanders. Income from housing (other than the family home) must be included in the tax regime. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? If these costs are those of compliance and administration, then I believe that effort must continue to minimise costs on business. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? I don’t think the tax system should be used to maintain natural capital. Other mechanisms should be used to protect soil or allocate water use. Are there types of businesses benefitting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? I think the time has come for businesses run by charities to be fully taxable. What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? That capital income is largely not taxed. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? 3 Yes. Capital income of all types must be brought into the tax system. This may not be a new tax, in that it should be treated as income like Labour income. It will produce more tax for the Government. I would like to see a reduction in the rate of GST to match the tax take from fully taxing Capital income. How and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? The fact that capital gains are non-taxable at the moment has encouraged speculation which has contributed to excessive growth of house prices. With owners purchasing at higher prices for housing to rent out, they have increased rent to maintain their return. Many people can no longer afford these high rents. I believe this is the most scandalous thing that has happened in New Zealand in recent years. Taxing Capital income from this sector will promote greater housing affordability by eliminating speculation and treating income from investment in this sector in the same way as other investment income Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax? No, as I would like to see Capital income being included in the definition of taxable income. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax? I am not is favour of a separate tax as I want to see all capital income being taxed. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? The environment is the issue of the day. I am in favour of formulating taxes/exemptions for industry/activities that are harmful to the environment and conversely to offer tax credits to industry/activities that reduce harmful effects. These taxes and credits could offset one another! Should the tax system do more to support small business? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? I don’t see the need for more support to small business. I would argue that this is counter- productive to keeping the system simple. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? I am not in favour of exclusions, on the grounds of keeping the system simple. I do favour taxing gains in Capital income and offsetting that tax revenue by reducing the rate of GST. SUMMARY 1. The basic structure of the NZ Tax System is sound. 2. However, capital gains need to be included in the definition of taxable income, in particular as regards capital gains from the housing sector (excluding the family home). 3. That taxation revenue arising from item 2 be used to reduce the rate of GST.

Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Submission to the 2018 Tax Working Group 2018-03-06 Simon Louisson (individual) A good portion of TWG terms of reference relate to the concept of whether the NZ tax system is fair and I submit that it is fundamentally unfair as there is little to no tax on the increase in the value of assets while all income from wages and salaries attracts tax. For example, my family trust makes hundreds of thousands of dollars most years and attracts almost no tax because the vast bulk of that wealth increase (effectively income) comes from the rise in the value of shares, which is not taxable. This is just completely unfair from a societal viewpoint. Household A earns $200k from income and pays around 25% of that in tax while Household B earns the same from selling shares that have risen in value, legally pays no tax. Just as important as fixing the unfairness of the system is that if those who are currently not contributing their fair share, via their legal tax avoidance through capital gains, are brought into the tax system, then the vast majority of people (~80%) would be better off. The latter point is crucial, in selling tax reform and countering the hysteria (they want to put a tax on your car/boat) that would inevitably be promoted by those with a vested interest in preserving the tax-free status of assets. The side-effect of our unfair system is that NZ has low productivity because of misdirected investment. Most of NZ’s available assets are directed towards the most obvious method of avoiding tax, which happens to be the property market because the tax system is also unfairly skewed in favour of property investment. There has also been over-investment in farming, where people invest very large sums into farms that make very poor returns over the medium-to-long term but they achieve very high non-taxable gains when they sell their farms. This contravenes the concept in your terms of reference relating to finding the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy. Another obvious side-effect of our unfair and skewed tax system has been the spiralling property market bubble that is both dangerous to the integrity of the financial system and has meant that owning a house has shifted beyond the reach of someone on the average wage. A house-price-to- income ratio of 9x in Auckland is undesirable from a social point of view, unproductive from an economic point of view and dangerous from a banking point of view. New Zealand is one of the few countries in the developed world not to have a wealth or proper capital gains tax. The so called “Bright Line” test is a joke, even when extended to five years. Firstly the name is confusing (deliberately so, as the previous government did not wish to be seen to be introducing a weak form of CGT). Secondly, most investors are quite happy to wait even five years when house prices keeps heading north. Then they pay no tax on their gain. The test should have no time limit – it should apply no matter when a second house is sold. 2 The clear solution to the problem of unfairness and widening the tax base is a comprehensive wealth tax on all assets (including the family home or at least on the value above the median house price). All assets should attract tax equivalent to a 5-year government bond. So for example, if you owned a $100,000 section, that would be deemed to have earned $5000 (assuming a government bond rate of 5%) and the tax on that would be at your marginal tax rate of say 33%, which means your tax bill for the asset would be $1650. It is relatively straight-forward process to value your assets – most people do an assessment every time they take out insurance. The beauty of a wealth tax is double pronged – firstly it eliminates the unfairness of the current regime. Secondly, it will change investment behaviour so that investment will be directed towards productive assets that achieve a better rate of return that government bonds. This will discourage over-investment in the property market (where rents are nowhere near an adequate return on capital) and will likely see investment in unproductive farms retreat. The most important part about introducing a comprehensive wealth tax is that there should be an offsetting reduction in either income tax or the rate of GST. It has to be shown that the majority of people will be better off. The only ones who will be worse off will be people like myself who are currently able to get away with not paying their fair share. It is absolutely crucial in selling the concept to the public that people should be totally clear that there will be no net increase in the government’s tax take. As the effects of the wealth tax kick in, there must be a process set in concrete whereby either income tax or GST would be cut by the amount collected in the wealth tax. Communications and selling the concept in terms of its fairness would be vital to the introduction of such a system. Recent polls show the majority of New Zealanders support a tax on assets. https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/over-half-new-zealanders-support-capital-gains- tax-properties-other-than-family-home-poll This poll shows that most people understand the current system is unfair and so long as the new system is shown to be fair and not seen as a tax grab (ie that there is an inbuilt system for offsetting the government’s gain from the wealth tax by offsetting tax cuts) they will welcome a comprehensive wealth tax, particularly if it is shown that most will be better off. Other points: • Progressive tax system I think that as a general principle the tax system should encourage progressiveness. New Zealand as a society has in the past thrived on being an equal society where the disadvantaged have had similar opportunities to the advantaged thanks in the main to having a progressive tax system where the better off pay more for public facilities than the less well off. 3 Equality has diminished in the post Rogernomics era. Introducing a comprehensive wealth tax would mitigate the necessity of increasing the progressiveness from the current set-up. • Gift tax The abolition of the Gift Tax was simply another way for the wealthy to avoid playing tax or for them to pass on their wealth to their children. It should be restored and the old $27,000 allowance should be inflation adjusted. • Trusts Most trusts are used as a vehicle for avoiding or minimising tax. They are almost exclusively used by the well off to shield assets from Inland Revenue. The TWG should assess how much tax is lost to the system through people using trusts and should make recommendations about a comprehensive review of trust law to minimise this activity • Base erosion and profit shifting The failure of large foreign companies to pay their fair share of tax in this country (and others) undermines the tax system and unfairly disadvantages local firms paying their fair share. I believe it is quite simple to bring the likes of Google and Amazon into the NZ tax system. Basically, after say a two-year set-up period, any foreign company should be taxed at the NZ company tax rate, based on its NZ sales and taking into account the profit to sales ratio of the parent company. The onus should be on the company to show why it should not pay the full rate of tax due based on an assumed rate of profit/sales in line with the parent company. If the company can show it is making fresh investment in New Zealand that is legitimately tax-deductible, then well and good. For example in the case of Google, its parent company, Alphabet, in the last quarter had gross income of $32.3 billion and net profit of $6.b billion – a 20% profit ratio to sales. In 2016 it is estimated Google had $12.2m sales in New Zealand but paid only $356,000 in tax. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=11999548 Under my proposal, it would have had to pay $683,000 (assuming a profit ratio of 20% on sales and a 28% tax rate on those sales) unless it could show it had offsetting new investment in New Zealand that should reduce that amount.

Chris Boxall Tax Working Group Secretariat Via email 2 April 2018 Re: Submission on the Future of Tax – Background Paper Dear Tax Working Group, This submission makes four key recommendations, as summarised below (and discussed thereafter):  Diagonal Equity must be factored into the personal income tax system to make it fairer.  Hypothecated taxes should be introduced, at least for primary health.  GST should be applied in a more targeted way to incentivise healthier choices.  The government should be advised that the terms of reference perpetuate intergenerational inequality. 1. Diagonal Equity must be factored into the personal income tax system to make it fairer For families, the personal income tax regime is unfair. It is also prejudiced against women and children. This is against the principles of fairness and equity which is at the heart of the review. The issue arises when two parents earn different incomes to fund the costs of the family, yet each is taxed individually without regard for household dynamics. E.g. the average household income is approximately $100k gross. 1 The difference in take home pay between this being earned by one earner (with the other a stay-at-home parent), and this being earned by two earners equally is approximately $8k. 2 The tax system therefore undermines the role of the stay-at-home parent, who, about 85% of the time, is the mother. 3 There are three main problems with this: a. It increases the vulnerability of children by dis-incentivising one parent to stay at home and look after the children. This has various negative impacts. 4 b. It goes against the current feminist movement by giving households where women do unpaid work in the home less cash-in-hand to fund family costs. This is preposterous. If the government is serious about pay equity and feminism, then this needs addressing. c. A new economic theory is required because the problem is not apparent if one approaches this from the perspective of horizontal or vertical equity. 1 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/98016625/auckland-tops-income-table-as-households-earn-more 2 https://www.paye.net.nz/calculator.html 3 https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/parenting/family-life/66982714/Stay-at-home-dads-Men-about-the-house 4 E.g. it erodes opportunities for precious bonding, increases the strain on grandparents, potentially limits sporting, cultural and social opportunities for children, and, anecdotally, increases screen time. \[1\] Let’s define Diagonal Equity as being “the principle that households with legal dependent children should receive the same amount of take-home-pay regardless of how many parents earn income for that household”. The solution is simple for qualifying households. E.g. for a two-parent household, at the end of the tax year, gross up the household income, divide it by two, calculate personal income tax as if both parents earned the household income equally, then apply a tax credit to the relevant person to achieve diagonal equity. Some changes to the definition of diagonal equity would be required so as not to penalise children or women in sole parent situations, but this could be worked through. The definition could also be changed to refer to legal dependents (i.e. any dependent, not just children), which would create fairer and more equitable outcomes for, for example, parents caring for disabled adult children or aged parents who need full time care. Such changes would have a material positive impact on quality of life for all involved. Diagonal equity is a great solution that does not change the income tax rate bands. It will, however, result in less tax take by the government that will need compensating for somehow – but there will always be allocative changes when fairness and equity are improved. New Zealand could, and should, lead the world in adapting its tax system to minimise the vulnerability of children and to be equal to each sex. 2. Hypothecated taxes should be introduced, at least for primary health The ability for a hypothecated tax to achieve qualitative benefits in New Zealand is proven by the ACC model which helps to influence our culture – i.e. people don’t really sue. On the premise that hypothecated taxes work, this should be explored further in relation to two core government costs – superannuation and healthcare. Table 1 suggests that New Zealand will not be able to afford both in the future at current service levels without finding a way to pay for it. The solutions might be: - For superannuation, perhaps make Kiwisaver compulsory, and complement this with other non-tax items 5 that should be brought into the scope of the review to enable a holistic solution to be explored. - For health, the outcome we should be looking for as a country is a seismic shift into primary health care (which should minimise reliance on secondary and tertiary care in the long run). To achieve this, NZ could tax earners maybe an extra 2% pa on income tax (like for the ACC levy), which could be capped at a certain amount, and provide everyone (including adult non-earners) with a base refund (of, say, 90% of contributions, subject to a minimum amount) at the end of the tax year if a doctor and a dentist certify that they have performed an annual medical and examination respectively. That refund could reduce by 30% for each pre-set primary health care risk factor (like being obese, being a smoker, or having drugs in their system (the factors can be amended to reflect changing health priorities)) that a doctor certifies the person as having at the time of their check-up. No medical or examination, no refund. The additional tax raised would fund the minimum rebate amounts. 5 Such as, in time, reassessing the eligibility age or legislating for the government to keep funding superannuation on a linear trajectory to meet the relevant long-term target. A hypothecated health tax 6 is an awesome way for the government to incentivise primary health by making part of people’s incomes or benefits subject to them taking ownership of their own health. The model should result in potentially huge savings in secondary and tertiary healthcare spending in the long-term. There may be a short-term increase in demand for secondary and tertiary healthcare due to increased referrals from primary health care. However, the earlier interventions should lower the life-cycle cost of the underlying health issue and obviate some health issues completely. 3. GST should be applied in a more targeted way to incentives healthier choices If GST is applied in a more targeted way, it could act like a hypothecated tax without increasing the overall tax take. For example, GST should be excluded on all unprocessed foods or healthy staples like bread and pasta, and be increased (even with targeted increases) for processed foods. 4. The government should be advised that the terms of reference perpetuate intergenerational inequality The paper cites an intergenerational equality problem a number of times, yet fails to materially discuss this or suggest solutions to the problem in Table 1. The tax system should address intergenerational inequality and fairness on the back of changing demographics, all of which are central to the points in the paper’s executive summary. The solution may be a model whereby in addition to a progressive income tax, an additional income tax rate is applied to people’s income if their age falls within range where that range has been identified 7 as being disproportionately large compared to the average. E.g. a baby boomer could pay the relevant band of income tax + 2%. The extra tax could be ring-fenced, invested, and applied to services for those people when they really need those services (i.e. without, at that time, taxing a proportionately smaller group of workers). Regardless, it appears that intergenerational equality cannot be solved without bringing into the scope of the review items that have specifically been excluded such as raising income tax rates, inheritance tax and the adequacy of the personal tax system. This point should be made to the government, and a request should be made to limit the items beyond the scope of the review to just the family home or the land under it or items that the IRD’s review is addressing. Conclusion We should tweak our tax structure to minimise the impact on the vulnerable, to fit with the feminist movement, and to specifically incentivise primary healthcare and healthy lifestyle outcomes. I am happy for the Working Group and the secretariat to contact me to discuss the points raised. If possible please redact my address prior to publication of my submission. Yours sincerely Chris Boxall 6 That also has horizontal and vertical equity 7 Maybe by Treasury \[1\]

March 26, 2018 1 Submission to the New Zealand Tax Working Group Rapid Advances in Robotics and Digital Technologies Changing the Nature of Work: The New Zealand tax system needs to adapt Dr Matt Boyd\* (Adapt Research Ltd), Professor Nick Wilson\*\* (University of Otago) Background The authors have published a recent review article on AI in the New Zealand context (Boyd & Wilson 2017) and have an interest in socio-economic inequalities in our society (Wilson et al, 2018a, 2018b). Digital technologies and the use of AI are likely to disrupt the nature of work, eliminate jobs, lead to widening inequality, and threaten tax revenue. We canvas these and other issues in our recent review of AI (Boyd & Wilson 2017). Importantly, new jobs created may not be jobs that New Zealand’s labour market is equipped to capitalise upon, given this nation’s relatively low productivity and weakness in key domains such as mathematics (OECD, 2017). Any widening in inequality would be a major policy concern given the relationship between socio- economic conditions and health (Marmot and Allen, 2014) and inequality may threaten societal and democratic functioning. New Zealand has a long history of health inequalities by income. Low socio- economic position has been reported in a large study to be the third most important risk factor for premature death (Stringhini et al. 2017). Summary: •Rapid advances in digital technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) threaten to widen wealth and income inequalities, and may lead to an increase in levels of transient or ongoing unemployment. •In the face of these risks New Zealand needs a tax system that will remain fair and provide a reliable revenue stream for government. •We favour pursuing the following three broad changes to the tax system: 1. Changes to ensure that successful companies in the digital economy return a portion of revenue to the society that has facilitated their success ( revenue integrity): •Progressive company taxation so that thriving and larger companies contribute proportionally •Tighter rules to ensure companies pay their fair share of tax •Company tax deductions for training and job creation to draw people into emerging careers 2. Changes to mitigate losses for people made worse off by technological change (vertical equity): •A tax free threshold for income tax •Removing GST from essential goods and services (with revenue being replaced by higher pollution taxes (especially on carbon) and higher excise taxes on hazardous products such as tobacco, alcohol, junk food and soft drinks) 3. A new tax initiative to ensure those without work have genuine opportunities to contribute (mitigating wealth inequality) •A transaction tax (ideally with a cashless society) •A universal basic income or negative taxation to unconditionally supplement low or no income We explain our reasoning below. \[1\] March 26, 2018 2 The New Zealand tax system needs to reflect this uncertainty about technology, so that those who gain in this unpredictable environment contribute more tax revenue and those who lose are protected from harmful effects. Importantly, because of the unpredictability of technological advance, individuals cannot be blamed for missing out while others succeed. Our proposals and supportive arguments Proposal Supportive arguments Introducing a progressive company tax rate It is larger companies that are likely to benefit the most from sophisticated automation and intelligent digital systems. Some of these tools will disrupt industries in ways we can’t predict. So consideration should be given to having a differential company tax rate by company size, since size is a crude proxy of capacity to make use of robots or AI. Companies aiming to maximize profit will not necessarily promote the public good such as a fully employed workforce. A progressive company tax would support small businesses with a very low tax rate, thereby encouraging innovation and new kinds of work and careers. Do more to stop large multinational corporations avoiding their tax obligations Large multi-national companies (including tech companies such as Google) have the capacity to avoid tax. As such the New Zealand Government needs to consider laws that ensure that these companies pay the appropriate tax level. This may require new international treaties – and if so New Zealand (with its ranking as the least corrupt nation in the world) is well placed to play a leadership role. Company tax deductions for training and new job creation There is a risk of jobs disappearing with technological advance. Other new kinds of jobs may or may not be created. We need a stimulus to encourage the development of new kinds of work, and subsidised training so those who lose jobs can readily retrain. Removing GST from essential goods and services To prevent any increase in inequality, essential goods such as healthy food, a certain level of electricity for home heating etc, and services such as essential care (childcare) and internet access should be exempt from GST. This will lessen the burden on anyone who becomes unemployed due to technology. An increase in taxes on pollutants (eg, carbon, waste) and taxes on other hazardous products (eg, junk food, soft drinks, tobacco and alcohol) is probably justifiable and could help ensure total government tax revenue remains steady. (See also the transaction tax detailed below). A tax free threshold applied to income tax The burden of displacement falls disproportionately on those with low incomes (and low wealth). The tax system should provide respite for those on low incomes by lowering income tax for people on low-incomes (and removing it from welfare payments) while ensuring welfare support is adequate to eliminate poverty (see next three items). A transaction tax on all financial and retail transactions To ensure that financial sectors (currently exempt from GST) pay a service tax, and prevent online transactions avoiding tax burden here in New Zealand. A transaction tax (at a fraction of one per cent) could be used to help support a negative taxation system (see final item below). Investigate moving to a fully electronic money system A cashless money system has potential advantages of helping to minimise tax avoidance and evasion, and may reduce some types of crime. Mobile phone transaction applications could ensure that events such as local farmers markets can still thrive in a cashless society. Indeed, there is already a strong trend to cashless societies in some high-income countries (eg, under 15% of transactions involve cash in Sweden) – so this issue is rapidly become more relevant. Investigate having a fair and reasonable unconditional basic income (UBI) Given the relationship between low socio-economic status and poor health, and also the threat of unemployment or widening inequalities due to emerging technology, those who are on the lowest incomes, or no incomes, need assistance. Some unconditional income support is warranted. This could be an unconditional income to the unemployed only, or a negative taxation system for all, as a resilience measure against unexpected labour force disruptions. Many productive industries are currently unpaid, and a UBI or negative taxation support would create opportunities in areas such as child and elder care, artistic endeavour, amateur sport, or environmental clean up to name a few. We recommend that the NZ Government fund real world experiments along these lines with a selected group of people earning less than half the median income (as in some other jurisdictions eg, Finland (Henley 2018)). These measures coupled with low company tax on small business may stimulate growth. March 26, 2018 3 We recognise the ideas in the table above are not all strongly supported by an evidence base and some are relatively hypothetical. Hence there might be a role for further research and pilot programmes (eg, for the UBI) to determine more precisely the benefits and costs before final adoption at a national level. Conclusions The New Zealand tax system should be upgraded so that unpredictable technological change and the use of AI does not disrupt the ability of all New Zealanders to flourish. The system must provide resilience against income loss, and prevent substantive inequality emerging. This is not only a matter of justice, but the sustained functioning of modern democracies may depend on reducing overall inequalities in incomes, wealth, education and health in society. New Zealand has an opportunity to model progressive and fair risk mitigation strategies to the world through it’s tax reform. The authors of this submission have substantial experience with doing high quality and concise presentations and welcome any invitation to speak about the suggestions in this submission.

April 2018. From Toby Heale. Cha llenges, risks and Opportunities When Indirect taxes were introduced in Europe it was claimed that they would herald the shift from direct to indirect taxation. Universally we now have both and at high rates. All government is addicted to spending. Some have a worse addiction than others but it remains a truth. There will never be enough tax income. I regret that I must step outside your terms of reference so soon, but it is necessary to strike a balance between raising tax and government waste. Naturally, one man’s spending is another man’s policy, but waste exists. I cite NZTA funding ECan to run busses that are contracted from a Christchurch City Council owned company. The busses lose so much money (and are not patronized) that ECan must subsidize them further. The willingness to pay tax evaporates when such pluralism and waste is exposed as it always is, but always at the last possible moment. By that I mean there is a posture to protect the status quo rather than to reform. That’s human, but it is not supportable with taxpayer money. New Zealand does not deserve to earn the reputation of being profligate, but New Zealand is not taking proper steps to root out waste, so it risks earning that reputation. \[1\] \[1\] All tax revenue will be harder to raise once that reputation has been awarded. Changing Demographics. A great deal is being written about the increase in older people as a percentage of the population and you can see observers extrapolate their conclusions. That has to be wrong. The growth in older people in the population is a one-off. It is a shift that is all, there can be no comfort in the notion that old people will go on growing in percentage. Only increases in lifespan will do that. Once the average age reflects the increased lifespan the one-off effect will have been absorbed and, like inflation, it will pass out of the statistics. When that happens, wealth will flow from the old to the young as it used to, and houses will be released in the same percentage as they were. Naturally there are intermediate steps, like retirement homes, that alter the figures somewhat, but they will not alter the proposition. Immigration is the other driver of demographic change, but immigration can only progress at the speed of assimilation. Multi- culturalism does not work according to Angela Merkle. It produces ghettoes. While no one will tolerate forced integration, it must be accepted that immigrants have come to New Zealand because they want to be here. Promoting diversity is to promote schism in society when there is every reason to hope for homogeny. Current policy can be seen as hostile to efficient government use of taxpayer interests. Maori interests have particular place in New Zealand history and life, but it is difficult to ‘see’ a Maori economy as a separate entity from New Zealand’s. It is certainly not tolerable to grant any part of the community special rights or tax breaks. However, to correct any imbalance in wealth creation or retention, emphasis could be placed on education and that could be dealt with efficiently (see below). Government revenue will collapse from existing sources, principally fuel duty and revenue from electric power. The law of diminishing returns will certainly apply to fuel if the government increases duty, because there will be a surge in electric car purchase. Yes, they are expensive, but in time, more will enter the second-hand chain, and as the product goes up the ‘S’ curve new car prices will reduce. The balance of payments will be beneficially impacted by lower fuel imports and that will be critical because, as interest rates rise in the near future, it will be necessary to repay foreign debt. The responsibility to repay debt will be a great drag on government’s ability to spend. Income from power-stations will also reduce as consumers switch to solar-panels. These prices will collapse in the coming years as perovskite panels are printed on a roll. It will serve as a tax break to consumers, and government would be ill-advised to take it back. Therefore, government must, first watch every penny, and second it must contain its appetites. Containing its appetite means that government must face its Bottomless Pits and see them for what they are. (see below). Reforms are essential in this area because the current situation will run into an uncontrollable behemoth. When considering the cost of health care, it is worth bearing in mind that the British National Health is Europe’s largest employer. Climate Change is arguably not caused by man-made carbo dioxide emissions, unless you consider the big change, which is that in the 1800s there were approximately 1.7bn people on the plant and now there are approximately 7.1bn. But you would have to include woman-made carbon dioxide emissions, however much that might offend political correctness, for which I have no time. However, global warming does exist and it is likely to continue for another one hundred years or so if you believe (as I do) in the cyclical argument. You do not ‘fight’ it. That is like fighting night and day or high and low tide. It is a childish attitude to a severe problem. Disease control will be an important dimension as New Zealand is faced with importing diseases and pests previously unknown here. These will threaten agriculture and humans alike. There is an answer that will prove to be the cheapest and it is to use New Zealand’s isolation to advantage. New Zealand should ensure that its neighbours in the Pacific are disease free. It must be clear that if they are not neither will New Zealand be. But if they are, New Zealand has an opportunity to use notifications nearby as an early warning system. The changes in weather are just as likely to be more benign as less benign. There can be no assurance that the weather will necessarily be worse. There will be more water available from the hydro dams (because power will come from the sun) for irrigation and that may be necessary. Regardless of environmental concerns there can be no tolerance of any policy that risks farmland becoming a dust-bowl. So far as pollution is concerned, New Zealand has an old stink-pot vehicle population. That will erode in time and if fuel prices are increased that erosion will be faster. Financial Capital is weak. Capital formation is poor with a weak presence by the New Zealand Sock Exchange. There is far too much reliance on funds from (foreign-owned) banks and when interest rates rise, as they will in the fullness of time, the pain suffered by New Zealand business, and particularly agriculture, will be severe to back- breaking. Because government is also funded on the short-term there will be little ability of central government to help domestic business. Local government finances risk becoming a shambles. A domestic bond market is urgently required and borrowers be brought to understand the advantage (especially at these rates) of locking in finance for twenty years or so. Because this is urgent it will almost certainly require tax concessions on coupon payment to increase acceptance. Therefore, withholding tax has no future. Human Capital has been debased by a politically motivated emphasis on Human Rights rather than on Human Duties, Obligations and Responsibilities. In other words, the subjugation of the population rather than protection of its citizenship. This is a world-wide shift started by President Carter and used by the American negotiating team to advantage at the Helsinki and Reykjavik disarmament talks. The emphasis on rights was not expected to leak into domestic American life. However, the English-speaking world has no immune system that protects against Americanisms. For instance, the word ‘harassment’ has been imported, when attached to the word ‘sexual’, complete with the American stressing. It remains true that Citizens are cheaper to look after than Subjects. Citizens (who are led or, even misled, politically) are inclined to take control of their lives, to make their own decisions and to make the best of what they have. Subjects (who prefer to be ruled) require to be provided for and they know their rights. This observation is not politicized as far as I know, but it easily could be. If this proposition is accepted and progress to correct the perceived imbalance is seen as desirable, it is important that it is not politicized. Social Capital stems from a lack of corruption. But I caution that the closer corruption is to you the more difficult it is to see. From ‘The Old Pals Act’ to hiring environmentalists to police the ‘issue of concern’ in a development, rather than to allow them to protest about it, demonstrates corruption. New Zealand is a small community and a great deal is accomplished on the old boy (and old girl) network. It represents social capital of a sort because it’s how things get done. But it is dangerous today, because it tilts the playing field against those who are new to New Zealand and they will become an ever- increasing percentage of the population. Integration and not diversity is the key decision to make sure New Zealand business and society become homogenous. The Design of the Current Tax System needs some review for changing circumstances. And the claim that it is a low-rate tax area should not go unchallenged. Adding all imposts together produces an expensive country to live in. The law of diminishing returns is probably closer to hand than politicians may admit. Social Taxation like social engineering is a disaster. This is usually an avenue for partial activism and the suppression of tobacco use is a classic example. While no one claims smoking is in not harmful, it can be made less so. By prohibiting the addition of any chemicals to either the paper or the tobacco in a cigarette, the nature of smoking cigarettes changes, because after one puff the cigarette goes out. One cigarette would do the work of possibly ten. I asked if there had been a study that found, or failed to find, any relationship between the suppression of tobacco use and the rise of Meth-Amphetamine use. I did not get an answer. But the cost of Meth-Amphetamine use must be added to the cost of tobacco and the name changed to the cost of smoking. Further, if the person driving towards me was on any drug, including sedatives, I would prefer it was tobacco. There is every reason to reduce duty on a chemical free cigarette. It is worth emphasising also that smoking and drinking are reaction, usually to induced stress. The activists are treating the symptom, not the cause. Maybe the activists themselves are the cause. Capital Gains Tax was introduced into the UK by Harold Wilson as a sop to the Unions who wanted to ‘get the bosses’. It is regarded as revenue neutral by everyone involved except the accountants who can be relied upon to be avid supporters. It is so complicated to levy and calculate that even the revenue (in the UK) does not challenge the numbers. Instead, it selects an accountant and raids it pour encourager les autres. As a result, no one trusts the tax authorities and that is territory the tax authorities in New Zealand have been in before and have escaped from. I am convinced they have no desire or intention to return there. Capital Gains taxes are a light-weight sop to activism. They are a heavy-weight burden to those who have to comply and given that accountants fees are tax deductible it will be the revenue that winds up paying for it. Also, very careful study of the allowance for capital losses may change the appetite for such a tax. Other countries have made this mistake. There is no need to follow them, especially while the political will and ability to repeal bad legislation is so weak. Distributional Outcomes touches on what government cannot do. If it is accepted that when demand is put in the private sector wealth is generated, while if the same demand is put into the state sector wealth is drained, there needs to be more caution about de-distributing tax money. It is clear from the charts on pages 31 &32 that the current policy is massively wasteful. Deciles 1-3 don’t have disposable income but they are taxed. Money is then transferred back to them. It is necessary and urgent that these deciles are given a chance of standing on their own feet and able to make a success of their lives. There should be a personal allowance and I don’t believe that would be questioned. The basic rate should be reduced to one percent to prevent the audit trail from going cold (back-dating that would be a vote-winner, but we are not discussing that -yet), and it would be accepted that the cost of collection exceeded the revenue generated. But the downstream information would be used to set to the parameters necessary for an equitable outcome. The basic pay-rate is now $15.60 an hour making $624 for a basic forty-hour week. That translates to $31,200.00 gross per annum on a 50-working-week year. It is a political decision where the one per cent rate ends, but it would seem sensible that it did not end below $31,200.00. It must be borne in mind that Deciles 4 & 5 only break-even (Fig 11) and still require support (Fig10). The golden rule must be that taxation is affordable. Usually it is ‘the rich’ who complain, but in the current situation it is the poorest who are being hurt the most. Rich and poor. Although not appropriate in this section it is necessary to consider that a lack of taxable allowance on domestic staff is hindering employment in a group unable to find it elsewhere. There are many people who could find employment in domestic service and discharge their duties with diligence, pride and a sense of purpose. They may be able to achieve little else in life. But because of political prejudice they cannot find employment in domestic service because the employer cannot offset the cost of domestic full-time staff against their personal taxation. It is an example of political bigotry getting in the way of safe and reliable employment for people it is otherwise proving difficult to employ. Thinking outside the current system with a few alteration New Zealand has an admirable situation to start from. The American adage, ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ applies. Complication in taxes is to be avoided and New Zealand has some taxes to get rid of. The pie chart on page 24 (Fig 4) demonstrates that four taxes yield 5%. There is every justification to assert they cost more to collect then they yield and they should be abandoned. Simplicity is key. If there is any concern, ‘where will the money come from?’ see Bottomless Pits below. FIF is nonsense, as is any capital tax. New Zealand is short of domestic capital. The country is inventive and its entrepreneurs and inventors must seek their investment finance in the USA and elsewhere. That is truly sad and it a true betrayal of all the country stands for because ownership is transferred for the investment. It is imperative to leave capital alone and help it grow. If the revenue could go without domestic withholding taxes then do so. Perhaps withholding tax-free bonds for domestic borrowers would be an avenue to study. All the councils are bust or nearly so. Rising interest rates might do it for some of them. They need to fund long-term and domestically. New Zealand must, as in must, develop its quoted, trading, domestic capital market. There is so much nonsense in the attitude that state owned assets are crown jewels. You can hear it. Investments are like leeks. You plant them, grow them and harvest them. There is no magic about it. These assets will degrade in time and ratepayers will be left with the residue. And the residue will be debt, not compost. Local authorities must be led to divest and spare their ratepayers from unnecessary rate rises or unnecessary gearing. Although this is not directly taxation it will have a huge and positive impact on the nation’s finances. And in that sense it is relevant to taxation because it generates wealth in the private sector and reduces the need for taxation because it reduces state (including local government) involvement in business. There is no evidence that local authorities can run assets better than the private sector and there is ample evidence that it cannot. Thinking outside the Current System – Bottomless Pits. Fig 6 (on page 25) demonstrates clearly that government will never, like ever, be able to satisfy the demands for money for three customers. Education, Health and Social security and welfare are each Bottomless Pits. I have made two suggestions that might, should, reduce the burden of social welfare costs. Domestic service and a 1% basic tax rate. It would be prudent to see if those generate the desired result before going further. Health and Education are both different manifestations of the same problem. They are local services and they serve local needs. ‘User pays’ is the concept that can be applied, but only in part. I would propose a new corporate category, a ‘Not for profit corporation’. I appreciate that some not for profit companies are viewed with suspicion because they pay themselves too much, but the structure does have a valid use here and both teachers and nurses could do with some wage inflation. The state would cap spending on both education and health in light of budget availability and need. The balance would be raised locally through donations, subscriptions and a change in the way ACC works. There is no need for ACC to pay for the cost of car accidents. It takes only a little downstream activity to identify the insurer of a car (number plate) and to identify the cost of victim’s treatment (internal accounts). Adding a margin to that and sending the bill to an insurance company would sort out a great deal of bad driving. There would have to be a change to the law, and there would be complaints from insurers. There would also be threats of higher premiums. But there would be a desirable result for the hospitals. Schools need to understand that standards have been falling for years. This is because of a lack of leadership and a drift towards consensus policy forming. Consensus policy forming is a drift to lower standards. Schools should run their own classes in the evenings for adults in all the subjects they find it difficult to fund. That would have the effect of ‘sharpening up’ the standard of teaching and could bring substantial revenue to a school by using its assets more effectively. There could be objection from teachers. That might lessen when they discover that they were to be paid. While on Fig 6, please watch Finance costs. They will balloon unless attention is given to growing the domestic capital market for long- term bonds. Overseas Suppliers. Satisfactory agreements must be made about transfer pricing. But, where a foreign company trading and selling into New Zealand and is thought to be washing its tax liability out of New Zealand a sum can be derived. GST on sales =15% of turnover in NZ(i) (i)divided into parent company’s total turnover = percentage of total turnover garnered from NZ business. (ii) Divide (ii) into gross profit of parent company to calculate liability to NZ tax. There will be protests but they will come to the table to talk and you are back to a transfer pricing agreement. Overseas Supply -Bottled Water A flat tax of two cents a litre on all water for export, bottled in New Zealand or not. It would be outrageous to increase any impost on New Zealand citizens while allowing foreign (or local) companies to export natural resources without making any contribution to the country.

Transforming Economies & Societies By Re-Engineering Taxation It all comes down to the capital and how it is treated. How will you spend your dollar? Questions Asked By The Tax Working Group The future of taxation: Contained in this document are a part of my ideas on how to fire up an economy and bring a better balance of opportunity across a nation. Purpose Of Tax: Tax should not just be about raising revenue but in addition about steering capital to places that will grow broad based opportunity for society, and for steering consumption away from destructive and inefficient forms and toward positive and more efficient ones. The biggest economic transformation we may have to yet to witness, is in the unleashing of the economic potential of lazy capital and sharing the opportunities created across a nation. Creating opportunity for others is the foundation of any vibrant and sustainable economy or business. Taxing The Right Things?: The document contains discussion of a variety of ways to tax Housing Affordability: Can taxation address the housing affordability issue. In part yes. It is all about supply and demand. Not just for housing but also for dollars, and the supply of people (immigration/population growth). Removing investor dollars using the ideas in this document will have a substantial effect as they not only remove dollar competition from existing housing supply, but also encourage the creation of additional housing supply. Further removing GST from property and instead using the ideas in this document to replace the revenue will make newly developed property substantially cheaper. What tax won’t fix particularly well is council regulations and zoning, and the supply of people which is an immigration and population growth issue. What Tax Issues Matter Most To Me: Creating opportunity for people is first and foremost as I see so much poverty now that never was present during my childhood in NZ. I am sorry, I have not had enough time to write down all my ideas on the issues. I can attempt to progress any areas of interest at a later date, particularly the ones that support a foundation for generating opportunity for others. Items Discussed 1. Money Flows 2.

AI & The Future Of Taxation Money Flows ‘Money flows to where it is treated best’. This is a widely held paradigm, but it often lacks the qualifier ‘relative to the desires of the sender’. This is an important qualifier to add and one that to a degree is already incorporated in the current tax system. For any future tax system, demonstrable proof of intention needs to be a part of it relative to the bits that are not black and white People-Centred Taxation Business for business sake is meaningless. People are the ultimate users of businesses goods and services and are the ultimate source of businesses profits. Spreading economic opportunity more widely means more people doing better and more people being able to afford to use more of businesses goods and services. This is good for business and good for the nation. Therefore a taxation system ideally needs to be people-focused and aimed at generating opportunity for a wide range of people across a nation, rather than just aiming to share the outputs of wealth and business from prior opportunity. No people centred taxation system would be complete without consideration for the environment. If the environment is poor then people invariably suffer and eventually business also suffers. We must take action to ‘clean up our economies’ to clean up our world and enable it to support more sustainable business opportunities into the future. Efficient Use Of Capital & The Opportunity Economy There is no better way to fire up an economy than to unleash the latent potential contained in a nation’s ‘lazy capital’ by instead having it available for growing businesses and at the same time using it to generate economic opportunities for a wide range of people across a nation. Definitions: Active capital is capital investment that generates significant amounts of economic opportunity beyond the beneficial owner of that investment or any non-arms-length parties. Lazy capital is capital investment that does little to generate economic opportunity beyond the beneficial owner of that investment or any non-arms-length parties. ‘Opportunity Economy’ refers to the generation of opportunity for a wide range of arms-length people in an economy. This set of ideas aims to support that but will need refining. Examples of active and lazy capital: • Active capital investment o Starting a business o Expanding a business o Property development o Investment into new company shares where the capital raised will be used to expand the business o Research and development • Lazy capital investment o Money in the bank\* o Investment in existing property with no further development o Investment in existing shares in a company\*\* o Investment in anything that generates little to no additional economic activity \* Whilst the bank may then lend that money to an expanding business the paradigm requires the link to be established between the primary investment and eventual application to an active investment. So money in an on call account won’t qualify (for simplicity) because active investment by the bank needs to be stipulated, where as money into an account that specifies a high level of further investment into active investments would. Taxation benefits would be proportional and in relation to the level of active investment and over what time the investments were made and held (to simplify short term investments may be better excluded however this may then exclude generation of short term opportunities) \*\*Investment in shares where the money is not going to be used to start or expand the business would be classified as lazy capital. This is despite shareholders being able to influence company decisions. Instead, any capital invested actively and associated tax benefits, would be at the business level and not the shareholder level. The benefits of the additional use of capital the company has from the tax benefits will over time, if the venture is successful, then flow through to shareholders but the dividends, capital gains and other income to the shareholder would be taxed in accordance with their investment being lazy capital. The division between active and lazy capital along with other rules needed to implement the ideas for efficient use of capital and spreading opportunity, would be one for debate if an active/lazy capital taxation system and its benefits were adopted. I would suggest the following mechanisms and figures as a starting point (I hope I have what is in my head correctly written down): • Active means that genuine economic opportunity is generated for arms-length entities and/or arms-length people. Some examples: o Investment into a business where the investment is spent on growing the business if the business employs people or uses suppliers or contractors that do. o Business or investment spending on NZ made goods, or NZ services where the goods or services involve human employment o Property development for the whole cost of development if or new residences are created o Property development for the development portion only if no new residences are created (i.e. the land is excluded and deemed lazy – exceptions would be development of hotels, industrial etc.). This is meant to be the case where people do smaller renovations to an otherwise passive rental property • Where applicable investment and assets are split into active and lazy components. Business spending can likewise be segregated and added to these totals. • The ratio of active to lazy investment/assets/spending is used to calculate the proportion of income that is taxed with the more favourable active tax rates and tax concessions, with the remainder being taxed with the lazy rates. These are deemed active income and lazy income respectively • Tax rates on income from lazy capital are raised by 20% of current rates and tax rates on income from active capital are lowered by the same measure. (A fixed % such as 5% instead of a relative % may be better or not) • Removal of tax concessions on income from lazy capital such as interest, depreciation, etc. Where there is a mix of active and lazy the active concessions can only be claimed in proportion with the active % • Optional: Active income losses can be put against either active or lazy income where as lazy income losses can only be used against active income • For reference a list of commonly encountered active assets and asset components when used in active business, investment or R&D. Anything that falls outside of the list or that are not being actively used are either considered lazy or need to be proven that they are active assets. • Bring changes in slowly – announce two years ahead of making changes. Then proportionally bring in changes to tax rates and tax concessions at 5 to 10% per year, or at rates that take more care around where clusters of LVR’s are which represent clusters of risk and capital that may need more time to adjust due to volume of capital. This will prevent a disorderly movement of capital that may otherwise have catastrophic effects. • A question arises of whether spreading opportunity beyond a nations economy would be considered active or not\*\*\* • A question arises of when does active capital become lazy if it stops generating opportunity for arms-length entities or people?^ \*\*\*Whether a nation has the freedom to choose may be determined by prior trade agreements it has entered into and WTO rules. If it does have freedom then I would suggest that opportunity should be contained within an economy to build it up and lift people out of poverty. Then when only a small pre-determined % of people are still below a commonly defined poverty line relative to local costs of living, then opportunity is shared with trading partners if they have similar effective environmental, employment, and intellectual protections that work in practice. This practice would help to solve some of the global imbalances that have developed when free-trade is applied liberally and as a one-size fits all solution, when in my opinion it is better used as a targeted solution in unison with other solutions to spread opportunity more evenly and ensure it is sustainable into the future. ^ By definition it is when it stops generating economic opportunities for arms-length people. However from an incentive perspective the benefits must last longer. Some solutions for this are: • Time horizon relates to the reasonable expectation of break-even and a while beyond • Time horizon relates to the depreciable life of assets invested into • Taper the tax benefits off so there are no sudden changes in capital value of the asset. This may be the best method but introduces more complexity • Issues around whether the tax benefits are transferrable on sale of the asset – see property example as to how this can potentially be handled Example: Property The elephant in the room relative to under-utilization of New Zealand’s capital is property investment. Addressing the issue there is an excellent example of how capital can be made to be more productive and generate benefits well beyond its beneficial owner and related parties. So when someone invests in a property and does nothing to it other than mandatory maintenance, then the amount of opportunity generated for others is limited – accounting, maintenance, property management, one off transaction activity on purchase or sale. Not much more except taxation of the passive income, and potentially what the resulting after tax income is invested in and what spread of opportunities that may generate. Whereas where someone develops the property further then there are a wide range of products and services required that generates greater business opportunities and importantly, gainful employment for people. Further, often property development increases the number of habitable rooms and or residences, adding to housing supply. So why should these investments be treated similarly in light of the capital use paradigm I am proposing and its benefits for society and the economy? They should not. The changes needed to activate some of the nations lazy property capital are as follows: • Passive property investment cannot claim interest costs • Passive property investment cannot claim depreciation • Any active investment such as adding a room, improving the property, or redevelopment, will have the development part of the investment exempt from the above rules and this is transferrable to any new owner. In order to not disadvantage current active investors this can be retrospective for developments already done if the current owner is the one who has done the development. • For a property investment any income derived will be taxed accordingly relative to proportion of active and lazy capital (and for minor developments • Possibly a time limitation/phasing out of benefits over time • Bring these changes in slowly. • Dynamic taxation for more precise management of economic bubbles (see dynamic taxation) The long-term benefits of slowly moving toward this will be: • Some of the leverage heat already in place will slowly unwind, reducing economic risk • Housing supply will naturally increase as capital is treated better if a property is developed or further developed • Property prices will become more affordable over time for potential owner-occupiers, due to removal of a portion of investor dollar-competition and increasing housing supply, therefore addressing one of the biggest problems New Zealand faces • Economic activity will increase due to higher rates of property development • Relative to the general economy, economic activity will increase overall due to more ‘local grown’ capital being available for innovation and for development of our nations resources, increasing the local levels of ownership of the nations high quality assets • Finally a great deal of additional taxation will be realized from those who can afford to pay it who still choose to hold passive investments. As a side point, housing affordability can be improved if GST is removed from property. My understanding is currently developers must charge and pay GST on property. Owner-occupiers generally are not GST registered and so they cannot claim it and so are the ultimate payers of this tax. Removing GST from property will lower the price of developed properties substantially and simplify the tax system in this area to make way for justified complexities in other areas. Use the ideas in this document to replace GST revenue on property. Are capital controls needed to stop capital leaving the country if tax concessions are being removed for what currently is a large portion of the country’s capital? The question instead should be: what type of capital do you want for the country? First of all, do it slowly to minimise disruption. Then over time the flight of lazy capital offshore does not matter if the taxable controller/beneficiary of that capital remains a tax resident. It still gets taxed the same on worldwide income basis and although there is loss of some tax due to double taxation agreements. The tax from income driven by growth from capital being readily available for businesses, will over time surpass the tax from lazy capital as the growth from active investments is superior. Over time some of that lazy capital will be attracted back and become active capital as the economy booms from readily available local capital. I’d go a step further and argue that it would be better for the country if a portion of lazy capital does leave so assets are cheaper and the asset price bloat and associated bubbles occur away from the NZ economy. Most importantly, if a majority active capital business needs to have an asset to support its business, then that asset will be cheaper and therefore free more of its capital for active investment into its business. This is a very good thing and a direct result of treating well the use of capital you want and less well the use of capital you don’t want. Sustainable Consumption Taxation – SCT – Attempting To Reengineer The GST This is an awful area to try and re-engineer. Awful. It hurts my head. Yet I see this as an important area to re-engineer for the greater public good. Even though I have not been able to complete it in the time available, I have still included it because the concepts are that important. I can continue to think about how to implement it. The degree of taxation on inefficiency, socioeconomic division, poor ethics and waste will be reflected in the degree of long-term sustainable growth of the respective economy adopting such and this will continue as long as broad based economic opportunity is supported long term. If other economies join in to this paradigm then the main long-term economic race between nations becomes one of being more efficient, ethical and sustainable relative to a nations’ use of capital and income. We already have a form of taxation on inefficiency in terms of a consumption tax, the GST. However it’s application has been blunt and it has considerable room for improvement by applying different component rates based on four sustainability measures that are ultimately people-focussed (example rates given): • Social sustainability (staples are: core shelter costs (rent/residential rates), water, basic healthy food, electricity, excluded is waste disposal) o Staple – 0% o Intermediate - 8% o Luxury – 15% • Environmental impact o Low – 0% o Medium – 8% o High – 15% • Economic efficiency o High – 0% o Medium – 8% o Low – 15% • Ethical status o High – 0% o Medium – 8% o Low – 15% So a product that is a staple, is ethically manufactured efficiently with a low environmental impact will have no GST applied. The effects will be to add to social stability by reducing costs to low SES populations whilst helping the economy to become more efficient in the most environmentally sustainable way and achieved in an ethically sound manner. By contrast a luxury item manufactured inefficiently, unethically, and in an environmentally unsustainable manner (or the product itself is bad for the environment), will attract a GST of 60%. If this is too high then adjust the rates, however we really need powerful measures to steer people to make decisions that support the ‘four dimensions of sustainability’, and the GST when applied in the manner I am suggesting can be a very powerful tool to achieve this and raise taxation revenue at the same time. It is no longer a blunt goods and services tax, but a sustainable consumption tax (SCT). Assessment of products for environmental and efficiency credentials is done. For each category where approved credentials have not been gained then the highest rates of taxation are applied. This can be used as a measure to level the playing field with countries with poor sustainability metrics to favour sustainably produced goods and services. The framework for such a sustainable GST will need a lot of work to ensure it is both effective and as simple as possible. Relative to GST as it stands now it will complicate compliance and auditing. However the outcomes are highly beneficial and worth the complications and compliance costs. Rough limited draft of GST credentialing system guidelines and examples. Details to be worked on in public/business consultation: • Social sustainability o Staples - core shelter costs (rent/residential rates/purchase of core residence (restrictions\* and concessions\*\* apply)), water, basic healthy food, electricity, and the following items when below a defined cost for each item- fridges, washing machines, stove/ovens/microwaves, heaters/aircons, basic household repairs, public transport o Intermediate - waste disposal, cars <60k, o Luxury items – for all other items including items lacking credentials in this category • Environmental impact o Low – TBA o Medium – TBA o High – for all other items including items lacking credentials in this category • Economic efficiency o High – TBA o Medium – TBA o Low – for all other items including items lacking credentials in this category • Ethical status o High – >=Living wage paid to all employees (although this is kind of a social sustainability measure) o Medium – >=Living wage paid to >80% of employees o Low – for all other items including items lacking credentials in this category I apologise. I could not get this one completed. The elements that matter most to me in the SCT is social and environmental sustainability and ethics. These are critical elements that need to be quantified and added into the tax system. Let me know if you are interested in any further developments in this area. The Global Corporate Tax Trap It appears there is a slow race to the bottom in progress. How low should corporate income taxes go? On one hand a country looses business if it taxes higher than other countries. On the other hand the unqualified mantra that ‘lowering taxes generates economic growth’ becomes a failure in the long term once beyond failure to raise levels of government revenue needed to sustain the social order and broad-based opportunity that supports business in the first place. The ideas contained in this document may be a more efficient and targeted way of lowering tax, if that is what is wanted. As to having more than one rate of corporate tax, then for the support of small business I am all for it. Imputation rules may need adjusting though, and ‘business-splitting’ and ‘ultimate control’ rules will need to be implemented to stop people splitting and routing businesses through multiple entities to access the lower rates. Opportunity Credits Should income and capital gains be taxed whether corporate or not? Not if it generates broader economic benefits for people above the cost of living for a wide variety of people who are at ‘arms length’. I introduce the concept of ‘Opportunity Credits’: Opportunity Credits are tax credits to be used against any form of income for the entity or person who earned them. The credits are generated proportionately every time a business or individual does something to spread economic opportunity to non-arms-length people. Ultimately Opportunity Credits is aimed at sharing the economic benefits of business and ultimately raising the income of individuals, which irrespective of corporate tax rates will raise additional tax revenue, raise standards of living and increase the level of opportunity to a broader portion of our society. An example is when employing people. Business income when it is paid as wages is already exempt from taxation. However a further exemption/ tax credit on top of this can be granted relative to the cumulative amount employees are paid for individual incomes ranging from the cost of living to, as an example three times the cost of living (so just paying executive bonuses above the cap will not qualify) So for example a company earns 1,000,000 profit after deducting expenses such as wages. Its 9 employees earn three times the cost of living. The cost of living is for this example 20,000. Its one executive member earns 200,000. The eligible bonus is then (60,000 - 20,000) x (9 + 1) = 400,000 So the company is then taxed on 600,000 instead of the full profit. This may be too much to give away to businesses so the following are options to moderate this: • Reduce the upper bound above the living wage – favours businesses that pay lower wages • Raise the upper bound and lower bound – favours businesses that pay higher wages (and more likely associated with higher skills and more satisfying employment opportunities) • Add a factor so the 400,000 in the example may only then be eligible for a lesser tax deduction • A mix of two of the above This method of tax cut in the area of employment has the following: • Advantages o Encourages employment in the pay range desired in an age where AI is threatening to undercut human functionality and jobs more rapidly than job creation is occurring o Acts as a mild counterbalance to the shift to contractor models and subsequent loss of individual economic security o Encourages business to invest in people so the benefits of the business are spread more broadly amongst society; something that is needed to counter the growing disparity in wealth and social benefits • Disadvantages o The exemptions may not be of much benefit to businesses with few employees relative to income, yet are high profit Application of the generation of Opportunity Credits to other areas of the economy becomes a little more tricky as opportunity is not equal to income or profit now, but instead the true potential for such (in an economic sense). It should be the sharing of that opportunity that is encouraged for a better society rather than the concentration of opportunity for the few. However it gets complex because one can create new opportunity at the expense of other opportunities. We would need more concrete measures of creation and destruction of broader opportunity on a broader scale in order to build a system relative to taxation relative to encouraging genuine and fresh opportunity. Business to business - Sharing When a business spends some of its money on procuring goods or services from another business it generally can either go to a smaller business or a larger one. If it goes to a larger one it gets too complex to work out if it is ultimately benefiting more people or less (think discretionary trusts, large super funds as shareholders, shareholder turnover etc.). So a simple method to encourage sharing and generation of opportunity for more people is to give a tax credit to the contractee if the contractor has a turnover less than some factor (say half) of the turnover of the contractee. To not disadvantage small businesses by excluding them because there are few business smaller than them, small businesses below a certain small business turnover cap can claim the credits when they contract to any company up to a multiple of (say 10 times) the small business turnover cap. For example a mum and dad business contracts to a business that turns over 20M may be able to claim credits but if they contract to a 2B turnover company they cannot. Big business has a massive advantage over small business. Small business is tomorrows’ big business and they should be encouraged for that reason. Fresh growth, fresh ideas, fresh opportunity. Do you want a vibrant economy or one that is already close to its climax? Opportunity As Realizable Potential This is a tough one. So for example a large multinational opens up a platform for other businesses to develop income generating apps. This is a form of opportunity creation however how will the reporting work and how can it effectively be audited without significant cost? Further is the dominance of the multinational eroding opportunity in other areas, such as a home- grown company having a significant slice in that market by having its own platform for other companies to have income generating apps? Further if a significant portion of the app income goes to the multinational then that money generally is taken out of the economy. Still I cannot help feel there is an opportunity here for spreading opportunity. Dynamic Taxation Wouldn’t it be great if a society suddenly had a need and taxation could come to the rescue? Also wouldn’t it be great if tax could reduce the damage caused when economic bubbles burst? It can. Adjust the rates in accordance with need. Bubbles are more often than not easy to spot. Using property as an example, a new development or new active investment only gets a portion or none of the benefits if oversupply is looming, or the full amount if supply is needed. This can be applied similarly to other areas of supply and demand. This control mechanism needs to be in the hands of something like the RBNZ to minimise political and business interests corrupting the mechanism for short-term gains. Simplification Relative To Ideals It is good to have simple systems. The simpler the better? To a point. In order for society to achieve its ideals and maintain system integrity, complexity is often justified. The simplest tax regime would be to just have a consumption tax. Or just have an income tax. We do not have this because the additional taxes and system complexities are justified by the benefits of taxing different areas. Crypto-Tax Crypto currencies are a medium of exchange and like cash and barter, tax it. Traceability is the main issue if one does not control the blockchain. At some point control, power and money will want to enter back into an economy where there is a bunch of people in it. So as a backup, value can be taxed when it is shipped back into an economy if it was not taxed prior. Looking more broadly, the benefits of the blockchain outweigh the negatives. Taxation would require fewer audits for a start as the blockchain can be used for immediate tracability, and subsequently allow more targeted human and AI audits to areas where blockchain is not applicable or not being used. The question is though could quantum computing be used to disrupt the blockchain? Should Capital Be Taxed? If one wants to slow or reverse the currently enlarging imbalance of opportunity across our societies, then capital should be taxed in one way or another. I have other ideas in this area on how to balance opportunity across society but am still working on those solutions. Wealth Tax If a non-specific wealth tax were introduced then expect all forms of capital to run for the hills. Capital controls would be needed as there is no separation of the good from the useless, and an economy may not do nearly as well under those. Instead if I were government and were going to implement a wealth tax, then I’d apply it along the lines already discussed for active and lazy capital because no capital controls are needed. As discussed lazy capital should not be welcome as it reduces the capital available to active businesses when there is a need for them to buy subsequently overinflated assets to support businesses. Any savings they make due to the absence of lazy capital reducing the number of dollars bidding for an asset, then the savings can go toward growing their business faster, better or broader instead. The combination of a selective wealth tax and selective treatment of incomes based on whether capital is increasing opportunity for others or not, may be the most effective at brining a better balance to wealth and power divisions across our society, as far as taxation is concerned, especially when combined with a sustainable consumption tax (SCT). Land Tax Land cannot leave a country unless it is Australia (Australia exports vast amounts of iron and carbon rich land). Jokes aside, land is not transportable and is an easy target for taxation. However if one is to tax land then how? Simplest is to tax based on value. The door to corruption of the system is wide open there. Further the value of land does not necessarily relate to economic potential. A land tax may, if not structured well, adversely affect farmers, particularly if they are trying to make a living off of marginal land. How would it work for forestry? Build up a tax deficit each year, to be repaid on harvest? Risky(!) as harvests can come and go just like dodgy directors and companies. What if there is a forest fire? Governments do not at this time want to be impeding carbon sequestration, nor be having debts that cannot be collected. If the ideas in this document around active/lazy capital are too blunt a measure to quell over- speculation into property, then a transient land tax may be the economic medicine required. However like medicine, only give it to patients who need it. Capital Gains Tax If there is no other tax on capital then why not? I do not like it but for the sake of the stability of our society, the on-going concentration of wealth, power, and opportunity needs a counterbalance to slow, halt and reverse it. However CGT is not particularly effective at achieving this. Australia has a comprehensive CGT and yet are still are having similar issues to NZ. This tax is also not a reliable source of government income because it ebbs and flows with the economic fortunes of a country; and after each crash there is a considerable delay to the increase in CGT revenues due to accumulated losses being written off against today’s gains. Another issue is there is an element of control that is outside of the taxpayers control and they should not be taxed on that. That is inflation. This bothers me from a principles perspective as inflation from what I understand relates to central banks and the fractional reserve system (the money supply side), and how many times money is exchanged in an economy within a given period of time (the demand side). Individual taxpayers have effectively no control over this so any gains from inflation should not be taxed. Australia half had taken this into account when it introduced CGT by allowing gains to be indexed against government inflation data before being taxed. Its better than nothing given some governments subtly manipulate that data for a variety of reasons. This was then switched to removing that for business but giving the current 50% discount for capital gains for individuals whereby a capital gain is halved before being thrown into the income mix. If a CGT is to relate to true gains in a capital position, then true inflation must be removed before it is taxed. In my view, a CGT is too blunt to be an efficient tax or a social engineering tool. It targets the wrong areas and subsequently causes distortions in both markets and government cash flows (Howard and Costello were lucky). A.I. & The Future Of Taxation If we are going to allow high-level AI into our economics and society, and it’s a choice, then we need new socioeconomic models that can be sustained, funded, regulated, and for them to encourage whatever works best for humans and our environment and not necessarily AI-lead consortiums. Further, as AI develops there will be a crossover point where pseudo-consciousness will begin to be perceived by humans and other AI. Should these AI entities then be ascribed rights and be taxed in their own right? At what level of perceived consciousness would this occur and what if each perceived AI entity is too connected others to be considered as separate entities or are traceable back to a controlling AI consortium? The AI area I am currently thinking about, have ideas on, and am watching. It’s like the star wars of taxation. It is interesting how sci-fi can be quite predictive at times. You may have noticed that a lot of emphasis of this document is on spreading opportunity, particularly by employment and utilising small business that employs people. AI is a potential threat to the taxation base as depending on how it is used it can remove opportunity from an economy or increase it. Time will tell which way it goes. Looking very far ahead, the utopian future of taxation may end up being related to testable levels of consciousness; either to assist with the development of ones ‘own’ consciousness to better levels, or because better levels of consciousness support benevolence rather than selfishness, and therefore tax is no longer needed for those entities. Public Trust My final point is please do not make the same embarrassing mistake that the ATO has done, by damaging taxpayer interests by being dishonest for the sake of achieving collection targets. That is extremely bad for public trust in the system of government. I am a public servant. I am here to serve the community and the public. Public servants need to remember why we are here.

Tax Working Group Submission (C)William Satterthwaite 25th March 2018 This work is licensed under Cre- ative Commons, Attribution, No Derivatives 4.0 Areas to reform: •1.0 Capital Gains –1.1 Applicable Assets –1.2 Implementation –1.3 Rational/Reasoning •2.0 GST –2.1 Items to exclude –2.2 Rational •3.0 Charities –3.1 Non-Charities that pretend to be –3.2 Rational •4.0 Other thoughts 1.0 Capital Gains A capital gains tax should exist in New Zealand. It should take into consideration losses as well as gains such that those who make loses on investments are able to have a discount on their tax bill from other income sources. Equally it should tax gains as any other income would be and encompass any asset that is held as a store of value. If held for a significant amount of time, inflation should be taken into account when calculating gains or losses. The paying of capital gains tax should only take place after the asset is sold, so for example those who buy a house and use it (for living or investment) do not have to pay anything until they sell it, or if they do not sell it and it is inherited, no tax is paid until their successor sell it. (Or their successor and so on. Do not introduce Death Duties) 1.1 Applicable Assets Applicable assets should be anything that is held as a store of value, excluding consumer items. For example a phone that is bought and then sold on Trademe a year later is a consumer item, and should not be taken into consideration when calculating capital gains taxes. However a share that is bought on the share market and then sold there would be an applicable asset, and its buy price and sell price would be key factors in determining tax owed. A list of applicable assets is (but not limited to): - Shares - Houses\* - Cryptocur- rency assets - Gold and Silver (Exclude commercial use: i.e gold for electrical contacts) - Foreign Currency 1 \*I have heard suggestions that if the house is owner occupied it could be excluded. I am neutral on this matter and could not comment. Please consider other submissions regarding this suggestion. I neither endorse nor oppose. 1.2 Implementation •A capital gains tax should only consider the initial buy price and final sell price of an asset in NZD. All other intermediary steps should be discarded. •Capital gains tax should only be concerned only with ∆V nzd ,‘Delta Value (in New Zealand dollars)’which is calculated as ∆V nzd =SN−BN−x . Or alternativelyHow much I got out of an asset minus how much I put into an asset –S is the sell price of an asset –N is the number of assets sold – B is the initial buy price of the assets that were sold, inflation adjusted. –x is the costs associated with selling or buying the item. (See next) –Dollar cost averaging should be used if applicable •Capital gains tax should only be payable when the asset is sold and any costs associated with selling the asset should be subtracted from the profit made by the sale. Additional, costs of buying the asset, or costs of improving the asset should be subtracted. For houses this would include real-estate agent charges, lawyer fees and renovation costs. For shares this would include broker fees and for Cryptocurrencies this would include exchange fees. I am unsure of how costs not valued in NZD should be included into this and will leave it for the working group to consider. •Gains should be considered as any other source of income, and taxed at the same rates that any other source of income would. •If a loss is incurred, i.e. ∆V nzd <0 , then ∆V nzd should be added to other income sources (while retaining a negative sign so by adding I mean its absolute value, |∆V nzd | , is subtracted) and then the combined sources are taxed together. For example if I buy 719.52USD for 1000NZD+1NZD exchange fee then buy Bitcoin with the 719.52USD then sell the Bitcoin for 1200USD and buy some 2 shares for 1200USD which I then sell for 1500NZD+50NZD broker fee the initial buy price is $1000 and the final sell price is $1500. The difference is $500 but I subtract $51 for the costs incurred in my investment so ∆V nzd is $449 and I pay tax on that $449 at whatever income bracket that puts me into. So if I earn below $14000p.a, I get taxed at 10.5% and pay $47.14 of tax on that particular capital gain I made. 1.3 Rational I know very few others in my age group with investments in anything other than a savings account, term deposit or kiwisaver. By ensuring that loses incurred by investors are able to claimed as a tax discounts against other income the risk with investing is minimised and more people in encouraged to save money and invest for their future. This should achieve the same kind of outcome as kiwisaver while being a more active option. (Kiwisaver being passive and boring.) However it is completely unfair that this income source is untaxed currently, there- fore there needs to be both the mitigation against loss to encourage investment, with capital gains tax for when gains are realised. 1.4 Other possibilities and considerations •Divide ∆V nzd by the number of years the asset was owned to get the p.a income and tax the yearly gains. This will spread large sums out over many years so that the tax rate is not suddenly pushed into the largest tax bracket. •Some may make poor investment choices in order get a tax discount. (Although this makes very little sense, as they do not get the money back, only a tax discount, which will be only a small percentage of the amount they lost.) However, it may be better to limit the discount to 10% or some other sensible value for the working group to decide. • Where the IRD has access to records of sales (for example property sales records or a shares register) they should calculate the capital gains tax owed and send that as a bill to the tax payer, rather then making them calculate it themselves. This way the tax payer needs only check the calculation and pay, then get own with their lives without wasting time. • When a large sale is made, send the capital gains tax bill immediately afterwards rather then waiting until the end of the tax year. This ensures that the tax payer still has the money, rather then having spent it by the time the tax year ends and having to organise a payment plan. 3 2.0 GST The main purpose of goods and services tax is to capture tax from the untaxed. Those that work for cashunder the tablemust then pay GST on what they buy with that untaxed income. This is a valid reason for such a tax, however punishes those who do pay their taxes. Also since GST is a flat rate, those who should be in a lower tax bracket must pay more in GST than in income tax, which is seemingly unfair. For this reason I would support lowing GST to 12.5% or 10% if it is feasible within the government budget. 2.1 Items to exclude Fruit and vegetables should be excluded from GST altogether. This would promote healthy eating amongst the population. 2.2 Rational There an many health benefits to eating fresh fruit and vegetables. I will leave checking peer reviewed studies of these as a trivial but somewhat time consuming exercise to the reader. Based on these result, central government should encourage the population to eat healthier foods, and one way to do that is by making them cheaper. (You already do it in the opposite direction with ethanol and cigarettes) 3.0 Charities Charities should continue to receive tax exemption. However organisations that should not be considered charities, but are due to outdated laws and definitions should not receive tax exemption. People who donate to charities should only receive a donation rebate at the largest rate they are taxed at, not at a blanket rate of 33%. For example someone taxed at 10.5% should receive a rebate of 10.5% of the total amount they donated, rather than the 33% of the amount donated they currently receive. 3.1 Non-Charities that pretend to be Many churches and religious groups are listed as charities but are not. They should not have tax exemption. This should be reformed as part of the charities act rather then in tax law, however should be a priority for this working group as they make up a large income stream which is currently untaxed. Not taxing these groups is immoral as it steals from tax payers and society. 4 Furthermore, any organsation which exists to push any kind of agenda (other then pure altruism) is not a charity, and should be paying taxes. Churches are just the most common example of where this happens, but many others should also lose charity status. 3.2 Rational Charities are organisations who exist solely to display altruism. That is they exist not for profit to themselves, their leader, CEO, Owner, shareholder, pastor orgod, but to help others in the way that they need it. Churches and other religious groups are not altruistic, they are egoistic. They exist to convert others to their own philosophy for the benefit of their pastor or god or gods. The person being converted does not receive any tangible increase to their quality of life, however is indoctrinated into thinking that they have. Members of a church may sometimes act in a way which looks like altruism but is only out of loyalty to their god or gods and their holy books which say that they must, therefore being entirely unfounded and meaningless. Furthermore this may cause harm, for example recommending that a sick person comes to church to be prayed for rather then getting the help they need at a hospital. These organisations do not deserve to be considered charities and should not be tax exempt. This should apply to any organisation which pushes an agenda, including atheistic groups, free software groups, socialist groups, conservative groups and any other group pushing any other philosophical, moral or economic agenda. 4.0 Other Thoughts I do not think there is any reason to change the existing tax brackets, although I have not looked into this matter and have not seen any evidence for either side. The working group should base their decision about tax brackets on other submissions and other evidence. 5

To: Tax Working Group From: David Thorp Submission For a fair and comprehensive tax system The New Zealand tax system needs more than a tweak and it is therefore unfortunate that some specific necessary changes are proscribed by the working group’s terms of reference. My submission however assumes no constraints and posits a tax system that represents an ideal for which to aim. A more comprehensively fair tax system would see the following changes:  capital gains taxed as income;  estate transfers taxed (on death or gift);  the income tax scale made more progressive;  the regressive goods and services tax reduced to 12.5%, without exemptions; and  a wealth tax introduced, or at least a land tax. An ideal tax system An ideal tax system has three essential components: income tax, estate tax and wealth tax. These three taxes are all progressive and play distinct and complementary roles. Tax on income (that includes capital gains) I am proposing that the income tax be made more comprehensive by including all income flowing from the investment of capital assets, including capital gains. Recognising that capital gains are income and should be taxed accordingly reflects the reality and puts an end to the unjustifiable preference given to unearned income over earned income. Realised capital gains would be treated as income, after adjustment for inflation, with losses allowed, ring- fenced and capped. If the “family home” is to be exempt from taxing capital gains, the exemption should however be capped, at say $1.5 million. The income tax scale should be more progressive, with at least one higher rate added: say 50% on incomes over $150,000. A more steeply progressive income tax scale also has the effect of reducing the after-tax payments of New Zealand Superannuation to those on higher aggregate incomes. Corporate profits are (progressively) taxed as income in the hands of individuals and company tax therefore need not be made progressive. New Zealand should not join a destructive competition for low tax rates. Tax on inheritance A progressive tax should be introduced on the transfer of estates, on death or gift. There is a significant concentration of wealth that on transfer represents “unearned income”. Tax on wealth A wealth tax is required to stop the continuing and unlimited concentration of wealth and its potentially destabilising effects. The working group’s background paper shows a high concentration of wealth with the top quintile but pays no attention to redressing this. It states that: “Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid-1990s but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income.” No case is made for a wealth tax, although a land tax would address an element of wealth concentration. A wealth tax should at least be signalled for the future while interim measures should include a land tax, which it is noted can be easily implemented. While nearly every developed country taxes real estate, only local body rates are levied on real estate in New Zealand. Until a wealth tax can be introduced, New Zealand should at least implement a land tax and probably stamp duty on transactions to make best use of this finite resource and to help regulate real estate prices. Thomas Piketty in Capital in the 21 st Century insists that a wealth tax is an essential part of the ideal tax system and: “The primary purpose of a tax on capital is not to finance the social state but to regulate capitalism. The goal is first to stop the indefinite increase in the inequality of wealth and, second, to impose effective regulation on the financial and banking system to avoid crises.” Tax on wealth levied annually might be: 0% on aggregate capital assets up to $2 million in value; 1% on $2 to 10 million; and 2% above $10 to $20 million. Tax on goods and services The goods and services tax should be reduced to 12.5%. This would reduce the burden on those on lower incomes, reduce the case for exemptions from this tax, and reduce the revenue importance of this regressive tax. Progressive tax scales Progressive taxes were a major innovation of the 20 th century and played a key role in the reduction in inequality, until the 1980s. Progressive taxes are a crucial component of the social state and represent an ideal compromise between social justice and individual freedom. Unfortunately, today, the progressive tax is seriously threatened by international tax competition. But New Zealand should not join the race to the bottom. A more steeply progressive tax system is indispensable for making sure that everyone benefits from globalisation and to encourage support for the globalised economy. The globalised economy The globalised economy means that capital increasingly moves, and investments are made across national borders. Capital is held in tax havens to avoid tax and the transparency of capital movements is limited. Multinational corporations exploit tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions to channel their profits and they pay little or no tax. New Zealand should continue aggressively to seek international transparency of capital flows and the full taxing of corporates in the countries where they do business. David Thorp 29 April 2018

I wish to comment on several issues, some of them related to each other, some quite distinct. In particular, I will comment on: 1. GST 2. Company tax, including the taxation of businesses owned by charities 3. The taxation of savings 4. Tax and the growing inequality of wealth in New Zealand 5. Taxes designed to influence behaviour GST In recent years, several political parties have toyed with the idea of exempting items from GST – perhaps food, perhaps just fruit and vegetables, perhaps sanitary items. I strongly urge the Working Group to resist these calls on three separate grounds. First, once some items are exempted from GST, the political pressure to exempt other items – perhaps children’s clothing, doctors’ bills, dental bills, books, local body rates – would be very considerable. This would almost inevitably involve a considerable loss of revenue, and quite probably an increased rate of GST on the items still caught in the net. Second, while it is certainly true that low income people spend a significant proportion of their income on, say, food – providing the logic for exempting food from GST – most of the money spent on food in the community as a whole is not spent by low income people, but by middle and high-income people. Thus, exempting food from GST would involve a considerable loss of revenue relative to the benefit accruing to low income people. It would be much more efficient to help low income people directly by direct income transfers than by exempting food (or similar items) from GST. 2 Third, many of those who advocate exempting food and other specified items from GST think of GST as just like a retail sales tax, and of course it is not. Yes, both GST and a retail sales tax are levied on sales to final consumers but GST is also levied at every stage of production, with those producing “intermediate goods” (prior to final sale to consumers) claiming back the GST paid in acquiring the materials, components and services used in producing those goods. This is an extremely simple process when there are very few exemptions in the GST system, but becomes markedly more complex as exemptions are added to the system. When GST was first introduced in New Zealand in the mid-eighties, the instruction from the Minister of Finance to the committee which designed our GST was to minimize the compliance costs which would face small businesses as a result of the introduction of the tax. It was easy to see that that was best achieved by having virtually no exemptions. As a consequence, New Zealand’s GST is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. Company tax, including the taxation of businesses owned by charities In recent years, many countries have reduced the taxation on corporate profits, with the sharp reduction in the US corporate tax rate to 21% being just the latest move in that direction. At 28%, our company tax rate is now above the OECD average, and well above some of the other countries we are sometimes compared with (though currrently still lower than the company tax rate in Australia). These comparisons with international company tax rates are a bit misleading, in that New Zealand (and Australia) have dividend imputation regimes which shelter shareholders from the double taxation of company profits. But I nevertheless tend to favour some lowering of the company tax rate because I suspect the “headline rate” remains relevant, particularly for foreign investors contemplating investment in New Zealand. Moreover, there is a reasonable literature which demonstrates that a significant part of the incidence of the company tax rate is borne by wage- earners, so that lowering that rate would, by encouraging more investment, have some positive benefit for wage-earners. I would urge the Working Group not to advocate lowering the company tax rate only for small companies, up to some specified size. That would 3 potentially increase compliance costs as larger companies sought, by appropriate restructuring, to be taxed at the rate applicable to small companies. One of the curious anomalies in the taxation of corporate income is the exemption from tax of income earned by companies owned by charitable organisations. This exemption has been in place for a considerable time and I do not know the background to it. But it is entirely unclear to me why Sanitarium, for example, should be exempt from tax while Kellogg’s is not; or why a bus company owned by an iwi should be exempt from tax while NZ Bus is not. At very least the exemption should extend only to the income distributed by these businesses for charitable purposes, though it is certainly hard to see why simply distributing profits to individual members of, for example, an iwi should be treated in a preferential manner as compared with dividends paid out to ordinary shareholders. The taxation of savings In the late eighties, I chaired several consultative committees on taxation for the Minister of Finance, one of which dealt with the appropriate tax treatment of life insurance and superannuation. As members of the Working Group will know, the taxation of savings in New Zealand differs from the treatment in most other developed countries. In New Zealand and in most other countries to the best of my knowledge, “ordinary savings” into a bank account are made out of tax-paid income; tax is levied on the interest paid; but when funds are withdrawn from the bank they are not subject to tax – Taxed-Taxed-Exempt, or TTE in the jargon. But in many (perhaps most) countries there is a preferential tax regime for long-term, or superannuation, savings, with contributions often being a deductible item from current income, with the income accruing in the superannuation vehicles being either completely exempt from tax or taxed at a preferential rate, and with payments received in retirement again often being taxed at a concessional rate. As I recorded it in my autobiography, 4 The committee \[I chaired\] debated this issue at length, and eventually decided that, while TTE is indeed the approach used to tax all other forms of saving, there was a case to be made for a different approach to taxing savings which were going to be locked away for many years, indeed decades. We recommended that people should be able to save into retirement income funds, what we referred to as RIFs, out of pre-tax income, that income within the funds should be taxed at the company tax rate (then 28%) because of the difficulty of taxing that income at the rate relevant to each individual, that 25% of the benefits could be paid out in lump sum form without incurring tax, but that the balance of the benefits should be taxed in the hands of the recipients as ordinary income – what we referred to as a “modified ETT” system. Our reasoning was partly that giving the “E” at the start of the savings process would provide a strong inducement to save, and that was appropriate given that saving into a pension fund is quite different from saving into a bank account, where savings can be withdrawn at any time. Moreover, allowing the “E” only at the end of the process in, say, 40 years’ time, as the Government had proposed, meant that savers would be vulnerable to some future government deciding to tax withdrawals from the pension fund, particularly if withdrawals were taken in the form of an annuity, with the result that the taxation of pension funds would end up as TTT. Moreover, we argued, TTE and ETT are equivalent in terms of tax revenue received by the government assuming income tax rates remain unchanged, so government would be able to provide a considerable inducement to long-term saving without any loss of the present value of revenue. Alas, of all the recommendations made by the four consultative committees which I chaired, this was the only significant one which the Minister rejected. The rejection was partly to maintain consistency with the way in which other forms of saving were taxed and partly to avoid channelling too much of the private sector’s savings towards the insurance industry, which Roger Douglas felt had done a very poor job of investing the funds backing existing pension schemes. Of course, I do not know how the introduction of an ETT regime for superannuation saving would have affected New Zealand’s subsequent 5 saving performance, though it is hard to see why there would not have been a considerable increase in saving. The Opposition National Party briefly toyed with the idea of introducing an ETT regime for superannuation saving, but dropped the idea after winning election in late 1990. 1 I am not now in any sense well informed on the current debate on the taxation of savings, but I tend to agree with those who argue that the relatively favourable tax treatment of savings invested in, say, owner-occupied residential property (TEE) is a contributing factor in the currently extreme level of house prices. If it is politically impossible to touch the second and third E, then perhaps there would be merit in making the taxation of other forms of long-term saving more attractive. Some recent commentary 2 has suggested that, if the Government were to introduce a capital gains tax in response to recommendations from the Tax Working Group, “it was likely that tax on both capital gains and interest would be adjusted to take inflation into account”, a view attributed to PwC tax expert Geof Nightingale, himself a member of the Tax Working Group. I understand the logic of that, and the political appeal of adjusting the tax on interest for the effect of inflation. But as a former member of the Committee of Inquiry into Inflation Accounting (usually referred to as the Richardson Committee), I hope the Tax Working Group also recognises that if interest received should be adjusted for inflation for tax purposes, interest paid should also be adjusted for inflation for tax purposes. Adjusting the tax system for inflation is a complex business, as the Richardson Committee concluded. In the late seventies, when the Richardson Committee was studying this issue, adjusting the whole accounting system for inflation seemed to make sense because of the quite serious distortions being caused by the relatively high inflation which prevailed at that time. Unfortunately, then Minister of Finance Muldoon was pretty certain that he was not going to adjust the tax system for the effects of inflation, so that the appeal of inflation accounting was short-lived. The subsequent Labour Government implicitly decided it was better to eliminate inflation. 1 Incredible Luck, Don Brash, 2014, pp.55-56. 2 “Silver lining from capital gains tax”, Sunday-Star Times, 25 March 2018, p. D3. 6 Tax and the growing inequality of wealth in New Zealand There has been increasing public focus on growing inequality in New Zealand. In fact, as members of the Working Group no doubt know, there has been no appreciable change in pre-housing-cost income inequality in New Zealand over the last two decades. But there has been a marked increase in post-housing-cost income inequality as a consequence of the failure of successive governments to do anything meaningful to deal with the causes of the enormous escalation in house prices over the last 20 years or so. As indicated above, that has no doubt been influenced in part by the favourable tax treatment of investment in residential property. It also seems very likely that there has been a considerable increase in wealth inequality over the last decade or two as a consequence of the explosion in house prices: those lucky enough to have owned a home, or better still several houses purchased with borrowed money, have become vastly wealthier than those who did not own a home. The question which the Working Group has been tasked to consider is what role the tax system has played in allowing this situation to develop, and more particularly what role the tax system should be playing in seeking to redress some of the wealth inequalities which have arisen as a consequence. It seems clear that while the tax system may have encouraged the escalation in house prices in recent years, the basic causes of the escalation relate to local government planning and consenting procedures, as the Productivity Commission and others have argued. But the combination of those planning rules (including in particular the tight constraint on residential land in Auckland created by the Metropolitan Urban Limit, or Rural Urban Boundary) with the construction of major infrastructure funded by other taxpayers and ratepayers has produced a situation where some people have become extremely wealthy with minimal personal effort and absolutely no tax liability. In 2013, there was an understandable public outcry when 29 hectares of land in the Auckland suburb of Flat Bush, purchased 18 years earlier in 1995 for 7 $890,000, was listed for sale at $112.6 million – the direct result of the Metropolitan Urban Limit and the construction of infrastructure paid for mainly by other ratepayers. The gain on the sale would almost certainly have been totally tax-free. I am not sufficiently familiar with the relative merits of land taxes, capital gains taxes, wealth taxes and “uplift taxes” to express an opinion on which of these options is the best under the circumstances, but there is clearly something inherently unjust to be taxing the ordinary wage earner on his or her hard-won income at up to 33% while not taxing at all the owner of property which hugely increases in value through no effort on the part of the owner at all. That is especially true when the increase in value is a direct result of the construction of infrastructure funded by others. Taxes designed to influence behaviour Since the introduction of GST in 1986, New Zealand has had few taxes designed to influence behaviour – essentially, only taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and petrol, with petrol being taxed not so much to influence behaviour as to provide a direct funding mechanism for the road network. Taxes on alcohol are widely accepted as a way of raising revenue to compensate for the serious social problems which alcohol can create and I certainly have no problem with such taxes. But I have a good deal of sympathy with those who believe that taxes on tobacco are now having more negative effects than positive ones. Evidence suggests that cigarette taxes are no longer producing a significant reduction in smoking but are putting severe economic pressure on the budgets of low income nicotine addicts as well as producing a large number of aggravated burglaries on dairies. In my view (and I am a non-smoker), there would be merit in freezing cigarette taxes at current levels rather than further increasing those taxes, or indeed even somewhat reducing them. I understand that the revenue raised from cigarette taxes now considerably exceeds the cost of treating the negative health consequences of smoking. There is considerable public support for taxes on sugar, and in particular on sugary drinks. While New Zealand clearly has a serious problem with obesity, and that would seem to support a tax on sugary drinks, I understand that a number of studies suggest that such taxes have little or no effect in terms of 8 reducing the consumption of sugary drinks. In the jargon, the demand for sugary drinks appears to be very inelastic. Finally, one of New Zealand’s challenges, especially in Auckland, is severe traffic congestion. The Auckland Council appears to believe that providing more public transport and more cycle-ways will materially improve the situation. But given the relatively low density of Auckland’s population and the unpredictability of Auckland’s weather, neither public transport nor cycle-ways will be an adequate response to congestion. Part of the solution must surely be congestion charging, hopefully modelled on Singapore’s successful system. 25 March 2018

Christchurch Budget Service Incorporated (CBS) is among the oldest budget services in New Zealand having been established in 1967. CBS has consistently provided budget and debt management services and community education for 50 years. CBS is Christchurch’s only independent confidential specialist Budget Service that is not aligned to any political party, religious organisation or Government Agency. CBS specialises in providing services for individuals and families whose main income is derived from employment, superannuitants and students and accordingly I expect that our perspective on social policy payments may differ from the old Federation services and newly contracted Building Financial Capability Services which were and are mainly focussed on MSD (WINZ) Beneficiaries. This submission addresses issues relating Child Support payments and receipts and Working for Families and Independent Tax Credits but also add Accommodation Supplements as they impact on working people who are in precarious, and casualised employment relationships and are often underemployed and do not have reliable regular incomes so are difficult to administer under current policy and procedure settings. At this point it is worth noting that New Zealand does not consistently collect national and or regional data on underemployment though Statistics New Zealand does have a definition of underemployment published in The New Zealand Labour Force at December 2012 (Survey of Working life) Statistics NZ. See also www.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/income-and-work/employment/household-labour- force-survey-info-releases.aspx While the so called GIG Economy is increasingly becoming the norm, Government agencies and their staff struggle to understand that many thousands of vulnerable working people and their families do not enjoy the privilege of a standard Monday to Friday job that provides regular working hours, incomes, statutory leave days, holidays, sick leave and other employment benefits. As a result the administration of Social Policy Payments and policy development assumes standard jobs and regular incomes no longer fits the reality experienced by our most vulnerable working families. Executive Summary This submission addresses issues relating Child Support payments and receipts and Working for Families and Independent Tax Credits but also addresses Accommodation Supplements as they impact on working people who are in precarious, and casualised employment relationships and are often underemployed and do not have reliable regular incomes so are difficult to administer under current policy and procedure settings. CBS believes that the WFF and ITC in their current administrative format are no longer workable due to the changing nature of employment in the deregulated labour market. CBS therefore suggests the following radical rethink of IRD’s administrative process. C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 3 of 9 With regard to wage and salary workers including agency workers CBS recommends that the IRD calculates ITC and WFF eligibility based on the family makeup being the number and ages of the children and issues a Special Tax Code to their employer. Their ITC and WFF entitlements are then based on their gross wage in the current pay period and are paid directly by the employer to the employee with their net wages. ITC and WFF payments are documented in the Employers PAYE return. With regard to Independent Contractors and Self-Employed CBS recommends that IRD assess their WFF and ITC on the basis of 2 monthly GST returns which would be required to claim ITC and WFF through IRD. Payments could either be paid as a single payment or in fortnightly instalments. With regards to Non-GST Registered independent contractors and self-employed who do not have a partner/ spouse who is in employment and comply with the 30 hour per week (20 hour per week for single parents) threshold CBS recommends that the maximum ITC and WFF entitlement is paid directly into their bank accounts as it is unlikely that any abatements will apply. CBS believes that Liable Parent Child Support Payments remain problematic despite the recently amended process to calculate parental liability. It is acknowledged that a number of the anomies are outside IRD’s jurisdiction, and beyond the limitations of Generally Applied Accounting Principles but none-the-less impact heavily on liable parent assessments and fairness and disadvantage children. CBS recommends that IRD assess liable parents’ employed on fixed and or variable salary or wages liability as a percentage of their previous year’s net salary or wages rather than a fixed amount. A special tax code is issued and, like Working for Families (above), the deduction should be made by the employer each pay period and managed through the PAYE System. CBS recommends that IRD assess liable parents who are engaged as Independent Contractors and Self-Employed on the basis a percentage of their a percentage of their previous year’s net profit before tax and then calculate their liability based in their 2 monthly GST returns. By doing this liability is never assessed on data that is older than 3 months so the accuracy and likelihood of compliance is increased. CBS recommends that IRD assess liable parents who are Non GST registered Independent Contractors and Self-Employed as being liable for minimum child support payments given that are likely to have a low-net income before tax. CBS recommends that IRD assess liable parents engaged on mixed wage, self-employed incomes and commission payed outside the PAYE system on all income over the past financial year and calculated on the basis of a two monthly income declaration with the deductions only taken from wages where PAYE is being deducted. CBS recommends that Child Support payments to custodial parents who are not on a MSD Benefit are made more regularly. Making more regular payments to Custodial parents benefits the children and children and assists families to manage their weekly budgets and meet expenses as and when they arise. C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 4 of 9 CBS also takes this opportunity to recommend that Accommodation Supplements are administered by IRD. CBS recommends that accommodation supplements available to people with children who are in employment including Self-Employed and Independent Contractors are best paid directly to the landlord or mortgagor by the IRD on the basis of the claimant’s ITC and WFF payments calculated as recommended above. CBS recommends that accommodation supplements available to employed low-income working people, including Self-Employed and Independent Contractors, who do not have dependent children but are entitled to an accommodation supplement are best paid directly to the landlord or mortgagor by the IRD on the basis of the claimant’s PAYE payments and or GST Returns calculated as recommended above. WWF and Independent Tax Credits. The suggested shift from an annual cycle to shorter pay periods sounds, on the surface, like a good idea that would benefit our clients, however the individual worker, employer and departmental compliance costs and administrative obstacles are likely to be huge. As a result this critical income is likely to become so administratively burdensome that uptake is restricted to those who are able to navigate the system. Furthermore it is likely that risk adverse employers, who already struggle to comply with employment law and administrative compliance, are likely to consider the employment of parents, particularly single parents, as a financial hazard. CBS budget advisers regularly meet people with fluctuating incomes who, due to their uncertain and irregular employment, struggle to access legitimate Independent Tax Credits and Working for Families entitlements when they need them most. Their and IRD’s fear of debt arising from over payments drives them to claiming a lump sum when and if they file an end of year income tax return. If they do incur a liability due to a WWF and or an ITC overpayment that debt becomes a burden in the following year and may well attract penalties and interest all of which negatively impacts on vulnerable working people and their children. In that instance the states priority shifts from the primacy of the child to recovering the debt. This problem is further exacerbated by the temporary nature of some jobs where working people migrate from work to MSD benefits and then back to work over very short periods. Typical examples are the building industry where it is common that workers are laid off in December and are re-employed by the same or a different employer after the summer shut-down and seasonal workers in the meat processing, viticulture and orchard industries. CBS believes that the WFF and ITC in their current administrative format are no longer workable due to the changing nature of employment in the deregulated labour market. CBS therefore suggests the following radical rethink of IRD’s administrative process. C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 5 of 9 Recommendations Wage and salary workers including agency workers. The IRD calculates ITC and WFF eligibility based on the family makeup being the number and ages of the children and issues a Special Tax Code. As the vast majority of employers now either use computerised payroll systems or contract out to payroll services. The employer or payroll service loads the special tax code into the payroll system which will calculate ITC and WFF based on the employee’s taxable wage during the pay period in much the same way as PAYE, ESCT and Student Loan payments are already calculated. The employee will benefit by receiving the correct WFF and ITC every week which will assist them by evening out fluctuating incomes making it easier to manage their budgets. Additional Employer Compliance Costs. This approach could result in significant savings for the IRD as there will not be the need to employ the same level of human and technological resources and office space as is required by the current system. Some of these savings could be redirected to contributing to employers’ additional compliance costs either as a set fee per employee (not recommended), or as a percentage of their total payroll (recommended). Employer Cash flow. This becomes a problem when an employee’s ITC and WFF tax credit are greater than their total PAYE, ESCT and Student loan deductions. For the majority of medium to large employers it is unlikely that this arrangement would have a significant impact on cashflow given that other staff who either have no dependent children and, or are on higher incomes will not have ITC and WFF tax credits added to their regular net pay, so during the payroll period one will effectively fund the other. Some small employers will however potentially run into a cashflow problem. In that case we suggest that the IRD create a mechanism to ensure that the funds are pre-paid directly to the employer through the PAYE system in much the same way as MSD already treats employment subsidies. 2 Income families. In the case of 2 income families CBS suggests that only one of the two linked incomes is designated by the family as the primary income earner. This does not need to be the highest income earner. That income earner would then be granted the special Tax code. Ideally this would be the income earner with the most regular wage over a full-tax year and would work most effectively when that income earner is a full-time employee rather that an agency worker, an independent contractor, a seasonal worker or is self-employed. Independent Contractors. ITC and WFF becomes a significant problem in the current system when working with independent contractors and self-employed traders, many of whom CBS finds actually meet the legal definition of being an employee. Some are not even aware that they are being treated as independent contractors by their employers. In the case of independent contractors the proposed system could be applied to their employer deducted withholding tax; however this is fraught with additional complexity and risk for both the IRD and the individual. A second option would be to assess their C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 6 of 9 WFF and ITC on the basis of 2 monthly GST returns. This would have the additional advantage of encouraging them to adopt a 2 monthly GST cycle which is a useful means of them avoiding significant GST debt. While this option would be inexact, the risk is that they will be underpaid WFF and ITC rather than overpaid which is an improvement on the higher risk status-quo in which no payment of ITC and WFF or overpayments and subsequent debt, interest and penalties are common. Self-Employed The most viable way to ensure that they receive correct ITC and WFF tax credits that are updated and paid regularly are to base them on their 2 Monthly GST returns as outlined for independent contractors above. Non- Registered independent contractors and self-employed who do not have a partner/ spouse who is in employment and comply with the 30 hour per week (20 hour per week for single parents) threshold. Given that these people are, or should be , below the GST threshold they are likely to have a low-net income before tax so are likely to be on or near the maximum ITC and WFF tax credits so there is little risk of overpayment. The most viable option would be to pay weekly ITC and WFF directly into their bank account. Liable Parent Child Support Payments. The first principle must be to do no further harm. The primacy of the child is the paramount concern. While the recently amended process to calculate parental liability is much fairer there are still a number of anomies, some of which are outside IRD’s jurisdiction but impact heavily on liable parent assessments and fairness and disadvantage children. 1) Paternity testing. Currently the child’s mother is able to veto a paternity test. While the rationale behind this is understandable it is also archaic. By denying paternity testing the mother also denies child the right to know his or her ancestry and also denies the father’s right to be certain the child is his while potentially allowing the biological father to avoid liability. 2) Child as the pawn. It is common to find that a liable parent is willing and able to actively parent the child but is denied access or even the knowledge of where his or her children even are, by the custodial parent (primary care giver), when no protection order is in place and there is no history of violence. This has a double impact in that the liable parent’s child care liability assessment is increased under the current (and past ) formula and his/her ability to afford suitable housing to safely accommodate and care for the child is diminished. This generates a self-fulfilling prophecy that the liable parent is likely to fail as a parent. Note: The way in which MSD Sole Parent benefits are structured and administered is a major contributor to the above situation. If the Liable Parent increases the time they spend parenting their child the primary caregiver’s benefit and financial situation is eroded. Ultimately the child suffers. This is counterintuitive to policy and practice commitments to ensuring the primacy of the child and New Zealand’s Commitment as a signatory of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and, arguably, to Section 4 of the Care of Children Act 2004. C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 7 of 9 3) Custodial Parents receiving “under the table” income. While this is in CBS Experience relatively rare it is not unknown. Several cases have emerged over the past year where the custodial parent is receiving informal non-cash income, such as free accommodation and food and support in kind while working in the family business. Under IRD’s current assessment process this income is not a practical consideration so the balance between parental liabilities favours the custodial parent over the non-custodial parent. This problem also arises when one parent (often the non-custodial liable parent) is able to hide income from the other by using trusts and or other mechanisms or owns and operates a business. 4) Significant Wealth Gaps. A further dilemma arises when there is a significant wealth gap between parents. There is a bias in the IRD child care liability assessments that favour asset rich but cash poor parents especially when they are not the primary care giver. 5) Custodial parent being given the family home, furniture, fittings and car. CBS has experienced situations where, mainly men, have left the relationship and the children in the care of their mother and have transferred ownership of the family home, furniture, fillings and the car over and above their legal matrimonial settlement obligations to their ex-partner and the mother of the child as a settlement in lieu of ongoing child support. This arrangement can work well for the custodial parent and the children until the custodial parent goes on a MSD benefit at which time the non-custodial parent is billed for child support irrespective of any prior arrangements. 6) Employers deducting Child support deductions and then failing to complete PAYE Returns or make PAYE payments to the IRD. CBS has come across several cases where clients have been impacted by employers who have failed to make PAYE Payments and or have gone bankrupt owing PAYE to the IRD. In these instances it is feasible that the liable parent will be assessed by the IRD as having child support arrears and as a result will incur penalties and interest charges. This becomes an extremely difficult problem to resolve, especially when the employee (the liable parent) may not have been issued accurate pay slips or any other documentation to verify their case to the IRD. CBS budget advisers frequently find that in this situation the Liable parent is likely to bury their head in the sand and just give up and struggle to pay the arrears, penalties and interest to their own and their children’s detriment. CBS acknowledges there are no easy solution to the above problems and understands that there are a myriad of variants on similar themes. It is understood that the presented challenges cannot be easily defined in financial terms, so while they impact heavily on the fairness or otherwise of Child Support Liability assessments they also fall outside generally applied accounting principles. Current Practical Problems The assessment of liable parent being based on an annual assessment based on both parents previous year’s taxable income is problematic for both the custodial and non-custodial parent. As previously discussed this blunt tool is inadequate in the contemporary deregulated labour market and Gig Economy. Nor does it cope well with contemporary Family / Whanau Structures. IRD is faced with a dilemma. On one hand where a liable parent’s income fluctuates or fall it is highly likely that the Child Support payments are likely to leave the liable parent in a position where they are unable to meet their own basic needs: food, accommodation, clothing and the ability to get to and from work. In this instance it is highly likely that payments will be missed and penalties and C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 8 of 9 interest charges incurred and the custodial parent and children, if not on a WINZ Benefit, will also be left out-of-pocket. While there is a process to review and reassess Child Support contributions it is often difficult for the Liable parent to access and presents a number of bureaucratic hurdles that appear insurmountable especially when there is little or no opportunity for face to face communication. On the other hand when a liable parent’s income increases the state and or the family, when the custodial parent is not on a benefit, misses out on much needed funds until the liable parents liability is reassessed at the end of a financial year. These problems are amplified when the liable parent in particular is self-employed and, or is an independent contractor and or is paid commission. Recommendation: For employed staff on fixed and or variable salary or wages Assessments are calculated as a percentage of their previous year’s net salary or wages rather than a fixed amount. A special tax code is issued and, like Working for Families (above), the deduction should made by the employer each pay period and managed through the PAYE System. This arrangement is either well within the capability of most modern Electronic Payroll Systems or would not require a significant development for most systems. The benefits are that the liable parent would not be left in a situation where they are not able to live on the balance of their net income after family support is deducted and by achieving this compliance is more likely. For Independent Contractors and Self-Employed CBS suggests, similarly to WFF above, Child Support calculations are calculated on the basis a percentage of their 2 monthly GST returns. By doing this liability is never assessed on data that is older than 3 months so the accuracy and likelihood of compliance is increased. These Liable parents would be given the choice of furnishing their liable parent return with their GST return or as a weekly fixed weekly or fortnightly payment over the following 8 weeks. For Non GST registered Independent Contractors and Self-Employed Given that these liable parents are, or should be, below the GST threshold they are likely to have a low-net income before tax so are likely to be on or near the minimum child support payments. In this case the status quo should remain. For mixed wage, self-employed incomes and commission payed outside the PAYE system. CBS recommends that the percentage deducted from wages is based on all income over the past financial year and assessed on the basis of a two monthly income declaration with the deductions only taken from wages where PAYE is being deducted. C:\\Users\\OfficeAdmin\\Documents\\Administration\\Accounting Info\\IRD\\IRD Social Policy\\Submission regarding social policy payments final.docxPage 9 of 9 Child Support payments to custodial parents who are not on a MSD Benefit. CBS recommends that these payments be made more regularly. In the modern era it should not take two months for payments to be made. Making more regular payments to Custodial parents benefits the children and children and assists families to manage their weekly budgets and meet expenses as and when they arise. Accommodation Supplements While acknowledging that Accommodation Supplements are not a IRD responsibility CBS is concerned that they are both difficult for MSD to administer and for low-wage working people, independent contractors and self-employed who do not have a regular incomes to access. CBS acknowledges that MSD is making efforts to develop an APP available on Smart Phones that will make their system more user friendly and accessible however it is unlikely to resolve all the major issues, particularly for people who are not IT literate and or who do not receive regular pay or payslips and for those who are contracted as independent contractors or are self-employed. Furthermore many working people do not want to engage with MSD due to the complexity of the registration process, the real and or perceived social stigma, and the demand for personal information that is not related to their accommodation costs. There is also an unnecessary duplication of administrative process and expense when people must register with two government agencies to access their correct Social Policy entitlements. Furthermore the existence of multiple agencies providing Social Policy payments to the same families increases the opportunity for, and the risk of fraudulent behaviour. Recommendation Accommodation Supplements legitimately available to people with children who are in employment including Self-Employed and Independent Contractors are best paid directly to the landlord or mortgagor by the IRD on the basis of the claimant’s ITC and WFF payments calculated as recommended above. For employed low-income working people who do not have dependent children but are entitled to an accommodation supplement the supplement are best paid directly to the landlord or mortgagor by the IRD on the basis of the claimant’s PAYE payments calculated as recommended above. The entitled taxpayer would be required to submit verifiable documented evidence of their accommodation costs such as rents or home loan, rates and Insurance details or a letter from the landlord in the case of board. The added benefit of this process is that IRD would also be able to cross tabulate the evidence provided by landlords with landlords and or property manager’s tax returns and New Zealand Tenancy Services. The advantage of this recommendation to CBS clients is that the administrative and compliance costs and time commitments are minimised, the accommodation supplement is not captured by creditors, including NZ Work and Income and the accommodation accurately reflects their real income.

It has structure and function. You may not be aware that the system I put forward is capable of handling all goods that enter this country through the use of an additional third party when necessary. It is full digital, so size is not a factor, the cost is minimal, and it covers down to a zero value, so all inclusive. Being prepaid it also avoids the bottle neck going through Customs waiting for payment. It does not matter if the overseas company wants to work with the New Zealand Government or not this system will still work. This System is two or three steps ahead of what the Australians are looking to introduce and without the gaps, whereas this operates more like a firewall and much more efficiently. Shifting the collection of monies owed back onto the purchaser and seller where it should be, as where the local GST is processed in New Zealand today. Letting Customs get on with doing their job. The systems database keys integrates: the purchase details, the customs declaration, the GST collected, tariffs if any including TPP and automatically clears or not clears the goods status through customs. When the goods enter the country, they are scanned with software not too dissimilar from how NZ Post now reads the letters or is manually inputted when necessary. The search function on the database then scans the keys from left to right to match the item, (Transaction number first key) once the item is recognized and cleared it carries on to its destination. If not, it is either investigated for more processing or confiscated. Fear of not receiving goods purchased is a great incentivise from the point of view of both seller and purchaser. This will encourage a increase in uptake from the overseas seller over a period of time. The payments can be handled through a portal in the New Zealand Banking system and with all the money been spent on the new IRD system ideally it would be stationed there. One of the important parts to making it work like clockwork is the tax payment and details need to be logged within the 24 hours or before the goods arrived. When the banking system detects an overseas purchase, the portal automatically opens to the purchaser \[1\] 2 This is also where an agreed third party could be involved and or for where any other outside arrangements that have been made. Once the System is setup and running most of the loading keys will automatically auto-fill. Most of this system already exists in other formats. So, the time to setup would not be that great. Another great part of this system is its ability to run reports for collecting data. What is coming into this country? Where is the product going? Where is it from? Where are any irregularities? and how much is been collected? These are tools for future decisions in investment in this country. This system would not be easy to cheat as it records all the data and that will leave a path. GST is a Consumption tax and not everybody is paying, online sales are growing about 15%putting local Business at risk. This should be treated as important under “fair to all New Zealanders” This country needs a balanced tax system. P.S Another shop went bust beside us today. That will be $100,000 less for the Government to spend per-annum “So what is the harm in looking into this system?” All the Best Regards John Brenssell Virus-free. www.avg.com \[1\]

Introduction We all recognise that the whole tax issue, including those around this working group, were a significant influence on last year’s election. Therefore this whole process is likely to be politically charged. I have never been a Labour Party supporter, and never will be. Nevertheless I hope that all parties will approach this process in good faith, and that good ideas will be recognised as such, and will be implemented whichever party is in Government next term. However I am against taxes which directly target certain portions of society, such as “rich taxes” or “poor taxes”. I don’t think GST falls into this category even though it tends to impact people on lower incomes more simply because they spend more of their income. The following is a bit of a ramble of comments based on the Tax Working Group’s paper. The comments are in no particular order. The issue that really made me write a submission was the idea of a progressive company tax system. I believe this could be of huge benefit to start-ups and the self employed, where there are only one or a few people in a company. 2. Progressive company tax I strongly support the idea of a progressive company tax and suggest that the rates and steps should mirror those of personal tax. In this way they would have very little impact on companies with more than 10 staff or so. I have just started my own business from home last year and am now looking to ramp up the business this year after taking some time to ensure things are set up correctly. One thing I now realise is that the time and costs required to set up a business are often more than initially anticipated. Having recently stepped out on this path I very much appreciate the risks and rewards it can offer. I believe it is unfair to apply company tax at a flat rate because it has a big impact on small and single person businesses, especially when compared with doing a similar role as an employee of a larger firm. I believe our tax system should encourage small businesses, not penalise them. Although it is theoretically possible to minimise taxes paid by carefully balancing company and personal income, in practice this is very difficult. As an example last year I made a payment on Thursday 30 March, hoping to get it in that financial year. However it wasn’t processed until the following Monday. A rookie mistake perhaps, but it does illustrate how difficult it can be to get these balances right. I recognise that if company taxes were progressive in the same way as personal tax there is the opportunity to pay less tax by splitting the income, for example $21,000 at the lowest rate. However I think that is reasonable recognition of the risks taken by people getting into business, and it may help to improve the business failure rate statistics. The example of the Australian small business tax rate is ridiculous. $25m is an awful lot of revenue. I wouldn’t regard that as a small business. 3. Expanding a small business If I generate enough income to keep myself busy and well recompensed, and then want to expand I would need to consider hiring a second person. Suddenly I would have the enormous fixed costs of an additional employee including Kiwisaver, etc etc. This is an enormous jump and risk for any fledgling business looking to expand, and it could easily be several times the previous business costs. Because I am in a professional business the person I hire would be on a professional salary well above any minimum wage. For example if I have enough work for 1.5 people, as business owner I would only receive the income of half a person because I would have to pay a salary to my staff member. Obviously this effect would lessen as a business employs more people, as would the effect on the company of the progressive company tax system. I believe introducing progressive company taxes would make a big difference to the ability of small businesses to start up and expand. 4. Maori and tax I would strongly object to differential tax treatment along racial lines (p11). Although I appreciate that the Treaty of Waitangi is a founding document for our nation, I am not happy with Maori culture and beliefs having such a significant role in the writing of our laws. To put forward particular values such as kaitiatanga suggests a number of things that are completely untrue: • That all Maori hold to these values. • That non-maori do not hold values that are similar. For instance many European immigrants probably hold stronger environmental values than many Maori, but without the spiritual overtones. • That the values of non-maori are of lesser importance. The concept of Living Standards Framework and the “four capitals” is very airy fairy and almost New Age philosophy. This has no place in the establishment of our government and tax system. Certainly a tax system needs to consider a wide range of sources and needs, but let’s not get all mystical about it. A good tax system requires clarity, not mystical concepts and philosophy as its foundation. 5. Environmental issues I have always been wary of the climate change cause. In my view this is far too simplistic and is analogous to a health system that concentrates solely on people’s lungs but ignores the heart, the liver and everything else. The climate change philosophy offers a relatively clean and easily quantifiable target in energy usage. However it ignores the myriad of other ways that mankind pillages and pollutes our environment. I don’t believe it is possible to create an environmental tax system that is able to account for all of the ways in which we damage the environment and therefore it is always going to be less effective than we might hope. 6. Equity issues The report makes a very dubious statement on page 19: “it is clear that New Zealand as a society accepts that a progressive tax system is a fair system”. That statement depends entirely on how those progressive steps are set. Of course this statement also implies that a progressive tax system for company tax would equally be accepted as fair. I would also say that raising the question of fairness between an employee and a contractor or business owner misses the point (p20, 2 nd para). An employee has a fixed salary and therefore generally is able to plan against a fixed income and often doesn’t need to worry about how that income is generated. A contractor or business owner on the other hand has a variable income reliant largely on their particular skills in developing and maintaining cash flows in their business. They also constantly need to make decisions around business costs and consider how they will impact or benefit the business. It is a far riskier proposition and I believe people in this position have every right to be treated differently by the tax system. The final statement of this paragraph suggesting equity implications itself suggests a particular political viewpoint. Figure 11 is quite startling. The fact that 40% of New Zealanders effectively pay negative tax is alarming. This is essentially a massive welfare dependency and is surely very bad for the economy and the country. The final paragraph on page 34 suggests that paying excessive benefits has the effect of locking in dependency. That is something I have always felt to be true, and why I continue to worry about successive governments handing out more and more benefits to low and now middle income households and families. I think this is a much more serious problem than superannuation issue, as it has changed society, and is entirely the fault of the Government. 7. Wealth It is very wrong to consider taxing wealth for a number of reasons. Firstly it is a very communist idea. The reality is that society is made up of a wide range of people who have very different interests and abilities, including when it comes to generating wealth. It is criminal and morally wrong to suggest that beneficiaries and entrepreneurs should both have the same income and wealth. Secondly a person may have an asset, such as a house, and have owned it for many years during which time its value has increased tenfold. That doesn’t necessarily mean they are rich or have significant liquid assets. Thirdly if someone owns an asset that is not active, increasing in value or generating wealth it is entirely inappropriate to consider taxing it. 8. Tax and retirement savings People use a very wide variety of approaches to building up retirement savings beyond just Kiwisaver. Therefore it would be very difficult to determine what are retirement savings and what are not, so I don’t think it is appropriate to treat “retirement savings” differently from other savings. Tax exemptions on Kiwisaver create an imbalance in retirement savings. I don’t believe Kiwisaver should have different tax status from other savings and investment options. The biggest beneficiaries in this scheme are the Kiwisaver providers, who reap all the fees. I have always felt that the system is a con job. 9. GST I strongly disagree with reducing or eliminating GST on certain items, particularly for the express purpose of assisting lower income people. It would create all manner of anomalies and disparities between products. It could be argued that this would unduly advantage certain products and markets over others. It would also create all sorts of complexity with the tax affairs of businesses that use or sell these products. It could also be used to “direct” consumers towards certain products that the Government thinks they should be buying. This is questionable on all sorts of levels. 10. Targeted taxes I am very against targeted taxes such as the proposed sugar tax. I believe this particular example is unfair, arbitrary, ineffective and politically motivated. Talk of taxing certain types of drinks for example make me quite angry. Why should certain products be taxed while other similar products that are just as sugar filled are not? I think it is also incredibly arrogant to try to influence consumer behaviour by taxing certain products and not others. Removing GST from certain products and not others is equally arrogant. Any attempt to apply these sorts of taxes will inevitably lead to a range of negative consequences. On a slightly different note, remember that the Nazis used draconian tax laws to specifically target Jewish wealth in the lead-up to the holocaust. Obviously that is an extreme example, but I don’t believe any state has any business using tax to target certain activities, products or people. 11. Digital economy I think it is right to be concerned about multi-national companies paying their fair share of tax. However I believe that a one size fits all solution is not likely to work in all cases. 12. Housing affordability I don’t pretend to be any sort of expert on the economics of property. I do find it difficult to understand why a house seems to escalate in value over time while all other material items tend to reduce in value. The fact remains that houses, like any other material item, decay over time and need to be renovated and replaced too. Commercial and industrial property have very different economic drivers than residential property, but are still an investment option. A commercial office block’s value for example is largely driven by the value and length of the rental agreements with the tenants. Major and very expensive refits are required periodically. During these periods the property is generally not generating any income but continues to pay rates. There is also now a wide variety of residential property from detached houses to large apartment complexes, rest homes and body corporates. Any discussions about housing affordability need to include discussions about all forms of property. Twenty or thirty years ago there were lots of books about how residential property investment with no money down would net great returns. These books would recommend people build huge housing portfolios. I’m not a property investor, but I don’t think these numbers stack up anymore, and I think capital gains are probably the only factor that makes the game worthwhile now. Property investors would probably have a lot to say about this. Labour governments also tend to side with the tenant rather than the landlord. Increasing the responsibilities on landlords with additional requirements such as warrants of fitness are also likely to change the game. Although I agree that taxation in this area should be fair, I think it would be very difficult to make it so. I think speculators operating in property investment are similar in many ways to speculators in the share market. Neither really contribute any value to the economy, but instead try to draw value from it. One of the big differences though is that people don’t live in shares. 13. Capital gains tax I can see some sense in a capital gains tax if it is carefully applied. I also think that dealing with losses needs to be carefully thought about. There were plenty of examples of people who owned apartments at the time of the Christchurch earthquake whose insurance costs suddenly increased by 1000%, and on top of that they were stung with hefty structural costs. People in this position were suddenly stuck with unsaleable properties. The impact of capital gains tax, or any tax for that matter, on Maori is completely irrelevant. Land tax would have an unfair impact on farming interests. 14. Environmental taxes and incentives I agree that environmental incentives are likely to have negative impacts on markets. An example is the renewable energy incentives in the UK. This had a big impact on solar power because it targeted that technology specifically at the expense of others. It caused a significant industry to develop. Then when the rules were changed after a period that industry was heavily impacted. Another problem with that approach would be that it would encourage installation of solar panels without first looking at how to reduce energy consumption, which is the actual goal. 15. Various issues noted Page 42, second paragraph states: “Tax that is not collected means that others pay more.” What??! I thought there were rules for what tax is paid. I don’t think there is any tax code in the world where that amount of tax paid by person A is dependent on whether person B pays their fair share of tax. 16. Summary I have compiled arrange of comments. Some are just comments in passing that don’t really affect me. In these cases, such as the property market, I’m sure there will be others heavily involved in these areas who would be able to provide much more detailed comment. I defer to their superior knowledge on these topics. Progressive company tax is very important to me, since I have just started up my own business. I also think that is a very important issue of fairness which could help thousands of small businesses find their feet. I am very deeply concerned with the depth that the welfare state has reach, with such a large portion of people effectively paying no tax. This is unsustainable and is a direct result of successive governments digging a deeper hole, which will now be very hard to climb out of. Some of the issues put forward by the report are very unfair and unreasonable. These are likely to further worsen the welfare state problem. I am very against taxes which are designed to benefit or inhibit certain people and/or products or activities.

On behalf of Hon Stuart Nash, Minister of Revenue, thank you for taking the time to write. Your letter has been provided to the Minister for his consideration, You can expect a response in the near future. Kind regards Fro m: Jean-Paul Thull Sent: Sunday, 3 December 2017 3:28 PM To: Hon Phil Twyford Subject: Capit al gains tax - zoning http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-council/news/article.cfm?c\_id=1503784&objectid=11948676 Dear Minister Twyford I applaud your enthusiasm taking the bull by the horns. While it may take a while to fix things, you recognised well that we need to stop property investment as a way to make money without creating any innovative benefits to NZ. Capital gains tax As you may recall, I raised the idea of 10 year capital gains tax, allowing anyone to get into the property market to be carefully considering the idea versus putting investments into NZX/ASX or other more direct productive ventures. Why 10 years instead of 5? In many cases an investor will not be required to invest too much into a rental property but that dramatically changes when it comes to 10 years >> this would lead to renovate and upgrade our poor housing standards across the board. I believe any intelligent person will understand this and YES it may also mean rising rents.... Which could be mitigated by fiscal advantages to be set. You could look at reducing GsT to 5% for improvements (material only) that contributes to thermal benefits or lowering operating costs of a rental property. PV (Photovoltaic) for 3kw is now less than $10k to install but gives the occupant the opportunity to dramatically lower their energy bill, as you will agree that a heat pump ($8 per day in winter) is a major cost factor and just providing a heat pump is not going to make the home warmer if not in use and providing extra financial support to some may end up in smoke, drugs or booze but free heat does not buy these items. We also need to stop building materials increasing in price 5-10% per year as really crazy and not justified. Zoning \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 2 Zoning and individual rezoning applications to differ from original city/district plans have led to much of the transport disaster we are facing and a tram to the airport is not going to fix this if you look at other cities around the world. Put a BRT system in place by removing all car parks along the designated route with quality Volvo hybrid buses and priority signalling at all intersections and you will achieve similar to a fraction of the price. The constant rezoning of NZ cities loses the effect of the gravity model where you can plan for mass public transit in peak times... the CBD in Akl is though working relatively well and perhaps removing access by private vehicles to the CBD or a congestion charge is an option to consider by providing free orbiter buses and other buses within the CBD. Look at park and ride 30 -20- 10- 5km out of the city.....continue what National decided on southern rail link, look at fast rail service between Hamilton- Akl and Warkworth and settle any new residential areas along that corridor.... Something I have been suggesting to Simon Bridges for many years. Anything outside the perimeter of 1km both sides of such a railway should be kept agricultural land and let’s concentrate on TOD Transit orientated Development. Regards Jean-Paul

Submission to the Tax Working Group 25 March 2018 Kerry McDonald Policy & Performance Ratings Congratulations on your background paper. It provides a clear and realistic view, in contrast to the prevalent “cheer squad”, aggregate GDP oriented rubbish. The Savings Working Group (which I chaired) provided a similar context in its January 2011 Final Report. I strongly recommend that the TWG follows the advice of the Savings Working Group on taxation matters, as set out in its Final Report to the Minister of Finance – Recommendations, Tax Policy p14-15 (refer Treasury website). The recommendations relate to a number of still-critical tax policy matters which still need to be addressed. New Zealand’s poor long term economic performance generally reflects poor policy decisions by successive governments, including on taxation; decisions oriented to re-election rather than improving the living standards of New Zealanders. It is notable that politicians and others are critical of various generally larger companies for not paying enough tax. But, the reality is that the companies were/are with very few exceptions complying with the law/tax policy - but the law/tax policy did/does not provide for them to pay a higher rate of taxation, basically reflecting the OECD rules. This matter is only belatedly being addressed. Having been a director of numerous companies, including the BNZ, I am very familiar with this matter and am happy to discuss specific examples. I had retired from the BNZ Board when it, inappropriately, settled its case. Another overseas owned company was informed that a special tax audit was targeted at gaining an additional $120m in tax; but the audit resulted in an additional $119,000 being paid and we received a very positive letter from IRD thanking us for our very positive engagement with the audit. So please stick to the facts and no more political obfuscation! Your background paper is a good start. There needs to be a full review of tax policy, particularly where the OECD rules are outmoded, to get fairer, less anomalous provisions. These rules need to be better aligned with other policies, including on immigration and foreign ownership. For example many people have their home in NZ, their families/dependants reside here and they fully benefit from the expenditure of the NZ government on a wide range of services but they pay no tax here - and often no tax anywhere. This includes highly paid contractors, in many occupations where their work is outside NZ and may be spread between a number of tax jurisdictions. It also includes wealthy individuals who may have token business interests in NZ to qualify for residency, pay little/no tax here and have no tax liability here for their offshore business interests. Current immigration policy is a disaster for the future of New Zealanders. It has to be reassessed, in the context of its tax implications, in terms of which categories of immigrants make a positive fiscal contribution over time, including the impact of dependants; and in terms of National Economic Benefit. Many low skill, low income immigrants have a net negative impact on both criteria. I have reviewed the Treasury data on this question. Their analysis is woefully limited. Yours sincerely Kerry McDonald \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 7 th March 2019 (1) Withholding Tax on residential property rental income (PWT) I believe that landlords should be required to submit a (PWT) Property Withholding Tax similar to (RWT) Residential Withholding Tax on rents received a monthly basis. The reason being is that we have to change the thinking and tax advantages that residential property has over other forms of investment without killing the industry. As a 30 year property person, landlord and long term property investor, property investment should be encouraged not demonised, as private landlord hold an integral part in providing 25% of housing stock in New Zealand. Currently as a private mortgage holder over a residential property I am required to submit a RWT monthly, remitting the appropriate selected tax rate on the monthly interest received on the residential mortgage, so why not on residential rents. I believe there should be a compulsory 20% PWT on all residential rents payable on a monthly basis, similar to withholding tax on commission earnings. Currently the landlord has the total use of the gross monthly rental income less his expenses and is only required to submit that income in his final end of year return. Sometimes this is 6 to 9 months after the end of the financial year. That is a powerful use of money situation and a huge advantage. It would also make the tax payable as and when the income is derived, not some 18 months later. This will actually change the way landlords and banks view the income stream from residential property. It will prepare landlords for the ultimate goal of producing a taxable income and not just accumulate losses which are offset against other income. In conjunction with PWT I support ring fencing losses for rental properties. There are many mechanisms for holding over losses to be applied against future income of the property for a professional landlord. It will incentivise landlords to make future taxable income so that the ring fenced losses can be claimed from their property portfolio. This combination will make landlords conscious of trying to ultimately be income positive long term and be a long term landlord. I appreciate that landlords can then submit their annual rental income statement claiming losses but it puts cash flow positive rental income foremost in their minds. The collection of the PWT would be a simple, it could be a computer entry for landlords who have their property managed or a manual monthly submission similar to RWT for self-managed properties. \[1\] (2) Limitation of Capital Value or Lease Value of Business Vehicles for Depreciation purposes I have never understood why there is not a limit on the value of some business vehicles or on lease business vehicle. Yes I what freedom of choice of motor vehicle, but I see no reason why a commission agent requires a $200,000 vehicle to perform his or her job say as a sales agent. The tax payer should not be subsidising this elitist practice and a limit of value be imposed which relates to a person’s business activates. For example business vehicles maximum depreciated value could be limited to $80,000 to $100,000. This was something Norman Kirk referred to many years ago when he said that “depreciation was designed to assist replacement of a working assets and not provide income tax reduction”. Firms and individual should fund their depreciation so that unrealistic financing costs or leasing rates are not require when it comes time to replace the asset which they have depreciated tax wise. (3) Ability to Income split for households with school age children I believe that the family unit is paramount in the upbringing of children and having a non-working non-income producing family member to look after children should not be penalise tax wise as it is now. The household with only one working parent or care giver it should be encouraged. The philosophies of our taxation system for families with school age children should be based on total household income. If one spouse is not working, 20% of the total household income should be apportioned to the non-working spouse and then both be taxed at the normal rate. A level playing field of taxation is not all about taxing the rich and defending the poor. A family that makes a conscious decision for “a stay at home spouses” should get the same tax advances of what a dual income family currently gets under our tax system. The numbers are compelling but there can be a limit set as to what level the split can be implemented say $100,000 as long as you have children attending primary/secondary school with an age limit of 18 years. The tax implications as shown: Example 1 - Total Household Income = $100,000 Single Family Income Dual Family Income 20% Split Family Income $100,000 $65,000 & $35,000 $80,000 & $20,000 Total Annual Tax Paid by each group for the above income examples: $23,920 $11,050 + $5,145 = $16,195 $17,320 + $2,520 = $19,840 • This Single income family currently paid $7,725 more that dual Income Family • A 20% Split family income pays $4,080 less income tax because of 20% allowance • A 20% Split family stills pays $3,645 more income tax than the Dual Income family Example 2 - Total Household Income = $80,000 Single Family Income Dual Family Income 20% Split Family Income $80,000 $55,000 & $25,000 $64,000 & $16,000 Total Tax Paid by each group for the above income examples $17,320 $8,050 + $3,045 = $11,095 $10,750 + $1,820 = $12,570 • This Single income family currently paid $6,225 more that dual Income Family • A 20% Split family income pays $4,750 less income tax because of 20% allowance • A 20% Split family stills pays $1,655 more income tax than the Dual income family Example 2 - Total Household Income = $60,000 Single Family Income Dual Family Income 20% Split Family Income $60,000 $45,000 & $15,000 $48,000 & $12,000 Total Tax Paid by each group for the above income examples $9,550 $6,895 + $1,995 = $8,890 $7,420 + $1,260 = $8,680 • This Single income family still paid $660 more that dual Income Family • A 20% Split family income pays $870 less income tax because of 20% allowance These reductions in total tax paid by the household is a true recognition of the value of “stay at home spouses” by allowing them to income split up to 20% of the single income family to a maximum of $100,000 household total income. This is very politically correct in my opinion and can easily be worked alongside working for families at the same time. Working for families should then be calculated on the reduced primary income source Kind Regards Jeff Cate \[1\]

Submission to New Zealand Tax Working Group 21 March 2018 By Kerstin Keogh, Dunedin My Background. I did a BCom in accounting in the late 1980s. I have previously worked as a chartered accountant in business services and company accountant for a listed company. Now I still do contract work for a small CA firm, and do the accounts and tax administration at home for about 8 entities involved in commercial property, investing and manufacturing. So I have nearly 30 years’ experience in commerce. I live in Dunedin. I would like to comment only on Capital Gains Tax, GST exemptions, land tax and progressive company tax, as those are areas I feel qualified to speak on. Capital Gains Tax (CGT): I believe it is a tax that sounds good to the uninformed voter, but that would be a retrograde step if implemented for the following reasons: 1 Too complex, high administration costs. Accountants and lawyers will be the winners here. What costs will be allowed against the CGT revenue. Is it simply a tax on inflation? 2 Australia took 15 years to realise significant revenue from this, as purchased assets were gradually drawn into the system, after the implementation date. 3 If we were to back date the base cost price for the calculation this would be arbitrary and onerous, as what date would this apply from? People may not have records for old assets. 4 How would capital losses be addressed? 5 Treatment of inherited assets? It would be essentially a de facto inheritance tax. 6 A CGT would reduce retirement savings for small business owners and shareholders. It would incentivise people towards investing more in the family home thereby favouring home owners more than at present. New Zealanders already favour home investment too much and should not be discouraged from investing in businesses and non- residential property. 7 It is effectively a subsidy for unaffordable cities. Is it fair that someone in Auckland can make a huge non taxed capital gain on their home whereas someone in Palmerston North might make a loss on their home? 8 It is a lumpy form of taxation revenue so the tax flows are difficult to predict. Governments will get hooked on the ability to spend more in the good years, and have to borrow to cover the reduced CGT payments in the poor years. GST 1 There seems to be a social justice movement to change the structure of our GST system so that where perceived luxury goods are taxed more and so called necessities are taxed less. As someone who has been preparing GST returns for various entities since 1990, I would urge the government to leave the system as it stands. It should shout from the roof tops that our GST system is the envy of the tax world due to its comprehensive and simple nature, and its steady revenue stream of good money into the government coffers. It is not the government’s job to get involved in picking winners and losers in the GST stakes. Exceptions and differing rates would create many practical issues: 2 More work for accountants and lawyers, and software developers. Eg refer the ridiculous case in the UK where a jaffa cake/ biscuit dispute around VAT dragged on for years. We don’t need to go down that rabbit hole. 3 Harder to predict GST revenues, and the lost revenue will have to be recovered from elsewhere. 4 If you take off GST from so called healthy food to assist affordability, how do you measure the effect some months later? Most produce is sold at market rates, which move weekly anyway. How would you know if the GST removal wasn’t simply soaked up as extra profit margin by the supply chain? 5 The arguments around essential supplies would be mind numbing. One person’s essential is another’s luxury. Are men’s shavers necessary? Makeup wipes? 6 We already have ‘sin’ taxes in the form of excise duties on alcohol and tobacco. Why introduce extra complexity into what is a fairly perfect administration and steady significant revenue stream for the government. 7 Once again, I believe uninformed people who love a soundbite and social justice, are being given too much prominence. The people who are at the coal face of business are too busy to contribute submission to the TWG, but they will be the most affected by any ideological changes. Progressive Company Tax As a small business accountant, this makes absolutely zero sense to me. It is a soundbite which on first hearing sounds like a good idea. But it shows a lack of understanding of what happens in practice now. What happens now for small companies is they do any or all of the following: 1 Pay a PAYE deducted salary to working shareholders 2 Pay an imputed dividend to shareholders 3 Allocate all of the pre-tax profits to shareholders via non PAYE shareholder salary in the company tax return, and the shareholders are responsible for their personal provisional tax. How would a reduced company tax rate assist in any of these situations? It is a solution to a non- problem. It may give some people the ability to defer paying higher DRWT on dividends, but that is the only effect I can see, and that is a negative for the government’s cash flow timing. In my experience people complaining about tax on business are inevitably poor with money and they fail to invest in a decent accountant. They get tripped up on technically not owing tax in their first year in business, then get hit with the double whammy in the second year. The best accountant I know tells his clients to pay voluntary tax in the first year of business based off their on line monthly reports. He has never had any issues with clients getting behind on tax. The new AIM method may help with this. Land Tax 1 As this will be on commercial properties, it will be a cost to the tenant businesses, and then passed onto consumers, so therefore inflationary. (All outgoings are paid by tenants in commercial leases) 2 It will incentivise investment away from real estate and may create distortions in the economy if set too high. 3 Residential landlords will likely increase rentals over time to cover the land tax as they are in business too but their leases don’t cover outgoings. This will affect low income earners and may be an own goal for the government as accommodation supplement would need lifting. 4 This would be a good regular earner for the government and easy to collect, and difficult to avoid. Much more efficient than a CGT, and simple to adjust the rate. It may need to be introduced to cover increasing government expenditure, but I would prefer they didn’t! Conclusion: 1 Our tax system is actually a very fair and well administered one. Don’t mess with the simple comprehensive GST system, as it is currently the best in the world. 2 CGT would be very complex with uncertain revenue streams, and would hit mainly small business owners saving for retirement. It is a tax on inflation and risk taking and would discourage investment. It would benefit home owners in wealthy areas who would pocket the largest non-taxed capital gains 3 Progressive company tax is a soundbite looking for a problem. 4 Land tax could be an option for a steady, non-avoidable revenue stream, but may be inflationary as rents will be affected for all tenants. 5 Housing affordability is a difficult issue in certain areas but not all areas. Should the poorer regions have to pay for the larger centres’ neglecting to build affordable apartments in the last few years? 6 I think our income tax system is fair at present. Individuals are quite highly taxed when GST, excise duties, fuel levies and ACC are included. 33% top rate is about right, any higher and people start to look to avoid it or move away.

A Submission to the 2018 Tax Working Group Introduction mysuper Superannuation Scheme (mysuper) welcomes the opportunity to contribute a submission on the future tax treatment of pre and post retirement savings. mysuper is a registered workplace saving scheme and is also a complying superannuation fund that was established in 1991. What is the problem we should be trying to fix? New Zealand is currently the OECD country with the most hostile tax environment for long-term savings in financial products earning compound returns (workplace saving schemes, KiwiSaver, superannuation schemes (each a Managed Investment Scheme) bank term deposits and standard annuities) typically the savings vehicles used by low and medium income earners in preparation for retirement. The tax penalty on long term savings consists of two parts. Income tax inherently overtaxes the part of your income you save, because taxing income today unlike an expenditure tax such as GST, taxes future consumption more than current consumption. The impact of taxation is particularly severe when the subsequent earnings on those savings from compound returns (interest on interest) occurs over a long period of time, such as the 40 years prior to retirement. The tax imposed on Managed Investment Scheme earnings in the fund effectively halves the earnings that will be added to your nest egg over 40-45 years. The tax members pay within a Managed Investment Scheme reduces the amount of interest after tax has been deducted, reinvested to earn further interest over 40 years to the point that you retain only 45.3% of the potential earnings in the absence of tax. This is despite the so-called concessional Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rates (i.e. 10.5%,17.5% and 28%) which give the impression members will pay lower than normal tax on their Managed Investment Scheme earnings in the investment fund they have chosen. Research undertaken back in 2010 by the Savings Working Group revealed that taking reasonable assumptions some 90% of a Managed Investment Scheme retirement nest egg would come from earnings within their Managed Investment Scheme and only 10% from their initial contributions and the contributions made by their employer and the taxpayer. Note this is even with the currently highly discriminatory tax treatment in place. Similar discriminatory tax treatment exists for other compound return financial saving products including bank term deposits and is a major reason why, standard annuities are both unattractive and not supplied by any New Zealand based organisation. How can taxing the earnings or interest from savings as you earn make much of a difference to New Zealanders retirement nest egg? Most New Zealanders would think intuitively that paying tax in your fund could not possibly make such a big difference to the amount of money that ends up in your KiwiSaver nest egg at retirement. A simple example might help explain the impact of taxation on your returns, as you earn has on your long-term savings. Suppose your Grandmother for your 17 birthday gives you $10,000 but on condition that you invest the amount for 48 years. She wants you to spend it only after you reach age 65. You have a fund to invest it in, that pays 6% interest each year, but the fund has to pay a 50% tax on each year’s earnings on your behalf. To calculate the time it takes to double your money you can use the Rule of 72. That is divide 72 by the interest rate you are being paid and it tells you how many years it will take to double your money from compound returns (earning interest on interest). If you paid no tax on your 6% interest, the Rule of 72 tells us that 72 divided by the interest rate of 6% means your initial $10,000 of savings will double in value every 12 years. Over the next 48 years your initial $10,000 investment would double 4 times. So, your initial $10,000 becomes $160,000 by the time you reach 65 if you pay no tax on your 6% interest income. If however you need to pay a 50% tax on your annual interest earnings, the after-tax rate of return drops to only 3%. This means only half the earnings can be reinvested each year to earn compound returns (interest on interest). You can use the Rule of 72 to calculate the time it takes to double your money if the after-tax return is only 3% each year. 72 divided by 3 gives the answer 24. Your fund now doubles only every 24 years. This means that over 48 years earning 3% each year your savings only double two times so your initial $10,000 only grows to $40,000. So compared to the tax free 6% return, the 3% net after-tax interest (after paying a 50% marginal income tax rate), on your annual interest earnings, the marginal Effective Tax Rate (ETR) over 48 years of saving is 75%. Calculating the Effective Tax Rate With a 6% return your nest egg grows to $160,000 over 48 years. With an after tax return of 3% this drops to only $40,000 over 48 years. So the effective tax rate over 48 years is 160,000-40,000 = 120,000 divided by 160,000 which is 75% compared to the marginal tax rate of 50%. The effective tax rate increases the longer the period of saving continues. This means taxing compound returns in Managed Investment Scheme, particularly hits those who are on lower incomes who need to save a little each year for a long time to build up a large retirement nest egg. What is the tax treatment for retirement savings in most other OECD countries? In most OECD countries by contrast, these countries for retirement savings made through locked in superannuation schemes you do not pay income tax on the contributions you make into your fund, inside the fund your earnings are not taxed but you do pay tax on the income you receive from your fund in retirement. This type of regime is called EET short for your contributions into your fund, are Exempt from tax, inside the fund the earnings are Exempt from tax and the withdrawals are Taxed. This was the tax treatment for superannuation in New Zealand prior to 1989. The current regime in New Zealand is TTE, that is your contributions into Managed Investment Schemes are out of already Taxed income, the income your contributions earn with in the KiwiSaver fund itself are Taxed but your withdrawals after age 65 are Exempt from income tax. This tax change has been highly distortionary for earnings between different forms of long term retirement savings. The effective tax rate on an owner-occupied home is 0%, for an investment in a rental property held for 20 years with 80% gearing can be about 2% and on a term deposit or other debt instrument over 50%. (A conservative Managed Investment Scheme is fairly close to this at 54.7% over 40 years of saving). 1 The effective tax rates on bank term deposits and the bonds which dominate the conservative Managed Investment Scheme investment funds are much higher than the marginal income tax rates they would be paying on their other wage and salary income. How do New Zealanders save for retirement? For New Zealanders the main avenue for investing their retirement savings one is via a Managed Investment Scheme. and the other is by investing in residential rental property. Some more risk averse savers invest in bank term deposits. For those on middle or lower incomes particularly if they do not own their own homes it is almost impossible to save for a comfortable retirement by putting a little away each week for a long time to get the benefit of compound returns (earning interest on interest). This is because – based on the low employer contribution rates (i.e. 3%) – on an income of $70,000 or less you need to save steadily for a long time to build up your retirement 1 Source 2013 Financial Services Council, report, “The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand. nest egg you need to fund a comfortable retirement (about $300,000-450,000). On that sum you can earn about $300 a week on top of your NZ Super. However, the longer the period over which you need to save, the higher is your effective tax rate because of the impact paying tax within your fund has on slowing the growth of your savings, from the lower after-tax earnings being reinvested into your fund. To achieve a comfortable retirement most New Zealanders consider they will need an income of $250-300 a week in addition to NZ Super. To do so a low or middle income New Zealander would need to save $300-450,000 over their working lives in addition to paying off their home so that it was freehold by the time of their retirement. There are different ways you could accumulate a nest egg of $450,000. You could save about $4,000 a year for 40 years, a challenging but not impossible task for someone earning $70,000 or less each but the effective tax rate on their savings would be 54.7% if you are in the 33% tax bracket. That effective tax rate would be lower, closer to 40% if you could save $40,000 a year for the last 10 years prior to retirement to age 65 but almost no one earning $70,000 a year or less could save $40,000 a year. Under the current tax settings that nest egg of $300,00-450,000 is almost impossible to save for, in a Managed Investment Scheme or in term deposits for someone on a low or even median income. The tragedy we have is that the savings products (i.e. Managed Investment Schemes) most easily used by low and middle income earners have the highest effective tax rates. That is the people in most need of saving for the long term face the biggest penalties for doing so. How did the Problem arise? In the 1980’s attempts were made to ensure all forms of economic income were taxed on the same basis to create a level playing field for investment. It was initially applied to most forms of remuneration and along with the introduction of GST widened the tax base which enabled income tax rates to be reduced. Greater reliance on wide based expenditure taxes and less reliance on income taxation is consistent with what optimal tax theory would suggest to assist economic growth. In 1989 in order to increase tax revenue and reduce the fiscal deficit the tax incentives to save in superannuation schemes were removed and the EET superannuation regime was switched to a TTE regime. This created the largest gap between the effective tax rates on residential real estate investments which were highly concessionary and the taxation of superannuation which became the most highly punitive of any OECD country. As is so often the case, a tax policy, that was fiscally helpful in the short term was disastrous for our social well-being, housing our population and economic growth in the longer term. What are some Solutions that could fix the problem? These are alternative approaches to create a level playing field which are: 1. Optimal Tax Theory would suggest moving to an Expenditure Tax treatment for Retirement Savings EET Move from New Zealand’s current TTE system to an EET regime that most OECD countries use. (A comprehensive expenditure tax, Kaldor approach is consistent with optimal tax theory). 2. Reduce the PIE rates to zero to create a level playing field Move to a TEE regime by reducing the PIE rates (and other tax for non-PIE Managed Investment Scheme) all to 0% for retirement savings locked in till age 65 and continuing if an approved annuity or other approved savings product is purchased. Any withdrawals at 65 or later that were taken as a lump sum and not used to purchase an approved annuity would be taxed at 25%. A variation could be any withdrawals at 65 or later, the first 30% could be taken tax free, but any amount over the first 30% not used to purchase an approved annuity would be taxed at 30%. 3. No options for income in retirement Between 2021 and 2060 KiwiSavers reaching age 65 will have combines nest eggs of some $468b to spent or invest. At the moment there is nothing in place to encourage the KiwiSavers with maturing balances to invest any of that money is products to provide a reliable amount of ongoing income. We would suggest that tax policy should encourage retirees to save some of their Managed Investment Scheme nest egg, in a way to provide a steady income stream in addition to NZ Super in retirement. The current tax settings actively discourages this approach. If retirees blow all their Managed Investment Scheme balances and then become soon dependent on NZ Super then pressure will mount for NZ Superannuation to be increased. We would suggest that Managed Investment Scheme withdrawals that are not transferred to an approved annuity be subject to a 25% withholding tax. Note the offsetting benefit is that your new post retirement savings product would continue to have access to the zero PIE tax rate on earnings reinvested within the fund. If this is not done then a new anomaly would be created. Someone who elected to stay in their KiwiSaver fund after 65, using it to draw down regular withdrawals would continue to enjoy the lower PIE rates but those who moved to another locked in savings product such as an annuity or term deposit would not. 4. Remove Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax Move to regime where PIE rates remain the same (or are increased) but Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax is completely removed for all employer contributions to all Managed Investment Scheme. This would also need to be combined with any withdrawal at 65 or later that were taken as a lump sum and not used to purchase an approved annuity would be taxed at 25%.

Historically, these were introduced in response to clear “market failures” in a pragmatic fashion alongside other budgetary items. Yet, these can be characterised as inter-generational transfers that have a strong insurable element about them. Thus, in a number of countries pensions and health are dealt with as predicable items of social insurance rather than subject to the vagaries of budgetary determinations. In New Zealand we have not done this. In consequence we have massive unfunded future liabilities associated with our state superannuation scheme and an annual wrangling exercise with the health sector (and its steady erosion in real terms under the previous administration). Yet, at the same time, we also have the rudiments of social insurance schemes for both sectors - KiwiSaver and ACC respectively - which we could be in a position to formalise and develop. And we also have the example over the Tasman, where the Australians have a levy-based superannuation scheme and a universal Medicare based on an income levy, together with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). I propose that we progressively take superannuation and health out of the usual tax take, carry out actuarial estimates of their rates on a regular basis, set them up at some arm’s length from short-term electoral politics (a bit like ACC, but better), and underpin them with regulations and structures that will ensure their efficiency and flexibility. 1. We should build on KiwiiSaver and ACC to establish twin social insurance schemes for future superannuation and health costs respectively. This would permit income and company tax rates to lower, but in part be replaced by actuarial levies on employees and employers. 2. KiwiSaver and the Superannuation fund should be considered together so that we can progressively transition our state pension scheme from a Defined Benefit to a contributory scheme with a guaranteed benefit (as it currently is). For example, when Sweden made a similar transition, individuals were given notional accounts in their equivalent to the Superannuation Fund as a token and promise. Individuals would be free to save more than required for the basic superannuation, but the role of KiwiSaver and the Superannuation fund would in the first instance be to ensure that no citizen of New Zealand with the requisite residential qualifications would fail to gain the current “National Superannuation” pay-out. This could be represented as an annuity, but guaranteed. KiwiSaver fees for the basic super would have to be controlled because high fees can add ten years onto the qualifying period for building a viable superannuation nest egg. 3. ACC should be extended to cover illness (as originally envisaged), but with the income support element taken out of and placed in an entity equivalent to the Australian NDIS. ACC rates vary by industry risk. This could be extended to other harm-inducing industries such as alcohol, tobacco and sugar, which could be levied in proportion to their estimated impact on the health budget. It would be important to reduce the transaction costs of service payments, with the use of salaries, capitation and bulk-billing (as in Medicare). This change would be carried out progressively, and individuals could still, as they do now, take out private insurance cover over and above their social insurance. However, in Australia this has been allowed to grow as an alternative tier that requires over $10 billion taxpayer subsidy a year. This has proved to be a costly, confusing and unnecessary exercise for Australia. \[1\] 2 This proposal builds on two current New Zealand schemes- KiwiSaver and ACC - that provide the rudiments of social insurance but that have failed to fulfil that potential. These schemes would provide budgetary certainty for their respective sectors and communities, they would improve the national rate of saving, and they would allow income and company taxes to reduce accordingly. Further Thoughts 1. GST. I am against any carve-outs (say, for low-income people). It is a bad precedent. The way to help low-income people is to give them adequate financial support. Instead, I think the TWG should look at the extension of GST to financial services, and dropping the rate back to a nice round 10%. It is anomalous that in an economy that is increasingly “financialised” and where the banks are so dominant that we do not have the wit to charge GST for financial services. And then there is a financial transactions tax. Again, it seems anomalous that we are among the most traded currencies, and yet gain no benefit from this. 2. Added value. One of New Zealand’s major weaknesses is the apparent inability to build and capture added value for our primary sector exports. Is there any way in which adding value can be encouraged legitimately through the tax system? 3. R&D tax write-off. I favour anything that will encourage an increase in our R&D. Most other countries use some kind of tax write-off, and we seem likely to follow. The only problem I see is that in other countries much of the benefit is captured by a few very large industries/companies. Is there any way of ensuring the benefit gets spread around? 4. Externalities. I am in favour of businesses and other agencies “internalising their externalities”. The obvious area is environmental externalities where the community picks up the tab for glass, plastic, polluted rivers etc. But consideration should also be given to health impacts. ACC does this for injury-causing industries. Why not other health impacts such as alcohol, tobacco and sugar for the health equivalent of ACC (see proposal)? 5. Capital Gains Tax. I think it is unhelpful to discriminate between different kinds of income. For any given individual, all sources of income should be aggregated and taxed accordingly, regardless of source. The Institute of Public Policy Research has suggested the UK government follow the German example of smoothing out tax levels and aggregating income sources to eliminate sharp shifts in marginal tax and between sources of income – using a formula-based approach. https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/tapering-over-the-tax 6. Exempting the family home. I am not aware of any jurisdiction where the family home is included in capital gains calculations, so, while theoretically possible, in practical terms it is not. However, some countries do place a limit on the value of a so-called family home that can be fully exempted. One can imagine that an exemption of the family home might lead to huge investment in this item, thus making purchase of a house even further out of reach for first home-buyers. There must be a practical formula linked to median house prices. 7. Treatment of savings. It has been said that the Lange-Douglas reforms instigated a form of “intergenerational theft” because it favoured current populations over future savers. I am in favour of savers getting a better deal – evening up the playing field for different forms of investment (particularly against the undue favouring of property). However, I am not in favour of tax incentives, unless carefully structured, because in almost every other jurisdiction where this is attempted the tax gains go disproportionately to the better off. 8. Trusts. These are used to shelter wealthy and not-so-wealthy people from tax. Apparently New Zealand has an abnormally high number of family trusts. This must be a function of tax treatment. It is important that this shelter be removed so that people pay their fair share.

Your excellent paper on the Future of Tax (Submissions Background Paper) invites suggestions for such reviews. Some of my submission will relate to such further reviews or issues which could benefit from being considered in the context of this reviews recommendations. A number of the points I wish to make have arisen from consideration of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) but which are relevant to your present review. Note that “Social Dividend” conveys the purpose of a UBI more accurately and may become the preferred name. I will use it herein. I will not attempt to deal with minutiae. I believe that these should be considered within the framework of a major restructuring of the system. I am delighted that your Submissions Background Paper clearly anticipates such a restructuring although your Terms of Reference appear to prevent it. Without such a restructuring your review can only result in another of the “fiddles” of the past. Many of the issues are interrelated but I will divide my responses ( I am reluctant to call them answers) to the questions related to the Chapters of the Submissions Background Paper. CHAPTER 2: THE FUTURE ENVIRONMENT The risks and uncertainties of the future have been well outlined in the Submissions Background Paper. Simple projections of the past are clearly unwise. Democracy, Inequality and Environmental Sustainability. These issues are perhaps the greatest tests for the use of Government’s taxation weapons. These three are related since the wealthy can afford to buy or make use of the things which are in short supply and thereby increase their rate of exhaustion. Apparent prosperity is currently built on the poverty of sections of the people who, necessarily take a short term view. I want to emphasise the view that Inequality unchecked will destroy democracy and our civilization as we know it. The will and the means to progress to environmental sustainability may thus be delayed or destroyed. Recent political upheavals lend this view credence. Hence, in my view above all else, the ​reversal of the current growth in inequality is essential.​ Those who can afford to own the new technology will benefit most from its use unless we develop means of ensuring “trickle down”. Social sustainability is required to achieve environmental sustainability. My submission does not attempt to suggest any specific environmental taxes. CHAPTER 3: PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES OF A GOOD TAX SYSTEM The notion of fairness Fairness is a difficult concept. It is very much a matter of how things are viewed and what the purpose behind the view may be. The concept of the “deserving poor” implies that there are also the “undeserving poor” and that the fair entitlement of one is different from the other. And that those of one “class” or ethnicity are more entitled than those of another. 1 2 My own view is that a fair system must allow societies “losers” to live with dignity and to be able to reasonably hope to have some “winning” for themselves and their children in the future. Also to feel that those who are better off deserve to be so. My focus is on the effect of the combined tax and benefit systems on individuals, their families and their associates. Benefits are not a formal part of this review but are, inescapably, connected to it. The net effect on individuals is the difference between what Government “giveth” and what Government “taketh away”. Apart from exceptional cases my view therefore is that, as far as possible, to be “fair” Government should give all its citizens the same services in terms of education, health, law etc and the same financial payments, concessions and incentives. In return Government should take the same proportion of citizen’s income and their wealth to pay for what Government does or what it redistributes. This principle should be applied as far as possible and used to assess the performance of the system. I give some examples below of these simplifying concepts which may be relevant to your review or its recommendations for later work. They can be tested for horizontal and vertical equity as well as efficiency and simplicity. CHAPTER 4: THE CURRENT TAX SYSTEM GST GST as currently structured is the best tax system I know of. Its application to goods and services being without exceptions is the reason for this. It is a feature that must be maintained whatever level is set for GST. Making any tax for something dependent on the name given to it is begging for avoidance and evasion. For example reducing GST for “fresh fruit and vegetables” sounds good. But does this apply to frozen vegetables, or ones that have been in a cool store, or ones that have since unfrozen. Even without the adjective “fresh” there is room for argument -Some people do not include pulses - peas and beans etc in the category of vegetables. Currently GST at present is simple, understandable, visible and efficient. Avoidance by some tradespeople is known but this is unlikely to be a large percentage of the whole. And if the ill-gotten gains are then spent GST is collected on that spending. If the gains are saved then a wealth tax would capture some of them. One problem is that GST falls most heavily on those who must spend all of their income on survival. This could be partially dealt with by including an estimation of its effect in a Social Dividend. Retirement savings In my view there should be no discrimination between savings of various kinds. Why would calling something a retirement saving justify its being taxed differently from saving for a house? Especially as having one’s own house is so important for comfortable retirement? CHAPTER 5: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT TAX SYSTEM & CHAPTER 6:THINKING OUTSIDE THE CURRENT SYSTEM The structure of our present personal tax system. Lower tax rates for lower incomes are beneficial for those on lower incomes but they benefit those on higher incomes more. ​Is this fair? ​It clearly violates the principle of vertical equity referred to in the Submissions Background Paper. 2 3 I would be happy to elaborate further but it is not my purpose here to discuss all the Social Dividend details. However, to a considerable extent, the justification for Social Dividends stems from the above fact and I will have to deal with relevant issues. The tax cuts proposed by the National Government before the election highlighted this unfairness in our system. Moving the 10.5% rate from $14,000/yr to $22,000 gave no benefit whatsoever to those below $14,000 and $560/yr to those above $22,000 while the move of the 17.5% rate from $48,000 to $52,000 gave those above $52,000 a further $500/yr. The more you have the more you get. Currently, above $70,000/yr the rate is 33% but such income benefits from all the lower tax rates. The tax saving compared to paying 33% on all that income is $9080. But, for example, on $14,000/yr the benefit from paying 10.5 % instead of 33% is only $3150. The further reductions from 33% for higher incomes are of no benefit to low income earners. If we paid someone earning $70,000/yr, or above, $9080 but charged them 33% on ALL their income they would be in exactly the same net position as at present. ​So why do we not do this for everyone? This would be a tax-free Social Dividend. ​It should depend only on age - like superannuation. There would be no surveillance, stigma or substantial administration. Someone with no income would be better off by $9080/yr. The net improvement in income would diminish to zero at $70,000. Everyone would pay the same rate of tax regardless of total income. There are many arguments about Social Dividends of various kinds ranging from being a human right to degrading the moral fibre of the nation leading to “layabouts” in unprecedented numbers. I see it as largely a matter of securing a fairer, simpler and more readily collectible tax system. The simple-minded case against such a Social Dividend is the cost. For adults, aged 18 to 64, the annual cost ( in 2015 figures) would be some 26 billion. But note that the Income Tax take from these Adults, excluding the Income Tax from Superannuitants, will increase with a uniform 33% rate by roughly $18 billion. This is because, apart from recovery from those on less than $70,000/yr, all those on or over $70,000 per year will be paying an additional tax of $9080/yr on their salary up to $70,000, negating their UBI. So the cost for an adult Social Dividend of $9080 per year with a 33% tax rate would be only 8 billion per year. It would need the tax rates to be increased or a new tax - possibly specifically for the purpose. Other benefits could be decreased by the UBI amount but this would still need the administration and other humiliations and complications of these benefits. Should we therefore go a little further and raise the Social Dividend so as to be able to get rid of most of the current benefits and administration. Of course the cost and the benefits of a Social Dividend depend on the the actual size of the Social Dividend. If it is sufficiently high for adults then many things like the Job Seeker Benefit can be discontinued and help to meet the cost. The Submissions Background Paper on page 25 shows the present total cost of Social Security and Welfare as about 25 billion. Of this some 14 billion is superannuation. Of the remaining 11 billion the continuation of hardship allowances but with administration savings may result in some 7 or 8 billion in savings from this 11 billion - leaving superannuation unchanged. For a more extensive discussion on this, transition issues, comments on possible tax systems and other matters see a number of my papers at perce.harpham.nz. In practical terms a Social Dividend of $11,000 per year (instead of $9080) for adults while making no changes to Superannuation or Child (including teens) arrangements will cost about 31 billion. So we would have huge social benefits and the net cost would fall to about 6 billion. We would still need more tax. Alternatively we could increase Income Tax for adults to nearly 38% but then those 3 4 above about $60,000/yr would be worse off. And the tax would not do anything about the accumulated inequality in wealth. Various types of taxes have been designed in bygone eras to distribute accumulated wealth. These have been eroded to extinction by avoidance, the establishment of trusts and the exercise of the power of the wealthy. Property ownership is a good proxy for total wealth. So a good choice for a new tax to maintain fiscal balance with a Social Dividend 0f $11,000 per year for adults could be an Asset Tax of about 0.5% collected together with local-body rates on the improved value of properties. It would be easy to collect and hard to avoid. Whoever paid the rates would pay the tax. This would discourage the use of resources in elaborate housing and, with the Social Dividend, reduce inequality. It would probably also decrease house prices. Note that individuals would get only one Social Dividend regardless of how many houses they owned while companies, trusts and non-resident investors would not get an Social Dividend. For the reduction of inequality and collection of revenue the virtues of a tax on the whole value of properties should be considered even if the revenue is not occasioned by the introduction of a Social Dividend. As discussed below there should be no exemption for family homes. An Asset Tax could be easily extended to include assets which are currently registered such as vehicles where the registration fee does not relate at all closely to the value of a car. Yachts and aeroplanes are also candidates but the Wealth taxes in India for example have been made ridiculously complicated and ineffective. Many taxes are possible. Many fail the fairness tests and exacerbate inequality. There is a need to protect those with little in the way of assets from the Asset Tax. At first sight this could be by exempting the first, say, $200,000. But this gives the same benefit to all who own their home and does nothing for those who do not have a home. ​Is this fair? If there were to be a Social Dividend then it would be easy to increase it by an amount to pay the Asset Tax on a property of say $200,000. Since the Social Dividend would be paid to each person then two people sharing a property would be covered for the Asset Tax on the first $400,000. And those without homes would benefit by the increased Social Dividend. This follows the principal enunciated earlier to give everyone the same benefit from any Government tax concession or payment. And those without property will have to pay rent which will probably increase because of the Asset Tax. But if the Social Dividend approach to dealing with the inequity embedded in the stepwise system of Income Tax is not adopted some other way of achieving that end needs to be developed. And, clearly, to achieve vertical equity it is necessary to tax those with higher incomes at a higher rate. The large step in the tax scale at present is in going from 48,000 per year to 48,001. The rate goes from 17.5% to 30%. A 12.5% jump from one dollar to the next. We should deal with the problems of the current large steps in the tax scale and the application of the lower rates to the higher income earners. One approach is for each level at which the tax rate is raised to apply the new rate to the whole income. There is great scope here for different approaches. Suppose the tax rate up to $100,000/year remained at 33% and then went up to 34%. The first additional dollar would incur a tax of 34 cents plus 1% on $100,000. A sudden slug of $1000. But the second additional dollar and later dollars would only incur the 34 cent charge. Another 1% rise at $150,000 would incur a $1500 charge and so on. Many variations can be considered. And their effect on the taxation revenue calculated. 4 5 If there were a Social Dividend and a 33% tax rate to start with then the effect of steps could be greatly reduced from the present even if the new rate were not applied to the whole income. Each step in the case above would then not involve lump sums at the changeover and would only increase the tax rate by 1% instead of the much higher figures at present. There is a huge simplification possible if we can establish a “fair” income tax system. In this case we can potentially abandon all the little complications which afflict many Government systems such as denial of student loans if the parent’s incomes exceed specific amounts, the claw-back of benefits as incomes rise, the denial of Community Service Cards above certain levels of income and other dis-incentives for people to earn above a certain amount. Taxation of Family Homes The idea of exempting family homes from various taxes has an attractive emotional connotation but fails every test enumerated in the Submissions Background Paper - simplicity and efficiency, vertical equity, horizontal equity and fairness. Defining a family home for tax purposes is far from simple. See the huge efforts and attempts at definition which have been made by IRD for the purposes of the “bright line test”. Also note the work being done by the Law Commision to define the division of property on the break-up of modern, complex, multiple marriages and other forms of association. Any such tax must be extremely complex and inefficient. Its very complexity will be likely to lead to evasion and avoidance. It will be subject to many amendments and never-ending legal argument - particularly when dealing with family rearrangements and bitter dissolutions. A tax dispensation for family homes will greatly reduce the tax base and result in reduced Government revenue. For any desired level of such revenue the burden will then fall on the homes that are not owned by the resident family. That is the burden will fall on the many who rent their homes. ​ ​Those who have more get a dispensation which is not available to the less well off. Horizontal equity is violated. ​Is this fair? Again, the value of properties varies enormously so any dispensation based on whether or not family homes are exempted has enormously different financial effects. There are said to be “family homes” valued at some $20,000,000​. ​For others their ‘family home” may be an old van. Vertical equity is violated by any taxation dispensation based on ownership of a family home. ​Is this fair? CHAPTER 7: SPECIFIC CHALLENGES Housing Affordability It is well accepted that taxes, or the lack of them affect business decisions. The primary driver of house prices is probably the balance between supply and demand. No doubt any change in the tax structure applied to housing will affect the eventual balance level but any change will take considerable time to stabilise. Anyone considering renting-out a property as a business investment rather than a speculation for capital gain will want to see a return on the investment. So taxes will have to be taken into account as part of the business plan. Taxes on housing will therefore affect rents. This impacts the increasing proportion of those who rent and who may never be able to buy a house of their own. The immediate effect of imposing taxes on properties may be to reduce their value and may result in houses which are not currently rented being sold more cheaply thereby increasing the supply of houses to rent or allowing a renter to become an owner thusreducing the demand for rentables and so stabilising rents. On the other hand depending on the demand the rents may simply continue to increase but, perhaps, at a slower rate. The note below on capital gains is relevant as is the one above regarding tax on family homes. 5 6 Capital Gains Tax The questions asked in Appendix 2 of the Background Paper bear testimony to the complexity of such a tax. Apart from the inevitable avoidance and evasion issues there will then be large administrative and legal costs as a result. If there are to be Capital Gains taxes then in fairness capital losses should, I think, be allowed to offset them. Government revenues will then diminish in an economic downturn at the very time that they will need an increase. On the other hand a CGT can be a gift to some of the wealthy. Consider the examples of “buy-back” of shares by companies such as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. They are very complicated but effective ways of buying back at less than the market price so that tax losses can be claimed. These losses are made up by issuing fully franked special dividends to those who agree to the buy- back so that the effective prices paid to shareholders is close to the market price but the tax loss can be offset against other income. A “stamp duty” applied simply as a percentage of the sale price on property has much to commend it. If it is not complicated by exemptions for family homes and the like it becomes just like GST but is collected every time a property is sold. Easy to understand and easy to collect. Also an Asset Tax as described above can be seen as a kind of progressive CGT paid annually. In my view it would be better to choose other simpler taxes, such as these two, which also reduce inequality instead of a CGT. Land Tax The idea of a land tax has been advocated for some centuries and still has some adherents. But it could mean that someone (e.g. an old widow) living in a house sandwiched between two apartment blocks could be paying the same land tax as the owners of the apartment blocks. And the tax base would be much narrower. If the same revenue were to be collected a land tax would bear heavily on farmers and market gardeners. I am not aware of any argument for a tax on the unimproved value of land which does not apply with greater force to the case for taxing on improved value - meaning the value of the property including the land. We face a major issue of inequality of wealth which means that any balance that there may have been between the competing ideas of land tax or a total property tax should now be resolved in favour of the latter. Progressive company ta​x All that a progressive company tax would do, in my view, would be to lead to fragmentation of larger companies with increased costs of compliance and administration. This would be especially likely if the progression was in large steps. The present moves to reduce the compliance burdens on start-ups and small companies will do a great deal to assist them. If they are making a profit they are OK but the burden of having to comply with complicated rules and regulations and/or to pay for accounting services can consume time and energy which is desperately needed for survival. Answers to other questions put to submitters, so far as I feel that I have any, are given above. QUESTIONS NOT ASKED WHAT SIZE OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD WE HAVE? The answer must be that it depends on what kind of society we wish to have. At one extreme Government controls and owns everything. At the other extreme civilization as we know it ends. The use of proportion of GDP as a measure of Government performance. GDP is itself a peculiar statistic which increases with calamities such as earthquakes. It has very 6 7 little relationship to the efficiency, effectiveness or “right size” of Government. The North European economies that we most admire have a Government Expenditure to GDP ratio of around 50%. The use of such a ratio as an overarching control on the total of our taxes and therefore the size of our Government seems incongruous. It has been said that “taxes are the price of civilization.” My limited reading of the budget allocations of the successful European economies indicates that their Governments provide many more services to all free of charge rather than targeted benefits. This approach clearly reduces the effect of inequality as measured in terms of income or wealth because the same services are available to all regardless of the financial differences. Comparisons of the ratio of Government Expenditure to GDP are clearly also meaningless for other reasons such as the split of responsibilities between national, regional and local governments as well as private/public partnerships and subsidies and other distorting issues. One of the pernicious effects of adopting this measure as a control target is that it is most easily achieved by reducing services and benefits as has been dramatically demonstrated in recent years. This is exacerbated by including benefits paid along with Government expenditure - OBEGAL. The nature of other expenditure and of benefits is fundamentally different. Government controls the final expenditure in one case but not the other. In my view a great improvement in the management value of reporting would be to remove the distribution payments (such as some 14 billion of superannuation) from the OBEGAL and to report it separately. This would give us some feeling for how far we are moving to reduce inequality and thereby preserve the “market system”. And judgments as to whether Government should engage in any activity as well as whether to fund it by immediate taxation or borrowing is a complex matter which should be made on a case by case basis and not be affected by some simple number of doubtful meaning. The decisions and timings for activity also depend on physical and other factors - not merely on the costs. Why are tax rates for a company different from those of ordinary persons? Companies are legal persons but have progressively secured many legal and financial advantages over ordinary persons. ​Is this fair? GST might be considered to be a tax on a company’s income but because of the reclaiming of GST on purchases, although not on staff costs, GST also has a relation to profit. The taxation of any business - sole trader or company - is necessarily complex and to attempt to charge the same tax rate on income for companies as for persons would be very difficult so a tax on profit is clearly required but having a different rate for each does not appear fair. The usual justification for reducing the tax rate on companies compared to that for people is that this is what other countries do and it is said that we must compete. Again, comparisons are problematic. With the deterioration in public health services it has become more common for NZ companies to provide staff health care insurance and this is much cheaper than in some other countries. Similarly with retirement benefits and many of the taxes which affect company expenses - such as fuel taxes, payroll taxes, customs duties, tariffs etc to say nothing of the cost, availability and productivity of staff. All of these things and more affect the profitability of a company after tax. Such things are considered in deciding where to locate companies. To reduce compliance costs as well as reducing our tax evasion and avoidance industry we should keep the tax rate the same for both companies and persons. We could also then abandon PIEs. How do we control the finance industry? There is great concern world-wide about the behaviour of the finance industry which has led to successive financial crashes. Attempts to control this industry by regulation have not worked and will not work if the regulations are not enforced, and/or not enforced across national boundaries. 7 8 Is it possible to device taxes which lead to curtailment of the problems? Care is needed to avoid getting the wrong effect by making special provisions for any group. We do not charge GST on financial transactions because of perceived difficulties in doing so. I know of one case of a financial institution buying a supplier so as to avoid having to pay GST on the services the supplier provided. But much of the problem is because of the peculiarity that banks are allowed to lend more than than they can pay. Ordinary company directors are liable if they “ trade while insolvent”. But banks can lend up to the Bank Ratio that currently applies. Mr Muldoon used to change this frequently. But a bank can legally lend up to, perhaps, 8 times what it is worth. Financial transaction taxes and “positive money” have long been discussed. The whole matter of banks and the creation of debt is getting world-wide attention and needs its own review. When NZ owned the Bank of New Zealand which had 45% of the NZ banking services we were almost 45% of the way to the “positive money” goal. By properly capitalising Kiwi Bank we could, perhaps, get there again and have Government at least share in the profits from the leagally privileged position of banks. But if banks paid an increasing tax on the debts that they “sell” would that act as a deterrent to the malpractices and excessive creation of debt? Say 0.5% on the first multiple of debt compared to net worth and rising by 1%, or more or less, for each later multiple. Clearly this would raise the cost of borrowing but at this time of low interest rates something of the sort ought to be worth consideration. ​As an old engineer, having established and run computer software companies in NZ, Australia, the USA and China and spent my business life largely in the design and establishment of computer systems I tend to think of how things work and how different ideas can be made to work. I sympathise with the complex tasks facing the Working Group and would be happy to contribute in any way that I can. Good luck! 8
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Will keep it brief, this isnt my area - but as a country we need to be able to fund services for an aging population, to cool the property market, avoid wealth accumulation and transference and to make tax fairer to middle class battlers and without penalising production. How about the government look at income possibilities outside of taxation? The government could invest in income generating assets such as the SOE’s to reduce the taxation burden. ACC's portfolio is great example of that. Suggestions: • Tax rebates for those on private health insurance. This will push more on to the private sector insurers without Govt disdavantaging private insurers who will essentially pay taxes twice for health. The same applies for private Education. • Scrap GST on rates, This is a tax on a tax and completely unfair. This would also set rates back 15% and give local govt and ratpayers more room to move. More disposable income would mean this GST is picked up on consumption or their is more tax from savings. Restricting rate increases to inflationary levels is another story. • GST could also come off pescriptions but I dont favour making complex policies like removal from fruit and vegetables, or a fat tax or sugar tax. These are totally impractical and unworkbale. • Maori arent parrticipating enough in business and self determination is ending up with just a few prospering and growth being limited. Trusts have tax advantages already so dont see any tax changes creating additional benefit and this certainly cannot be aimed directly at Maori. One possibility is that up to 2 professional salaries for each trust can be claimed as a partial rebate. This would ensure they can hire the best CEOs, CIOs and grow as a business to return more profits to trust beneficieries. • Online transaction charges need to ensure goods, services and transactions arent cicumventing paying their share of tax burden. This "internet tax" is well worth pursuing to make a workable solution. This may invlove software or take the form of a financial transaction tax which could be applied accross the baord. • I would like to see company tax reduced to 27% for companies less $10m income per year and complinace costs reduced with rebates. Those comapnies earning more than $10m pay 28%. This may stimulate economic growth through increased employment. However there is a demarcation between companies paying tax in NZ and those shifting earnings overseas. We must pursue tax avoiders and tax evaders to the letter of the law. International companies must pay their taxes owed to NZ. • We are an exporting nation, our standard of living deends upon it and exporters need all the incentives they can get. Also hitech companies need rebates for R&D up to 5% if we are to be internationalyy competitive. In regards to other tax brackets I suggest introducing 2 other steps: $0-10k 0% universal for everyone including "paper boys" $10.01-$30k 14.5% $30.01-$50k 17.5% $50.01-$70k 28% $70.01-$90k 32% 90.01k - 150k 34% 150.01-350k 36.5% >350,01 42% • Trading in assets such as residential housing or commercial property without paying tax on profits generated requires ring fencing. End tax breaks for investment property to reorganise NZs investment habits towards productive enterprise. CGT that excludes family home is necessary. Perhaps taxing vacant urban land could be considered. Land bankers and vacant houses owned by investors are inhibiting the supply of residential homes pushing up prices and affodability and increasing total personal debt levels held by Australian banks. • Reviewing and removing tax exmption status for various trusts, churches and charities. This has become tax avoidance. Similarly most gaming machines are owned and administered by charitable trusts, another area that could do with an overhaul. Tax on casinos and gambling profits should be increaed. • As part of managing our environment sustainably, dissauding large numbers of freedom campers and to be able to afford infrastructure to support tourists we should charge vistors an arrival tax $50. Capping total tourist numbers to 2 million visitors a year would be part of this. Moreover every tourist should be checked they have either travel or health insurance. $400k a year is spent on their medical services courtesy of NZ taxpayers • Tax on domestic water use. This is essentially regional govt managing of resources but commercial activity that profits directly from fresh water should pay for it. This includes bottlers, however I suggest this is local and pure water exports are banned out right. • Superannuation is tax being spent. However superannuitants are paid when they reach 65 automatically whether they are in full time work or not. Paying a benefit and that is what it is, while in full time employment must cease. • Taxation on retirement savings and investments needs to be reduced slightly to encourage more savings and self sufficiency during retirement. In conclusion, Inheritance tax may be outside of the scope of the Terms of Reference for the Working Group but consider the easy money acquired by watching assets go up in value, or inheriting from those who have watched assets go up in value (all of which attracts little or no taxation) as opposed to working hard to acquire money (which attracts high taxation). Taxing this wealth transference is imperative if we are to maintain an egalitarian society where if you work hard you get ahead. Does NZ want to be a society that has intergenerational wealth or poverty, depending on where you are born? Abolish secondary tax for workers and create Death Stamp Duty, or Gift Tax. Not the same as inheritence tax but which has a sliding scale depending on the size of estate - essentially an estate duty if you will. Thanks for your time. regards, Marc Galle

Tax Working Group question 1 22/03/2018 • What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? Risks and challenges 1 Tax evasion and corruption. There are many people in my community who work on a cash only basis. This is insidious and undermines society. It is also very unfair increasing the financial burden on honest people who pay their taxes. The challenge is to detect tax evasion efficiently and prosecute, recover lost income plus fines. I don't see this as happening much if at all in my local community. Personal rationalizations such as “everyone else is doing it”, are not OK. The growing problem needs to be dealt with, if not it will spread wider and into power and governance structures in NZ eroding economic growth, general societal welfare and social justice. 2 Climate change. Business as usual equals failure to adapt to coming environmental changes and the consequences of this include national economic decline, and more frequent business failures. The welfare states ability to cushion severe personal hardships will lessen as the ratio of wealth generating to loss making acivities increases. 3 Epidemics. An epidemic could infect a large proportion of the population and diable or kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of New Zealanders putting an impossible to recover from burden on welfare, health, and governance infrastrucure and personnel. Which of these are most important? The above 3 points are equally important. 1 and 2 are developing slowly and at an accelerating rate. 3 is almost certain to happen and could occur at any future time within a period of weeks to months. Ideas on how the tax strucure could help ameliorate these risks. By incentives stimulate innovation and diversity in economic, business activity and research and development. For examples 1 Further research into agrichemicals, potential pharmaceuticals, anti viral and antibiotics from plants and other natural biota. eg from Feijoa fruit see https://www.ruraldelivery.net.nz/stories/Feijoa-Research-at-Victoria-University and https://hikurangi.enterprises/2017/11/18/drugs-from-feijoas/ and RURAL DELIVERY SERIES 14, EPISODE 1 March 24 2018 Bio-pesticides are being created to fight pastoral pests at AgResearch Lincoln 2 My project breeding Feijoa plants with long storing fruit for exports in shipping containers. see https://www.ruraldelivery.net.nz/stories/Feijoa-Breeding 3 Link the NZ Intellectual Property Office activity, funding and goals to real business and research activity. The NZ taxpayer pays for buildings and staff in the NZ Intellectual Property Office which has little real connection to actual business and economic activity or research. Eg Current and past VUW work on feijoa fruit extracts from fruit from my land has found new compounds and ultra potent fungicides that have international market potential value in the billions of dollars but to date the University has insufficient funds or it appears commercial expertise to file for provisonal patents. This is going to produce a potential loss to the NZ taxpayer of gigantic scale. Regards, Nigel Ritson

I/We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. I/We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. I/We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine (Lancet). Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori - these are unjust. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to addressed • Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been • New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. • Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). • People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, we recommend the following: • Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% • Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) • Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. • It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. These recommendations are fair as low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. \[1\] Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the most fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups.
