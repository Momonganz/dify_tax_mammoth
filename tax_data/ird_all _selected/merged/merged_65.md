RLWT on certain disposals of residential land in New Zealand by offshore persons and are pleased to see that a number of our submissions and others on RLWT have clearly been taken into account in drafting the bill. (EY) We support the concept of RLWT, the approach by officials to keep the calculation both simple and broadly representative of the final tax liability, and agree that it should not be a final tax. (PwC) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. No clause Issue: RLWT should not be introduced Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed RLWT should not be introduced, because the compliance and administrative costs are likely to significantly outweigh the amount of revenue collected. There is no evidence that the Commissioner’s current tools (including the OECD Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, double tax agreements, and tax information exchange agreements) are ineffective or ineffective enough to warrant the introduction of the proposed new regime. The enactment of the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 have significantly bolstered the Commissioner’s ability to collect tax from not only the bright-line rule but also other land taxing rules, including the intention test. Comment In the regulatory impact statement Options for optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test, officials noted that a key objective of the proposed RLWT is to support the integrity of the bright-line test as part of the wider tax system. In addition, the introduction of RLWT would also ensure that the tax system retains coherence and fairness, as New Zealand imposes withholding taxes in relation to other forms of inco me in similar circumstances (that is, when a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there 3 could potentially be enforcement or evasion concerns) – including employment income, investment income, and income received by non-resident contractors. It is also consistent with international norms (that is, many countries that impose tax on sales of certain property also require tax to be withheld upon the sale). Officials acknowledge that there will be additional compliance costs incurred in determining whether a vendor is subject to RLWT and paying the required amount of RLWT to the Commissioner, and additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue. However, officials do not agree with the submitter’s statement that the conveyancing agent for every residential land transaction will be required to determine whether the vendor is an offshore person. Officials consider that the offshore status of the vendor should only need to be determined if it has first been determined that the sale occurs within two years o f acquisit io n. As the majority of transactions are sold outside the two-year period, the offshore status of the vendor will not need to be determined in most cases. Further, where the transaction has occurred within a two-year period, for individuals who are New Zealand citizens and present in New Zealand at the time of sale, proving that they are not an offshore person should be relatively straightforward. Other aspects of the rules (such as calculation of the RLWT amount) are intended to be as simple to apply as possible, while maintaining the integrity of the withholding tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 2 Issue: Introduction of RLWT should be deferred Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) The introduction of the proposed RLWT should be deferred until there is more information about the effect of the information requirements and bright-line test on enforcement and collection. The Committee should undertake a full review of the property reforms, preferably before the RLWT is implemented. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The implementation of the proposed RLWT should be deferred as there will be a very short timeframe between enactment and coming into force. Conveyancers will need to review their client engagement approaches, processes, and systems in order to meet their obligations as soon as the RLWT rules come into force. The RLWT rules will create a need for conveyancers to identify affected transactions at early stage in the process, not just at the final settlement date. (EY) We acknowledge the Government’s rationale, but we do not support the implementation of an RWLT at this stage at least because the cost of the RLWT will significantly outweigh the revenue collected and protected. It should be delayed to allow the wider land information requirements to be bedded in and tested for their impact on, and compliance with, the bright-line 4 test. A deferral would also allow time for Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme to establish a more efficient process for the withholding tax. (KPMG) Comment In the regulatory impact statement Options for optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test, officials considered whether it would be preferable to first assess compliance with the bright- line test (using data collected under the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015) before a regulatory response (the proposed RLWT) is introduced. That option was not preferred, because if there are low levels of compliance, the Commissioner will need to rely on her existing tools and powers to remedy the non-compliance in the period prior to the review. Inland Revenue has been working with representatives from the Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Society of Conveyancers to design and implement a product that would work for both Inland Revenue and the conveyancers and solicitors involved in the RLWT process. If the legislation is enacted, Inland Revenue will work closely with these professional bodies to ensure that their members are informed of and understand their RLWT obligations before 1 July 2016. In addit io n, it is unlikely that many transact ions will require RLWT wit hho lding when RLWT is first implemented. This is due to the fact that only residential land acquired on or after 1 October 2015 will be potentially subject to RLWT. Thus, in July 2016, only residential land disposed of within nine months of acquisition will be covered. Officials will monitor the implementation of the new rules and report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue if concerns with the effectiveness of the rules are identified. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. No clause Issue: Reporting of information on RLWT collected and refunded Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Committee should require Inland Revenue to collect and report information on the amount of RLWT collected and refunded following the filing of interim and final income tax returns to determine the fiscal effect and effectiveness of the proposal. Comment Officials consider that RLWT needs to be as simple as possible for withholders to apply and difficult to avoid. A trade-off arising from this approach is that the RLWT collected will only 5 be an approximation of the ultimate tax liability. To mitigate the impact of this on cashflow when the ultimate tax liability is likely to be less or nil, it is proposed that the RLWT system has an interim return process. Given the policy objectives of simplicity and integrity, information on the amount of RLWT collected and refunded may not give an indication on the effectiveness of the proposal. However, officials will monitor the implementation of the new rules and report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue if concerns with the effectiveness of the rules are identified. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No clause Issue: Compliance costs Submission (Auckland District Law Society, PwC) The imposition of “paying agent” status will add significant costs and increase lawyers’ exposure to risk and thus professional indemnity insurance premiums. (Auckland District Law Society) The design of this tax should be carefully considered to ensure that compliance costs do not outweigh the revenue raised, as that would go against New Zealand’s general tax policy principles. (PwC) Comment Officials acknowledge that requiring conveyancers and lawyers to act as paying agents for the purposes of the proposed RLWT will increase compliance costs and potentially insurance premiums. However, the proposed RLWT has been designed so that conveyancers and lawyers will not be considered true withholding agents in the sense that they will not be held liable for the underlying amount of RLWT when RLWT has not been withheld. This should assist in limiting the potential increase in professional indemnity insurance premiums. As noted in Issue: RLWT should not be introduced, a key objective of the proposed RLWT is to support the integrity of the bright-line test as part of the wider tax system, not just to raise revenue. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 6 No clause Issue: Transitional measures Submission (EY) Transit ional measures should be included in the legislation to exclude land disposals where the bright-line date occurs before the RLWT rules come into force. Comment The legislation proposes that RLWT will apply when a vendor acquires residential land on or after 1 October 2015 and disposes of the land within two years of acquisition, and that vendor is an offshore person. However, RLWT will only apply when a “residential land purchase amount” is made on or after 1 July 2016. Generally, a “residential land purchase amount” will be payment that equates to 50 percent or more of the purchase price and will occur upon settlement. The payment of a “residential land purchase amount” will not always coincide with the vendor’s “bright-line date”. (The vendor’s “bright-line date” will in most cases is the date that the vendor enters into an agreement to dispose of the land.) There may be instances when the vendor has entered into an agreement to dispose of their residential property before to 1 July 2016, but settlement does not occur until after 1 July 2016. If the vendor originally acquired the property on or after 1 October 2015 and has disposed of it within two years, there is likely to be an income tax liability and RLWT should apply as long as a residential land purchase amount is made on or after 1 July 2016. It should not matter whether the contract to sell is entered into before or after 1 July 2016. Officials consider that the lead-in time before the introduction of RLWT on 1 July 2016 is sufficient enough not to warrant a transitional measure such as that proposed by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 41, 43 and 44 Issue: Due dates for RLWT Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, EY) It is not clear that payment of RLWT on a basis other than a monthly one is permitted. Proposed sections RL 5 and RA 15 should be amended. It would be preferable to delete 7 proposed section RL 5(2) and to insert into section RA 15(2) that the 20 th of the following month is the due date by which RLWT amounts need to be remitted to IRD. (EY) Provision for payment at time of settlement or monthly to IRD would be appreciated. (Auckland District Law Society) Comment Section RA 15(2) provides the due dates for different types of tax payments and is dependent on the length of the payment period. When the payment period is a month, it provides that the amount is due by the 20 th of the following month. Section RA 15(3) provides further information as to the specific payment period for each tax type. A proposed amendment to section RA 15(3)(b) provides a signpost that the payment period for RLWT will be monthly and refers the reader to proposed new section RL 5, which also provides that payment is on a monthly basis. This follows a similar structure to the other tax types covered by section RA 15. While the draft legislation provides that the payment basis for RLWT is monthly, the due date is by the 20 th of the following month. This means that an RLWT paying or withholding agent will not be precluded from remitting RLWT to the Commissioner earlier than the 20 th of the following month or in batches. Officials consider that no further amendment is necessary, but will clarify the issue in guidance. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 8 WHO RLWT APPLIES TO Clause 45 Issue: Definition of “offshore person” is inconsistent with the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 definition Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The definit io n of “offshore person” is inconsistent with the definition introduced into the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the purposes of the information requirements. The definition for RLWT purposes should be consistent. We do not understand why they are different and no explanation has been provided. It will be costly and difficult to comply with and enforce. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition should be the same as or consistent with the definition introduced in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015. There should be as little scope as possible for confusion and uncertainty on the part of conveyancers and persons involved in the land transaction. It is not obvious from a policy perspective why a different approach should be taken. (EY) The definition is wider than the definition for the land information rules. We see no reason for the inconsistency as it will cause confusion when there are different results for RLWT and land information. We recommend that the definition of “offshore person” under the RLWT rules be consistent with the land information definition. (KPMG) The disparity between the definition proposed in the bill and the definition used for the purposes of the land information tax statement rules may cause confusion for conveyancers with a resulting increase in compliance costs. If the difference is to remain, Inland Revenue should ensure that conveyancers are alerted to the differences in any subsequent explanation of RLWT and that any confusion caused by the differences is taken into account in considering the imposition of penalties for non-compliance. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 introduced a new concept of an “offshore person”. This concept is used for two purposes. First, offshore persons must obtain a New Zealand bank account in order to apply for an IRD number. Secondly, offshore persons must generally always provide their IRD number when they are transferring property (that is, the main home information exemption is not available to them). For individuals, the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 provides that an individual will be an offshore person, if they are not a New Zealand citizen and they do not have a residence- class visa. A New Zealand citizen or a holder of a New Zealand residence-class visa will be an offshore person if they are not present in New Zealand, and they have not visited New Zealand within the past three years (in the case of a New Zealand citizen) or 12 months (in the case of a residence-class visa holder). 9 For non-individuals (a company, trust, partnership, or other body of persons), the definition in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 broadly follows the test contained in the Overseas Investment Act 2005. The offshore person definition in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 that applies for individuals is the same as the offshore person definition for individuals for the RLWT. However, in the bill as introduced the definition for offshore persons who are non-individuals is not the same. The offshore persons definition for RLWT, for both individuals and non-individuals, was initially proposed in the officials’ issues paper Residential land withholding tax in August 2015 as being identical to the definition contained in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015. However, submitters to the issues paper raised a number of concerns in relation to the offshore persons definition for non-individuals. RLWT requires an assessment of whether a person meets the criteria of an offshore person by a withho lder – usually the vendor’s conveyancer. The withholder will need to obtain sufficient information about the offshore person in order to make that assessment. In contrast, taxpayers self-assess whether they meet the criteria for an offshore person for the purposes of the bank account requirement and the land information. This meant that certain features of the Tax Administration Act 1994 definition of offshore persons for non-individuals, while appropriate in the context of the bank account requirement and main home information exemption, may be more complex or difficult to comply with in the context of a withholding tax regime. Further, some questions were raised about how the Tax Administration Act 1994 definition applied in the context of trusts when there are discretionary beneficiaries. The definition of “offshore person” for non-individuals (as introduced in this bill), was changed to make the rules clearer for withholders while still maintaining integrity. As submitters have noted, this resulted in the offshore person definition applying in a wider range of situations than was initially proposed in the issues paper. It is acknowledged that as a result, some people will not have a tax liability and will therefore have tax incorrectly withheld. These are generally individuals or trusts who have the main home exemption available to them or people who are in a loss situation. The interim claim mechanism was intended to ameliorate the effect of this incorrect withholding. It is noted that if officials’ comments in relation to certificates of exemption are also accepted, then the impact of a wider definition applying is reduced for those with a main home or those who are in the business of being a developer. However, officials note that apart from these groups, almost all persons caught under the offshore persons definition as proposed in the bill will, prima facie, have a tax liability under the bright-line test (and if not under the bright-line test, then under another land taxing provision). As discussed below, some changes are being made to the proposed definition for non- individuals. These will make the definition more consistent with the thresholds in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 and the Overseas Investment Act 2005. As noted below, we also agree that the term “offshore person” should be changed to reduce confusion. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 10 Clause 45 Issue: Definition of “offshore person” is too broad for non-individuals Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) The definition of “offshore person” is too broad for non-individuals (companies, trusts, and partnerships). The definition should just look at the shareholding percentage. The current proposal is overly cautious, as all subsidiaries of foreign businesses would be “offshore persons”. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition should have a 25 percent control aspect like the Tax Administration Act 1994 definition and Overseas Investment Act 2005. It is excessive that a New Zealand-incorporated and tax-resident company could be an “offshore person” just because one of its members, directors or executives is an offshore person. (EY) There is a strong argument for limiting RLWT application to individuals who do not live in New Zealand, and non-resident entities. Alternatively, the bill should define an offshore entity as a New Zealand company, trust or partnership that does not have at least one New Zealand shareholder, trustee, or partner. If this submission is not accepted, we recommend that a New Zealand incorporated company and/or established trust/partnership should only be an offshore person if the majority are offshore persons. It should not apply when the entity is majority owned or controlled by non-offshore persons. (KPMG) The definit io n is too wide-ranging in relation to trustees and non-natural persons. (EY) The definition of “offshore person” is likely to capture a large number of family trusts, which is likely to significantly increase compliance costs for family trusts. (Chapman Tripp) Comment As noted above, the definition of “offshore person” for non-individuals was amended to make the rules clearer for withholders, while still maintaining integrity. As submitters have noted, this has resulted in the offshore person definition applying more widely than initially proposed in the issues paper. It is acknowledged that as a result, some people will not have a tax liability and will therefore have tax incorrectly withheld. These are generally individuals or trusts who have the main home exemption available to them, or people who are in a loss situation. The interim claim mechanism is intended to ameliorate the effect of this incorrect withholding. However, officials note that apart from these groups, almost all persons caught under the offshore persons definition as proposed in the bill will, prima facie, have a tax liability under the bright-line test if they have disposed of residential land within two years of acquisition (or under another land taxing provision depending on the circumstances). 11 After discussing the issue with the independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, officials agree that some modifications to the definition of “offshore person” for non-individuals would be appropriate. Officials consider that these modifications still ensure that the rules are relatively simple to comply with, while maintaining integrity of the rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 45 Issue: Companies – directors Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, New Zealand Law Society) It is unclear why one executive or director that is an offshore person should be sufficient to make the entity an “offshore person”. Many New Zealand incorporated companies should be regarded as offshore for RLWT purposes. The requirement should be for the majorit y o f directors to be New Zealand residents, rather than all of them. (New Zealand Law Society) The requirement for directors should be limited to a requirement for the majority of the directors to be New Zealand-based in order to not be an offshore person. There will be some companies that are clearly domiciled in New Zealand and are New Zealand taxpayers, but that may have an offshore director. (Auckland District Law Society) The test should be whether the majority of directors are “offshore” persons, or whether control is exercised offshore. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is excessive that a New Zealand-incorporated and tax-resident company could be an “offshore person” just because one of its members, directors, or executives is an offshore person. (EY) Comment In the bill as introduced, a company with at least one offshore director would result in an entity being an “offshore person” and subject to RLWT, if they have disposed of residential land within two years of acquisition. Officials note that almost all companies that dispose of land within two years, prima facie, will have a tax liability under the bright-line test (or another land taxing provision depending on their circumstances). It was expected that the requirement for all directors not to be offshore persons would be relatively simple to determine and would provide a higher degree of integrity. The independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee has suggested that instead of requiring all directors not to be offshore persons, the company should be “offshore” only if more than 25 percent of directors are offshore. This would be consistent with the approach taken in the Overseas Investment Act 2005, which identifies overseas persons for screening purposes. 12 Officials note that this would result in more situations when RLWT will not apply even though the entity has a liability under the bright-line test if they have disposed of residential land within two years of acquisition (or under another land taxing provision depending on the circumstances). However, officials agree that a 25 percent threshold, combined with certification of this fact by a New Zealand director, would provide an acceptable level of simplicity and integrit y. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 45 Issue: Companies – shareholders Submission (KPMG) A company should be an offshore person if it does not have at least one New Zealand shareholder. If this submission is not accepted, it should only be an “offshore person” if the majority of shareholders are offshore persons. Comment Officials note that almost all persons caught under the offshore persons definition as proposed in the bill will, prima facie, have a tax liability under the bright-line test if they dispose of residential land within two years of acquisition (or under another land taxing provision depending on their circumstances). Further, the 25 percent threshold for shareholding reflects that contained in the Overseas Investment Act 2005. Officials consider that this is also appropriate for RLWT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 45 Issue: Companies – certification of shareholders Submission (Auckland District Law Society) Many companies will have a plethora of shareholders and it may be impossible for a lawyer to assess whether 25 percent threshold has been breached. How will a lawyer determine this? 13 Could they rely on certifications of directors, or on the residential addresses registered at the Companies Office to make that determination, or a combination of the two? There should not be any comeback for the lawyer if they have made their best efforts to ascertain this. Comment Officials acknowledge that it would be difficult to require lawyers and conveyancers to identify all shareholders and determine whether they are offshore persons, particularly in the case of indirect shareholders. It was envisaged that by requiring all directors of a company not to be offshore persons themselves, the offshore status of the company could be determined by requiring all of the directors to certify the relevant shareholding of the company. This would enable appropriate follow-up action by Inland Revenue to be easily taken in the event that the information provided by the directors proved to be incorrect. After discussion with the independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, officials agree that only one New Zealand director should be required to certify the shareholding of the company, rather than all directors. This still maintains a reasonable degree of integrity but would more appropriately reflect commercial reality. The withholding agent would be able to reasonably rely on this certification by the director. The requirement to certify the shareholding should be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 45 Issue: Companies – New Zealand incorporation or registration Submissions (Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society) A company incorporated or registered in New Zealand should not be an offshore person – it should be sufficient to rely on these companies returning tax owing in the ordinary income tax return process. (Chapman Tripp) It should be clarified whether a company incorporated outside New Zealand that is registered as carrying on business in New Zealand will be an “offshore person” and if so, it is unclear why it should be so regarded given its New Zealand business presence. It should be clarified whether a company incorporated in New Zealand and registered as doing business in another jurisdiction will be an offshore person and if so, it is unclear why it should be so regarded given its New Zealand incorporation and hence New Zealand tax residence. (New Zealand Law Society) 14 Comment It would not be appropriate to exclude all New Zealand incorporated or registered companies from being an “offshore person” as this could undermine the application of RLWT by encouraging companies to incorporate or register in New Zealand in order to avoid RLWT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 45 Issue: Companies – fixed establishment Submission (Chapman Tripp) A company engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment should be excluded from the definition of “offshore person”. The conveyancing agent should be able to reasonably rely on the written representations of the vendor as to whether it has a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Comment The “fixed establishment” is a tax concept that depends on the facts and circumstances. Officials do not consider that this test is sufficiently clear for an RLWT agent to apply at the point of withholding. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 45 Issue: Limited partnerships Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As a partnership also includes a limited partnership, we recommend that if an entity approach is to be taken to partnerships, a percentage test should be adopted in the same way as it is for companies. 15 Comment Officials agree that the percentage test should apply to limited partners in the partnership in the same way as it is for shareholdings in companies. The requirements that apply to directors of companies should similarly apply to general partners of limited partnerships. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 45 Issue: Partnerships Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) It is not appropriate that the test is based on whether one partner is an offshore person. It should be a control or majority partnership share test. Otherwise a partner with a 1 percent share could make a partnership an “offshore person”. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A partnership should be an “offshore person” if it does not have at least one New Zealand partner. (KPMG) It should be clarified whether a non-natural person such as a partnership that is constituted outside New Zealand and is registered as carrying on business in New Zealand will be an “offshore person” and if so, it is unclear why it should be so regarded given its New Zealand business presence. (New Zealand Law Society) It should be clarified whether a tax transparent partnership will be treated as entity to which the RLWT rules apply if at least one partner is an offshore person, or whether the RLWT rules will only apply to the offshore partner(s). If an entity approach is taken, it is unclear why one offshore “member” should be sufficient to render the partnership an “offshore person”, whereas a 25 percent holding of shareholder decision-making rights are required for a company. (Ne w Zealand Law Society) Comment In relation to partnerships, officials were concerned that income could be streamed to an offshore partner. The definition of “offshore person” for non-individuals as introduced was intended to make the rules clearer for RLWT agents, while still maintaining integrity. The independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee has suggested that the test be amended so that a partnership will be an offshore person only if more than 25 percent of the partners are themselves offshore persons. Further, to address officials’ concerns in relation to the misuse of partnerships, she recommended that a partnership should also be an “offshore person” if more than 25 percent of the voting interest, or income interest, is allocated to the offshore partner(s). 16 Officials note that this would result in more situations when RLWT would not apply, even though the entity would likely have a liability under the bright-line test if they have disposed of residential land within two years of acquisition (or under another land taxing provision depending on the circumstances). We consider the rule as originally proposed would have a greater level of robustness and simplicity. However, we agree that a 25 percent threshold for both the number of partners and interests in partnerships would provide an acceptable level of simplicity and integrity. In the case of a company, a New Zealand director would be required to certify the shareholding percentage (or the general partner, in the case of a limited partnership). However, in the case of a standard partnership, there will be no equivalent to a director. Officials consider that in this situation, one of the New Zealand partners would be required to make the certification. Officials note that it would be consistent for the same approach (a 25 percent threshold, a restriction on streaming interests in the property and certification by a New Zealand co-owner) to apply in the case of co-owners of a property. The independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee has raised concerns in relation to the RLWT implications of changes in partners in the partnership as this will normally be a taxable event for the outgoing and incoming partners. Officials note that this may be an issue for existing withholding taxes, but accept that these issues may arise more frequently as a result of the introduction of RLWT. Officials agree that Inland Revenue should develop guidance on this matter. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 45 Issue: Trusts – definition of “settlor” Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of “settlor” in the Income Tax Act 2007 is so wide so these criteria are far- reaching. A settlement on trust from an overseas relative would result in the trust becoming an “offshore person”. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Determining the status of “settlor” could be difficult – they may be impossible to track down. (Auckland District Law Society) Comment Following discussion with the independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, officials agree that the reference to settlors should be replaced by a person who has the power to appoint trustees or amend the trust deed. 17 This would mean that a person who has no effective control over the trust would not affect its offshore status. Officials note that Inland Revenue should monitor this situation to ensure that there is no abuse. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 45 Issue: Trusts – trustees and settlors Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) A trust should only be an “offshore person” only if the control of the trust is exercised offshore or alternatively, if the trust does not have either at least one settlor or at least one trustee who is not “offshore person”. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A trust should be an “offshore person” if it does not have at least one New Zealand trustee. If this submission is not accepted, an established trust should only be an offshore person if the majority are offshore persons. (KPMG) It is not explained why merely having a co-trustee or settlor that is an offshore person should be sufficient to bring the trust within the RLWT net. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee has suggested that the test be amended so that a trust will be an “offshore person” only if more than 25 percent of the trustees or persons with the power to appoint trustees or to amend the trust deed are offshore persons themselves. This is consistent with the Overseas Investment Act 2005. Officials note that this would result in more situations when RLWT would not apply, even though the entity would likely have a liability under the bright-line test if they have disposed of residential land within two years of acquisition (or under another land taxing provision depending on the circumstances). However, we agree that this proposal would provide an acceptable level of simplicity and integrit y. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 18 Clause 45 Issue: Trusts – beneficiaries Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society) Discretionary beneficiaries have no entitlement to trust monies and so their tax status should be irrelevant. Regarding the six year rule – do they have to have been offshore at the time the distribution was made? What if they were onshore when the money was paid out? Will lawyers have to look at six years of trust accounts? (Auckland District Law Society) In relation to a beneficiary who receives a distribution within six years: this test is not appropriate and should be removed. If not, timeframe should be reduced and/or the scope of distributions should be considered. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The explanation for treating a trust as an offshore person if a beneficiary who is an offshore person has received a distribution within the last six years is flawed. There are numerous situations when an offshore beneficiary can receive a distribution of funds that are completely unrelated to the sale of land. Such an approach is not necessary to realise the goal of ensuring that the gain on disposal of residential land does not escape tax by being transferred to an offshore beneficiary. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The intention was that trusts that own the family home should not be an offshore trust solely because some of the beneficiaries were offshore (for example, adult children working overseas). On the other hand, officials have concerns with the possible misuse of trusts to evade payment of RLWT. The rule as proposed would mean that an offshore beneficiary who has received any distribution in the last six years would result in the trust being an offshore trust. After discussion with the independent specialist tax advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, officials agree this should be amended to situations when an offshore beneficiary has received $5,000 or more from the trust in any one year during the past four years. However, officials consider this $5,000 per year threshold should be restricted to “natural person” beneficiaries. There should be no minimum threshold in the case of non-natural person beneficiaries, such that a trust would constitute an offshore person if a non-natural person beneficiary has received a distribution from the trust during the past four years. This would mean that a small annual distribution of dividends paid to a beneficiary of a family trust, for example, would not result in the trust becoming an offshore person, but a distribution to an offshore company would. In addition, this distribution rule should apply to all beneficiaries including discretionary beneficiaries. However, as other parts of the definition for trusts refer to both beneficiaries and discretionary beneficiaries, and the current drafting of the distribution rule does not refer to discretionary beneficiaries, the distribution rule could be read as not applying to a discretionary beneficiary. An amendment will need to be made to ensure that discretionary beneficiaries are covered. 19 It would not be necessary to determine whether the offshore beneficiary (discretionary or otherwise) was an offshore person at the time of each distribution. The test would look at whether a beneficiary or discretionary beneficiary who is currently an offshore person has received a distribution from the trust within the past four years. In the case natural persons, the test would look at whether a natural person beneficiary or natural person beneficiary who is currently an offshore person has received $5,000 or more from the trust in any one year during the past four years. This will be clarified in further guidance material. Further, to maintain the integrity of the trust aspect of the “offshore persons” definit io n following the narrowing of the distribution rule, a trust should be an offshore person if a beneficiary (discretionary or otherwise) is an offshore person and the trust has disposed of residential land within the four years immediately before the relevant disposal of residential land for RLWT. To summarise, if officials’ recommendations regarding the definition of “offshore persons” in this issue, Issue: Trusts – trustees and settlors, and Issue: Trusts – definition of “settlor” are accepted, a trust would be an offshore person if any of the following criteria apply: • More than 25 percent of the trustees or persons with the power to appoint trustees or amend the trust deed are offshore persons themselves; • All natural person beneficiaries and all natural person discretionary beneficiaries of the trust are offshore persons; • All beneficiaries and all discretionary beneficiaries of the trust are offshore persons; • A beneficiary or discretionary beneficiary that is not a natural person and is an offshore person has received a distribution from the trust within the last four years of a relevant disposal o f resident ial land; • A natural person beneficiary or natural person discretionary beneficiary that is an offshore person has received from the trust distributions of $5,000 or more in any one year of the past four years prior to the relevant disposal of residential land; • A beneficiary or discretionary beneficiary of the trust is an offshore person and the trust has disposed of residential land Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 45 Issue: Trusts – foreign trusts and trusts with a New Zealand resident trustee Submission (New Zealand Law Society) If the vendor is a foreign trust with a qualifying resident foreign trustee, the RLWT measures should not apply, given the trustee’s obligation to satisfy the income tax liability of the trust. If 20 the trust is not a foreign trust and has a New Zealand-resident trustee, the RLWT should not apply. That would reduce compliance costs where a trust was concerned. Comment As noted above, officials have concerns with the possible misuse of trusts to evade payment of RLWT. Officials note that some of the recommendations outlined above in relation to the criteria for trusts will reduce the scope of the trust criteria. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 45 Issue: Corporate trusts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Corporate trustees should not have to meet both trust and company criteria. Comment Officials consider that as corporate trustees are companies, and also trustees of a trust, both criteria should apply. Officials note that some of the issues raised above will reduce the scope of both the company and the trust criteria. Recommendation That the submission be declined. No clause Issue: Australian citizens Submission (EY) Australian citizens may be regarded as holding residence-class visas granted under the Immigration Act 2009 while they are physically in New Zealand. In their individual capacities they may therefore fall out of the “offshore person” definition if they are physically present in New Zealand on any critical date. Presumably their presence or absence could change the offshore status of any company. The proposed definition could be unworkable for some vendors. If there is no legislative clarification, the Commissioner should provide comprehensive clarification as to the treatment of Australian citizens as offshore persons or 21 otherwise both in their individual capacity and also the implications for any other body or entity that they are connected to. Comment An Australian citizen is generally automatically provided with a resident visa (one of two types of residence-class visas – the other type being the permanent resident visa) upon arrival in New Zealand. Officials understand this resident visa generally expires when the person leaves New Zealand and another one will be issued if they return. Where an Australian citizen is committed to a life in New Zealand, they may apply for permanent residency or New Zealand citizenship. In this case, they will be required to show that they have held a resident visa continuously for two years and meet certain physical presence tests. As an Australian citizen’s New Zealand resident visa normally expires upon departure from New Zealand, officials understand it is possible to endorse the visa with travel conditions to prevent it from expiring upon departure. An Australian citizen holding a resident visa endorsed with travel conditions, a permanent resident visa, or New Zealand citizenship will be able to meet the standard offshore person test looking back at the previous 12 months or three years depending on the circumstances. However, other Australian citizens (those whose resident visas expire upon departure) will need to be physically present in New Zealand on the day of the residential land purchase amount to satisfy the requirement. Officials do not consider any legislative clarification is required, but agree that further guidance on the issue would be appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clauses 44 and 45 Issue: Different term should be used for “offshore person” Submission (Chapman Tripp) Different definitions of “offshore person” are necessary for the tax statement and RLWT, but it should be renamed – for example, “overseas vendor”. Comment Officials acknowledge the submitter understands that the definition of “offshore person” for the purposes of the tax statement is not appropriate in the context of RLWT. The reason for the different definitions is that when the definition of “offshore person” was first created for the purposes of land information requirements it was not envisaged that it would also be used in the context of a withholding tax. 22 Officials agree that use of the same term could create confusion and if the definition is different to that used for land information purposes, a different term should be used. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the matter referred to drafters. Clause 45 Issue: Non-individuals – use of the terms “member” and “executive” Submissions (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society) “Member” and “executive” should be defined. They are not technical terms and it is not appropriate to use non-technical terms in this context. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The use of the term “executive” is unusual in the New Zealand context and it is not clear what persons are intended to be captured by the term. The term “authorised person” should be used instead. (Chapman Tripp) It should be clarified whether the concept of a “member” applies in the context of a company and if it includes a shareholder. It is assumed, but should be clarified, that “member” does not include a shareholder, executive or director, given clause (c)(v) and (vi) of the proposed definit ion. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The term “member” was intended to capture partners in a partnership and other similar arrangements. It is not intended to capture a shareholder, executive or director of a company. Officials agree that the legislation should be amended to clarify this. The term “executives” was intended to capture persons who held a similar role to directors. This should be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 23 Clause 45 Issue: Offshore persons – individuals Submission (Ne w Zealand Law Society) The end date which sets the antecedent three-year and 12-month periods for individuals needs to be specified. It is not clear whether it is the three-year or 12-month period immediately preceding the entry into the contract to sell, the receipt of the first payment relating to the disposal or the receipt of a resident ial land purchase amount. Comment Officials consider that because the RLWT obligation will be triggered when there is a residential land purchase amount, it will need to be determined at the time of payment of the residential land purchase amount whether or not the vendor is an offshore person. This means that the three-year (for New Zealand citizens) or 12-month (for holders of residence-class visas) period immediately preceding the payment of the residential land purchase amount will be the relevant period. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 24 WHEN RLWT APPLIES No clause Issue: Exemptions Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chapman Tripp, EY) Developers will suffer serious cashflow consequences which may discourage offshore developers from going to market if there is no exemption from RLWT. A bank bond system could be used to secure payment of RLWT at a later date and registered on the titles of unso ld properties. (Auckland District Law Society) We acknowledge that the RLWT needs to be easy for the conveyancing agent to calculate. Over-withholding will lead to increased compliance costs as taxpayers will frequently want to prepare and file interim returns to apply for refunds. This will also include Inland Revenue’s administrative costs in processing the interim returns. RLWT may act as a disincentive to foreign-owned developers and investors who might otherwise undertake residential property development in New Zealand. This may be an unwanted outcome at a time when residential development, particularly in Auckland, is desperately needed. Vendors should be able to apply for a certificate of exemption on an enduring basis similar to the certificate of exemption rules for resident withholding tax (RWT), and potentially automatically where the vendor already holds a certificate of exemption for RWT (that is, where the taxpayer does not present a risk of non-collection). Or it could be on a one-off basis when they post a low risk of non-collection and RLWT would result in gross over-withholding. This would be consistent with international norms (for example, the United States.) (Chapman Tripp) New Zealand tax residents Taxpayers should be able to apply for an exemption, nil or reduced rate certificates on an annual or indefinite basis. It would provide appropriate flexibility for the Commissioner to deal with unusual situations which have not been foreseen or anticipated. (EY) Comment The interim claim process was designed in lieu of a certificate of exemption facility to mitigate the cashflow issues for people whose tax liability is likely to be lower than the amount of RLWT withheld. Having in place either a certificate of exemption process or an interim claim process would provide similar benefits in terms of revenue integrity as Inland Revenue has the ability to review the situation when a taxpayer has claimed that they have a reduced or no tax liability (before the transaction, in the case of the certificate of exemption, or after the transaction, in the case of the interim claim process). The compliance and administrative costs and benefits of each approach are mixed and there are costs associated with both. An important part of the policy design was that where possible the RLWT rules should avoid delaying the sale of property. Given that the certificate of exemption would need to be issued prior to the sale of a property and that this would involve assessment by Inland Revenue of whether the person satisfies the 25 criteria for the certification of exemption, there may be potential for some sales to be delayed if the vendor needs to wait for the certificate of exemption to be issued. It was for this reason that an interim claim system was considered, overall, to be more appropriate. However, officials recognise that increasing housing supply is an important issue and the imposition RLWT should not further inhibit housing development, but RLWT in its current form could create major cashflow concerns for developers. Officials agree that a certificate of exemption process would alleviate some of the concerns raised by submitters, but consider that it should be limited to taxpayers who are in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings, and have a good tax compliance history in New Zealand. In this case a certificate of exemption could be provided on an enduring basis. The criteria for whether a taxpayer is in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting a building would be based on the existing principles in the land tax rules. Officials consider that a certificate of exemption should only be provided in bona fide cases where the taxpayer is increasing housing supply, not simply renovating and/or speculating. As the certificate of exemption could be provided on an enduring basis (for example, one year), there would be additional compliance and administrative benefits, in addition to alleviating significant cashflow concerns. This is because Inland Revenue would only need to consider one exemption certificate application for a particular taxpayer in lieu of processing potentially dozens of interim claims. We note that a certificate of exemption system would also be expected to reduce the volumes of interim claims overall. In addition, there is an existing provision in place in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that allows taxpayers to provide security to the Commissioner to secure the performance of a tax obligation, subject to other certain requirements. Where a taxpayer would not be able to qualify for a certificate of exemption from RLWT because they do not yet have a good New Zealand tax compliance history (for example, if they have only recently entered the market), officials consider that this provision could be used to allow the vendor to supply a bank bond similar to the Auckland District Law Society submission. Officials are investigating whether it would be administratively possible for developers (and those in the business of subdividing land into lots or erecting buildings) with a good tax compliance history who already hold a certificate of exemption for other tax purposes (for example, a RWT exemption certificate), to use that exemption certificate for RLWT. Officials consider that in the rare situation where a vendor is eligible for the main home exception under the bright-line test, they should be able to apply for an RLWT exemption certificate. As a certificate of exemption in this case would generally only be issued on a transaction basis, the same compliance and administrative benefits as in the case of developers are unlikely to arise. However, the effect on cashflow could be amplified as it is expected that in most of these cases, proceeds from the sale of a main home would be used to purchase a new main home. This exemption certificate approach is consistent with the existing legislative rules for certificates of exemption that can be issued to non-resident contractors. Like other certificates of exemption, the Commissioner would have the ability to cancel an RLWT exemption certificate. The proposed interim claim process would still be available for taxpayers who do not meet the requirements for or have not been issued with an RLWT exemption certificate. 26 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 44 Issue: RLWT should not apply if the disposal is taxable under other provisions Submission (EY) RLWT should be restricted to offshore persons whose land disposal is taxable only under bright- line rules. It should not apply to New Zealand tax residents who are offshore persons if the relevant land disposal would also be taxable under other Income Tax Act 2007 provisions. (EY) Comment The bright-line test was introduced as an objective test to buttress other land taxing provisions. It is possible that a vendor who sells their residential land within two years of acquisition may be taxable under the intention test, for example. In this case, the vendor will have an income tax liability. In such a case, RLWT should still apply – an offshore person should not be able to avoid the RLWT simply because another taxing provision applies to the transaction. This is because difficulties arise in collecting tax from foreign investors, regardless of which provision applies to impose the tax liability. This intent was articulated in the bill Commentary and the earlier officials’ issues paper, Residential land withholding tax, but the drafting in the bill currently does not achieve this intent due to how the bright-line legislation is worded. An amendment is required to ensure that the proposed RLWT applies when the offshore vendor is disposing the residential land within the two-year bright-line period, regardless of whether another taxing provision also applies. This will ensure that the RLWT cannot be easily circumvented by the vendor telling the RLWT that they are taxable under a different provision when they have no intent of fulfilling their tax obligations. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments, and the matter be referred to drafters. 27 No clause Issue: Guidance on the meaning of “residential land” Submission (Chapman Tripp) There should be guidance on mixed-use assets – for example, lifestyle blocks in rural areas. Otherwise conveyancers and lawyers will need to make a factual determination and if mistaken, they would be liable for penalties. Comment The meaning of “residential land” follows the definition used in the bright-line test. Further discussion of the meaning of “residential land” in this context can be found in the special report available on the Inland Revenue tax policy website and in the February 2016 issue of the Tax Information Bulletin. Inland Revenue will provide additional guidance material to conveyancers and lawyers involved in the RLWT process. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. No clause Issue: Property relationship agreements Submission (EY) There should be a specific exclusion for transfers in relation to property relationship agreements. Section CB 6A(5) specifically excludes relevant disposals by a deceased person’s personal representative or beneficiaries described in section FC 1(1)(b), but section CB 6A does not contain any similar exclusions for property relationship agreements as there is no income, because new section FB 3A treats such transfers as disposals and acquisitions at cost. This could feed into the calculation of RLWT resulting in nil RLWT to be withheld, but this is indirect and there should be a specific legislative provision. Comment Officials do not consider a specific provision relating to property relationship agreements is necessary for the purposes of RLWT as it may raise questions about the application of the income tax provisions regarding property relationship agreements in other areas. However, officials consider further guidance in this area would be useful for conveyancers and lawyers required to administer RLWT. 28 Recommendation That the submission be declined. No clause Issue: Main home exception Submission (KPMG) The main home exception should be included. It is possible for someone who works in New Zealand and who is not a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident to have bought resident ial property, lived in it as a main home and therefore not be subject to tax under the bright-line test when they dispose of it. Comment Officials consider that the criteria that must be met for RLWT to apply must be kept as objective as possible, and easily verifiable for conveyancers and lawyers. For this reason, officials do not consider a main home exception to be appropriate in the context of RLWT as it would be easy to circumvent RLWT by claiming the main home exception when it may not actually be available. However, people eligible for the main home exception will be able to lodge an interim claim once the RLWT has been paid to Inland Revenue and receive a refund. As noted in Issue: Exemptions, officials consider a better approach to be a certificate of exemption system for vendors who are offshore persons and eligible for the main home exception. This would mean that the RLWT agent would not be required to assess whether the main home exception applies and instead the vendor would make an application to Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption from RLWT. The vendor would then provide this certificate of exemption to the RLWT agent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 No clause Issue: Precise tests in legislation Submission (Auckland District Law Society) The legislation should include precise tests to determine whether or not RLWT is applicable, because offshore vendors will try to convince their lawyer that the tax does not apply. The legislation must set out the mechanics of the process to minimise any discretion. Comment Officials agree that the tests should be made as objective as possible to minimise the potential for pushback from vendors and to reduce compliance costs. Where appropriate, the legislation should prescribe what tests must be satisfied, and in some circumstances, how these tests should be satisfied. However, it is not always appropriate to provide the desired level of detail in legislation. In many circumstances (not necessarily specific to RLWT), the legislation refers to information prescribed by the Commissioner or in a form prescribed by the Commissioner. Regardless, guidance will be published on what information is acceptable and what must be provided to satisfy a particular requirement. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No clause Issue: Avoidance techniques Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) The legislation does not deal with techniques that will be used to avoid RLWT – for example, option fees, parallel agreement, and separate chattels agreements with inflated value. The legislation needs to specifically address these techniques if it is to retain its integrity. (Auckland District Law Society) The bill should address chattels and option fees. (New Zealand Law Society) 30 Comment Officials consider that the new rules should be monitored to ensure that RLWT obligations are not evaded or avoided. Data from the new information requirements contained in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 is likely to assist in this area. Officials note that under current legislation, option fees are included in the definition of “an interest in land” and would be captured by the proposed RLWT. Further guidance will be provided on this. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Clause 44 Issue: Meaning of “purchase price” Submissions (Chapman Tripp, EY) Clarification is required where there is a transfer of trust property between trustees and where the purchase price is not cash-settled. In the case of associated persons, there will just be a transfer – possibly below market value or nil value. (Chapman Tripp) RLWT should be limited to amounts paid or payable in money and should not include non-cash consideration. RLWT should not apply when the Income Tax Act 2007 deems an amount of consideration to be paid but a lesser or no amount is actually paid pursuant to the relevant transfer agreement. At the least, there should be (statutory) clarification on how the RLWT rules apply in relation to all other income tax rules that treat property as disposed of for a certain amount of consideration. (EY) Comment The RLWT rules apply to money or money’s worth. Further, the obligation to report to the Commissioner amounts that should be subject to RLWT would still apply to RLWT agents, even if RLWT agents are unable to withhold due to no cash being exchanged. When an RLWT agent has been unable to pay RLWT because the purchase price has not been settled in money and has reported the incident to Inland Revenue, officials consider that the RLWT agent should not be penalised. Further guidance on the issue will be provided by Inland Revenue to RLWT agents. Inland Revenue considers this area should be monitored, particularly for situations when the transaction may involve a transfer of personal property or other non-land assets. Data from the new information requirements contained in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 is likely to assist in this area. 31 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. No clause Issue: Clarification of “disposal of land” Submission (Chapman Tripp) The definition of “disposal” should be clarified in situations when there is no Agreement for Sale and Purchase or registration of tit le – for example, company share arrangements and unregistered perpetual leases. Comment Officials note that these issues are not unique to RLWT and are relevant in the context of land disposals more generally, but agree that Inland Revenue should provide guidance and examples in relation to such matters. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No clause Issue: Liquidation and receivership Submission (Chapman Tripp) Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 provides priority of payments to creditors when the taxpayer is in liquidation and section 30 of the Receiverships Act 1993 applies, the taxpayer is in receivership. RLWT should not apply where the vendor is in liquidation or receivership. Comment Officials agree that RLWT should be treated the same as other withholding taxes on inco me (such as RWT and NWRT) in situations of liquidation or receivership. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 32 Clauses 44 and 45 Issue: Part-payments aggregating more than 50 percent of total purchase price Submission (EY) Clarification is required for the intended treatment in situations where the aggregate of deposits and part-payments is at least 50 percent of the purchase price – it is implicit in the bill, but there is no further explanation. Statutory clarification is required. Comment The intent for RLWT is that there should only be one RLWT liability per land disposal and this should arise when the 50 percent threshold is first exceeded. However, there may be situations when there are a number of part-payments beyond the 50 percent threshold and none of these part payments individually would be sufficient to satisfy the RLWT liability for the entire transaction. In this case, the RLWT agent should retain or withhold RLWT from each part-payment beyond the 50 percent threshold to the extent that they are able to until the RLWT liability has been fulfilled. Amendments to the legislation are required to ensure appropriate due dates and credits are provided in this situation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the matter be referred to drafters. 33 PERSON REQUIRED TO PAY RLWT Clause 44 Issue: Associated persons – scope Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) The proposed associated persons provision is too wide. There should be clarification as to which associated persons definition should apply. (EY) Currently the definition of “associated persons” in section YB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not provide for section CB 6A to be included in the definition of the “land provisions” as defined in section YA 1. The definition of “associated persons” for the purpose of RLWT is presumably also not to be limited to the same extent as it is for the land provisions, but this should be clarified. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The land provisions use a narrower version of the “associated persons” definition to prevent association in unnecessary situations. For example, two siblings fall within the broader definition of associated persons, but one sibling should not be considered to be in the business of developing land or erecting buildings, just because the other person sibling is, and so a restricted definition applies for the land provisions. However, in the context of RLWT, this restriction is not appropriate and the broader definition of associated persons should apply. In the proposed RLWT rules, RLWT will, in most circumstances, not be a true withholding tax in that the payer will not be held liable for the underlying amount of RLWT. This is because it would not be appropriate to hold a conveyancer or solicitor liable for RLWT if they did not withhold it since they are just an intermediary in the process. When the purchaser and vendor are associated persons, RLWT will be regarded as a true withholding tax, but it will be the purchaser who is liable for the underlying RLWT, as there may be an increased risk of mischief. As with other withholding taxes, the purchaser may use the services of an agent (for example, a conveyancer or solicitor in this case) to fulfil their withholding obligations. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 34 Clause 44 Issue: Associated persons – separate bank account Submission (EY, PwC) Requiring a separate bank account for RLWT when the purchaser and vendor are associated persons may require the purchaser to use a conveyancer. (PwC) The requirement to hold RLWT in a separate bank account for the benefit of the Commissioner is excessive, impractical and unnecessarily costly for purchasers. (EY) Comment Officials agree that this requirement is unnecessary and would not add any extra protection for the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 44 Issue: Associated persons – amounts treated as received Submission (New Zealand Law Society) When the purchaser and vendor are associated persons and the purchaser is required to withhold, proposed section RL 3 should be amended to ensure that the amount of RLWT payable is treated as being received and derived by the vendor, similar to what is provided for in proposed section RL 2(7). Comment In most cases, RLWT as proposed in this bill is not a true withholding tax in that the RLWT paying agent will not generally be held liable for the RLWT. When the purchaser and vendor are associated persons and the purchaser is required to withho ld RLWT, standard withholding tax rules apply. Section RA 9, which applies to withholding taxes, will also apply when the purchaser and vendor are associated persons. It provides that an amount of tax withheld (RLWT in this case) from a payment is treated as received by the payee (vendor). However, section RA 9 does not automatically apply when the purchaser and vendor are not associated persons, because RLWT is not a true withholding tax in that case. Proposed section 35 RL 2(7) is therefore required in that circumstance, to ensure that the amount of RLWT payable is still treated as being received by the vendor. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 44 Issue: Associated persons – trigger date Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It is not clear at what point in time the test for associated persons is to be applied. As the obligation to withhold RLWT is triggered when a residential land purchase amount is paid, it should be that date that the test of association is applied, rather than the date the Agreement for Sale and Purchase is entered into. It is often the case that between the date of the agreement and settlement, the purchaser will nominate another person or entity to complete settlement and take tit le to the land. Comment Officials agree that the appropriate time for the associated persons test to be triggered is the date on which a residential land purchase amount is made and the RLWT is to be retained from that payment. This is already provided for in the legislation as the RLWT rules apply to a residential land purchase amount paid in relation to a disposal, rather than the disposal itself. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 44 Issue: Seller’s conveyancer or solicitor to be paying agent Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) We welcome the decision to provide as the default position that the vendor’s conveyancing agent will be the RLWT paying agent. Imposing the obligation on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent would increase compliance costs and create additional risk of non- compliance. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) If the RLWT proceeds, we support the deduction obligation arising principally on the vendor’s conveyancing agent. (KPMG) 36 Comment The officials’ issues paper Residential land withholding tax invited submitters to comment on whether they would prefer the purchaser’s conveyancing agent or vendor’s conveyancing agent to be the paying agent for the purposes of RLWT. The majority of submitters expressed the preference that the vendor’s conveyancing agent should be the paying agent, with compliance costs and availability of information being major factors. Officials note that this is not the norm for withholding taxes, both in terms of New Zealand’s other withholding taxes and property-related withholding taxes overseas. Normally the payer (that is, the purchaser) or their agent will be the withholding agent as they are seen as having the least incentive not to comply. Requiring the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor to retain/withhold RLWT is a departure from this norm and it is important that necessary safeguards are put in place to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is not undermined. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No clause Issue: Transfers between trustees Submission (Chapman Tripp) The bill should clarify that transfers between trustees should not be caught. Comment In general, a transfer between trustees of the same trust would not be considered a disposal of residential land and therefore would not be subject to RLWT. Officials consider that this does not require legislation clarification, but will provide further guidance on the issue to RLWT agents. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 37 CALCULATING RLWT Clause 44 Issue: GST component of purchase price and acquisition price Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, PwC) The “current purchase price” and “vendor’s acquisition cost” used to calculate RLWT should be net of any GST, if any. Comment The draft legislation is currently silent on whether the prices used to calculate RLWT are inclusive or exclusive of GST, when GST has been charged. As the RLWT is designed to be a collection mechanism on account of a person’s income tax liability, officials consider it appropriate that the prices used to calculate RLWT should be net of GST since that is how their final income tax liability will be calculated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 44 Issue: Priority – support Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) We welcome the third calculation method for New Zealand bank and non-bank deposit taker mortgages, otherwise there is potential for RLWT to delay or derail settlements. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the ability to offset the amount payable under a mortgage. (KPMG) Recommendation That the submission be noted. 38 Clause 44 Issue: Priority/deduction for other payments Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) There should be further amendment to allow for priority for real estate agents and lawyers to be paid from sales proceeds ahead of the RLWT if the new regime is to work. (Auckland District Law Society) Certain direct expenditure should be able to be deducted – for example, real estate agents’ costs, legal fees and registration costs incurred in relation to the sale should be included in calculating the vendor’s gain. The vendor’s conveyancing agent will know all of this because they will have to pay these costs before settlement. If the legislation specifies they are deductible, there should not be additional compliance costs. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The position of overseas mortgages is significantly impacted. The legislation should be crafted to limit instances where this occurs. (Chapman Tripp) The ability to offset the amount payable under a mortgage only captures mortgage relationships with New Zealand banks and should be redefined to include banks registered under the equivalent of the Reserve Bank Act of another jurisdiction. (KPMG) The inability to include post-acquisition costs in the RLWT calculation should be reconsidered. RLWT is likely to over-tax, resulting in refunds. (KPMG) The concept of a “licensed security holder” should be extended to include a person who is not an offshore person or an associate of the vendor, so as to avoid the costs involved of the current vendor possibly needing to obtain a short-term loan from a registered bank or non-bank deposit taker. (New Zealand Law Society) The availability of the third calculation method should not be limited to instances when the paying agent is the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor or when the mortgagee is a New Zealand financial inst itution. (PwC) Comment In most situations, the withho lding agent for a withholding tax is the payer of an amount and the order of priority is naturally determined as the withholding tax must be paid by the payer before the recipient obtains control over the funds. The proposed RLWT is unusual in that the obligation to pay RLWT is not on the purchaser (the payer in this case), but the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor who is acting on behalf of the vendor. To protect the integrity of the tax system and ensure that the RLWT cannot be easily circumvented, it is important that RLWT is paid before other payments are made out of the purchase amount. 39 The provision of priority for mortgages held with a New Zealand registered bank or a New Zealand non-bank deposit taker licensed under the Non-Bank Deposit Takers Act 2013 was inserted in response to consultation on the original issues paper and concerns that the payment of RLWT could prevent settlement from occurring in some cases. Officials do not consider it appropriate to extend the provision to other mortgages secured by overseas mortgagees or non- associates of the vendor as it would create an increased risk of vendors gearing up prior to the sale just to avoid the payment of RLWT. A similar risk arises in allowing other disbursements to be paid before RLWT – it would be relatively simple for offshore sellers to avoid the payment of RLWT and evade their New Zealand tax liability. By limiting the provision to mortgages held with New Zealand registered banks and non-bank deposit takers, the Government would be able to more readily identify and react to any abuse as it is more able to monitor the regulatory environment in which the bank or non-bank deposit taker is operating. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clause 44 Issue: Priority of local government rates Submission (Chapman Tripp) Under the Local Government Act 2002, unpaid rates amount to a charge on the land which has priority ahead of any mortgage. We recommend for consistency that the obligation to satisfy all rates charges against the property is also ranked ahead of the collection of RLWT. Comment As noted in the discussion on Issue: Priority/deduction for other payments, there is a general concern about allowing other payments to be made before RLWT is paid. This is because RLWT can be easily avoided by increasing the payments to be made before RLWT. However, officials are satisfied that this potential for gaming does not apply in relation to the seller’s proportion of outstanding local authority rates. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 40 Clause 44 Issue: Default method where information unavailable Submission (KPMG) There should be a default rule for the case when the paying agent does not have the information required to determine the lowest of the three formulae. In this case, RLWT should be deducted at 10% of the current purchase price. The formula in section RL 4(4) should not be available if the vendor has not complied with requests for information from their conveyancing agent. Comment The 10% x current purchase price formula for calculating RLWT is the simplest of the three formulae. The other two formulae rely on information about the vendor’s acquisition cost or the value of a New Zealand bank or non-bank deposit taker mortgage. Officials intended that if information about the vendor’s acquisition cost or New Zealand mortgage is unavailable, the default rate would be 10% x current purchase price. This is because the values for the unavailable information will be zero, and calculation would simply become the lowest of 10% x current purchase price, 33% (or 28%) x current purchase price (for the vendor’s gain approach, where no acquisition cost is available), and the current purchase price (if no value for a New Zealand mortgage is available). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 72 Issue: Verification requirement for vendor’s acquisition cost Submission (KPMG) The legislation is silent on how a conveyancer is required to verify that the vendor’s acquisition price is correct. Unless the conveyancer knows the information to be false, the conveyancer should be able to rely on the acquisition price as notified by the vendor and should not have to independently verify the information to ensure that the RLWT amount is correct. If an artificially inflated price is provided by the vendor they should be subject to knowledge offence penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Information about the vendor’s acquisition cost is available from Quotable Value, a state owned enterprise. The RLWT agent should be able to rely on information obtained from Quotable 41 Value, unless the vendor is able to provide sufficient evidence of a different acquisition price. This could include providing the RLWT agent with the original acquisition contract. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 44 Issue: Calculation method when there is no conveyancer or lawyer Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) When neither party has a conveyancer or lawyer, only the 10% rate should be available to avoid additional compliance costs and the risk of error. Comment Officials do not consider it appropriate to restrict the availability of the vendor’s gain method in this situation. While it may be preferable to restrict the availability of certain methods (for example, the New Zealand mortgage calculation) to prevent abuse or gaming, officials do not consider that there is such a risk here. Recommendation That the submission be declined. No clause Issue: RLWT will be more than tax owed Submission (Auckland District Law Society) The actual RLWT in every situation will be more than the actual tax owed, if any. This is because the RLWT calculation does not allow for cost of acquisition, costs of disposal, any improvements or any existing losses. Or, in the case of a resident co-owner, they may not be liable for the tax at all. There is no reason why the tax could not be allocated on a percentage of ownership basis. This would save all the extra costs of recovering the refund, not to mention the opportunity cost of the use of the money. Comment We understand that the submitter has two concerns. First, that there is too much tax withheld because it does not allow for the deduction of costs related to the acquisition, costs of disposal etc, which necessitates refunds. 42 Officials note that the calculation of the RLWT is intended to be as simple as possible in order to reduce compliance costs while retaining integrity. Allocating tax on a percentage of ownership basis would require RLWT agents to undertake a more complicated calculation and would require the RLWT agent to collect more detailed information. The interim claim process was intended to mitigate some of the effects of over-withholding. Second, the submitter is concerned that there is too much tax withheld in the case of a resident co-owner who may not be liable for the tax at all. Officials note that if the property is not the main home of the resident co-owner, the resident co-owner will generally have a tax liability of their own. Where there is a main home, the person will not be liable for tax, and again the interim claim process is intended to mitigate this situation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Clauses 44, 45 and 72 Issue: Consistency with the Privacy Act 1993 Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The proposed RLWT changes do not raise any concerns from a privacy perspective and the Privacy Act 1993 will continue to apply to any information collected by RLWT agents. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 72 Issue: Information requirements – retention when the paying agent is not a professional conveyancer Submission (PwC) When the paying agent is not a professional conveyancer (that is, the purchaser), they will not be aware of their obligations. It may be more appropriate to have all relevant information provided to the Commissioner in this circumstance when the RLWT is paid, removing the record keeping requirement from the paying agent (that is, the purchaser). Comment Officials agree that when the paying agent is not a professional conveyancer or solicitor and is just the purchaser themselves, it may be more appropriate for the paying agent to provide the information provided to them by the vendor under proposed section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to the Commissioner at the time they return the RLWT payment. In this case the paying agent should not be required to retain the information for seven years under section 54C(5). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 44 Clause 72 Issue: Information requirements – retention for seven years Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The requirement to retain records for seven years is excessive and imposes an undue burden on conveyancing agents and on purchasers required to deduct RLWT. This should be reduced to four years since IRD has access to information about land sales in real time and devotes specific resource to auditing of property transactions. Comment The seven-year retention requirement is a standard feature of record-keeping requirements and officials do not consider it to appropriate to impose a different requirement here. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 72 Issue: Provision of information by seller Submission (Chapman Tripp) The compliance costs for sellers could be passed onto the buyer. The conveyancing agent has to undertake a number of tasks, or risk penalties. The vendor’s conveyancing agent will have to investigate certain information in all cases, not merely those where the RLWT actually applies, and further investigations where it looks like RLWT will apply. A simpler solution would be to put the onus on the seller to provide the relevant information, provided that the vendor’s conveyancing agent is entitled to rely on that information. Comment Officials consider that the onus should be on the withholding agent (usually the conveyancing agent), as they will be able to apply the tests in an objective manner. Otherwise, there is a risk to the integrity of the rules. However, for certain questions, the conveyancing agent should be able to reasonably rely on information provided by the vendor. This includes the requirement that a New Zealand director (or in the case of a limited partnership, the general partner, or the equivalent of a director in other cases) provides a statement about shareholding by offshore persons. As this would be information provided in relation to a tax law, the New Zealand director or general partner 45 providing the statement would be subject to criminal penalties if they knowingly provide false information. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Clause 72 Issue: Information requirements – certification of information Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) For compliance cost reasons, the information requirements should be simplified or reduced in scope. Requiring vendors to provide certified copies of documents is excessive. “Certified copy” has a specific meaning and requires a qualified lawyer to sight the original and verify a copy. In most cases the paying agent will be a qualified lawyer and intimately involved in the land sale transaction – it would be simpler and more efficient for the Commissioner to accept a copy of the document taken by the agent at the time the prescribed form is completed. Alternatively, the form could include an acknowledgement by the agent’s lawyer (for example, a tick the box) that they have seen the relevant supporting information. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The requirement for certified copies of relevant documents to be provided and obtained is excessive and should be deleted. (EY) An alternative approach is to apply information requirements only to vendors who are liable for RLWT rather than to all vendors who are subject to the two-year bright-line period. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The bill is silent on how a conveyancer is required to certify information required to be provided by vendors under new section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It is unclear which information will require certified copies of supporting documents to enable the conveyancer to verify. Unless they know the information to be false, the conveyancer should be able to rely on information provided by the vendor. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that the requirement to provide certified copies of documents could be excessive in many circumstances. As noted in Issue: Provision of information by seller, officials consider that while the onus should be on the RLWT agent to determine whether RLWT applies, the conveyancing agent should be able to reasonably rely on information provided by the vendor in relation to certain questions – for example, regarding the shareholding in a company or limited partnership. In the case of a company, there will need to be a New Zealand director who gives a statement as to the proportion of offshore shareholding in the company. In the case of other entities or 46 arrangements, the equivalent of a New Zealand director would provide the statement – for example, the general partner in a limited partnership. It may be difficult to provide evidence of the offshore status of all shareholders in some situations, but a statement by a New Zealand director, for example, would provide integrity as this statement would be information provided in relation to a tax law, which means that the New Zealand director would be subject to criminal penalties, if they knowingly provide false information. However, to be able to provide the statement, the director (or director equivalent in the cases of entities that are not companies), will need to prove to the RLWT agent that they themselves are not an offshore person. They could satisfy this requirement by meeting with the RLWT agent and providing their New Zealand passport, for example. However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this and providing a certified copy may be more appropriate. As such, officials consider that requiring certified documents to be provided isn’t necessary and should be removed fro m legislat ion. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. No clause Issue: Information requirements – duplication of information required Submissions (Auckland District Law Society, KPMG) Vendors have to provide information to their conveyancer, however the bulk of this information is already required as part of the land transfer tax statement. The current land transfer tax statement should be updated to capture any additional information needed for RLWT purposes rather than require the information to be provided by the vendor to their conveyancer. (KPMG) It would be helpful if certifications by vendors under this legislation were included in the tax statement so that there is not further paperwork for information a conveyancing agent is relying upon for certification. (Auckland District Law Society) Comment We understand the submitters are concerned about potential duplication of information provided to Land Information New Zealand and Inland Revenue. Under current law, in the majority of land transactions, buyers and sellers need to provide their IRD number unless it is their main home. This information is provided to Land Information New Zealand upon transfer of property. When the person has a conveyancer, this step is done by the conveyancer. This bill proposes that in situations when there has been a sale of residential land within two years, vendors will be required to provide additional information for RLWT purposes to the 47 RLWT agent who is, in most cases, the vendor’s conveyancer. This information, along with the payment of RLWT, is sent to Inland Revenue. Some of this information (such as IRD numbers) will be useful in completing the land transfer statement. Officials do not think that it would be beneficial to amend the land transfer tax statement to require additional information about RLWT to be sent to Land Information New Zealand rather than sending this information directly to Inland Revenue. It would lead to unnecessary data risks and administrative costs and does not appear to reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clause 72 Issue: Information requirements – should be expressly restricted to land acquired after 1 October 2015 Submission (EY) The information requirements in section 54C should be expressly restricted to situations where a vendor would have come under section CB 6A in relation to land acquired after 1 October 2015 and the RLWT rules may apply. As presently worded in the bill, section 54C would appear to apply to any disposal of residential land within the bright-line period as defined in the bright- line rules, regardless of whether those rules apply. We consider imposing the proposed information, certification and retention requirements in all such cases is excessive and unreasonable. Comment The RLWT applies only in respect of residential land acquired on or after 1 October 2015. Officials agree that the corresponding information requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should also be restricted to residential land acquisitions after 1 October 2015 as the current wording could require information to be provided in relation to residential land acquired before 1 October 2015. However, the proposed section 54C information requirements should also apply where the vendor would have come under the bright-line test, but for the application of another land taxing provision (the bright-line test applies only if another land taxing provision does not). This would align with the proposed scope of RLWT. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 48 Clause 72 Issue: When information must be provided to the conveyancer Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The seller should be required to provide information relating to RLWT to the RLWT agent prior to a residential land purchase amount being made, rather than “before the disposal is completed”, because the point of disposal will be too late for RLWT purposes. Comment The bill, as currently drafted, provides that the seller must provide the required information regarding their IRD number and whether or not they are an offshore person. The bill provides that this information must be provided “before the disposal is completed”, which may not coincide with the payment of a residential land purchase amount. From a practical perspective, the conveyancer would need the information to determine whether RLWT needs to be withheld or retained from a residential land purchase amount before the residential land purchase amount is passed on to the seller. For consistency, the seller should therefore be required to provide the required information to the conveyancer before a residential land purchase amount is made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clauses 44 and 72 Issue: Prescribed list of information required Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Select Committee, in considering the RLWT regime, should be provided with a full list of the information that the Commissioner intends to prescribe so that the Committee can fully understand the extent of the information to be collected and certified in order to gain a full appreciation of the compliance costs that RLWT measures will impose on all residential land transactions. There are difficulties with electronic passports as they will not show that a person is an offshore person and a New Zealand-resident vendor may not have a passport. Comment The information that will need to be provided by vendors to prove that RLWT will not apply will depend on the final design of the proposed RLWT. However, officials are able to provide an indicative list of the information required and how the tests may be satisfied, as fo llows. 49 RLWT will only apply if all three of the following conditions have been met: the land being disposed of is residential land, the land is being disposed of within two years of acquisition, and the vendor is an offshore person. It will not be necessary to check the remaining conditions if the vendor would be outside the scope of RLWT on one of the conditions. The legislation does not stipulate which condition should be checked first. In some cases, it will be easiest to first determine the residential land requirement, in some cases, the two-year disposal requirement, and in other cases, whether the vendor is an offshore person. For example, it may be straightforward if the vendor is a natural person, they are able to sit down with their RLWT agent in New Zealand and they show the agent their New Zealand passport. This would be sufficient to prove that the vendor is not an offshore person and the RLWT agent would not be required to check the remaining conditions. When the vendor is not a natural person (for example, in the case of companies, partnerships, and trusts,) an appropriate person (such as a New Zealand director, partner or trustee) would be required to provide a statement as to the status of the entity or arrangement. In the case of a company, a New Zealand director (that is, a director who is not an offshore person) would need to state that no more than 25 percent of the shareholders are offshore persons. As noted in Issue: Information requirements – certification of information and Issue: Provision of information by seller, the director would still need to prove to the RLWT agent that they are not an offshore person (and are therefore eligible to provide the certification). When a statement is provided by a New Zealand director, the RLWT agent should be able to reasonably rely on the statement. Because the information is provided in relation to a tax law, the New Zealand director would be subject to criminal penalties, if they have knowingly provided false information. As noted in Issue: Verification requirement for vendor’s acquisition cost, the RLWT agent will be able to rely on information obtained from Quotable Value on regarding the vendor’s acquisition cost for the purposes of calculating RLWT. If the vendor does not believe this is the correct acquisition price, they would need to provide the RLWT agent sufficient evidence of a different acquisition price – for example, the original acquisition contract. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 50 WHEN RLWT OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT MET Clause 44 Issue: What penalties will apply Submission (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) It is unclear what penalties will apply if the paying agent gets it wrong. How will conduct be assessed and what standard of inquiry is expected. Offshore vendors will try and avoid paying the tax; this will place extreme pressure on the conveyancer or solicitor to determine whether the tax is applicable. (Auckland District Law Society) It is also critical that the nature of the possible penalties is clarified. The bill Commentary refers only to “general penalties”, instancing late filing penalties. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment In general, the existing penalties under Part 9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply to the paying agent, as they would to other withholding taxes. However, late payment penalties will apply only in the case when the paying agent has retained the RLWT but has not passed it onto the Commissioner. Civil penalties The main civil penalty that may apply will be shortfall penalties. A paying agent may be liable for shortfall penalties if they take a tax position that is inaccurate and satisfies one of the following: • not taking reasonable care; • gross carelessness; • abusive tax position; or • evasion. The penalty increases in proportion to the seriousness of the breach. These penalties apply across different tax types, and official guidance and interpretation is available on how the Commissioner applies each type of shortfall penalty. In addition, there are provisions which determine to what extent taxpayers may be eligible for a reduction in the shortfall penalty. Where a paying agent has retained an amount of RLWT but not passed it onto the Commissioner, they may be subject to late payment penalties. However, late payment penalties will not be applied where the paying agent has not retained the RLWT. This is because they would be unable to rectify their late payment once the settlement funds have left their hands. 51 Late filing penalties are a type of civil penalty and they are important in the context of RLWT because if an RLWT agent’s statement is not received by the due date, it may negatively affect a taxpayer’s ability to use their RLWT credit to offset their income tax liability arising from the disposal of residential land and obtain a refund from Inland Revenue. The possibility of having late filing penalties imposed will encourage agents to provide RLWT statements by the due date. However, an amendment to the drafting is required to ensure that late filing penalties can be applied. The bill as currently drafted provides that Part 9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply to RLWT as a withho lding tax. However, the section relating to late filing penalties only applies in specific circumstances – to tax types when the timely provision of information to the Commissioner is important (for example, employer monthly schedules and annual imputation credit account (ICA) returns) and does not apply to withholding taxes such as RWT and NRWT as that information is not required until 31 May in the following year. In this sense, officials consider the provision of RLWT statements to be more akin to employer monthly schedules and that an amendment should be made so that the late filing penalty that applies to employer monthly schedules will also apply to RLWT. This will allow for the timely matching of RLWT data, thereby reducing the amount of time a taxpayer will need to wait for the interim claim to be processed. Criminal penalties The paying agent may also be liable for criminal penalties. These are applied by a court of law. Criminal penalties include absolute liability offences, such as failing to keep documents required to be kept under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Information about the different types of penalties can be found on the Inland Revenue website. However, further guidance will be provided to RLWT agents to ensure they are aware of the consequences for not fulfilling their obligations as RLWT agent. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, and the matter raised by officials accepted. No clause Issue: Guidance on what constitutes “reasonable care” Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society) The bill should include precise tests so that a lawyer can decide whether the tax is applicable without having to obtain an expert tax opinion. This process should be clearly set out in legislation so that discretion on the lawyer’s part is minimised. (Auckland District Law Society) The bill does not contain explicit wording as to what amounts to “taking reasonable care” by the conveyancing agent when determining whether the vendor is an offshore person and the 52 applicability of RLWT. Guidance is needed on what will constitute “reasonable care” and therefore absolve a conveyancing agent from liability under section 141A. (Chapman Tripp) We suggest a standard of reasonable reliance – for example, the provision of a statutory form that the vendor must fill out to certify to their conveyancing agent that they are or are not an offshore person. Requiring higher levels of inquiry behind a vendor’s representations would be complex and involve high compliance costs, and be potentially difficult for the conveyancing agent to get right. (Chapman Tripp) Section RL 2(6)(b) should be amended to clarify that the paying agent has no liability for a penalty if it was reasonable, on the basis of the certified information provided by the vendor, for the paying agent to consider that RLWT was not payable. Proposed section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would require the vendor to provide certified information, but the section does not oblige the potential paying agent to undertake an independent verification. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Where possible the bill has included tests that should be relatively straightforward to apply in the majority of cases. Officials agree that a standard of “reasonable reliance” is appropriate and this should be clarified in the legislation. For example, the test of whether a person is not an offshore person would be satisfied by the person meeting the conveyancer in person and providing their New Zealand passport. The conveyancer would be entitled to assume that this person is not an offshore person, unless there are reasonable grounds for doubt – for example, if it appears that the passport has been altered. More guidance will be provided on how reasonable reliance will apply in the context of RLWT. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. No clause Issue: Penalty regime – penalties should be civil not criminal Submission (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) It is crit ical to lawyers that any penalties imposed are deemed to be “civil” penalties rather than “criminal”. If the penalty is deemed to be criminal it is likely to impact on the lawyer’s ability to continue to practice law. (Auckland District Law Society) The bill does not expressly state that agents may be liable for criminal penalties but as currently drafted makes that at an option. Introducing a criminal penalty would increase professionals’ exposure to risk and thus increase professional indemnity insurance premiums, with a consequent increase in the overall cost of conveyancing services. (New Zealand Law Society) 53 Comment Civil and criminal penalties play an important role in protecting the integrity of the tax system. The proposed penalties for RLWT simply follow the existing penalties regime. The vast majority of penalties are civil penalties, while criminal penalties are relatively rare and are court imposed. It is important to note that all taxpayers face the possibility of being subject to civil and criminal penalties, including withholding agents for other withholding taxes, and it would not be appropriate to provide an exemption from criminal penalties for RLWT agents. Recommendation That the submission be declined. No clause Issue: Duty to investigate mechanisms used to avoid RLWT Submission (Auckland District Law Society) It is unclear whether the lawyer has a duty to investigate or take into account any mechanisms which are used to reduce the purchase price. The legislation should deal with these issues and clarify whether there is a duty for a lawyer to inquire behind certified statements, including when they have either knowledge or a suspicion that a certified statement may be incorrect. Comment Officials consider that if the conveyancer knows or suspects that a statement or other information is incorrect, then they are required to withhold RLWT. For example, if a person provides a statement to the effect that they are not offshore when the conveyancer knows that they are offshore, the conveyancer must withhold tax. Inland Revenue will use its existing powers to monitor situations where there are likely to be evasion or avoidance concerns. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 54 Clause 44 Issue: Liability of agent for underlying RLWT Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposal to exclude the paying agent from joint and several liability in relation to the vendor’s RLWT debt. The funds do not belong to the withholding agent and exposing the withholding agent to liability for the underlying tax could lead to increases in the cost of professional indemnity insurance and thereby increases in conveyancing costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clauses 39 and 44 Issue: When RLWT has been deducted but not paid Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) When the paying agent has deducted withholding tax, but does not remit this to Inland Revenue, Inland Revenue’s recourse should be with the paying agent and the vendor should still receive the credit for the RLWT. (KPMG) It is unduly harsh to pursue the vendor rather than the paying agent when the paying agent has withheld money but has not passed it onto the Commissioner. The bill Commentary notes this, but the legislation is currently silent, so it should be strengthened in the legislation. It would be harsh if the vendor is not able to claim a tax credit when RLWT has been withheld but not passed onto the Commissioner as the vendor is deemed to have received full consideration. The RLWT regime should be consistent and either operate wholly on a withheld basis or a paid basis. Proposed section RL 2(7) should also be amended so that it only applies if the money has been passed onto the Commissioner. (PwC) The Committee should ask the Commissioner to issue guidance on circumstances in which a vendor is unable to get a refund or credit because the conveyancing agent or purchaser has withheld RLWT but not paid it to the Commissioner. The vendor should not be denied the credit or refund. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that the vendor should be able to get a refund or credit if the conveyancer has withheld RLWT but not paid it to the Commissioner. This is consistent with other withholding taxes, where the Commissioner will investigate the failure to pay, provide the tax credit to the affected taxpayer, and recover the debt from the withholding agent. 55 To protect the integrity of the tax system and decrease the risk for fraud, RLWT will generally need to be received by the Commissioner before an interim claim will be released. If there are concerns that an RLWT agent has retained an amount of RLWT and has not paid this to the Commissio ner, this will be investigated by Inland Revenue as currently occurs with other withholding taxes, such as PAYE. In the case of other withholding taxes, the withholding agent is liable for the underlying amount of withholding tax. In the case of RLWT, the draft legislation provides that the RLWT agent is not jointly and severally liable for the vendor’s RLWT debt. This is the correct outcome in the situation when the paying agent has not retained RLWT from the settlement amount before paying the funds to the seller. This is because the RLWT paying agent will not be able to recoup the debt from the seller if the paying agent is held liable for the underlying RLWT debt. The exception to this is when a RLWT paying agent has retained an amount of RLWT from a resident ial land purchase amount, but has not paid this to Inland Revenue. In this case, the Commissioner should be able to hold the RLWT agent liable for that debt and recover the funds from the agent. Officials consider that further consideration needs to be given to the drafting to ensure that Inland Revenue would have sufficient recourse in this situation and be able to take action against the RLWT agent. Officials do not consider that proposed section RL 2(7) should be amended as per PwC’s submission. Proposed new section RL 2(7) provides that the vendor is deemed to have received both the amount withheld and the net proceeds. This follows other withholding taxes. The standard procedure for other withholding taxes when an amount has been withheld but not paid to the Commissioner is to provide the taxpayer with the tax credit, not to reduce the amount of income deemed to have been derived by the person. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, the PwC submission be declined, and the matter be referred to drafters. Clause 73 Issue: Penalty regime – disclosure to professional bodies Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed amendment to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the Commissioner to provide details of RLWT paying agents to their professional bodies when they have failed to meet their RLWT obligations. We agree that this measure will support the integrity of the RLWT. 56 Comment Officials note that this feature of the proposed RLWT plays an important role in protecting the integrity of RLWT, because of the proposal to exclude the RLWT paying agent from having jo int and several liabilit y for the RLWT. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 73 Issue: Penalty regime – disclosure to professional bodies needs clarification Submission (EY) There needs to be clarification as to the legislation’s intent in relation to possible reporting by the Commissioner to professional bodies of conveyancers' failings to comply with the RLWT rules. The mere existence of a provision may encourage IRD personnel to report any and all failures – we would expect this only in egregious cases of repeated or deliberate failure but would appreciate acknowledgement as to the legislation’s intent. No similar provision applies to any other failure. Provisions as currently drafted are not straightforward, and different definitions of offshore persons could create uncertainty and confusion. As conveyancers are not tax specialists, the 1 July commencement date does not allow much time for finalisation. Comment Officials agree that Inland Revenue should report a person only when there are repeated or deliberate failures. This will be clarified in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clauses 41, 42 and 44 Issue: Penalty regime – equity of proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the decision not to impose late filing penalties on a paying agent who has not retained the amount of RLWT from the residential land purchase amount but to impose late 57 payment penalties on a paying agent who has retained an amount of RLWT but has failed to pay it to the Commissioner. The proposal is equitable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No clause Issue: Penalty regime – fixed penalty regime would be more appropriate Submission (Chapman Tripp) We accept that there needs to be some penalty regime as penalties play an important role in ensuring that taxpayers, including withholding agents, have an incentive to comply with their tax obligations. However, imposing a penalty on a conveyancing agent that is based on a percentage of the unpaid RLWT would seem unduly harsh. The conveyancing agent is merely an intermediary in the process of collecting RLWT. The penalties may be disproportionate to the level of offending and may vary based on the underlying RLWT rather than the offending conduct. Comment The level of a penalty should be commensurate to the level of offending in order to prevent perverse incentives from arising. In the context of RLWT, there will generally be more pressure on the RLWT agent not to withhold when the amount of RLWT to be withheld is large (for example, $100,000) compared with a small amount (for example, $1,000). This is because there may be more to gain when there are large amounts at stake. The role of a variable penalty is to diminish this effect by introducing an equivalent downside to not fulfilling their obligations. A fixed penalty would generally have a greater effect on incentivising RLWT agents to withhold and pay RLWT when the amount of RLWT is small (for example, the penalty is $200 when the amount of RLWT is $1,000), but will generally not have the same effect when the amount of RLWT is much larger (for example, the same $200 penalty when the amount of RLWT is $100,000). Withholding taxes normally make the withholding agent jointly and severally liable for the amount of withholding tax, which substantially diminishes the incentive not to withhold. This is not a feature of the proposed RLWT, so variable penalties will play a key role in incentivising RLWT agents to correctly withhold when there are large amounts of funds at stake. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES No clause Issue: Assistance for RLWT agents Submission (Auckland District Law Society) Will there be dedicated resources within Inland Revenue to provide support to paying agents who are making assessments and require assistance? In addition, there are several problem scenarios that require addressing before the RLWT comes into effect. What happens if there are joint vendors and only one vendor is an offshore person? What if a property is being sold with one purchase price but includes more than one certificate of title, and some titles do not have houses on them? How will a lawyer apportion the value of a purchase price when the land has been subdivided and sold as separate lots, particularly if one lot has a pre-existing house on the land and others are bare sections? Inland Revenue should answer these questions and provide extensive examples of how other different scenarios should be treated. An online calculator will need to be created for the 1 July 2016 implementation date. Comment These questions and full examples will be addressed in guidance material issued by Inland Revenue for RLWT agents. Additional resources will be available to assist RLWT agents in fulfilling their RLWT obligations, including an online calculator. Recommendation That the submission be noted. No clause Issue: Written confirmation of RLWT from Inland Revenue for overseas tax returns Submission (Auckland District Law Society) Written confirmation should be provided by Inland Revenue of the amount of RLWT received in relation to the taxpayer so this can be provided to offshore clients for offshore tax returns they will need to comply with in their respective tax jurisdictions. Paying agents should be able to issue the RLWT certificates for their clients. 59 Comment RLWT will be on account of a person’s income tax liability and may not reflect the final income tax paid by the person in relation to the disposal at the end of the income year. Providing a certificate of the RLWT paid would not be appropriate when the person’s income tax for the year has not been finalised. It could lead to the person’s home jurisdiction providing a tax credit when the person is not entitled to the credit – for example, when their final income tax liabilit y for the disposal is less than the amount of RLWT paid or if the overseas tax authority provides a credit for both RLWT and income tax paid, not realising that RLWT is on account of income tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. No clause Issue: Guidelines for purchaser and purchaser’s agent Submission (Chapman Tripp, PwC) There should be clear guidance for people who do their own conveyancing – that is, where the buyer is the RLWT agent. (Chapman Tripp) Communication strategies should be put in place when the RLWT agent is the purchaser’s conveyancing agent or the purchaser themselves as they may not be aware of their obligations. (PwC) Comment Officials understand that land transfers involving no conveyancer or lawyer make up a very small minority of all land transfer transactions, so it will be unlikely that the purchaser will be the RLWT agent but it is possible that the RLWT agent will be the purchaser’s conveyancer or lawyer. However, appropriate guidance will be available to people with RLWT obligations and communication strategies will also be put in place. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 60 Issue: Legislating for interim claims Submission (EY, PwC) Statutory clarification is necessary to provide consistency between the Tax Administration Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2007. We are not aware of any general statutory authority for taxpayers to file their returns on an interim or early basis. (EY) Specific legislation is required to enable a vendor to prepare and file an interim tax return. (PwC) Comment The Tax Administration Act 1994 already provides for special returns in specific circumstances, including early returns when the taxpayer no longer has an enduring relationship with New Zealand and will not derive any further income that will be taxed in New Zealand. Officials consider that a specific legislative provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide for the interim claim process is necessary. While there are general provisions in sections 79 and 80 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allowing the Commissioner to require the furnishing of annual returns and other returns in addition to those already prescribed, officials consider that due to the uniqueness of the proposed interim claim process, a specific legislative provision outlining the concept would be beneficial. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the matter referred to drafters. No clause Issue: Process for filing an interim return Submissions (KPMG, PwC) The formulae are likely to result in over-taxation and refunds often take longer than required to be processed. Refunds are a key feature of RLWT and implementation needs to be taken into consideration. There needs to be efficient reimbursement of overpaid tax. It is unclear what remedy will be available to the vendor in situations when RLWT has been over-deducted or deducted in error. (KPMG) We query how a taxpayer would file an interim tax return and final tax return in practice, and what the format of the interim return would be. (PwC) 61 Comment As noted above in Issue: Legislating for interim claims specific legislative authority will be required in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide for the interim claim process. In general, the interim claim process will be available when the vendor has had too much RLWT deducted relative to the income tax liability from the sale and they have no outstanding tax debts. However, other requirements will also be necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. For example, RLWT will generally need to be received by the Commissioner before an interim claim is processed and there may be some verification of deductions. If the RLWT proposals in this bill are enacted, detailed guidance will be provided on how the interim claim process will work and in what circumstances a taxpayer will be able to file an interim claim. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. No clause Issue: Assurance of systems capability Submission (EY, KPMG) Detail is required on the interim claim and the RLWT payment processes. The Inland Revenue system will need to be able to identify RLWT deductions at a taxpayer level in real time, meaning that RLWT returns filed by conveyancers will need to itemise the tax paid by each vendor. It is not clear that this requirement has been included by Inland Revenue in its own administration costs. (KPMG) The Commissioner should provide assurance that Inland Revenue’s systems will be able to process and release such refunds promptly before the end of the relevant tax year. It would be disappointing if IRD’s systems could not refund the excess RLWT because the tax year has not yet ended. (EY) Comment Inland Revenue’s processing systems will be able to cope with releasing funds under an interim claim before the end of a tax year. However, whether funds are released early will depend on a number of factors, including whether the taxpayer meets the requirements for an interim claim, the RLWT has been received by the Commissioner, and sufficient evidence has been provided. Officials have engaged with representatives from the conveyancing and legal professions to design the reporting and payment process for RLWT, as these agents will likely not have acted as withholding agents before. This will help to streamline the RLWT payment process. 62 The implementation of RLWT is staggered in that the first payments of RLWT will be made only in relation to residential land acquired on or after 1 October 2015 and disposed of on or after 1 July 2016. This means that at first, RLWT will only apply to disposals of residential land made within nine months of acquisition rather than two years. This will relieve a significant amount of pressure for both RLWT agents and Inland Revenue in relation to a 1 July 2016 implementation date. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. No clause Issue: ICA credits Submission (EY) The ICA provisions should be amended to expressly recognise RLWT credits and to provide for the timing of such credit for vendors that are ICA companies. Comment New Zealand-resident companies are able to maintain an imputation credit account (ICA). A company has imputation credits for income tax or provisional tax paid. These are then attached to dividends paid by the company to reduce the amount of tax payable on those dividends by their shareholders. Given that the proposed RLWT would be paid on account of income tax, amending the ICA provisions to expressly recognise RLWT credits would lead to double counting. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 38 and 39 Issue: Tax credits Submission (EY) Clarification is required as to the availability of RLWT credits when there are a number of co- owners, look-through-companies, limited partnerships, trustees and nominee legal owners. 63 Comment This is an area that will require further guidance. However, officials’ intent is that the availability of RLWT credits in circumstances when there is not a single owner should follow the procedure for other types of withholding taxes. The treatment of RLWT credits will be clarified in guidance on the RLWT such as the special report and the relevant Tax Information Bulletin item. Further guidance will also be provided to RLWT agents, where appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 64 MINOR DRAFTING ISSUES Clause 44 Submission (KPMG) Proposed new section RL 1(2) should read “by a person (the vendor) to another person (the purchaser)”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 42 Submission (KPMG) The proposed amendment to section RA 10(1)(b) should read “RLWT for a residential land purchase amount”. This would appear to leave proposed new section RA 10(1)(c) redundant. Comment The submitter refers to the amendment in section RA 10(1)(b), but the correct section reference is section RA 10(1)(a). The need for both the proposed amendment to section RA 10(1)(a) and the proposed addition of section RA 10(1)(c) arises from the fact that in the majority of circumstances, RLWT will not be a true withholding tax when the purchaser and vendor are not associated persons. Section RA 10(1)(a) begins with “a person liable to withhold an amount of tax for...”, which would only apply where the purchaser and vendor are associated persons. The proposed addition of section RA 10(1)(c) is necessary for all other circumstances when the conveyancer or solicitor (or purchaser themselves, if neither party has a conveyancer or solicitor) is simply a “paying agent” and the vendor remains liable for the RLWT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 Clause 44 Issue: References to tax rates Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The tax rates in the RLWT formula should refer to the appropriate clauses in schedule 1 to the Income Tax Act 2007, rather than the numerical rates themselves. Comment The RLWT formula as currently drafted refers to 33% and 28%, the top individual marginal tax rate and the company tax rate. The norm is to refer to the clause in the appropriate schedule so that if the tax rate changes, there is no requirement to also update references to that tax rate in the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 45/No clause Issue: RLWT should be included in the list of tax credits in the definition of “residual income tax” Submission (EY) RLWT should be included in the list of tax credits in the definition of “residual income tax”. Comment The definition of “residual income tax” is used for the purposes of determining whether a taxpayer should fall within the provisional tax rules. Generally, a taxpayer will be in the provisional tax rules if they have a residual income tax liability of more than $2,500 in the previous income year. Residual income tax is the amount that remains after subtracting from a person’s income tax liability certain tax credits that are listed in the definition of “residual income tax”. These tax credits include a number of withholding taxes (for example, non-resident withholding tax, resident withholding tax and PAYE) and ensure that taxpayers who have had tax paid on their behalf at the correct rate throughout the income year do not fall into the provisional tax rules. Officials consider RLWT to be similar to other withholding taxes in this respect, because RLWT is intended to be a collection mechanism for taxpayers’ income tax liabilities arising under the bright-line test, and therefore should be listed as a tax credit in the definition of “residual income 66 tax”. This would ensure that taxpayers will be less likely to fall into the provisional tax rules merely because of an income tax liability arising from the disposal of residential property when RLWT has already been paid on their behalf. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 44 Issue: Reference to “associated persons” in defined terms Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The relevant RLWT provisions in the bill should include “associated persons” in the list of defined terms. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 45 Issue: Offshore persons – individuals Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It is not clear whether presence in New Zealand for just one day (or part of one day) is sufficient for the vendor not to be considered an offshore person. The legislation should be clarified. Comment It is intended that presence in New Zealand for part of one day would satisfy the requirement not to be an offshore person. This would be consistent with day-count tests in New Zealand’s tax residence rules. However, this is specifically provided for in the tax residence rules, so officials consider that a legislative amendment is required to achieve this. Regarding the submission that it is not clear that presence in New Zealand for a single day would sat isfy the test, officials consider the current drafting to be sufficient. The current wording reads “have not been in New Zealand within the last three years” and “have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months”. This should be interpreted as any physical presence in New Zealand during the previous three years or 12 months, rather than continuous presence in New Zealand for three years or 12 months. This point will be clarified in guidance. 67 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Clauses 35, 36 and 44 Issue: Persons described in sections RL 2 and RL 3 Submission (EY) The proposed amendments in sections BE 1 and BF 1 refer to persons “described in” sections RL 3 and RL 2, respectively. We query whether such wording may cause uncertainty or difficulties where a person may meet the description but not be subject to those provisions. Recommendation That the submission be noted and the matter be referred to drafters. Clauses 44 and 45 Issue: Restriction of security discharge amount to situations where vendor or vendor’s conveyancer must pay RLWT Submission (EY) We suggest the words “if the relevant person who must pay RLWT is the vendor or the vendor’s conveyancer”, which are currently contained in the proposed section RL 4(7)(b) definition of “security discharge amount”, would be more appropriately included in section RL 4(6). Otherwise, it seems implicit there should be another “security discharge amount” definition applying where purchasers or their conveyancers have RLWT obligations. Recommendation That the submission be noted and the matter be referred to drafters. 68 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Clauses 38 and 39 Issue: RLWT payment and income tax liability may arise in different tax years Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sellers should get a tax credit for RLWT paid in relation to a disposal of residential property in the tax year in which the disposal occurs. Comment The bill as currently drafted provides that the taxpayer receives a credit for RLWT in the tax year it is paid. It may be possible for a taxpayer’s income tax liability in relation to a residential property disposal to arise in one tax year and the RLWT paid in relation to the disposal to occur in a later tax year. This is because in most cases, the income tax liability under the bright-line test will arise when the person enters into the agreement of the disposal of residential land, but the RLWT obligation will not arise until settlement. For example, Jo enters into an agreement to sell her property to Scott on 14 March 2017 (during the 2017 tax year), and settlement, along with the payment of the residential land purchase amount, occurs on 10 April 2017 (during the 2018 tax year). As currently drafted, Jo’s disposal would be taxable in the 2017 year, but she would not receive an RLWT credit until the 2018 year. It would be possible to allocate the RLWT to the 2017 year, but this would not be possible until Jo’s income for the 2018 year has been finalised. The bill should be amended so that when a payment of RLWT is received by Inland Revenue, the seller receives a tax credit for the amount of RLWT paid in relation to a disposal of residential property for the tax year in which the disposal occurs. In the case of Jo’s disposal, she should receive an RLWT credit for the 2017 year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 69 No clause Issue: Use of tax credits when paying agent or withholding agent has underpaid RLWT Submission (Matter raised by officials) Where an RLWT agent has underpaid RLWT, and has other tax debts and tax credits for overpayment on file, those credits should be used once any non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) debt has been paid and before the agent’s GST debts. Comment In the Income Tax Act 2007, when a taxpayer has a refundable credit, the Commissioner may apply the amount of the refund to satisfy a liability that the taxpayer has under the Inland Revenue Acts. If a taxpayer has more than one tax type in debt, the payment priority order list sets out which tax types are credited first. The order of some of the tax types is set by reference to statutory guidelines, while the order of other tax types is set by operational decision. The statutory framework for setting the payments is found in schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 and in section 274 of the Insolvency Act 2006. Officials consider that because RLWT will be a type of withholding tax it should sit near other withholding taxes on the payment priority order list. The list currently places resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest, dividend withholding tax, and NRWT (in that order) behind child support, KiwiSaver, student loans (employer), and PAYE. GST is immediately behind NRWT and is the last tax type that is set by reference to statute. As the RLWT as proposed in the bill is a type of withholding tax, officials consider that it should feature after NRWT and before GST. Note that in the contrasting situation when an RLWT agent has overpaid RLWT in a given period, the resulting RLWT credit should not be used to offset the RLWT agent’s other tax debts. This is because the RLWT payment would have been made from a trust account, which means that the overpayment originates from funds held on trust for someone other than the RLWT agent and should not be used to satisfy the RLWT agent’s other tax debts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 Clause 44 Issue: No negative value for RLWT amount Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amount of RLWT should not be negative, when the amount of RLWT payable is reduced to ensure that a New Zealand mortgage can be fully repaid. Comment In some situations, the amount of RLWT payable may be reduced if it would otherwise mean that a mortgage secured over the property issued by a New Zealand bank or non-bank deposit taker could not fully be repaid. In this case, the amount of RLWT would be the agreed sales price minus the mortgage to be repaid. It may be possible for the seller’s mortgage to exceed the agreed sales price, resulting in a negative amount of RLWT. Officials consider that when the amount of RLWT calculated would be a negative number, it should instead be zero. A zero limitation already applies to other RLWT calculation methods. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 72 Issue: Information about zero amount of RLWT Submission (Matter raised by officials) When a vendor is subject to RLWT, but no RLWT is paid because the vendor has made a basic loss on the sale or the mortgage exceeds the sale price, information about the transaction should still be provided to Inland Revenue. Comment The bill as currently drafted provides that a person that must make a payment of RLWT must give a statement of their RLWT obligations to the Commissioner. It is possible that “must make a payment of RLWT” excludes a vendor who is subject to RLWT because they are an offshore person and are disposing of residential land within two years of acquisition, but the amount of withholding is nil because of the way in which RLWT is calculated. 71 Officials consider that information about such transactions should still be provided to the Commissioner to allow for more efficient data matching with information obtained from Land Information New Zealand on the tax statement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 72 OTHER MATTERS No clause Issue: Timeframe and process Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We recognise this bill is being enacted as Government priority outside the norms of the Generic Tax Policy Process. Nevertheless this approach runs a real risk that the speed in which the proposals will be enacted will impact the quality of the legislation. Comment The Generic Tax Policy Process has been followed for the proposals and an officials’ issues paper on the RLWT proposals, Residential land withholding tax and a government discussion document on the GST proposals, GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods ̧ were released in August 2015. The RLWT and GST proposals were finalised following the standard consultation process on the officials’ issues paper and government discussion document. Officials will monitor the implementation of the proposals and report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue if concerns with the effectiveness of the rules are identified. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 73 74 GST on cross-border supplies of remote services 75 76 CROSS-BORDER SUPPLIES OF REMOTE SERVICES TO NEW ZEALAND- RESIDENT CONSUMERS Clauses 46 to 68 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, Miles and Associates Limited, Retail NZ, PwC, New Zealand Racing Board, Software Finance & Tax Executives Council, Trade Me) Submitters support in principle the proposal to apply GST to remote services and intangibles supplied by offshore suppliers to New Zealand-resident consumers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alignment with international guidance and overseas regimes Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The submitters support the fact that the proposed rules are consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidance, and take into account similar GST rules in other jurisdictions, while also still being mindful of the New Zealand context. This should help avoid double taxation or double non-taxation in the international trade of services and intangibles as well as minimising compliance costs for overseas suppliers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Requiring financial institutions to return GST on transactions involving cross-border remote services Submission (Miles and Associates Limited) The submitter states that officials should further review the feasibility of requiring financial institutions to return the GST on credit or debit card transactions involving services and intangibles purchased from offshore suppliers. 77 Further analysis is required before this option can be discarded because there are significant opportunities to be gained from: • additional tax revenue available through greater (effectively mandatory) compliance; • the ability to reduce thresholds without adding significant operational or administrative costs; • simplification of collection and administration of GST from online consumers; and • future cross-government agency efficiency gains as the GST net on cross-border purchases widens to include small value physical goods. Comments Requiring financial institutions to charge and return GST on cross-border supplies of services and intangibles was considered by officials during the development of the proposed rules. The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) prepared by officials for the introduction of these rules contains an assessment of this option. As outlined in the RIS, while this collection option has the potential to automate the collection process, thus minimising the cost of collection as well as collecting GST on physical goods, it was considered to be unworkable in practice. In order to apply GST to remote supplies of services any system must be able to determine whether a service supplied by a non-resident would be consumed in New Zealand. International guidance suggests proxies for this that differentiate between: • “on-the-spot” services (such as hairdressing, accommodation and restaurant services) being services that are physically performed at a certain location and typically consumed at the same time and place as they are physically performed. In this case the place of physical performance generally determines the place of consumption. • “remote” services (such as e-books, music, videos, and software purchased from offshore websites) being services when the recipient is not generally required to be in the same location as the supplier in order for the service to be performed). In this case the place of consumption is the country of residence of the recipient. Deviating from the above principles may result in double taxation or double non-taxation in the international trade of services and intangibles. Therefore, in order for financial institutions to correctly apply GST to services through credit or debit card transactions, they would need to have the necessary information to determine whether the service being supplied was a “remote” or “on-the-spot” service. For example, a New Zealand resident purchasing hotel accommodation online for an overseas holiday should not be charged New Zealand GST because the service is consumed outside of New Zealand and the financial institution would need to know this. Officials’ assessment is that in a number of situations the necessary information would not be available to a financial institution to be able to apply GST correctly. This is particularly so when the recipient of the service is purchasing through a payment intermediary, in which case the financial institution may have very little information about the underlying purchase. Furthermore, if it became apparent that only certain payment methods could be relied on by the 78 financial institutions (such as the use of a New Zealand credit card), consumers would have an incentive to use other means of payment and potentially avoid the imposition of GST. Therefore, the risk of over- or under-taxation is considered too great to further develop this collection option. Furthermore, this collection option has not been implemented in any other country in part because financial institutions do not consider it to be viable. Further, there is no international experience on how well this option would work, what practical difficulties could arise, and what compliance and administration costs would be involved. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending the offshore supplier registration model to imported goods Submission (Deloitte, Retail NZ, New Zealand Law Society) Currently, GST is not charged on imported goods that fall under the de minimis threshold of $60 of duty (which is roughly equivalent to goods valued at $400, if GST is the only duty that applies). This incentivises consumers to buy from foreign competitors and as a result is seriously impacting New Zealand businesses, towns and communities. In principle, there should be no difference in the tax treatment of services and goods. All purchases should be treated the same way for consumption tax purposes regardless of what they are or where they are bought. The bill should be amended to require offshore suppliers of goods to New Zealand to register and return GST on their supplies, at the same time that these proposed rules for remote services come into effect. This would prevent Parliament from having to consider the same issues again in the short- to medium-term. Suppliers of goods could be expected to comply with the rules, as suppliers of services are expected to comply with the proposed amendments. Firms that choose to comply with the registration requirements could have a streamlined flow of goods across the border. (Retail NZ) Close consideration should be paid to proposals in Australia with non-resident suppliers who supply goods over the GST registration threshold to domestic customers to register and charge GST on all their sales, regardless of the value of the individual sale. (Deloitte) Comment The proposed amendments would apply GST to cross-border remote services (such as e-books, music, videos and software purchased from offshore websites) by requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST when their supplies to New Zealand consumers exceed the registration threshold. The bill does not propose to extend this offshore supplier registration system to supplies of imported goods. Currently, GST is not collected on imported goods when the total duty value (including GST, tariffs and other duties) is less than $60. This roughly equates to goods with a value of $400, if 79 GST is the only duty that applies. This de minimis threshold is intended to ensure that the cost of collecting GST on low-value goods does not outweigh the benefits of doing so. New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) is leading work on options to improve the collection of GST on low-value imported goods. Customs officials are currently testing several approaches to changing the de minimis threshold and streamlining the collection of duty on imports with key stakeholders, and plan to release final proposals for public consultation in April 2016. The non-collection of GST on imported low-value goods gives rise to similar concerns as imported services, as domestic suppliers consider that the current tax settings place them at a competitive disadvantage when compared with offshore suppliers. However, different considerations arise in relation to imported goods, as they must cross the border to enter New Zealand, rather than being remotely or digitally delivered to customers. Any option to improve the collection of GST on imported goods must be integrated with existing processes to collect GST at the border. It may be possible, in the future, to extend an offshore supplier registration system to suppliers of imported goods. There may be some advantages to this approach, as GST would not need to be paid by the importer when the goods reach the border, which could result in goods being shipped faster to the customer. Offshore suppliers who make supplies of both goods and services (for example, books and e-books) could use the same system and charge GST on both types of supplies. However, there would be significant implementation hurdles to overcome in applying this model to imported goods, particularly in relation to the compliance costs for offshore suppliers and the administrative impacts for Customs and Inland Revenue. While an international consensus has developed around the use of the offshore supplier registration model for cross-border services, no other country has implemented similar rules in relat ion to imported goods. It is difficult to assess the success of the model in this context. As a relatively small market in the global economy, some caution is needed in considering whether New Zealand should adopt such a model ahead of further international developments in this area. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for not extending the rules to imported goods Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the decision not to extend the proposed rules to imported goods. A new regime for goods should have regard to international best practice, and New Zealand should not become a leader or outlier in introducing new rules for offshore supplier registration in regard to imported goods. 80 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Narrow the scope of the rules Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The scope of the rules should be narrowed with subsequent amendments being made to increase the scope of the tax over subsequent years once any issues arising from the initial introduction of the tax are addressed and as the international framework for imposing VAT/GST on remote services becomes more mature. Comment The rules as proposed are broadly consistent with OECD guidelines and the rules that apply in other countries, as well as similar proposed rules in Australia. The broad application of the rules is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system. A departure from the guidelines and the New Zealand broad-based GST system to narrow the scope of the proposed rules would likely result in double non-taxation in the international trade of services. Therefore, the competitive distortions the current rules create would not be fully addressed. Where possible, the rules that apply to domestic suppliers should be consistent with the rules that apply to offshore suppliers to ensure that domestic and offshore suppliers compete on a level playing field. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Claiming New Zealand input tax Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) An offshore supplier should be allowed to claim input tax without the supply being received being attributed to a particular taxable supply in New Zealand. Comment In April 2014 new cross-border business-to-business neutrality rules were introduced to allow non-resident businesses to register for New Zealand GST and claim back any New Zealand GST cost they may incur. Only those businesses that do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand are eligible to register under these rules. As GST is intended to be a tax on final consumers 81 rather than businesses, the rules are intended to allow non-resident businesses to register and claim deductions in a broadly similar manner to a comparable New Zealand-resident business. The 2014 rules are designed to address the submitter’s concern. However, officials understand that there could be situations when non-resident businesses may not be eligible to register under these rules as they make taxable supplies under the ordinary rules or the proposed rules outlined in this bill. In these situations, any GST costs they incur that do not relate to a particular taxable supply in New Zealand cannot be recovered. Since this issue relates to provisions that are not in this bill, it should be considered outside the scope of the bill. Officials will discuss this issue with the submitter in order to better determine to what extent the problem exists in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials' comments. 82 ADMINISTERING THE RULES Clauses 46 to 68 Issue: Administrative guidance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Guidance on how the rules are intended to apply as well as how the regime will operate in practice should be issued several months before the introduction of the new regime on 1 October 2016. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Additional guidance material needs to be issued by Inland Revenue to support the resulting legislation. The guidance material is required to provide certainty and clarity to offshore suppliers. (PwC) Comment Officials understand the importance of providing clear guidance to offshore suppliers to ensure these newly imposed obligations are well understood. Detailed guidance material on the operation of the new rules will be provided soon after the legislation has been enacted in the form of a Tax Information Bulletin and a special policy report. Further practical guidance will follow. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Enforcement of the rules Submission (Trade Me, New Zealand Law Society) The lack of enforcement processes outlined in the bill remains a significant concern, as a clear and robust enforcement regime is essential to the regime's success. It is important that government collects GST from all suppliers once they reach the proposed registration thresho ld, and not just larger suppliers who provide an easy target, or face greater reputational pressure. If government fails to ensure these businesses comply, it risks putting an ineffective tax regime in place, or forcing an electronic marketplace to act as a de facto regulator. If offshore suppliers fail to comply wit h their GST obligat ions, any enforcement is best dealt with by government. (Trade Me) The Law Society is concerned that insufficient weight is being placed on the prospect that New Zealand taxpayers may be charged amounts on account of GST by offshore suppliers, in circumstances where Inland Revenue has no effective means to monitor the charging of those amounts or collect the tax charged. There is a risk that New Zealand taxpayers will be charged 83 GST, but this amount is never remitted by the offshore supplier. This results in a net outflow of wealth from New Zealand, arising from the difficulties in monitoring and enforcing the obligation on offshore suppliers to charge and account for GST. (New Zealand Law Society) The overreach inherent in the bill will also undermine the integrity of the tax system by effectively encouraging non-compliance with New Zealand laws. There is no benefit to New Zealand in passing legislation that cannot be enforced, and which in practice, is likely to be ignored. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The experience in jurisdictions that have implemented similar rules is that offshore suppliers have demonstrated a willingness to comply. This is to a large extent because the tax is passed on to the New Zealand consumer and any cost is administrative only. Also, for many of these suppliers, failure to comply with their obligations would pose a significant risk to their reputation. The proposed amendments have been designed to support voluntary compliance, as they are aligned with similar rules in other jurisdictions and contain features that are intended to provide flexibility and reduce compliance costs. The rules will be complemented by simplified registration and return processes, and by the release of clear and helpful guidance that will be easily accessible to offshore suppliers. Setting a relatively high registration threshold (NZ$60,000) in comparison with other jurisdictions should also help to maximise compliance, as only suppliers that make supplies over the registration threshold to New Zealand consumers will be required to register. As these suppliers are based outside New Zealand, enforcing compliance with the rules will require different strategies to those for New Zealand suppliers, although offshore suppliers will be subject to the same penalty and interest regime as domestic suppliers if they fail to meet their tax obligations. New Zealand has mechanisms for mutual co-operation, information exchange and assistance with many jurisdictions under both bilateral agreements and the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (“the Convention”). These agreements establish an extensive network of jurisdictions from which New Zealand can request, collect and provide information, assist in the service of documents, and collect unpaid GST. The OECD envisages countries cooperating and sharing information to ensure that suppliers comply with registration requirements in different jurisdictions. The OECD is therefore working on further guidance for effective exchange of information and other forms of mutual assistance between tax authorities in the field of GST or VAT. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 84 APPLICATION DATE AND TRANSITIONAL RULES Clauses 2 and 46 to 68 Issue: Commencement date of the rules Submission (Deloitte, KPMG, EY) Implementation of the proposed legislation should be aligned with the implementation of similar rules in Australia (being 1 July 2017). This should help increase the global awareness of the changes and allow suppliers to amend their computer systems at the same time to comply with similar rules in both countries. (Deloitte) The commencement date should be deferred to allow offshore suppliers to become more familiar with the details of the enactments and to be able to design and implement any process and system adjustments needed to comply with their obligations. There may also be language difficulties, particularly for non-residents other than high profile multinational groups. (EY) A later implementation date (of either 1 April 2017 or 1 July 2017) would give offshore suppliers more time to understand the new rules and amend their systems in order to comply with the new rules. Even if the bill is enacted by the end of March 2016, there is a risk that the lead time will not be sufficient for non-residents to adapt their systems to comply with the new rules (KPMG). Comment The proposed implementation date (being 1 October 2016) should allow close to six mo nths from enactment of the bill to the implementation of the new rules (provided the bill is enacted in April as planned). Offshore suppliers have indicated that this would give them sufficient time to understand the new rules and amend their systems in order to comply with them. While an extended implementation date would give more time to offshore suppliers to comply with the new rules, this needs to be balanced against the negative impacts resulting from a delay, such as the continued competitive distortions the current GST treatment creates and the delay in receiving the new revenue stream. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 Issue: Application of the registration threshold Submission (EY) The rules should be expressed as applying only in relation to supplies made after the commencement date and any liability to register should be based on supplies made or expected to be made after that time. Comment Under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act), non-resident suppliers of remote services will be required to register for GST if the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand: • in the past 12 months exceeded NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • in the next 12 months is expected to exceed NZ$60,000. These are the same rules that apply to domestic suppliers. In practice, as of 1 October 2016, the date the rules would apply from, the threshold will be forward-looking only for offshore suppliers of remote services and therefore an offshore supplier’s requirement to register will be based on its expected supplies over the following 12 months. This is because under the GST Act, pre-1 October 2016 supplies are not “supplies made in New Zealand”. It is only as a result of these amendments, that from 1 October 2016, remote supplies of services and intangibles to New Zealand resident consumers will be regarded as “supplies made in New Zealand”. This achieves a sensible outcome in practice because offshore suppliers cannot be expected to keep track of supplies to New Zealand residents before the introduction of these rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transitional rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, New Zealand Law Society) Transitional provisions will be necessary for supplies of on-going or part-provided services under arrangements which already exist as at the commencement date (EY) Specific transitional rules are required for insurance contracts that span the date of introduction, similar to those that were introduced at the time of the GST rate change in 2010. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) 86 The continued application of the current rules should be maintained for any claims, recoveries and payments made under pre-1 October 2016 insurance contracts, regardless of whether the relevant periods of cover continue past that date or have expired by that date. (EY) Transitional provisions similar (if not the same) as those applying for the introduction of GST and increase in the GST rate should apply to non-resident suppliers who become liable to account for GST. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that for some fixed term contracts (such as contracts of insurance), that span the implementation date, it may be administratively difficult to adjust the consideration for the supply if periodic payments are made and the new rules would require those payment made after the implementation date to be subject to GST. Therefore, officials consider it appropriate to provide a transitional provision for fixed-term contracts entered into before the implementation date. Officials propose a similar transitional provision to section 78AA(10) and (11), which was provided for the GST rate change in 2010. The provision would apply: • to contracts entered into before 1 October 2016; • to periodic payments made under the contract, and consequently section 9(3)(a) would apply to treat these payments as successive supplies; • if the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement (a year and one month should account for contracts that are entered into during a month and end a year later at the end of the month); and • if the offshore supplier elects that the transitional provision apply. The transitional provision would allow the supplier to treat periodic payments under the contract as not being successively supplied under section 9(3), and therefore, those payments made after 1 October 2016 would not be subject to GST. This transitional rule would only apply for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. After that time (for example, contracts that are for a period of more than a year), section 9(3) would apply and treat periodic payments as being successive supplies when the payments become due or are received, whichever is earlier. Example Jacob insures his car for a 12-month period with a non-resident insurance provider on 15 January 2016 and he elects to pay for the insurance in monthly instalments. The non-resident insurance provider is able to treat those monthly instalments as not being successively supplied under section 9(3) and, therefore, payments made after 1 October 2016 would not be subject to GST up until the 12-month contract ended. Jacob has an accident and damages his car on 1 November 2016. He immediately makes a claim under his insurance contract. The insurance provider is unable to claim a deduction for any insurance payment made as it relates to a non-taxable supply of insurance. This transitional rule is intended to reduce the compliance costs associated with adjusting the consideration for fixed-term agreements that span the application date of the new rules. 87 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Grace period for compliance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Corporate Taxpayer Group, Deloitte) The draft legislation should include transitional provisions that allow a reasonable amount of time for businesses to register and de-register without penalty. There may be businesses that register as a result of these changes who should have registered at an earlier date. The legislation should explicitly state that overseas businesses have a period of time to register once these rules have been enacted. It must acknowledge that it may need to forego revenue (or simply compliance obligations) from back years in order to do so. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Officials administering the rules should take an educational approach to the new rules, rather than an enforcement approach. In the short-term, resources would be better devoted to educating non-resident suppliers and recipients on how the new rules apply, rather than penalising them when they get it wrong. (Corporate Taxpayer Group, Deloitte) It is not appropriate to launch a regime with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue perhaps turning a “blind eye” at the initial stage to others who do not immediately initiate any moves to comply. Taxpayer perceptions that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is applying some part of the tax laws on a partial or inconsistent basis may prejudice their perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. (EY) Comment Allowing a window for offshore suppliers to register would effectively delay the implementation of the new rules as many suppliers would have an incentive to choose to register at the latest date possible. However, it is recognised that the obligations imposed on offshore suppliers under these proposals may be unfamiliar to some suppliers and will require systems changes to be implemented, which may result in mistakes being made or registration being delayed. These situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis and penalties and interest may be remitted under the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s existing discretion (see sections 183A and 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) when it is appropriate. The existing discretions can be exercised when the Commissioner is satisfied that the non- compliance has been caused by an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification or excuse for the omission, or when the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the duty to collect, over time, the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law (for example, when there is a genuine oversight or a one-off error). Inland Revenue will also develop and provide tailored educational material that will be easily accessible to offshore suppliers. This is intended to ensure the obligations imposed on offshore suppliers are clear, thus avoiding simple errors and misunderstandings. 88 Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Taxpayer’s historical practice Submission (KPMG) It is possible that the introduction of a new registration system may bring into question the historical practices of some taxpayers, as some taxpayers may have been returning GST when they should not have or have not been returning GST when they should have been. A pragmatic approach to this issue should be adopted, where historic tax positions are not opened up. Therefore, the bill should include transitional rules that: • allow a period after commencement of the new rules to register under the new rules, without retrospective registration under the existing rules; • allow a period for an existing registered person to change the nature of their registration; and • prevent retrospective de-registration. Comment A blanket exclusion from considering historic practice would be undesirable for fairness reasons, particularly when a taxpayer was deliberately avoiding tax or was grossly negligent. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 51(4) and 52(5A) already has some discretion relating to when a taxpayer is required to register and de-register. Situations as described by the submitter can therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis and the discretion exercised when it is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 PLACE OF SUPPLY RULES Clause 49 Issue: Meaning of “physical performance” Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) The references to places where, or times when, services are physically performed in the proposed amendments and in the existing place of supply rules, are unsuitable in many cases, especially in relation to digital services. Not all supplies of services are necessarily “physically performed” or the time or place of such performance may not be obvious or readily identifiable. Difficulties may arise for intangible services (for example, insurance cover and rights to use intellectual property) or when supplies are of an on-going nature (such as a continuing supply of electricit y). Comment When GST was introduced in 1986, the volume of cross-border trade in services was much lower than it is today, and online digital products were not available. At this time, the place that services were “physically performed” would usually have been a readily identifiable and appropriate proxy for the place of consumption. Since then, advances in technology have enabled consumers to access digital services and intangibles from anywhere in the world, with the services often being delivered through automated processes without any manual intervention from the supplier. In the modern context, it may be more difficult to determine where an automated service, such as the provision of a right to stream a music video, is physically performed. The existing place of supply rules draw a distinction between services that are “physically performed” in New Zealand, which are generally subject to GST, and services that are “physically performed” outside New Zealand, which are generally not subject to GST. To some extent, the new rules will reduce the emphasis on this boundary, as a service that is remotely supplied to a New Zealand consumer will be taxed, regardless of the place of physical performance. The place of supply rules are based on the premise that all services are “physically performed” either inside or outside New Zealand, with the place of physical performance being the place where the service is actually carried out or performed, or where the effort in providing the service takes place. In many cases where the supplier has no presence in New Zealand and makes content available to a New Zealand consumer, it will be clear that the service is not physically performed in New Zealand. Removing the concept of the place where services are “physically performed” from the place of supply rules would be a further fundamental shift in the framework for taxing services, which could inadvertently affect the current interpretation of the GST rules. The tension between traditional frameworks based on the place of performance of services and reforms that are based on the OECD principles of taxing remote services in consumers’ place of residence is a challenge faced in many jurisdictions. Officials consider that the best approach would be to maintain a watching brief on international developments in this area before making further changes. 90 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Physical presence before triggering the requirement for GST to be charged Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The rules should be amended so that a recipient must be both resident in New Zealand and physically present at the time the services are performed, in order to trigger the rules. Comment The rules as proposed are consistent with the OECD guidelines and the rules that apply in other countries. The guidelines and international practice suggest that residence is the appropriate proxy for determining New Zealand’s right to tax these services. While other proxies could be used to determine where a person consumes a cross-border service or intangible (such as the physical location of the consumer when the service is received), it is proposed that New Zealand follow international consensus. This will better ensure that cross- border services are only subject to GST/VAT in one country, thus avoiding double taxation or unintentional double non-taxation. Importantly, diverting from international practice by requiring offshore suppliers to determine their customer’s physical location, in addition to their country of residence, would likely impose very significant compliance costs on offshore suppliers and a considerable likelihood of error. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 DEFINITION OF REMOTE SERVICES Clause 47 Issue: Support for definition of remote services Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The submitter supports the proposal to impose GST on cross-border remote services and intangibles and to insert a definition of “remote services” into the GST Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Narrowing the definition of remote services to include only digital services Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Since digital services are the primary focus of the rules the definition of “remote services” should be amended to include only digital services. Comment The proposed definition of remote services is deliberately broad and, in the context of supplies of remote services and intangibles, would include: • digital services that are typically electronically delivered (such as digital downloads, online music and video streaming services, online gaming and other digital services), and • traditional cross-border services supplied remotely by a person offshore (such as professional advice like legal and accountancy services). While some countries have limited their rules to digital services only, in the New Zealand context of a broad-based system, we consider a broader definition of services would be more in line with the objective of neutrality between offshore and domestic businesses. If the rule was limited to digital services there is a risk that it could: • Bias consumer decisions on whether to purchase digital or non-digital services. For example, the rules may create an artificial distinction between a legal opinion produced by a non-resident that is provided via email and one that is sent through the postal services. (Ideally, tax should not influence people’s decisions to purchase a particular type of service or influence the delivery method of a particular service). • Make the rules more complex and less flexible as suppliers would be required to determine whether a supply of services is “digital” and therefore subject to GST. 92 A broad definition of “services” is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system and is also consistent with the approach recently announced in Australia and the OECD’s guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Services should be excluded when it is reasonably foreseeable that the service will be consumed outside New Zealand Submission (KPMG) The definition of “remote services” should specifically exclude services when it is reasonably foreseeable that the services will be consumed outside New Zealand. As presently drafted, the use of a broad definition potentially captures some supplies such as vouchers or loyalty schemes, which could be ultimately consumed in a foreign jurisdiction. These remote services could be purchased and ultimately consumed in a foreign jurisdiction but subject to GST in New Zealand based on the definition of remote services, given the focus on the location of the supplier and recipient at the time of supply. Comment For many remote services the “place of consumption” is difficult to determine, instead the OECD guidelines and international practice suggest the appropriate proxy for place of consumption is the country where the recipient is resident. This is why the place of residence of the customer forms the basis for taxation under the proposed rules. Officials understand that there may be situations when a voucher is supplied or benefits under a loyalty scheme are redeemed for an “on-the-spot” service that will be physically performed outside New Zealand. In these situations, the place of consumption is arguably outside New Zealand and therefore the service should not be subject to New Zealand GST. Despite this, considering New Zealand’s rules are similar to the rules that apply in other countries, double taxation and double non-taxation are not likely occur in practice. Amending the rules to address this issue may result in a misalignment with rules that apply in other countries resulting in double taxation and double non-taxation. It is proposed that officials monitor how the rules apply in practice as well as international developments. Further amendments can then be considered if issues arise in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 93 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES Issue: Support for the excluding telecommunications services Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Submitters support the proposal to retain the special GST rules that apply to telecommunication providers. The telecommunications rules are well established and operate effectively in practice so retaining the current rules is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Interaction with the telecommunication services rules Submission (EY) Clarification may be desirable as to how the proposed section 60C should interact with the current GST rules for telecommunication services supplies in sections 8(6) to (9) and section 8A where services are acquired through a mobile telecommunication device. Comment The marketplace rules under section 60C will not apply to resident telecommunication providers as the rules only apply to non-resident marketplaces. In most instances, the rules should also not apply to non-resident telecommunication suppliers unless they supply remote services by electronic means on behalf of underlying suppliers. It is not expected that merely transmitting a remote service through a mobile telecommunication device would require non-resident telecommunication supplier to register as an electronic marketplace. The act of transmitting a remote service through a mobile telecommunication device would not constitute the supply of a remote service, consequently, the non-resident telecommunication supplier would not meet the proposed definition of “electronic marketplace”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 94 GST REGISTRATION THRESHOLD Issue: Support for the registration threshold Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, KPMG) Submitters support the proposed level of the registration threshold of NZ$60,000, which is consistent with the threshold that applies to domestic suppliers. A very low threshold may have been seen as unreasonable and unlikely to be enforced, so may not have encouraged voluntary compliance. Moreover, a lower threshold would have increased costs for businesses and Government. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Increase the registration threshold Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed registration threshold should be significantly increased so that offshore suppliers subject to the rule can reasonably be expected to dedicate the resources necessary to comply. Comment The proposed rules are intended to ensure that domestic suppliers compete on a level playing field with offshore suppliers. A higher threshold than the threshold that applies to domestic suppliers would disadvantage domestic suppliers and not fully address the competitive distortion the current rules create. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 95 Issue: Registration threshold and currency conversion Submission (EY) Clarification is needed in relation to the currency treatment for offshore suppliers determining whether or not their supplies have exceeded or may exceed the NZ$60,000. Given the volatility of New Zealand’s currency, however, difficulties may arise if the annual amounts may or may not exceed the threshold using different conversion rates. Comment Officials agree that offshore suppliers whose supplies near the registration threshold may obtain different results depending on currency movements, and that there should be additional clarit y on the method of determining whether the threshold is exceeded. Under section 51(1) of the GST Act, a supplier is liable to be registered: • at the end of any month where their total value of taxable supplies in that month and the preceding 11 months exceeds NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of the supplies in the 12-month period after that month will not exceed the threshold); or • at the beginning of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of their taxable supplies in the next 12-month period will exceed NZ$60,000. To ensure the rules are flexible, officials consider that an offshore supplier should be able to use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded under the first limb of this test. This would include converting amounts to New Zealand currency as at the time of supply, using the exchange rate at the time of testing the threshold, or using an average exchange rate over the period. Any of these methods would be regarded as fair and reasonable as long as they were used on a consistent basis. The second limb of the test already relates to whether the supplier has reasonable grounds for believing that the registration threshold will be exceeded, which we would expect to be based on the exchange rate in existence at the start of the 12-month period in question. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. 96 DETERMINING WHETHER A CUSTOMER IS RESIDENT IN NEW ZEALAND Clause 50 Issue: Support for rules for determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) The submitter supports the required methods for determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand, including the discretion given to the Commissioner to allow her to prescribe the use of another method if required. The ability of a non-resident supplier to rely on two non-conflicting indicia is an appropriate trade-off between compliance costs and capturing all transactions that could attract GST. (KPMG) We support the proposal to require an offshore supplier to treat a supply to a New Zealand resident as one made to a consumer unless the recipient confirms their status as a GST- registered business. (PwC) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Reliance on indicia to determine whether GST liability arises Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Law Society supports offshore suppliers being able to rely on the indicia to determine whether GST liability arises, however, an amendment should be drafted to ensure that there is no residual exposure to the offshore supplier when they have correctly considered the indicia. Comment It is intended that offshore suppliers will be able to rely on the indicia to determine whether a recipient of a supply is a New Zealand resident. It is intended that there should be no further liability on offshore suppliers if they treat a recipient as being a non-resident (and therefore the supply not being subject to GST) after relying on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence at the time of supply but the recipient is later found to be a New Zealand resident. Officials consider the current draft legislation achieves this policy. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 97 Issue: Declaration that a customer is a New Zealand-resident consumer Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) An offshore supplier should also be entitled to rely on a statutory declaration by the recipient that they are a New Zealand resident. Comment Offshore suppliers will be able to rely on a notification or declaration from the recipient of a supply that they are a New Zealand resident in terms of meeting the test under section 8B(2). For example, a notification or declaration could be in the form of a drop-down list of countries from which the recipient self-selects their country of residence. This would be considered to be “commercially relevant information” under the test in section 8B(2). However, the supplier would also be required to obtain another non-contradictory piece of evidence to establish that the recipient is a New Zealand resident, unless it is agreed with the Commissioner that another piece of evidence is not required. It is unlikely that statutory declarations would be practical for the types of services supplied under the proposed rules (such as music and video streaming services). A statutory declaration is a legal document to allow a person to declare something to be true for the purposes of satisfying some legal requirement or regulation when no other evidence is available. It is expected that suppliers would more easily be able to obtain information about a person’s country of residence, such as the recipient’s billing address, IP address or bank details. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, Software Finance & Tax Executives Council) It should be clear that the provision in proposed section 8B is for the Commissioner to exercise widely and that the legislative wording is not intended to be prescriptive or restrictive about when the discretion can be exercised. It may be that the provision could be worded more broadly to demonstrate this. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The legislation should ensure that there is flexibility in determining the residency of customers and the use of proxies to do this. We are pleased with the inclusion of discretion for the Commissioner to determine other methods, but this area should be closely monitored to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to allow businesses to function in an efficient manner. (Deloitte) 98 The Commissioner should be afforded authority to provide exceptions to the two pieces of evidence requirement. This would allow for one piece of evidence to be used (such as the country indicated by the billing address or a “drop-down” menu where the customer selects their country of residence). This would be used for scenarios involving high-volume, high-speed low-value supplies of remote services to consumers, and scenarios where the supplier must use less reliable indicia of the consumer’s country of residence because the supplier receives no other location information from the consumer. (Software Finance & Tax Executives Council) Comment Officials agree with submitters that it is important to allow flexibility for cases when offshore suppliers are unable to apply the prescribed tests for determining whether a customer is a New Zealand resident or a GST-registered business. I n each case, the Commissioner should be able to either publicly prescribe another method for a class of taxpayers or to agree with a particular taxpayer on a method that is tailored to their circumstances. Officials consider that factors should be added into the legislation to guide the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion in line with this policy intent. Without limiting the Commissioner’s discretion, the factors that the Commissioner could consider when approving another method to determine the residence of a customer would include: • whether the supply is made in a low-value, high-volume digital context; • whether the supply is a one-off transaction, as opposed to circumstances where the supplier and customer have an on-going relationship; • the information that is commercially available to the supplier. Similarly, when approving an alternative method for an offshore supplier to determine whether a supply is made to a New Zealand GST-registered business, the Commissioner could consider addit ional factors such as: • the nature of the supply (for example, certain advertising services that are generally only purchased by registered businesses); • the value of the supply (for example, the provision of a high value software package that would only be associated with business use); • the terms and conditions of the provision of services (for example, software that is licensed for enterprise use across a large number of networked computers would be likely to be supplied to GST-registered businesses). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. 99 Issue: Meaning of “other commercially relevant information” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Guidance should be given on what the Commissioner would consider to be “other commercially relevant information”. Any information used to make business decisions in the course of carrying on the supplier’s business should be sufficient. Comment The use of “other commercially relevant information” in proposed section 8B(2) is intended to be consistent with rules that apply in the European Union. 1 It allows flexibility for offshore suppliers to use information that is routinely collected through their existing business processes to determine whether a customer should be treated as a New Zealand resident, rather than specifically prescribing the items of evidence that should be used. This recognises that the information that is available to each offshore supplier will depend on their business model and the technologies used in their interaction with customers. Examples of “other commercially relevant information” would include: • the customer’s previous trading history, such as the historic IP address or billing address of the customer; • the customer’s selection of their country of residence, for example from a “drop-down” menu on a website; • the customer’s purchase of a product that is localised or locked to a particular region. The use of “other commercially relevant information” does not mean that only one item o f evidence can be used to satisfy the test. A supplier must use two separate pieces of commercially relevant information or other evidence listed in section 8B(2) to meet the requirement of having two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. Recommendation That the submission be noted.F OR LESS 1 Article 24f, Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1042/2013 100 NON-DOUBLE TAXATION RULE Clause 55(3) Submission (Corporate Taxpayer Group, KPMG, Deloitte, New Zealand Racing Board, PwC, New Zealand Law Society) Further work needs to be done by officials to ensure double taxation does not arise under the proposed new rules. The rule that prevents double taxation in relation to services supplied to non-residents should be broadened to include services that are physically performed outside New Zealand, and the incidence of double tax be closely monitored to determine whether GST should be considered and included as part of New Zealand’s double tax agreements. When a remote service is supplied to a non-resident that is physically present in New Zealand, the supplier should be entitled to zero-rate the supply and no double tax mechanism should be required in these circumstances (Corporate Taxpayer Group, KPMG, New Zealand Racing Board, Deloitte). Global guidelines should be developed to determine which jurisdiction is responsible for giving a refund on a particular supply where GST is due in more than one jurisdiction. We recognise any such measure remains a long way off. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The proposed rule allows a deduction to the extent of output tax paid. There does not appear to be any limit to that deduction. If the foreign GST rate exceeds New Zealand’s rate, the supplier will be ent it led to a refund. (KPMG) The non-double taxation rule should refer to “a tax similar to GST” as opposed to “consumption tax”. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The non-double taxation rule (under section 20(3)(dc)) is intended to prevent double taxation when the normal GST rules seek to tax a remote service supplied to a non-resident, and at the same time another jurisdiction’s GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) rules also seek to tax that same service because the service is being supplied to one of their residents. In this situation, the non-double taxation rule provides an input tax credit for the amount of tax paid to the other jurisdiction in recognition of this double tax effect. It is intended that the input tax credit be limited to the output tax (GST) paid on the supply in New Zealand (15%) and to the extent tax is paid and returned in the other country. 101 Example A resident of Country A visiting New Zealand receives a remote service from a New Zealand supplier. The service is physically performed in New Zealand and therefore subject to New Zealand GST. Country A also requires the New Zealand supplier to register for GST and tax the service at a rate of 20% as it is a remote service supplied to a resident of their country. The non-double taxation rule allows the New Zealand supplier the ability to claim an input tax credit of up to the amount of New Zealand GST returned on the supply (15%) if the supplier has returned and paid GST to Country A (if Country A’s tax rate was 10%, the supplier would only be entitled to an input tax credit of 10%). Double taxation is only likely to occur in this context when services are performed in New Zealand, as services performed in New Zealand are generally subject to GST. If the service is performed outside New Zealand to a non-resident, the service will be zero-rated (see section 11A(1)(j)), and therefore, double taxation should not occur. A new zero-rating rule was considered when developing these rules to address double taxation. However, a special deduction rule was considered preferable because: • at the time of supply the New Zealand supplier may not be aware of his/her obligation to return tax in another country and therefore would not know to zero-rate the supply; • remote services may be mistakenly zero-rated if it was later found that output tax did not need to be returned in another country; and • there is less revenue risk associated with a special deduction rule as Inland Revenue would be better able to substantiate that output tax had in fact been returned in another country before providing relief from double taxation. The non-double taxation rule will therefore prevent double tax in the rare situations when double taxation arises. Officials will monitor the application of the rules and the developments in other jurisdictions to ensure that if these situations become more common the double-taxation rule continues to operate effectively. Finally, the drafting of the non-double taxation rule in referring to “consumption tax” is consistent with other parts of the Act, specifically section 54(B), which allows non-residents to register and claim back New Zealand GST if they are, amongst other requirements, registered for a “consumption tax” in the country or territory in which they are resident. Consumption taxes are considered to be “a similar tax to GST” and would include VAT and sales taxes. Therefore, officials consider that an amendment is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 102 SUPPLIES TO NEW ZEALAND GST-REGISTERED BUSINESSES Clause 49 Issue: Support for not requiring GST to be returned on business-to-business supplies Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group, KPMG) Submitters support the proposal that GST will not be required to be returned on remote supplies from offshore suppliers to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. However, an offshore supplier and GST-registered recipient would be able to agree to treat the supply as being made in New Zealand, and therefore zero-rated. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Zero-rating of business-to-business supplies Submission (PwC) The offshore supplier should be allowed to deduct any New Zealand GST costs incurred in relation to supplies made to a GST-registered business without the need to obtain specific agreement to zero-rate the supply. It would be preferable if the offshore supplier could unilaterally elect to zero-rate supplies to GST-registered persons so long as they have evidence that the New Zealand customer is GST-registered. This would remo ve the addit ional compliance costs required to obtain agreement from the New Zealand-resident recipient. Comment Officials agree with the submitter. Agreement to zero-rate a supply of remote services by an offshore supplier to a GST-registered business should not be necessary and may impose unnecessary compliance costs on the offshore supplier. An amendment is therefore proposed to allow offshore suppliers to unilaterally elect to zero-rate supplies to GST-registered businesses. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 103 Issue: GST refund requests from offshore suppliers Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) It is critical that Inland Revenue has efficient procedures for dealing with GST refund requests fro m non-residents, as an offshore supplier is unlikely to return GST overpaid on a supply to a GST-registered business unless a refund is obtained. It should be considered whether non- residents should be given a greater ability to make adjustments for errors in subsequent GST returns. Comment It is expected that the majority of offshore suppliers will only be required to return GST (if they only make supplies of remote services) as they are unlikely to incur New Zealand GST. An optional simplified GST return is therefore being developed for these “pay-only” offshore suppliers, which will remove the ability to claim input tax deductions and receive refunds. A simplified return is expected to lower compliance costs and is consistent with international best practice. In addition, as these suppliers will only be returning GST, they represent a low risk to the tax base and therefore will only be required to provide minimal information about themselves, thus further reducing compliance costs. There may, however, as the submitters have pointed out, be instances when a non-resident supplier accidently treats a GST-registered business as an individual consumer and therefore charges the GST-registered business GST. In these situations, proposed amendments to section 25(1) will allow a supplier to make adjustments to the payment of output tax in the return in which it is apparent that the mistake has been made. This is intended to reduce the need for a refund to be paid to these suppliers, although the need for a refund may still arise in some instances. Officials therefore note the submission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 104 OPTION TO PROVIDE A TAX INVOICE FOR SUPPLIES OF NZ$1,000 OR LESS Clause 57(2) Issue: Support for option to issue a tax invoice for supplies of NZ$1,000 or less Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group) The proposal to allow an offshore supplier to issue a tax invoice for a supply of less than NZ$1,000 is a sound, pragmatic solution to the issue of GST being charged inadvertently to a GST-registered business. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Removal of the option to issue a tax invoice for supplies of NZ$1,000 or less Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The NZ$1,000 limit on the ability for a non-resident to claim GST should be removed. Comment The option to provide a tax invoice is intended to be a compliance-saving measure for non- resident suppliers in relation to low-value supplies, when the compliance cost of issuing a refund may exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. The NZ$1,000 cap on the ability to provide a tax invoice is a revenue protection measure considered necessary to address the risks with offshore suppliers providing tax invoices and allowing GST-registered business recipients the ability to claim back the GST. For example, offshore suppliers may purport to charge GST but not return the GST and registered New Zealand businesses could then seek to claim the GST back in the normal manner. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 105 Issue: When a tax invoice has to be obtained Clause 55(5) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The wording of clause 55(5) should be amended to require the recipient to obtain a tax invoice before claiming a credit. Comment It is intended that the existing deduction requirements under section 20(2) (no deduction without required documentation) continue to apply to those recipients that obtain a tax invoice when the consideration for the supply is less than NZ$1,000. In general, this provision requires the recipient to have a tax invoice before a deduction can be claimed. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Difficulty in determining whether GST is inadvertently charged Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) It seems unclear how a New Zealand GST-registered business could determine whether or not New Zealand GST has been inadvertently charged in the absence of being provided a tax invoice. Once the transaction is completed online, the mechanism for contacting a supplier may be difficult, such that requesting an invoice after the fact may be practically impossible. An employee may not know the relevant details to satisfy a foreign supplier that they are making the purchase on behalf of a GST-registered business. If the employee then seeks reimbursement from the employer, the employer will face compliance costs in recovering the GST suffered by the employee on behalf of the business. The Committee should consider whether it is possible to oblige non-resident suppliers to provide easy to access contact details in order to request a tax invoice, or a refund of incorrectly charged GST, if this proves to be required after the transaction has been completed. Comment Officials consider that as the intention is to minimise compliance costs for offshore suppliers, the rules should not be prescriptive about when a refund must be provided, or require suppliers to provide publicly accessible details. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES Clauses 47(3), 65 and 66 Issue: Support for electronic marketplace rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Trade Me) The requirement for an electronic marketplace operated by a non-resident to register is a sound practical solution to the issue of requiring the registration of many small suppliers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to electronic marketplace rule Submission (KPMG) The submitter does not support the compulsory GST registration of an electronic marketplace operated by a non-resident. The ultimate liability should be on non-resident suppliers to comply with the rules. There is a risk that a requirement for an electronic marketplace to register for GST could result in them ceasing to make supplies to New Zealand consumers. Comment The proposed rules will require the non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace (such as an app store), as opposed to the underlying suppliers, to register and return GST on supplies to New Zealand-resident consumers. Typically, the electronic marketplace has a closer relationship with the customer than the underlying suppliers who make supplies through the marketplace. Consequently, the electronic marketplace rule generally places the responsibility to determine the GST treatment of a supply on the entity that has the best access to the information required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand-resident consumer or GST-registered business. As the electronic marketplace is likely to be larger and better-resourced compared wit h the number of underlying suppliers that supply services through it, requiring the operator of the electronic marketplace to register and return GST is also likely to reduce compliance costs overall. As the proposed rules are consistent with those in place in the European Union and Norway, and with those proposed in Australia, it is expected that many electronic marketplaces that operate globally will already be responsible for returning GST or VAT on supplies in other jurisdictions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 107 Issue: Documentation for agreements between electronic marketplaces and underlying suppliers Submission (EY, PwC) It would be preferable to remove references to documentation being provided and to agreements being made in documents signed by the relevant parties, as the references to signing documents may lead to confusion or uncertainty for offshore suppliers. Comment Officials agree with the submission and consider that proposed subsection 60C(2)(b) should be clarified to state that the supplier and the operator of the electronic marketplace do not need to agree in “a document” that the underlying supplier is responsible for paying GST on the supplies. However, it is expected that some form of evidence be kept to confirm that an agreement was entered into. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Operation of electronic marketplace rule Submission (Trade Me) The proposed definition of “electronic marketplace” is problemat ic. In the proposed definition, the obligation to return GST rests on the electronic marketplace in the first instance, and moves to the underlying supplier only if certain conditions are satisfied. Tax obligations, including registering and returning GST, should rest on the underlying supplier in the first instance. Then, if that supplier supplies to a marketplace, and when certain conditions are satisfied, such as the marketplace setting the terms of the transaction, and authorising payment and delivery, the GST obligation should move to the electronic marketplace, as it becomes best placed to deal with those obligations. Comment The rules are drafted to be consistent with those in other jurisdictions, which place responsibility on the electronic marketplace, unless certain requirements are satisfied. This is for the reasons relating to who has the best information, and how compliance costs are best reduced as outlined earlier in this section of the report. International consistency is desirable to reduce compliance costs and uncertainty, as an electronic marketplace will be able to apply the same rules in respect of their supplies to New Zealand as they do for customers in other countries. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 108 Issue: Ambiguous wording Submission (Trade Me) The wording of proposed section 60C(2)(c) is ambiguous, and may cause interpretative issues. It is unclear whether an electronic marketplace must meet each requirement outlined in sectio n 60C(2)(c)(i) – (iii), or whether meeting only two requirements will result in the marketplace failing to meet the test in section 60C(2) . It is submitted that the drafting be clarified to outline that a marketplace must not meet any of the requirements listed in section 60C(2)(c) to avoid returning GST. Comment To fall outside of the electronic marketplace rules, the supply must meet all of the requirements in section 60C(2)(a), (b) and (c). This is consistent with similar rules in other jurisdictions. In regard to subsection 60(2)(c), only one of the conditions set out in (i) – (iii) needs to be met before subsection 60(2)(c) precludes the marketplace and the underlying supplier from opting out of the marketplace rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of “authorise the charge” to the recipient Submission (Trade Me) One of the conditions of electronic marketplaces not being required to return GST on behalf of international suppliers, is that the electronic marketplace does not "authorise the charge to the recipient". It is unclear whether the intention is to outline that it is the marketplace which is the entity that is deducting the payment from the recipient's credit card following receipt of authorisation by the recipient. Comment The reference to “authorise the charge to the recipient” is intended to be consistent with similar rules in other jurisdictions. It refers to situations when the electronic marketplace can influence whether, at what time or under which conditions, the customer pays. The electronic marketplace authorises the charge when it decides that the customer’s account can be charged for the service. Recommendation The submission be declined. 109 Issue: Excluding click-through entities Submission (PwC) Click-through entities are those where the ultimate purchaser can click-through a link on their webpage to the supplier. The click-through entity does not facilitate the supply of services from the supplier to the purchaser and therefore should not be required to register and return GST on behalf of the supplier. While the proposed definition of electronic marketplace should not capture click-through entities as an “electronic marketplace”, for the avoidance of doubt, we consider it is preferable to specifically exclude them from the definition. This will provide certainty to click-through entities that the proposed rules will not apply to them. Comment Officials agree that the definition of electronic marketplace is not intended to include “click- through entities”. This is because the click-through entity does not make the supply in the situation outlined. Officials consider the wording of the definition of electronic marketplace achieves this policy outcome. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 110 CROSS-BORDER SUPPLIES OF INSURANCE Clauses 48 and 55 Issue: Rules for cross-border supplies of insurance Submission (KPMG) Insurance is a complex area that will require further consideration and the rules should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they work appropriately in this context. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Deductions for insurance payments to third parties Submission (KPMG) Clause 55(2) should be amended to specify that a deduction is available unless the supply of the contract of insurance is zero-rated and the reverse charge exception applies, in order to ensure that an insurer would clearly be able to deduct a payment made by a third party supplier (for example for a replacement good). Comment A proposed addition to section 20(3)(d) prohibits an offshore insurer from claiming a deduction for an insurance payment made under a contract of insurance when the supply of the contract of insurance is zero-rated under proposed section 11A(1)(x) (the rule that zero-rates supplies to a GST-registered recipient). The proposed addition to section 20(3)(d) does not prohibit deductions for payments made to third party suppliers (for example, for a replacement good). Instead, the normal deduction provisions under section 20 apply. Officials do not consider that an amendment is necessary to clarify this. Allowing deductions for payments to third-party suppliers (for example, for replacement goods) ensures that there is no bias between making a cash payment and making a payment for a replacement good. If the GST-registered policyholder instead purchased the replacement good, he/she would normally be able to claim a deduction for any GST incurred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 111 Issue: Marketplace rules for supplies of insurance Submission (Lloyd’s of London, EY) The rules do not take into account situations when insurance services are arranged through a marketplace, on behalf of a syndicate (a vehicle through which its members group together to underwrite insurance). This structure could also involve a New Zealand coverholder who is acting as an agent for syndicate members. The rules as currently drafted may require each syndicate member as an underlying supplier to register and return GST on their supplies, rather than the New Zealand coverholder or insurance marketplace. Currently, the definition of an “electronic marketplace” is limited to electronically operated marketplaces through which supplies are made by electronic means. This definition could be amended to include a “marketplace” as approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This would allow the insurance marketplace to register and return GST. This is consistent with the policy intention to require marketplaces to account for GST on cross-border services where the marketplace covers a large number of underlying suppliers. Similarly to an electronic marketplace, the New Zealand coverholder or the insurance marketplace would have a closer relationship with the New Zealand customer than the members of the syndicate that supply the contract of insurance. Therefore, they will be better placed to determine whether the New Zealand customer is registered for GST. If insurance is supplied through a New Zealand coverholder, that coverholder should be required to register. If there is no New Zealand coverholder, the insurance marketplace should return the GST. This is consistent with the approach being undertaken for electronic marketplaces. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Allowing non-electronic marketplaces (such as a marketplace for insurance) to register and return GST is consistent with the broader policy of allowing electronic marketplaces to register. This should lower compliance costs as underlying offshore insurers would not need to register separately and the marketplace could be expected to have a closer relationship with the New Zealand customer and therefore would be in a better position to apply the proposed rules. Officials also agree that the non-electronic marketplace would need to agree with the Commissioner before being able to register on behalf of its members. This would allow the Commissioner to ensure that the marketplace was in the best position to return the GST as opposed to its members. This is particularly important for the insurance industry, as the marketplace would need to be in the position to return GST on both premiums received and claim deductions on payments made so that the margin-based approach for calculating the value of general insurance supplies can be properly applied. Officials also agree that New Zealand coverholders should be able to register and return GST instead of the underlying non-resident insurer or marketplace as they are also likely to be in a better position to return the GST. The existing agency rules require the principal to return the GST (unless the principal is absent). Therefore, an amendment to the agency rules could allow New Zealand coverholders to make returns and be liable for the GST instead of the principal 112 (the offshore insurance provider), essentially treating the New Zealand coverholders as making the supply of insurance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Standard-rate supplies of insurance to GST-registered businesses Submission (Lloyd’s of London) The bill provides an option for the insurer and the GST-registered recipient to agree to treat a supply as zero-rated under proposed section 11A(1)(x), rather than being excluded from GST under the proposed amendments. This optionality will create confusion and there will be greater compliance costs to administer the different GST treatments. Instead, supplies of cross-border insurance to GST-registered businesses should be subject to GST at the 15% rate, and a deduction should be allowed under section 20(3)(d) in respect of the related insurance payments. Comment Under the proposed rules, remote services supplied to GST-registered businesses are excluded, unless the parties agree to zero-rate the supply. The reasons for excluding these supplies are as follows: • There would be significant compliance costs for no net GST revenue if offshore suppliers that made only (or predominantly) business-to-business supplies were be required to register. • Tax invoice requirements can be relaxed because no New Zealand consumers charged with GST would be in a posit ion to claim back the GST. • There are some fiscal risks associated with applying GST to business-to-business supplies, which would arise if any offshore supplier purported to charge GST but did not return the GST. Registered New Zealand businesses could then seek to claim the GST back in the normal manner. • Excluding business-to-business supplies is consistent with how similar rules have been applied in other countries. The reasons for excluding remote services supplied to GST-registered businesses also apply to remote supplies of insurance services and officials consider that a special rule for insurance would be undesirable. The compliance costs associated with distinguishing between consumers and GST-registered businesses is expected to be manageable for many offshore insurers as they are likely to better understand the nature of the recipient for risk assessment purposes. Like other offshore suppliers, offshore insurers will also be able to apply to the Commissioner for the use of another method to determine whether the supply is made to a registered person (see proposed section 8B(6)). 113 Despite the reasons outlined above, when a New Zealand coverholder is registered for GST on behalf of an underlying offshore insurance provider or marketplace, they would be treated as any other New Zealand-resident supplier and therefore would be required to return GST on both supplies to New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. The amendment to the agency rules as suggested in the previous submission would need to ensure the New Zealand coverholder is treated like any other New Zealand-resident supplier. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 114 CROSS-BORDER SUPPLIES OF REMOTE GAMBLING SERVICES Clause 48(1) and 52 Issue: Formula for determining consideration for gambling services Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Racing Board) It may be difficult for suppliers to determine the boundary between one gambling or prize competition and another, which may lead to disputes and uncertainty. This is less relevant for a New Zealand supplier as all supplies are typically taxable supplies for GST purposes. (KPMG) The formula proposed requires the offshore supplier to include “whole of business” data to apportion prizes (and refunds) to New Zealand. In order to promote voluntary compliance, such unnecessary complication should be avoided. It is more complex for the supplier to attribute the worldwide prizes according to the proportion of bets made by New Zealand residents, compared with simply knowing how much was actually bet (in aggregate) and how much was actually won (in aggregate) by the customers of a particular jurisdiction during the taxable period. Instead, the actual amounts received minus prizes paid to New Zealand-resident consumers should be taxed, and a credit/loss carry-forward mechanism should be developed to address fluctuations within a taxable period. (New Zealand Racing Board) Offshore suppliers should be able to claim a refund for losses from a supply of remote gambling or prize competition, or should be able to offset these losses against the GST payable on other supplies. (KPMG) Clearly, if the proposed pro rata approach is not adopted it will be necessary for negative consideration to be able to arise (and a carry-forward loss, credit or refund to arise to the supplier) to offset future positive consideration and GST payable when New Zealand-resident customers lose. (New Zealand Racing Board) Comment Officials agree with the submitters. After considering how offshore gambling suppliers would practically be required to apply the proposed formula, we note that there could be significant compliance costs for these suppliers. This may discourage some offshore suppliers of gambling services from complying with the rules or from supplying to New Zealand consumers. While officials consider that the proposed formula does accurately reflect the value-add associated with supplies of gambling services, and therefore results in the appropriate amount of consideration on which GST would be payable, a similar result can be achieved with a simpler formula that calculates consideration on the basis of amounts received from New Zealand residents less amounts paid out to New Zealand residents: Consideration = amounts received from residents – prizes paid to residents As identified in the Commentary to the bill, this simplified formula may produce arbitrary results on a supply- by-supply basis or even over a taxable period, because offshore suppliers of gambling services will have limited control over the distribution of prizes across participating 115 countries. However, over time this distribution can be expected to even out, resulting in a more proportionate amount of consideration being allocated to gambling services provided to New Zealand residents. Example Gambling Co. operates an offshore gambling website. Gambling Co. offers a game of chance to two participants, one in Australia and the other in New Zealand. The Australian resident and the New Zealand resident each make a payment of $100 to participate in the game of chance for a 50 percent chance to win $150. Depending upon who won the prize, the amount of consideration calculated by Gambling Co. could vary significantly if consideration was solely based on the amounts received by the New Zealand residents less the amount of prizes paid to the New Zealand resident. However, a result closer to one that would arise under the formula currently in the bill can be expected the more games the New Zealand and Australian resident plays. In order for an appropriate amount of consideration to be calculated under the revised formula, the losses to the New Zealand resident would need to be carried forward and offset against the consideration from games won by the New Zealand resident. Therefore, officials recommend that the formula be simplified as suggested, with any New Zealand losses being required to be carried forward and offset against future New Zealand winnings. This ensures that offshore suppliers of gambling services do not return an excessive amount of GST when prizes are won by non-resident participants, nor claim excessive refunds. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: GST registration threshold determined on a net basis Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) The registration threshold should not be determined on a “net basis”, but instead should be based on the amount received from New Zealand residents, to capture a greater number of operators. Comment The threshold as applied to domestic suppliers of gambling services is determined on a net basis. To ensure that domestic and offshore suppliers of gambling services are treated equally, officials consider that the threshold that applies to offshore supplies should also be determined on a net basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 Issue: Clarify treatment of refunded bets Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) The formula proposed may not be sufficient to provide clarity on the treatment of refunds. Refunds could arise due to an event not proceeding or if the supplier offers a rebate to the customer based on the quantum of bets. Offshore betting providers may require assistance to confirm that “free-bets” provided to a New Zealand customer, when there is no “amount received” for the bet are not required to be included in “resident amounts”. Comment To ensure consideration in relation to gambling services is not over-estimated, refunds paid back to New Zealand-resident participants should be subtracted from “resident amounts” (amounts received from New Zealand residents). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 117 MISREPRESENTATIONS BY RECIPIENTS OF REMOTE SERVICES Clause 48(5) Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The proposed section 5(27) and knowledge offences should be amended to make it clear that they apply where the information is provided with the purpose of avoiding New Zealand GST, rather than leaving their application to administrative practice. (KPMG) The Law Society is concerned at the vagueness of the threshold in proposed section 5(26)(c) that must be met before the Commissioner is allowed to invoke the reverse charge. The concept of “repeated” occurrence, could be as low as two occurrences, and the concept of there being “substantial” tax is also unclear. The Law Society recommends that the absolute values, for example a set number of occurrences in a six or 12-month period, and a minimum level of tax, such as NZ$1,000 should be required. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials consider that these provisions could be amended to better reflect the policy intent, which is that they apply when the customer is providing false information for the purposes of avoiding GST. However, officials consider that it is undesirable to amend the provision to provide for abso lute values as suggested. While officials agree that in certain circumstances it is desirable to provide absolute values in order to provide taxpayers with certainty, in this situation the provision was deliberately drafted to provide flexibility in order for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to consider instances of non-compliance on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, providing absolute values may result in the legislation sanctioning a certain level of non-compliance by taxpayers and this would be undesirable from an integrity perspective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 118 TAXABLE PERIODS Clause 54 Issue: Support for quarterly taxable periods Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The submitter supports the proposal to include changes to a simplified registration process and a change to quarterly taxable periods as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation project. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We welcome the proposed intention to provide an initial six-month taxable period, while retaining a two-month option on application to the CIR, then providing for a quarterly taxable period. (EY) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Two-monthly filing after 1 April 2017 Submission (EY) Suppliers should retain the option of two-monthly filing from 1 April 2017, if they can and wish to use two-month return periods. (EY) Comment Quarterly filing is in keeping with offshore suppliers’ filing obligations in other jurisdictions. As creating additional options would lead to complexity in the registration process, we consider that default quarterly filing should be retained. Officials will monitor whether there is greater demand for alternative taxable periods and may recommend changes in the future if required. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 119 EXPRESSING AMOUNTS IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY Clause 68 Issue: Support for the option to express amounts in foreign currency Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group) Submitters support the proposal to allow offshore suppliers to choose to convert amounts to New Zealand currency at the time of supply or at the date of filing (or at the due date for filing if filing past the due date). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Increased flexibility in the conversion method Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group, New Zealand Racing Board) The flexibility in accounting for supplies in foreign currency should be increased. There should be a catch-all provision that gives the Commissioner a power to approve a time and method for currency conversion, if the same method and timing is used for each conversion. So long as any method is applied consistently it is unlikely that there would be any ability to “game” the system in respect of exchange rates. Complications arise for gambling conducted in a foreign currency, as the time of supply for gambling services is triggered on the first date on which the result is determined. Suppliers should have extra flexibility to either convert amounts to New Zealand currency on the last day of the taxable period, or convert amounts of bets received to New Zealand currency when a bet is placed and prizes to New Zealand currency when prizes are paid. (New Zealand Racing Board) Comment Officials agree that the options to express amounts in a foreign currency should be expanded by allowing an offshore supplier to agree with the Commissioner on an alternative method of converting amounts into New Zealand currency, provided that the method is applied consistently and is not open to manipulation. Offshore suppliers should have the option to convert amounts into New Zealand currency as at the last day of each taxable period (or, alternatively, on the last day of each quarter for the period before 1 April 2017). This may assist offshore suppliers who are required to convert 120 amounts on the last day of each quarter in order to comply with equivalent rules in other jurisdictions. As there may be circumstances in which a supplier needs to change their method within the proposed 24-month “lock-in” period (for example, when a supplier begins charging customers in New Zealand currency), officials consider that offshore suppliers should be able to change their method within this period if agreed with the Commissioner. Therefore, officials recommend that a non-resident supplier of remote services should have the options of: • expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at the time of supply; • expressing amounts in a foreign currency and converting to New Zealand currency at the end of each taxable period (or, alternatively, at the end of each quarter for the period before 1 April 2017); • expressing amounts in a foreign currency and converting to New Zealand currency at the time of filing the return (or at the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); • an alternative method as agreed with the Commissioner. Once the supplier elects to use an option other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at time of supply, they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Currency conversion for tax invoices issued Clause 57 Submission (Corporate Taxpayer Group, EY) An amendment should clarify that the date on which the foreign currency amount should be converted to New Zealand currency for the purposes of determining whether the NZ$1,000 threshold is breached should be the foreign currency amount converted to New Zealand dollars as at the time of supply. It should be clarified whether suppliers should express the consideration details in the foreign currency or whether they must convert into New Zealand dollars. Comment Officials agree that it should be clarified that the NZ$1,000 threshold for the option to issue a tax invoice should be determined by reference to the foreign currency amount converted into New Zealand currency at the time of supply. 121 Consistent with the existing tax invoice rules, the amounts shown on the tax invoice should be expressed in New Zealand currency as at the time of supply. This will provide certainty to the recipient as to the amount that can be deducted by the recipient. Depending on the conversion method chosen by the supplier, this means that currency movements could lead to a mismatch between the amount on the tax invoice and the amount returned by the supplier. Officials consider that the risk of a mismatch is acceptable from a revenue perspective given that this option is only available for relatively low-value supplies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Guidance on currency conversion method Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group New Zealand Racing Board) Inland Revenue should provide guidance on how the foreign exchange rules work and acceptable sources of exchange rate information to assist in compliance with the rules. Offshore suppliers should be provided with guidance on what to do if the date at which they must convert the foreign currency amounts is not a business day (such that a spot exchange rate is unavailable on that date). Comment The Commissioner will accept the exchange rates offered by a registered bank or a bureau de change at the relevant time, which is consistent with the practice for converting amounts to New Zealand currency under the current rules. See public ruling BR Pub 11/04 (Supplies paid for in foreign currency – GST treatment). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 122 HOLDING RECORDS OUTSIDE NEW ZEALAND AND IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH Clause 67 Issue: Support for the exception to the requirement to maintain records inside New Zealand Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group, KPMG, PwC, New Zealand Racing Board) Submitters support the proposal to allow offshore suppliers to keep records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English, without seeking authorisation from the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Extend the exception to the requirement to maintain records inside New Zealand Submission (Corporate Taxpayer Group) Customers of non-resident suppliers of remote services should be excluded from the requirement to request approval to store records outside New Zealand. This is pragmatic given that New Zealand customers may have no knowledge of where the records are kept and may not be in a position to determine whether an application is required. Comment The exception to the requirement to seek authorisation to keep and retain records outside New Zealand is intended to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers, who in many cases will have no connection to New Zealand other than supplying a remote service to New Zealand customers. Extending this exception to customers of non-resident suppliers of remote services is not consistent with this intention, and would reduce the scope of the existing provision significantly. This is a broader policy question that is outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 123 EXCEPTION FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT REQUIREMENT Clause 71 Issue: Support for the exception to the bank account requirement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Racing Board, PwC) The submitters support the proposal to exempt offshore suppliers from the requirement to hold a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Requirement for offshore persons to have a New Zealand bank account number in order to apply for an IRD number Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd) The bank account requirement imposes costs on banks and also applies where a non-resident’s reason for applying for an IRD number is not related to a land transaction. For example, a non- resident business may wish to register as a taxpayer in New Zealand because it expects to pay GST in New Zealand (for example, if hosting a conference here). Similarly, non-resident emplo yees fro m non-tax treaty countries may have New Zealand PAYE obligations if they are here for more than 92 days. In both cases, a New Zealand bank account will not be relevant for their purposes, which is to pay tax. The New Zealand bank account requirement is an unnecessary complication in these circumstances. (KPMG) The relaxation of this requirement is narrow and will only take effect from 1 October 2016, which does not address the current issue. The ability to quickly and easily be supplied with an IRD number is fundamental to the operation of New Zealand’s tax system. The previously enacted changes compromise that operation. We strongly recommend a change in the bill to remove the New Zealand bank account requirement (in section 24BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994). (KPMG) We submit that the exemption from the requirement to hold a New Zealand bank account be widened to include other non-residents who have been subject to another form o f ident it y verification either in New Zealand or overseas. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The introduction of this exception in the bill highlights the breadth of the current bank account requirement in increasing compliance costs for non-residents and creating barriers for non- residents to comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. In the Group’s view, these issues 124 are not limited to non-resident suppliers of offshore services and intangibles. (Corporate Taxpayer Group) The scope of the bank account requirement should be revisited and further carve-outs considered or consider repealing the bank account requirement altogether. Six examples of issues created by the bank account requirement are: short term stays/fly in/fly-out arrangements, non-residents with a permanent establishment in New Zealand, non-resident providing assistance in an emergency situation (hypothetical situation), difficulties in getting a bank account, GST refunds for non-residents, Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme. (Corporate Taxpayer Group) It is submitted that taxpayers should be exempt from the bank account requirement where: • a New Zealand entity has already undertaken identity verification as part of AML checks; (OliverShaw Ltd) • the offshore person has a bank account in another country and that other country has AML rules similar to New Zealand (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand); • a person is required to register for New Zealand GST (OliverShaw Ltd); or • a New Zealand employer applies for an IRD number on behalf of an employee or contractor. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, OliverShaw Ltd) Comment From 1 October 2015, a person who is an “offshore person” must have a functioning New Zealand bank account in order to apply for an IRD number. The requirement to have a New Zealand bank account ensures that the anti-money laundering (AML) identity verification requirements apply to offshore persons. It was introduced as part of a suite of Budget 2015 changes to improve the integrity of the property tax rules (particularly in the case of foreign owners). An individual will be an offshore person for the purposes of the bank account requirement, if they are not a New Zealand citizen and they do not have a residence-class visa. A New Zealand citizen or a holder of a New Zealand residence-class visa will be an offshore person if they are not present in New Zealand, and they have not visited New Zealand within the past three years (in the case of a New Zealand citizen) or 12 months (in the case of a residence-class visa holder). A non-individual (a company, trust, partnership, or other body of persons) will be an offshore person if they are 25 percent or more controlled or owned by an offshore person. Submitters have raised concerns that there seem to be practical difficulties with the bank account requirement and there may be unintended consequences where the taxpayer needs an IRD number in order to comply with their tax obligations, but has limited physical presence in New Zealand. For some of these issues, further work needs to be undertaken to ensure that practical solutions (whether legislative or operational) can be found for situations where it may cause compliance issues, while still maintaining the integrity of the rules. This is particularly the case for non- resident contractors and short-term employees, as well as business investors into New Zealand. However, to address some of the specific concerns that have been raised by submitters to the bill, officials consider that the following solutions would relieve some compliance costs while minimising risks to the underlying policy rationale of the bank account requirement: 125 Other non-resident suppliers registering for New Zealand GST The bill as introduced proposes an exemption for a non-resident supplier of remote services from the requirement to have a bank account. This exemption is available only if the IRD number is applied for solely because the person is a non-resident supplier of remote services taxed under the proposed remote services rules. These are generally payers of GST, so officials consider the risks to be low. We recommend that this exemption be extended to other non-resident suppliers (as well as non- resident suppliers who provide remote services), as long as the IRD number is applied for solely because the person is a non-resident supplier under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. There are a number of requirements that they must meet in order to become registered which reduce the identity verification risk. This proposal would make the policy more cohesive for non-resident suppliers. The person has already had AML verification undertaken by a New Zealand reporting entity In situations where the person has already had AML verification undertaken by a New Zealand reporting entity, we agree that the bank account requirement seems an unnecessary duplication. The person is a worker under the recognised seasonal employer scheme and they obtain a fully functional bank account within one month of arriving in New Zealand A further specific concern identified by submitters related to non-resident workers under the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) scheme. An employee without an IRD number has tax withheld at the non-declaration rate which is a penal rate of 45%. Once they supply their employer with their IRD number, they will have tax withheld at the correct tax rate. We understand that the standard practice for banks is for the person to visit the bank in person. Therefore, the bank account application cannot be finalised until after the person arrives in New Zealand. Proof of a fully functional bank account then needs to be sent to Inland Revenue for processing and issuing. The delay means that at least one pay period will have a penal rate of 45%. This contrasts with the special tax code rate that is available to RSE workers, which is 10.5%. Accordingly, there is a temporary over-withholding of 34.5% on the non-resident seasonal worker’s pay, which results either in potential temporary cashflow issues for those workers, or increased costs for employers. It is important that RSE workers have their wages paid into a New Zealand bank account. However, we recognise that in some cases there may be some delays in obtaining a New Zealand bank account. Accordingly, we recommend that an employee who is a non-resident seasonal worker should have a one month “grace period” to get a New Zealand bank account and to send evidence of the bank account to Inland Revenue. If the person does not provide evidence of their bank account to Inland Revenue within one month, then their employer would be required to begin withholding PAYE tax at the non-declaration rate of 45%. We recommend that these changes should apply from the date of Royal assent. 126 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in part. 127 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Application of the Fair Trading Act Submission (KPMG) Consideration should be given to whether the supply of remote services under the remote services rules would fall, or is intended to fall, within the ambit of the Fair Trading Act 1986. Comment The Fair Trading Act 1986 extends to conduct outside New Zealand that is undertaken by a person carrying on business in New Zealand, to the extent that such conduct relates to the supply of goods or services in New Zealand. This means that suppliers should avoid making false or misleading representations with respect to the price of any services they supply. The prohibition against false or misleading representations does not require a trader to provide a single price for the services. However, any additional charges should be transparent so as not to mislead a potential or actual customer. Therefore, ideally the customer should be aware of any GST payable at the point where the price is promoted and on display. There may be situations when an offshore supplier may not know the residency of the customer until the online checkout, and therefore, the GST may not be displayed on the promoted price. In these situations, potential customers should be made aware that GST may apply at the outset so that customers are not misled at the point when the initial price is on display. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Forming a GST group Submission (PwC) Officials should clarify that an offshore supplier who is required to register for GST under the proposed amendments is able to form a GST group with a company that is registered for GST under the standard rules. Comment Offshore suppliers will be subject to the ordinary rules for forming a GST group with no limitations to the existing provisions being proposed for offshore suppliers registering under the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 128 Issue: Drafting issues raised by submitters Clauses 47, 48, 50, 52, 54, 57 and 67 Submissions (EY, Trade Me, Corporate Taxpayer Group, New Zealand Racing Board) The submitters raise a number of drafting issues: • An amendment should clarify an apparent overlap where the three-month taxable period is “based on a first quarter ending on 31 March”. • The formula expressed in the bill to calculate the consideration should be clarified by inserting additional brackets, in order to avoid possible uncertainty and dispute. • The reference to “lead” in proposed section 5(27)(b) should be changed to “led” • The references in proposed new section 5(27)(c) would provide greater flexibility if the references to repeated occurrences and substantial amounts of tax not being charged were contained in two subparagraphs separated by a colon. • Similarly, in proposed sections 8B(5) and 24(5B)(c), there should be a colon between (a) and (b) and (i) and (ii) respectively • A definit io n of “New Zealand business number” should be provided in the GST Act. • The term “marketplace” in section 2 is problematic, as it carries the implication of a neutral venue where sellers can meet to transact together. While we recognise the proposed definition for section 2 makes reference to a “distribution platform”, Trade Me believes the term “electronic distribution service” is more appropriate. • The legislation should be clarified to make it clear that non-resident suppliers of remote services are not required to seek approval for the Commissioner to keep records outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. Comment Officials acknowledge the minor drafting points raised by the submitters and have referred these points to the bill drafters for their consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 129 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Remote services not received by a registered person for the purpose of carrying on their taxable activity Clause 55(4) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reverse charge provision in section 20(3JC) should be extended to apply when a registered person receives remote services that are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(j). Comment The reverse charge proposed in section 20(3JC) applies to GST-registered recipients of remote services, in cases when the supplier and recipient have agreed to treat the supply as being zero- rated and the taxable use of the service is less than 95 percent. This produces the same outcome as the existing reverse charge in section 8(4B), which applies when services are treated as being supplied outside New Zealand and therefore are not subject to GST, and the taxable use is less than 95 percent. However, if a supply to a registered person is treated as being made in New Zealand because section 8(4) does not apply, then there may be situations when neither reverse charge provision applies to require the recipient to account for their non-taxable use of a zero- rated supply. If a GST-registered business receives a service for the purpose of making exempt supplies, or for other non-taxable purposes, it may not be received “for the purposes of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity”. When the service is physically performed outside New Zealand, the supply will instead be zero-rated under proposed section 11A(1)(j), which applies to services that are physically performed outside New Zealand, other than supplies of remote services provided to New Zealand-resident consumers. As currently drafted, the reverse charge in section 20(3JC) only applies to services that are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). To provide a consistent treatment of non-taxable use by a GST-registered recipient of services, the proposed reverse charge should be extended to apply to a registered person who receives remote services that are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(j). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 130 Issue: Drafting issues Clauses 50 and 68 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials would like to raise a number of drafting issues: • Proposed section 8B(2) refers to two items being “non-contradictory”. However, in the remainder of proposed section 8B the reference is to “non-conflicting” items. Officials consider that an amendment should be made to ensure consistency of the use of the word “non-contradictory”. • Officials consider that proposed section 8B(3)(a) should refer to “at least” two non- conflicting items rather than simply “has”, as the supplier may have more than two other non-conflicting items. • Proposed section 77(2) allows a non-resident supplier of remote services to choose to express the amount of consideration in money for their supplies in a foreign currency. Officials consider it useful to clarify that the election to do so would be made in the non- residents suppliers GST return. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 131 132 Student loan scheme 133 134 INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA Clause 26 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The Office of the Privacy Commissioner expressed its general support for the proposal, which facilitates the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and the Australian Taxation Office to assist Inland Revenue to obtain contact details of New Zealand borrowers living in Australia, and administer the student loan scheme in relat ion to those borrowers. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clauses 21A, 26A and 26B Issue: Facilitating electronic communications Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 6 of the bill proposes an amendment to section 15 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to allow a person to cancel their loan contract in writing or by electronic means. For consistency it is proposed that section 169 also be amended to allow a borrower to require in writing or by electronic means that the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development determines an objection relating to the details of a loan advance made or charged to the borrower under section 167. This could be achieved by replacing “formally notifying” with “notifying in writing.” As a consequence, it is proposed that section 213, which defines “formally notify”, should be repealed and the cross-reference to section 213 in section 214 should be removed. The proposed amendment and repeal would come into force on the date of enactment. 135 Comment The proposed amendment to section 15 would change the requirement for cancellation of a loan contract from “formally notify” to “notify in writing” to allow the cancellation of contracts by electronic means, in accordance with the Ministry of Social Development’s current procedures. The terms are both defined for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, but while “formally notify” excludes communication by email, “notify in writing” does not. The only provision in the Act, other than section 15, that currently requires formal notification, to the exclusion of electronic communication, is section 169. Section 169 applies when a borrower has objected to the loan manager about details of a loan advance made or charged to the loan manager, but the objection has not been wholly allowed by the loan manager. The borrower may then require the matter, essentially an appeal right, to be determined by the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development. Appeals under the Social Security Act to the Social Security Appeals Authority, which are required to be by written notice, are accepted electronically. This is also consistent with proposals to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to facilitate electronic communication, when appropriate. An amendment to section 169, if agreed, would mean that the term “formally notify”, as defined in section 213, is no longer used in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, and section 213 could be consequentially repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 4 Issue: Drafting clarification Submission (Matter raised by officials) In support of the proposed delegation to the Commissioner for approval of charitable organisations for the purposes of the student loan scheme, the organisations that have been approved will be required to be listed on Inland Revenue’s website to make the information easily accessible. Consequently, “list” is to be a newly defined term in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Clarity of meaning would be improved by replacing the proposed definition in section 4(1) with – “list means, in relation to an entity, to include the entity as a charity in the list kept under section 27A”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 136 Remedial amendments 137 138 Issue: Clarification of rule for when land is acquired through the exercise of an option Submission (Matter raised by officials) During the Committee stage of the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill, officials indicated that there would be an opportunity in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill to propose amendments that assist with the overall coherence of the land provisions. This submission is proposing such an amendment. The Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 introduced rules for determining the date on which land is acquired for the purposes of the land provisions (not including the recently enacted bright-line test). The rules recognise that land is acquired at the time a person acquires a first interest in the land. Officials have identified that the specific rule for land acquired through the exercise of an option (section CB 15B(3)) needs to be clarified to ensure it is clear how the specific rule operates. Comment The specific rule for land acquired through the exercise of an option is intended to recognise that when land (such as the freehold title to land) is acquired in this way, the first interest in the land is acquired at the time the option is exercised. This is irrespective of whether the person (the purchaser) previously held a different interest in the land such as a leasehold interest. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Technical amendment to relationship property rule for the bright-line test Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section FB 3A applies for the purposes of the bright-line test when residential land is transferred on a settlement of relationship property. A remedial amendment is required to fix a drafting oversight in the recently enacted section FB 3A(3) which deals with the date of acquisition of land when land is acquired on a settlement of relationship property. The reference to section CB 6A(1)(a) or (b) should also refer to section CB 6A(2) – (4) because these provisions also deal with acquisition dates that are relevant for section FB 3A purposes. Comment Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139

In addition, the proposed amendments clarify the communication options available and provide general rules governing methods of communication delivery. The proposed delivery rules consolidate current practices and legal requirements and extend these to electronic communications putting emails, for example, on the same footing as paper letters delivered by post. The changes in the Bill: • establish the new communications framework, contained in new sections 14 to 14G, to facilitate the information flows between the Commissioner and a person, and between two persons where the tax legislation governs that interaction (refer to clause 74); • update existing terminology referring to specific modes of communication, for example, the requirement for certain communications to be “in writing”, with terminology corresponding to an appropriate tier in the communications framework (refer to remainder of clause numbers). Submitters were generally supportive of the rationale for the amendments. However the submissions raised questions about the effectiveness of legislative change alone, and emphasised the need for administrative change and a positive commitment from Inland Revenue to make better use of electronic communication methods. Submitters also highlighted concerns around the use of common verbs as “defined tiers” of communication options in terms of providing legislative certainty about which method was to be used and when. Finally, submissions highlighted the importance of accurately gauging the necessary formality of certain communications when allocating a tier. For example, whether a document is required to evidence the communication or the consequences of a missed communication (including penalties or use-of-money interest). The example submitters were most concerned about was section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which governs the obligation to provide information when required by the Commissioner, which uses the term “request” in the tit le. In response to submissions, officials are making the following recommendations to modify the proposals in the Bill: • amendments to correct the drafting errors and cross-references as described in the comments below; • amendments to ensure that any provisions where the term “requested” has been replaced with the term “required” are consistent with intended policy; and • an amendment to clarify the inclusion of both “notify” and “notice” within the framework. 3 Officials also undertake to further consider whether an amendment to section 17 to formalise the Commissioner’s stated practice is desirable, as well as any remedial amendments, where necessary, to correct unintended meaning changes as a result of these amendments. Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Covisory Partners, EY, KPMG) Submitters support the rationale for the amendments proposed in the Bill to modernise and future-proof the means of communication in the legislation, and welcome the proposals to clarify the options available for communications. In particular the proposals to remove legislative barriers to electronic communications and the framework included in the Bill establishing general rules for communications are supported. Any amendments that are proposed that will facilitate easier communication with Inland Revenue and increase Inland Revenue’s flexibility to communicate electronically are encouraged and supported by submitters. Comment Officials note the submitters’ support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Administrative changes required No clause Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) We believe administrative changes are required, the Commissioner’s internal operational policies, for example, in relation to the use of e-mail and accepting files sent digitally should also reflect the objective of the amendments. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). The success of the Business Transformation proposals depends on a permissive tax administration framework and Inland Revenue’s uptake and acceptance of the proposals, which will require a significant cultural change within the Department. (KPMG) 4 Comment In the Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration and Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services discussion documents – released in 2015 as part of the Government’s wider focus on transforming the way New Zealanders interact with the tax system – the Government indicated a clear vision for the future state of tax administration in New Zealand, which involved significant administrative changes for Inland Revenue. The discussion documents acknowledged that changes were needed to ensure that Inland Revenue could make better use of available and future digital technologies to provide more efficient services and to simplify interactions for taxpayers. To ensure that the integrity of the tax system and taxpayer confidentiality is maintained, it is necessary to roll out the use of the electronic communication technology following the Department’s staged transformation programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Rules should provide positive obligation for the Commissioner to use electronic communications primarily No clause Submission (KPMG) We consider there should be a positive mandate for Inland Revenue to communicate electronically as the primary mode unless other means of communication, such as letter by post, are necessary (for example, if a taxpayer does not have access to digital services). In our view, the Commissioner has yet to properly and fully embrace current technology, and our concern is that without a clear legislative mandate the Commissioner will resist the application of future technology. A positive obligation to communicate electronically would be useful in supporting a mind-set change at Inland Revenue. Comment Officials consider that the current approach, allowing for varied communication formality which can be tailored to suit individual circumstances, is preferred over a mandated approach where electronic methods of communication are preferred over others. This flexible approach takes into account both the fact that not all communications should attract the same level of formality as well as the fact – as noted in the Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services discussion document – no one size fits all. It is critical that as the tax administration systems are transformed to accommodate better use of digital technologies that services are flexible enough to accommodate taxpayer preferences and to accommodate those taxpayers who may have reduced access to digital services. In light of these underlying principles, officials do not consider a positive obligation for the Commissioner to use electronic communications would be the correct approach. Overall the proposed amendments, coupled with the Government’s stated focus on embracing digital services for New Zealand’s tax administration, should provide the impetus for change within Inland Revenue. 5 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The communication framework should apply to all provisions Clause 74 Submission (Russell McVeagh) We note that not all interactions are governed by the proposed new framework, for example, section 17 does not use one of the defined terms. We submit the proposed framework should apply to all provisions of the Tax Administration, Income Tax, and Goods and Services Tax Acts, that govern interactions between the Commissioner and taxpayers. Comment The amendments were intended to encompass all of the interactions between the Commissioner and taxpayers, and taxpayers and third parties where the tax legislation presently governs these interactions. Therefore where presently the legislation does not expressly describe or require a communication, then the framework will not apply. Section 17 of the Tax Administration Act is unique in this regard and is discussed specifically further below. Officials intend to rely on the framework, once enacted, for future legislative developments to ensure consistency in governing communication under the tax legislation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendments should extend to stamp and cheque duties legislation Clause 74 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments do not apply to Part 6B of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, which deals with the approved issuer levy. This omission should be rectified. Comment The proposed amendments only apply to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Therefore the remainder of the Revenue Acts, including the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, will require updating to align each Act to the proposed communication framework. Officials intend to continue work on the necessary 6 amendments to the remainder of the Revenue Acts and once the framework is enacted, will recommend fo llow-up legislative amendments in due course. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendments should future-proof the legislation Clause 74 Submission (KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is difficult to predict where technology will lead and the risk is that this amendment will restrict the Commissioner’s ability to communicate with the appropriate technology in the future. The drafting should be considered to confirm that it allows for advances in technology so that Inland Revenue is not slow to respond to any changes. The framework needs to be flexible and to embrace digital communication however it develops. It should be possible to draft legislation in a broad way so that communication is not restricted to specific communication means and modes. Comment This amendment is intended to future-proof the legislation, by allowing for each category to be expanded without the need for further legislative change. Presently the defined communication modes have a set of available options for delivery (for example, in writing, electronic or on the telephone) as well as a broad category allowing for communication by “any other manner permitted by the Commissioner”. This catch-all allows for the Commissioner to facilitate new technologies and permit their use without requiring specific legislative amendment. This flexibility allows for the legislation to move with technology with relative agility. Equally, if technology becomes redundant, the legislation can be easily updated through direct amendment to the framework, rather than requiring a re-visit of each operative provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 Issue: Use of common verbs creates uncertainty Clause 74 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The use of different verbs to signal to taxpayers whether they can or must write, call or do something digital should be reconsidered as it will lead to confusion. It would be simpler to have electronic communication accepted unless a taxpayer is notified that another means is required. The use of a tiered system is not practical. Comment Officials acknowledge that the amendments, which specifically define commonly used verbs for the purposes of the tax legislation, do pose a risk of confusion for taxpayers who may not expect that the terms carry specific meanings. However, the definitions of the terms are permissive rather than mandatory, allowing for flexibility in communication mode. This flexibility should allow for taxpayers to communicate in accordance with the law without necessarily needing to refer to the definitions. The tiered approach allows for varying formality in the definitions of the terms, which is a practical way for Inland Revenue to signal which communications are considered more significant (because they may require documented evidence, for example). Given the volume of communications processed by Inland Revenue (both received and sent) it would not be practical to provide an individualised approach for specific taxpayers or even taxpayer groups. Therefore providing flexibility, more generally, in which modes of communication are acceptable to the Commissioner allows for taxpayers to select whichever method they prefer best when communicating with Inland Revenue. For the Commissioner, choosing which method to use would depend on both the individual circumstances and the significance of the communication. Finally, given that the existing definitions and procedural provisions relating to the giving of notices (for example, the postal delivery rules) have been maintained and extended to the electronic forms of communications, officials expect that taxpayers should be largely familiar with the procedures around the more formal modes of communication. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 Issue: Commissioner’s express consent Clause 74 Submission (EY) Where the proposed new provisions refer to using electronic communications, they generally require the person to comply with the Electronic Transactions Act, which includes the requirement for the person to seek the recipient’s consent to the electronic communications. The new proposals specifically deal with the consent issue for taxpayers and others who may receive communication from the Commissioner but do not cover the Commissioner’s position. To remove any doubt or uncertainty we suggest that there should also be express statutory provision that the Commissioner consents to the use of electronic communication and technology wherever the new provisions allow for this. Comment As noted in the Commentary to the Bill, wherever possible and practical, Inland Revenue staff seek from each individual recipient their consent for electronic communication. However, this may not always be feasible, particularly for large groups of recipients receiving a generic batch email notice or in circumstances where the email address is the only contact address available for the recipient as they are overseas-based, for example. In these circumstances requiring express consent from each individual is impractical and would unduly restrict electronic communications when compared with paper equivalents sent by post. As a result the general override in the existing notice provisions (see current section 14(7)) has been maintained and extended to cover the newly defined modes of communication (that is, to apply, inform and ask as well as to give notice). However, in order to ensure that the systems requirements and processes are in place to protect taxpayers from misdirected electronic communications falling outside the net (for example, tax returns being sent via email to a generic Inland Revenue email address and never being picked up for processing) it is necessary for the Commissioner to phase in electronic communication as Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme progresses. By not providing the Commissioner’s express consent to all electronic communications, these amendments preserve the Department’s ability to phase in new digital services. The amendments are designed to allow for these services to “go live” once developed without the need for further legislative change. Therefore, if a fringe benefit tax return online filing system becomes ready for use for example, the Commissioner would simply generally consent to this electronic communication by making the service available on the Inland Revenue website and none of the governing legislative provisions would require updating. These amendments therefore are not intended to, for example, allow for immediate filing of tax returns by email where that service has not been made available to date. The Commissioner’s consent can be given in specific circumstances for a particular matter through a consent agreement with the taxpayer or agent, or more generally by notice on Inland Revenue’s website or through the provision of an online filing service or electronic contact address. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: Communications must be in writing where penalties could arise or time periods are triggered No clause Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society) In any circumstances where there is a penalty for non-compliance or the communication triggers a time period in which a certain condition must be met or a certain action performed, the relevant communication should be in writing as they may subsequently be required for evidentiary purposes. Any communication from the Commissioner to a person that triggers a statutory time period, requires a response by a particular date, or where non-compliance by the person could result in criminal or civil liability, should be made in writing (either electronically or in print). This would avoid disputes over what was required and when a particular communication was made. Comment In developing the proposed amendments to the substantive provisions – as part of establishing the communications framework more generally – officials have taken care to ensure that the current practice and expectation about how communications are to be completed in individual circumstances is disturbed as little as possible. This means that for more formal communications (for example, those where a statutory time period may apply) if the governing provisions have previously required communication in writing or by registered post, the amendments should not allow for an informal communication mode (for example, oral conversation or phone call). To the extent that unintended changes have been made such that formal communications are no longer required to be in writing or electronic equivalents, officials will undertake remedial amendments as required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Commissioner’s power to request information under section 17 Clauses 74 and 76 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) It is inappropriate for communication of a section 17 request to be via phone, orally in person or via email (albeit the Group is comfortable with a separate written letter of request being delivered via email). We submit that the Commissioner must “notify” a person from whom information is required pursuant to section 17. (CTG) Section 17 is silent on how the Commissioner may require information to be provided, which is undesirable as a person who fails to provide information required under section 17 commits an 10 offence. The heading of section 17 should be amended to “information required” rather than information “requested”. A request, as defined under the new framework, would be inappropriate for section 17 given that requests can be made by telephone or orally in person. The section should be amended to require the Commissioner to “notify” a person that information is required. Comment Section 17 provides a broad obligation for every person to provide information or documents to the Commissioner when required by the Commissioner. The title of the section describes the section as “information to be furnished on request of Commissioner”. Officials note, however, that section 17 does not set out a manner for how a request for information must be communicated (that is, at present “request” is undefined). As stated above, in developing the proposed amendments to the substantive provisions officials have taken care to ensure that the amendments do not unintentionally change the current meaning of the individual provisions, and this includes section 17. Nonetheless it is arguable that the meaning of section 17 has been altered by amending the meaning of the word “request” in the heading, which was not intended. Given the significance of this section and the potential consequences for non-compliance, officials prefer not to make hurried amendments to the meaning of section 17. This would include inserting the requirement for a notice into section 17, as suggested by some submitters, which would be a law change away from the status quo. Furthermore, given that section 17 is predominantly relied on for formal requests for information as part of an investigation or audit, officials are confident that the risk of inappropriate use of section 17 (for example, formal request for audit information over a telephone call) is minimised by the Commissioner’s clear departmental practice as discussed in the operational statement (OS 13/02) governing specifically section 17 notices. The OS outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing section 17 notices. It clarifies that although Inland Revenue staff will usually request information and documents without expressly relying on section 17, as this fosters a spirit of reasonableness and mutual cooperation, when information is not provided voluntarily or in a timely manner the Commissioner is able to use section 17 to demand the information by issuing a notice under the section. The OS clearly states that when information is demanded under section 17 a notice will be issued in writing. However, to address the concerns raised by submitters, officials undertake to further consider whether an amendment to section 17, to formalise the Commissioner’s stated practice, is nonetheless desirable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 11 Issue: Responding to an information request in writing Clauses 74 and 76 Submission (Russel McVeagh) The amendment to section 17 should be clarified to provide certainty that a person is able to respond in writing to an information request under that section. The objective of facilitating greater use of electronic and other new communication channels is achieved by allowing the Commissioner to specify other acceptable methods of furnishing requested information but maintaining, as a default, the ability to respond “in writing” provides certainty for taxpayers that written documents will be acceptable. Comment This amendment is intended to both update the language to reflect the fact that documents “in writing” may no longer be the preferred method of providing information and to allow for the flexible application of the section tailored to individual circumstances. The removal of the reference to “in writing” in section 17 is not intended to restrict the way in which a person communicates their response or disallow written responses to information requests. Although certainty in drafting is desirable, officials consider that re-inserting the words “in writing” as suggested in the submission would appear to set written communication as the preferred method of co mmunication which is inconsistent with the intention to allow for flexible adoption of modern communication technologies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Requirement to provide information for a binding ruling Clause 140 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The amendment to section 91EE to remove the word “requested” and replace it with “required” would mean that an applicant for a binding ruling would commit an offence under section 143(1)(c) if they did not provide the relevant information. Presumably this is not intended. It would be simpler to remove the “by notice” and retain “request” which would allow for requests for further information to be made by phone or in person, which is often the case in ruling applications. Comment Officials agree that the extension of the offence in section 143(1)(c) to section 91EE is not intended. An amendment to address this concern has been proposed. The Bill contains other 12 similar amendments to sections covering other types of ruling applications, and officials have proposed further amendments to ensure the unintended extension has been corrected elsewhere in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Legislative clarification for email bounce-back Clause 74 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Group recognises the need to ensure that a corporate taxpayer actually receives a communication, and we agree with the comments in the Commentary to the Bill that a notice should not be treated as delivered if it is simply sent to a generic email box at a company. The requirements for delivery by electronic means should be further enhanced by making it clear that in situations when an email bounces back to the sender (for example, due to the person having left the organisation or a response indicating the recipient is out of the office with no email access) it will not be treated as having been delivered. Comment Although failed communication is not desirable from an administrative and policy perspective, it is officials’ view that the legislation is a blunt tool to address the risk of communication non- delivery. There are many circumstances that could give rise to a communication non-delivery and an email bounce-back is just one example. To effectively legislate to cover off all of the circumstances would clutter the provisions, which may nevertheless remain incomplete. Furthermore a specific email bounce-back provision would put electronic communications on a different footing to paper-based communications delivered via post, on which the legislation is silent on the treatment of returned mail, and could create undesirable opportunities for recipients to dodge communications or impede administrative action. Officials consider that the risk of failed delivery is ameliorated by both the delivery rules (including the definition of an acceptable corporate body contact address) and the positive requirement when sending electronic communication for the Commissioner to first seek the recipient’s consent to communicate electronically (except when there are reasonable grounds to suppose the electronic communication will be received by a person, in which case the recipient’s consent will not be required). Inland Revenue will aim to always preserve integrity and confidentiality in its communications and therefore it can be expected to be responsive to failed communications even without an express legislative direction to that end. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 Issue: Legislative clarification for “received by the person” Clause 74 Submission (EY) Further clarification of whether the reference to having reasonable grounds to suppose an electronic communication will be “received by the person” test is intended to be met by apparent or assumed receipt by the named addressee, would be desirable. We suggest including an express provision that a sender holding evidence of having sent an electronic communication to a correct (or appropriately notified) address would constitute reasonable grounds for supposing the communication had been received. Comment References to communication to be “received” by a person are contained in both the Tax Administration Act 1994 (in the current provision which refers to electronic delivery of notices) as well as the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 (which governs when a communication is received). Existing case law and interpretive guidance will therefore be useful in determining whether particular communications will be treated as received. The phrase is used twice in the amendment. First, as discussed above, it is used as a qualification to the provision which allows for the Commissioner to send electronic communications without first obtaining the recipient’s consent. Secondly, it applies to electronic communications sent to addresses that are neither the electronic address provided to the sender nor the last known address. It is intended to provide addit ional protection against misdirected mail. When an electronic communication has been sent to the address provided or last known address, the communication can be treated as received. Express provision, that a sender holding evidence of having sent an electronic communication to a correct (or appropriately notified) address would constitute reasonable grounds, would therefore not be necessary if an address is “correct or appropriately notified”. When the address is only “otherwise available” and the electronic communication has not been previously consented, the reasonable grounds of receipt are still required. Officials prefer to allow for judicial interpretation of what may constitute “reasonable grounds” in particular circumstances over strict legislative criteria which may not effectively canvass all of the circumstances that could arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: Legislative clarification of what “directly alerted to” means Clause 74 Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) Further clarification of what is intended by the requirement that an addressee or intended recipient must be “directly alerted to the communication in some manner” in order to communicate on the internet or by other electronic means, would be desirable. In particular the concern here is to minimise any risk that the Commissioner can dispute the fact or validity of taxpayers’ communication with the Commissioner. It is unclear what is required for the person to be “directly alerted”; the meaning should be clarified. Comment A communication via the internet will not always alert the recipient to the receipt of the message. Examples include posting a comment on an online newspaper article or posting a blog on a webpage. To protect recipients from mail going unnoticed, this condit io n is intended to ensure that electronic communications are used only where the recipient is alerted to the receipt of the communication, for example, via email or txt message. Given the fact that the Commissioner has to consent to the receipt of electronic communicatio n by either individual agreement with a person or more generally by providing an electronic communication channel (for example, myIR secure mail), it is unlikely that the use of a communication channel which does not “directly alert” the Commissioner of receipt would be consented to. For example, the Commissioner could give consent for electronic communication via email with Inland Revenue staff directly agreeing this with the sender or through a secure contact function via the Inland Revenue website. Therefore it is difficult to envisage a circumstance where the Commissioner would be in a position to dispute the receipt of electronic communications on the basis of there being no “direct alert”. Finally, officials note that this amendment has been modelled on similar provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 which refer to the person being “directly alerted” in some manner. Officials are unaware of any concerns or disputes arising over what the phrase means within those provisions, to date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Legislative clarification of what “advising” means Clauses 103, 124, 127 and 161 Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) The term “advising” is not defined; it is suggested that where “advising” is used, that an appropriate level of category of defined term is used instead. The term “inform” is currently used in various provisions dealing with the content of documents to be provided in tax disputes, to infer that the information provided is in sufficient detail to “inform” the other party of the grounds of the proposed adjustment, for example. The Bill has replaced these references with “advise” as “inform” is a defined term under the framework. The term “advise” arguably has a different meaning to “inform” and as a result of the amendment to these sections it could be assumed that Parliament intended to change the meaning of these provisions. Therefore it should be clarified that there has been no intended change in meaning as a result of these amendments. Comment The use of the term “advising” within the amendments is intended simply to replace the term “inform” where the defined term would cause uncertainty within the context of the individual provisions. For example, where the section requires a notice providing sufficient detail to inform the recipient of the circumstance, the use of the term “inform” would appear to allow for an oral communication despite the fact that the communication is intended to be via a notice (that is, the communication must be written or electronic). The change of wording is not intended to change the meaning of the provisions, and to the extent that unintended changes have been made, officials will undertake remedial amendments as required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Consistent use of the term “provide” Clauses 92 and 201 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments replace some references to “provide” within various sections with a new defined term within the framework but not all references to “provide”. We submit that the amendments be checked for consistency with reference to the term “provide” and ensure there are no unintended omissions. Comment The term “provide” is undefined and used extensively throughout the legislation, signalling that information must be given. This set of amendments replaces the term only to ensure the 16 provisio n uses a term defined by the communications framework or to simplify the drafting (for example, replacing “provide a statement in writing” with “notify”). Officials have re-checked the use of the term “provide” in the new amendments and have not discovered any un-intended uses. To the extent that unintended changes have been made officials will undertake remedial amendments as required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Legislative clarification of difference between “notify” and “notice” Clause 74 Submission (Russell McVeagh) It is unclear how provisions of the Tax Acts that require a “notice” fit within the proposed communication framework. This should be clarified. An inference created by the amendments is that “notice” is not a derivative of “notifying”, therefore the provisions should be clarified to indicate whether “notice” is intended to form part of the new framework. Comment Officials agree that the amendments should clarify the intention to capture both “notice” and “notify” within the framework. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of cross-reference in new section 14F Clause 74 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It should be clarified that new section 14F applies only to communications delivered by personal delivery, post, fax and electronic means. As the section is presently drafted, it could arguably be interpreted to apply to both written and oral communication due to the cross-reference to new section 14B (2). 17 Comment Officials note the potential for uncertainty caused by the cross-reference and agree to a simple clarification of the intention for the section to apply, in line with its title, only to communications delivered by personal delivery, post, fax and electronic means. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor legislative drafting errors Clauses 155, 159 to 162 and 164 Submission (EY) Several minor drafting errors are described in the submission, including some which do not form part of the amendments in this Bill. The suggested amendments relate to the following sections of the Tax Administration Act: i. section 28, submission suggests that the section is missing the subject and that either including “any payer” or deleting the word “from” would resolve this issue; \[not in Bill\] ii. section 106(1C), submission suggests that the section incorrectly refers to “provides” and should be changed to “does not provide”; \[not in Bill\] iii. section 108B(1)(a), submission suggests there is no need to amend the use of the semi- colon as is provides both for situations where a further extension is agreed and where no such further extension is agreed; iv. sections 126(1); 130(1) and(2); 136(6), (12) and (14); submission suggests these amendments are not required given that the sections are either no longer operative (that is, the time limits have lapsed) or apply in retrospect; v. section 137(1)(a), submission suggests that the change from “requesting” to “seeking” is unhelpful as the term is undefined under the framework; vi. sections 137(11) and 138R(8), submission questions whether it is intended that the delivery method be limited to registered post or whether personal delivery could be used. The submitter raises one other concern with amending section 8(2E) of the Goods and Services Tax Act, as this section is no longer able to be used as the time period had lapsed. Comment Officials are grateful to the submitter for highlighting these drafting concerns and agree that clarifications of all of the sections should be made, except for the submissions referred to above at iii), v) and vi). In submission iii), officials consider the use of the colon, as short-hand for the phrase “all or any of the following”, in section 108B currently leads to confusion, as sub-paragraph (b) refers to 18 sub-paragraph (a). Therefore it is not possible to read the two sub-paragraphs as being separated by the phrase “all or any of the following” given that logically an extension of 12 months under sub-paragraph a) must first be obtained, in order for a further 6-month extension to be obtained under sub-paragraph (b). Officials consider the insertion of “and” between the two sub- paragraphs is sufficiently clear and that a 12-month period applies first and then a possible further 6 months. In submission v), officials consider that the amendment is necessary to ensure that there is no confusion caused by the requirement for this section to be satisfied with a “notice” that either requires or “requests” for the objection to be heard by the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). Inclusion of the terms “notice” and “request” within the communication framework at different levels of communication formality means that they are therefore inconsistent in this context. To ensure that the section operates as intended, requiring the objector to communicate by notice, the term “request” (which is less formal than a notice) must be amended. Officials consider that the action intended by this provision is to either require or seek a hearing before the TRA. The term “seek” does not need to be defined for the operation of this section as the desired action must be communicated via a notice, which is a defined method of communication. In submission vi), officials note that proposed new section 14D allows for both personal delivery and registered post. Therefore the proposed amendments to sections 137 (11) and 138 R(8) would allow for both methods of delivery. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 19 ACCEPTING ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES Clauses 72, 73 and 105 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The submitters support the amendment to allow for documents to be “signed” with an electronic signature. Comment Officials note submitters’ support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Commissioner’s express consent Submission (EY) The Electronic Transactions Act requires that the recipient consents to receiving the electronic signature. While it may be arguable that such consent is implicit in the legislation or should be able to be inferred from the Commissioner’s general conduct, we consider express statutory provision to that effect would be desirable. Comment This amendment is intended to provide the necessary consent for the use of valid electronic signatures on information provided to the Commissioner for taxpayers who comply with the Commissioner’s published guidelines. The guidelines will set out the criteria and technical requirements for the use of valid signatures as well as the nature of, and circumstances in which, the Commissioner accepts information under an electronic signature. Once developed, the guidelines will provide the detail of the circumstances in which electronic signature use is expressly consented to by the Commissioner. The criteria will be set by the Commissioner fo llo wing consultation with interested parties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 Issue: Legislation should cover more than just electronic signatures Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Other unique identifiers such as encryption keys and biometric signatures should be accepted as a means of validating documents. This change needs to be future-proofed so that forms of consent (digital signatures) are also acceptable once the appropriate technology has been designed and tested. The proposal should be future-proofed to accommodate fast evolving communications technology. Comment The proposal is intended to be flexible to allow for the Commissioner to respond to new technologies. For this reason the proposed new section does not list all of the acceptable technologies or ways in which the technologies can be used; this detail will be covered in the guidelines. The term “electronic signature” is defined in the Electronic Transactions Act as a method used to identify a person and to indicate that person’s approval of that information. This definition is very broad and therefore electronic signatures can arguably range from a name typed into a document, a pin number, the ticking of an internet check box or even a scanned image of a hand-written signature. The combination of the broad definition of “electronic signature” and the requirement for guidelines, will allow the Commissioner to approve the use of new technologies and to accept the use of new forms of electronic consent, by adding to the guidelines without the need for further legislative change. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Express reference to “income tax” and “GST returns” under electronic signature Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) For the purposes of removing doubt, explicit provision should be made for taxpayers to file income tax and GST returns under electronic signature. Comment As stated in the Commentary to the Bill, because of the legal significance of a signature it is important that the use of electronic signatures is secure and reliable for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. To ensure that the necessary processes and systems requirements have been developed to allow for the secure and reliable use of electronic signatures it is important to phase in their use across the variety of communications received by the Commissioner. Therefore the proposed new section provides the over-arching consent for the use of electronic signatures and the guidance will provide the necessary detail as to which communications (for example, income tax or GST returns) and which technologies will be acceptable over time. To include some communications explicitly in the proposed new section with others allowed in the 21 guidelines could result in confusion and uncertainty. Furthermore, the explicit inclusion of some communications undermines the desired flexibility of this section, which aims to future- proof the legislation. If technologies change or tax administration changes there could be a need to reconsider the specific inclusion of these communications, which could require further legislative changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 Employee share schemes 23 24 OVERVIEW Clauses 2(3), 52 to 54, 109, 204 and 222 Changes are proposed to the general PAYE collection rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 to improve the collection of tax on benefits received as employment income under an employee share purchase agreement. Share purchase agreements in this context are often referred to as “employee share schemes”. The changes proposed in the Bill: • allow employers to choose to withhold tax using the PAYE rules on any employment income an employee receives under a share scheme; and • require employers to disclose the tax value of any benefits an employee receives under a share scheme using the employer monthly schedule. This requirement applies to employers who choose not to withhold tax using the PAYE rules. Submitters support the first change, subject to some modifications regarding scope and the timing when income information is supplied to Inland Revenue. Submitters do not support the requirement to disclose the tax value of any benefit an employee receives under an employee share scheme. Submissions note that the requirement to use the employer monthly schedule to disclose the value of employee share scheme benefits will generate additional and unnecessary reconciliation work for employers. They are concerned that Inland Revenue’s employer monthly schedule is not sufficiently sophisticated to deal with situations when amounts withheld under the PAYE rules do not reconcile with income. Submitters expect that Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme will result in better systems which can deal with these computation issues. Submitters also made technical comments about the amendments and their interaction with the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the Holidays Act 2003. In response to submissions, officials are making the following recommendations that would modify the proposal in the Bill: • Large employers will for the most part be able to shift the recognition of benefits under an employee share scheme to the pay-period immediately following the purchase of shares or exercise of an option. The timing shift is to allow large employers sufficient time to compile information to support the required disclosures in the employer monthly schedule. A similar change is not required for other employers as they do not face the same time pressures to meet the statutory filing dates for the employer monthly schedule under the Tax Administration Act 1994. • The obligation on employers to disclose the value of employee share benefits (when a decision is made not to withhold tax under the PAYE rules) is scaled back. The obligation to disclose will not apply in the following circumstances: - when an employee or an associate of the employee sells share rights to a non- associated third party; - when the share benefit arises from a “Commissioner approved” employee share purchase scheme; and 25 - when share benefits are provided to a former employee. • The decision to withhold tax under the PAYE rules will not be irrevocable. The decision to withhold tax can be exercised on a per employee basis. Officials note that in situations when tax is not withheld, Inland Revenue will still receive income information about the emplo yee via the emplo yer monthly schedule. Minor changes and drafting clarifications are also proposed, including an amendment to the Accident Compensation Act 2001. Effect of the recommendations Under current law (the status quo), employees are responsible for disclosing the value of share benefits received under an employee share scheme and paying tax on those benefits. The Income Tax Act treats the employee as receiving employment income in the following situations: • when the employee acquires shares – section CE 2(2); • when the employee disposes of rights to acquire shares to non-associates – section CE 2(3); • when an associate of the employee acquires shares – section CE 2(4); and • when an associate disposes of rights to acquire shares to non-associates – section CE 2(5). The proposal in the Bill shifts the obligation to disclose the value of employee share scheme benefits from the employee to the employer and allows the employer the option to withhold tax on benefits that are deemed to arise under section CE 2(2) and (4). Employees remain responsible for declaring and paying tax on income arising under sections CE 2(3) and (5) – the current treatment. The employee is also responsible for paying tax on income arising under section CE 2(2) and (4) if the employer chooses not to withhold tax (as under the current rules). 26 The range of outcomes is illustrated in the table below: When income arises Current treatment Proposed outcome When the employee acquires shares. Employee must declare income and pay tax. (i) Employer declares income for current employees. (ii) Employer may choose to withhold tax. (iii) Employee must pay tax if (ii) does not apply. (iv) Former employees must declare and pay tax unless (ii) applies. When employee disposes of rights to acquire shares to non- associates. Employee must declare income and pay tax. Employee must declare income and pay tax. When an associate of the employee acquires shares. Employee must declare income and pay tax. (i) Employer declares income for current employees. (ii) Employer may choose to withhold tax. (iii) Employee must pay tax if (ii) does not apply. (iv) Former employees must declare and pay tax unless (ii) applies. When an associate disposes of rights to acquire shares to non- associates. Employee must declare income and pay tax. Employee must declare income and pay tax. 27 SIMPLIFYING THE COLLECTION OF TAX ON EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES No clause Issue: Wider review of the tax treatment of employee share schemes needed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) A review of the substantive taxation of employee share schemes and the wider policy settings for employee share schemes and employee option schemes should be given priority. Comment A review of the taxation of benefits under an employee share/option scheme is on the Government’s tax policy work programme. A consultation document about the review is expected to be released in 2016. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for proposed change Clauses 2(3), 52 to 54, 109, 204 and 222 Submissions (ANZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Covisory Partners, EY, New Zealand Law Society) The submitters support the proposal to allow employers to choose to withhold tax using the PAYE system on any employment income employees receive under a share purchase agreement. (All submitters) The submitter supports the requirement that employers disclose using the employer monthly schedule the value of the benefits employees receive under an employee share agreement. (Covisory Partners) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 28 Issue: Alternative method of withholding should be considered Submission (KPMG) The submitter supports the idea of withholding tax on employee share scheme benefits but considers a better approach is for tax to be withheld using the schedular withholding payments system. Comment Alternative methods of collecting tax, including a schedular withholding system, on employment income received in the form of an employee share benefit were considered during the policy development of the proposal in this Bill. Schedular withholding uses the same collection mechanics as the proposal in the Bill. The amount of tax collected is based on a flat rate, which can result in either under- or over-taxation. The proposal in the Bill ensures that the amount of tax withheld, if the employer chooses to do so, is at a rate that aligns with the emplo yee’s marginal tax rate. Submissions received on the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes were mostly of the view that the PAYE system should be used to withhold tax because any new withholding system would require new compliance systems. Other submitters on the issues paper did not see the case for duplicating compliance costs under a new withholding system when the PAYE system could be used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: PAYE reporting and timeframes Clauses 52 to 54 and 109 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG – verbal endorsement) A longer time-period is needed for making the required disclosures than those allowed under the PAYE rules, especially for employers whose PAYE obligations exceed $500,000. (EY) A longer time-period for making the required disclosures should be provided. In some circumstances it will be difficult for employers to meet the normal PAYE reporting dates because of delays in receiving the necessary information from overseas parent companies, share registry firms or former emplo yees. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 29 Comment Every month employers provide information to Inland Revenue in the employer monthly schedule about PAYE and related deductions made during the previous month. Large emplo yers, that is, those with more than $500,000 a year of PAYE withholding (including employer superannuation contribution tax – ESCT) must provide the emplo yer monthly schedule by the 5 th of the month following that in which they withheld tax. Large employers, in addition to the preparation of the employer monthly schedule by the 5 th of the month, are also required to pay to Inland Revenue any tax withheld under the PAYE rules according to the following schedule: • For pay-periods between the 1 st and the 15 th of the month, amounts withheld must be paid on the 20 th of the month. • For pay-periods between the 16 th and the end of the month, amounts withheld must be paid by the 5 th of the following month. The payment information for the pay-periods in that month are reconciled in the employer monthly schedule filed with Inland Revenue on the 5 th of the following month. Employers with less than $500,000 in PAYE or ESCT must provide this information along with the payment of any withheld amounts by the 20 th of the month following the month in which tax is withheld. Submissions have noted that large employers are likely to find it very difficult to meet the statutory reporting timeframe of the 5 th of the following month to provide Inland Revenue with an employer monthly schedule containing the necessary disclosures about any benefits an employee receives under an employee share scheme. Problems facing employers include: • receiving the necessary share information from third-party share registries; • obtaining the requisite information about the value of the share benefit vested in an emplo yee; • if the employee is a member of a global share purchase agreement, dealing with the non- resident parent company or trustee responsible for managing the employee share scheme; • obtaining relevant information if the share benefit is received by a former employee that is still a party to the employee share scheme provided by the employer. Submitters note these problems would be particularly acute for large employers if the share benefit accrues on the last few days of the preceding month when the employer monthly schedule is due on the 5 th . A similar problem does not arise for other employers with PAYE obligations as the employer monthly schedule is required on a later date, being the 20 th of the following month. These filing dates are deeply embedded in Inland Revenue’s IT systems and drive a number of administrative processes and actions, including returns management, assessments, payment processing, penalties and filing reminders. Any change to the dates would therefore best be implemented following Inland Revenue’s transition to new technology and systems. Currently, employment income arises in the income year when the employee purchases shares or exercises an option. This transaction would, in the absence of any change to the current 30 proposal in the Bill, be disclosed by the employer in the pay-period when the transaction occurred and, if the employer elects, PAYE would be withheld. To provide large employers with additional time to compile the necessary information, given system constraints, officials recommend a new rule that shifts (for the purposes of the proposal in this Bill only) the point in time when employment income is recognised under an employee share scheme. The timing rule would apply to employees of a large employer only. Under the new rule, this income would be shifted to the next payment return period, as illustrated in the diagram below: Explanation of ESS transactions in the diagram above: • An employee share scheme benefit arising on 4 March would be attributed to the next pay-period. This means that if the employer chooses to withhold tax, it would be payable for the PAYE payment on 5 April and disclosed in the employer monthly schedule of the same date. • An employee share scheme benefit arising on 30 March would be attributed to the next pay-period. If the employer choses to withhold tax, it would be payable for the PAYE payment on 20 April and disclosed in the employer monthly schedule on 5 May. • An employee share scheme benefit arising on 13 April would be attributed to the next pay-period. If the employer chooses to withhold tax, it would payable for the PAYE payment on 5 May and disclosed in the employer monthly schedule of the same date. • An employee share scheme benefit arising on 18 April would be attributed to the next pay-period. If the employer choses to withhold tax, it would be payable for the PAYE payment on 20 May and disclosed in the employer monthly schedule on 5 June. The implications of this new rule are as follows: • Income shifted from the first half of the month until the second half of the same month would be reported in the employer monthly schedule for that month. • Income shifted from the second half of the month to the first half of the following month would be reported in the employer monthly schedule for that following month. • In the year of introduction, a one-off and unquantifiable timing deferral may be created with some employee share benefits recognised in the next income year.

For some employees, this one-year income deferral could affect their child support or student loan obligations or Working for Families entitlements. Inland Revenue will investigate instances where employees seek to exploit for personal advantage the deferred recognition of income for share benefits provided between 16 and 31 March if those share benefits are provided out of pattern with previous years or the decision to acquire shares is out of step with market conditions. Shifting the point when income is recognised would give large employers the benefit of additional time (minimum 20 days) 1 to compile the necessary information to be disclosed in the emplo yer monthly schedule. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act should be modified to allow large employers to disclose the value of an employee share scheme benefit received by an employee in the payment return period immediately following the pay-period in which the benefit vests in the employee. The practical implications of this recommendation for large employers will be explained in the Tax Information Bulletin following enact ment. Issue: Ability to correct returns Submission (EY) The current PAYE rules do not provide any flexibility to correct any income variations in later employer monthly schedule/PAYE returns. If adjustments are necessary, the employer must amend their previously filed employer monthly schedule/PAYE return. Comment Inland Revenue’s current technology platform cannot presently provide the flexibility recommended by the submitter. This issue is considered in policy proposals set out in Better Administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document, which was released for public comment in November 2015. Officials note, however, that the recommended change to shift the recognit io n of emplo yee share scheme benefits to the next payment return period should go some way towards reducing the need to make adjustments to previously filed employer monthly schedules/PAYE returns. 1 Assumes a benefit vesting on the 15 th of the month is not reported in the employer monthly schedule for the 5 th of the following month and included in the payment return period of the same date. A longer period (up to 35 days) exists for benefits that vest on the last day of a month, which would not be reported in the employer monthly schedule of the 5 th of the second following month. That benefit would, however, be included in the payment return period of the 20 th of the following month. 32 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Scope of the proposals Clauses 52 to 54 and 109 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Simpson Grierson) A number of submitters have sought clarification about the scope of the proposal and in what situations the rules have application. • The proposal should apply to situations when the employer is not a direct party to the arrangement, for example, in the case of multinational groups with New Zealand subsidiaries or branches. (EY) • The proposal should apply to share option plans. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • The proposal should not apply to situations where the employer cannot be reasonably expected to have knowledge of the transaction – such as the employee selling their rights to another person. (Simpson Grierson) Comment As drafted, the proposal in the Bill has application to employment income that is treated as arising in the situations described in section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act. Section CE 2 treats employees as receiving employment income from an employee share scheme in the following four situations: • when the employee acquires shares – section CE 2(2); • when the employee disposes of rights to acquire shares to non-associates – section CE 2(3); • when an associate of the employee acquires shares – section CE 2(4); and • when an associate disposes of rights to acquire shares to non-associates – section CE 2(5). Sections CE 2(3) to (5) act as specific anti-avoidance rules to support the main rule in section CE 2(2) and ensure that employment income is attributed to the employee in situations when the employee sells the option to acquire shares to another person. Share acquisition under sections CE 2(2) and (4) are on the basis of a contractual understanding between the employer (or, as noted by EY, the employer’s parent company or trust connected with the employer) and the employee. The rules also apply to schemes where the employee can exercise an option to acquire shares as noted by the Corporate Taxpayers Group. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the employer would have sufficient information to disclose the value of the share benefit and if the employer so chooses, to withhold tax on the benefit. 33 The submission from Simpson Grierson notes that employment income arises when an employee sells their rights to shares to a third party (section CE 2(3)) or an associate of the employee sells rights to a third party (section CE 2(5)). The employer would in all probability be unaware of the transaction and officials agree the appropriate outcome would be for the emplo yee to remain liable to declare and pay tax on any income from the transaction. Officials are also recommending in response to submissions other changes to clause 109 (new section 46(6B) of the Tax Administration Act) as previously discussed, which affect employers’ obligations to disclose information about employment income an employee or former employee receives under an employee share scheme. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. The proposal in the Bill applies to employee share schemes where the employer is not a direct party to the arrangement and to share option plans. Section RD 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act and section 46(6) of the Tax Administration Act should also be amended to confirm that employment income arising from an employee disposing of their rights to shares under a share purchase agreement to a non- associated third party are outside the scope of the new rules. The employer remains obligated to disclose employee share benefits (and, if the employer chooses, withhold tax) received by the employee as a result of shares acquired by an associate (for example, in situations when section CE 2(4) applies). Issue: Employees should be able to request their employer to withhold tax on any employment income No clause Submission (Covisory Partners) Employees should be able to request their employers to withhold tax on employment income received under an employee share scheme. This gives the employee and the employer the option of having PAYE deducted and provides good symmetry and fairness. Comment Submissions received on the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes noted that applying the PAYE rules to withhold tax on employment income benefits received by employees under a share purchase agreement imposes additional costs on employers. More importantly, submissions on the issues paper from employers strongly argued that not all share purchase agreements could accommodate a requirement to collect tax without substantial changes to the terms and conditions of the employee share scheme offer. In response to these arguments the Government agreed that the proposed rules should apply at the emplo yer’s elect ion. Employees can request their employers withhold tax on employment income, but the employer should not be compelled to comply and should retain the final word as provided for under the Bill. 34 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Irrevocable election to withhold Clause 54 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) The election should not be irrevocable. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The election should be reflected in the amendments. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) An irrevocable election creates significant inflexibility for employers. (KPMG) There need to be mechanisms in place to allow employers to “try out” new rules and apply the withho lding rules to some emplo yees and not others (such as former emplo yees). (KPMG) Comment Officials expect that employers should only elect to withhold tax if, after proper consideration and appropriate tax advice, it makes sense for the employer to do so taking into account the features of the employee share scheme and the nature of the benefits provided. The irrevocable election is intended to provide certainty for employees and payroll intermediaries about the employer’s decision to use the new rules. It is also intended to prevent employers from “cherry picking” between income years or pay-periods. However, recognising that the disclosure requirement that complements the employer’s choice about withholding tax under the PAYE rules and the comments in submissions about the impractical nature of making any choice irrevocable, officials agree the Bill should not specify that elect ions to withho ld tax on emplo yee share benefits be irrevocable. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. The election should not be irrevocable. New section RD 7B should apply on a per employee basis. 35 Issue: Objection to the requirement to disclose information when employer chooses not to withhold Clause 109 Submission (ANZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) Submitters recognise there is a trade-off for choosing not to withhold tax at source on emplo yee share benefits. Providing the information required will be onerous for some employers. (All submitters) The disclosure requirements should be deferred until Inland Revenue’s technology systems are redesigned (under Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme). (All submitters) Submitters have also raised the following additional specific concerns with the disclosure requirement: • The disclosure should not be made as part of the employer monthly schedule (ANZ) and the method of disclosure should be reconsidered. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • Employers should not be required to disclose the value of any benefit received by an emplo yee. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • The disclosure should be on an annual basis. (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group) • Internationally mobile employees should not be included in the disclosure. (ANZ) Comment The trade-off for allowing employers to choose whether to withhold tax on employment income employees receive under a share purchase plan is a requirement that employers that choose not to withhold declare the value of such benefits in their employer monthly schedule. Disclosing this information in this format allows Inland Revenue to capture information about employees’ income and assists with prepopulating relevant employees’ statement of earnings. The submission from Covisory Partners supported the disclosure requirement. Information collected through the employer monthly schedule assists Inland Revenue with determining an employee’s tax compliance and correct social policy obligations, such as child support and student loans, and Working for Families entitlements. The disclosure is intended to improve Inland Revenue’s knowledge about the amount of employment income derived from employee share schemes, and improve taxpayer compliance generally. The proposed means of obtaining this information, using existing data points in the employer monthly schedule, will provide Inland Revenue with the information needed to administer the collection of tax on employee share scheme benefits. The information can be captured in a timely and administratively effective manner without any impact on Inland Revenue’s existing technology platform. Alternative methods of collecting information about employee share scheme benefits, such as annual returns or a letter from the employer setting out the names and tax file of employees receiving a share benefit do not provide the same efficiencies. 36 Currently, the responsibility for compliance is borne by the employee, and this can affect voluntary compliance. Officials recognise that for the majority of employers, the allotment of benefits under an employee share scheme will sit outside the employer’s payroll system. Such benefits are, however, either a feature of the employee’s remuneration agreement or other benefit available to the employee through their employment. The employer should therefore have existing systems in place to ensure they meet any contractual obligations under the employee share scheme, including making adequate enquiries if associates are able to acquire shares under the employee share scheme. New tax compliance systems will need to be developed to capture any necessary information such as the employee’s name, tax file number and the tax value of any share scheme benefit to ensure that it can be included when the employer’s payroll is compiled. The application date of 1 April 2017 for the proposed changes was set recognising that employers and payroll intermediaries would have to develop new compliance systems to meet the new disclosure requirements. International employees have the same tax obligations as resident employees if their income is subject to New Zealand income tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Employers should not be responsible for disclosing employee share benefits arising from Commissioner-approved share purchase schemes Clause 109 Submission (ANZ) Benefits received under a share purchase scheme that is approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be excluded from the disclosure requirements. Comment The tax value of any share benefits an employee accrues under a share purchase scheme that is approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is specified to be zero under section CE 2(7) of the Income Tax Act. This rule relates to schemes meeting the requirements of sections DC 13 and DC 14. As the benefit from these schemes under the Income Tax Act is zero, requiring employers to disclose the value of benefits received under a Commissioner of Inland Revenue- approved scheme is arguably o f litt le benefit. The employer monthly schedule would not yield any meaningful information about the participants in these share purchase schemes. 37 Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Employee share benefits received under a Commissioner of Inland Revenue-approved share purchase scheme meeting the requirements of sections DC 13 and DC 14 are not required to be reported in the employer’s emplo yer monthly schedule. Issue: Employers should not be responsible for disclosing information about employee share benefits received by former employees Clause 109 Submission (ANZ) Employers should not be obligated to disclose information about employee share benefits received by former emplo yees. Comments Unless the employer chooses to withhold tax on any employee share benefit received by a former employee and has appropriate compliance systems in place, the obligation to disclose employee share benefits received by a former employee should not apply. Officials recognise that with former employees, employers would likely incur higher costs to access and maintain the necessary information needed to meet any disclosure requirement as the employment relationship has ended. It would also be practically more difficult for employers to make adequate enquiries about the acquisition of shares by an associate of the former employer under the employee share scheme. If the employer chooses not to withhold tax, former employees would remain liable to declare and pay tax on any income from employment income from an employee share scheme. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. New section 46(6B) should not apply to employers in connection with employee share benefits received by former emplo yees. 38 Issue: Interaction with the Accident Compensation Act Clause 222 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Matters raised by officials) The consequential change to the Accident Compensation Act 2001 does not appear to be effective in excluding employee share benefits from “earnings as an employee”. Comment Changing the method of collecting tax on employee share benefits using the PAYE rules is not intended to alter employees’ current obligations under the Accident Compensation Act. The amendment as contained in the Bill is not effective in achieving this outcome. The amendment to the Accident Compensation Act is intended to preserve the status quo in that employee share benefits are not considered as PAYE income payments when determining an emplo yee’s earner’s levy liabilit y. Following discussions with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Accident Compensation Corporation, officials recommend the consequential change in the Bill to the Accident Compensation Act be replaced by a new provision that ensures that any emplo yee share benefit arising under the Income Tax Act is not counted as “earnings of any emplo yee”. A further change is also recommended by officials so that earnings of an employee-shareholder, as defined in the Accident Compensation Act, exclude amounts of benefits received under an employee share scheme that are subject to withholding under the PAYE rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The Accident Compensation Act 2001 should be consequentially amended so that employment income arising under section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act and has tax withheld under section RD 7B is not included in “earnings of any employee” or “earnings as a shareholder employee”. Issue: Interaction with the Holidays Act Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) It should be confirmed that employee share scheme benefits are excluded from holiday pay calculations under the Holidays Act 2003. 39 Comment Shifting the tax collection point to the source of a benefit received under an employee share scheme does not directly impact on the employee entitlements under the Holidays Act. Entitlements under the Holidays Act are based on the employee’s agreed remuneration package (in accordance with the Holidays Act), not the tax treatment of such benefits. The decision by employers to treat a benefit under an employee share scheme as an “extra pay” does not change whether this is gross earnings or ordinary earnings/average weekly earnings for the purposes of the Holidays Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting matters Clauses 52 to 54 and 109 Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) Given that the proposed amendments relate to the PAYE treatment of employee benefits, it is more appropriate to refer to the rules applying to “tax years” rather than “income years”. (EY) An amendment is required to make it clear that only an employee share scheme for which employers choose to withhold and pay tax on the employees’ behalf is treated as an “extra pay” under the Income Tax Act. As drafted, the rules are circular in effect and this should be removed to give taxpayer certainty. (All submitters) Comment Officials consider the reference to “income year” is the better term as it covers a wider set of financial year circumstances. It also aligns with recognition and timing of income in section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act. Officials will take into account submitters’ useful comments and suggestions on the circular operation of the new rules, and where appropriate, they have been incorporated into the proposed amendments to the Bill arising from the changes recommended in this report. Recommendations That the submission on using the term “tax year” be declined. That the submissions on circularity be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 40 Issue: Application date – validation of earlier tax positions Clauses 2(3), 52 to 54, 109, 204 and 222 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Cases where PAYE has been deducted by employers in earlier income years should be retrospectively validated, or alternatively, a “savings” clause should be included. Comment The genesis for the proposals in this Bill was an approach from some employers to use the PAYE system to return tax on their employees’ behalf. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 54 should apply for earlier income years to employers that have taken a tax position on the assumption that tax on an employee’s share benefit can be withheld under the PAYE system. Issue: Amnesty for past non-compliance Submission (KPMG) An amnesty is recommended to allow benefits from an employee share scheme in earlier income years to be returned as income in either the 2016 or 2017 income year’s tax returns without incurring penalties or use-of-money interest. Comment Taxpayers have an obligation to comply with the tax rules for benefits received under an employee share scheme. The treatment of such benefits as employment income has been a longstanding feature of the tax system. Anecdotally, documentation associated with the scheme usually describes an employee’s tax obligations in respect of the benefit provided. For these schemes, employees are aware of their tax obligations, although this may not directly transfer to tax compliance. An amnesty would be unfair on those employees who have to date complied, and filed and paid tax on employment income received under an employee share scheme. Officials note that penalties are generally reduced for voluntary disclosures. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: Consequential matters Submission (KPMG) The submitter seeks clarity on the following matters: • Existing share purchase agreements may not legally allow the employer to reduce the share benefit for the employee’s tax liability. This would result in the employer needing to fund the tax through a “gross-up”, effectively increasing the value of the benefit. • The recipient of shares provided under an employee share scheme may be subject to a “blackout” period in which they are not able to dispose of the shares to cover the tax liability. The time when income is earned under the Income Tax Act should be deferred in these circumstances. Comment Officials agree with the submitter that taxation at source requires the employer to fund the tax liability arising on the employee share scheme benefit. The simplest way to do this is for the employer to sell a portion of the employee’s shares to cover the tax. Alternatively, the employer may gross up the payment using cash to meet the employee’s tax liability. This alternative would increase the cost on the employer for providing the employee share scheme benefit. The submitter seeks an amendment that would treat the payment of tax as meeting the employer’s obligations under the scheme. The voluntary nature of the rules means that officials consider it is a matter that is best left for the employer and employee to agree as to the impact the collection of tax has on the quantum of emplo yee share benefit s. The submitter’s comparison wit h co mpulsory emplo yer superannuation contribution tax is not valid because the substantive taxation rules for employee share schemes are not being changed. Officials recognise that our view may limit the initial take up of the PAYE rules as a means of ensuring employees meet their tax obligations to new schemes or existing schemes that permit the employer to sell shares on the employee’s behalf. The second matter relating to “blackout” periods is an example of when taxation at source is problematic for non-cash employment income. Blackout periods would prevent the employer from selling shares to meet the employee’s tax liability. Again, the voluntary nature of the rules would suggest that if blackout periods are likely to be a practical compliance problem for the employer, they should not elect to withhold tax on the employee’s behalf. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 Issue: Does the sale of shares to meet tax obligations mean that all the shares vested in the employee are held on revenue account? Submission (KPMG) Selling shares to meet tax obligations could be considered trading and the remaining shares could be treated as revenue account property. A specific legislative exclusion is needed to eliminate this outcome. Comment The sale of shares to meet employees’ tax obligations under the PAYE rules should not create a different outcome from the situation if the employee was to sell the shares themselves to meet a tax obligation. If the shares vested in the employee were held on capital account, then officials agree, in principle, that any share disposal to meet tax obligations (independent of whether tax is withheld under PAYE) should not “taint” the remaining shares. Given the possible matrix of facts that could apply to an employee and their intentions about the shares received under an employee share scheme, officials consider that a specific legislative exclusion is not appropriate. Instead, officials will provide guidance on this question as part of the Tax Information Bulletin item explaining these changes following enactment of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 44 Information sharing 45 46 RELEASE OF GENERAL INFORMATION Clause 117(3) Submissions (Office of the Privacy Commissioner, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Three submitters expressed their general support for the proposals. We support the Commissioner releasing general information without the approval of the Minister of Finance, as long as the information does not identify any taxpayer. (KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The use of de-identified and statistical information to increase the transparency of government processes is supported. The proposed amendment to enable decisions on the release of information in this context to be made by the Department, rather than requiring Ministerial approval, is a pragmatic approach to facilitate the release of information when it is desirable to do so. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 47 ENFORCEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS Clauses 117(2) and (6) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Three submitters expressed general support for the proposals to share information with other agencies, such as the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and with WorkSafe for the enforcement of employment standards. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner also commented that it considers the threshold introduced in clause 117(2) that requires the Commissioner to consider that “the disclosure is reasonably necessary” to support a legislative function, as proposed for the new section 81(4)(ec) of the Tax Administration Act, is a sufficient safeguard to ensure the exchange of personal information will be appropriately constrained to support the purpose intended. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proposal should be reconsidered Submission (EY) The proposal is not necessarily in the best interests of fostering voluntary compliance and disclosure, for tax purposes, by taxpayers. The proposal should be reconsidered. Comment Officials agree that voluntary compliance is an important consideration. There are times when carrying out a function in relation to workplace legislation that wage and time records are absent, inaccurate or falsified. Using Inland Revenue records will support the goal of facilitating the enforcement of employment standards. Inland Revenue records should enable labour inspectors to identify and proceed against a breach. 48 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Further safeguards needed Submission (KPMG) The proposal should be subject to the same safeguards over the storage and use of taxpayer- secret information, and sanctions for non-compliance, that apply to Inland Revenue, applying to the relevant agencies (and their officers). Comment There will be safeguards in place over the storage and use of the information shared. For example, information can only be shared for specific purposes and the information can only be used for that purpose, the information must be stored appropriately by the other agency and only accessible by relevant people in the other agency (not by all staff). In addition, shared information is part of a public record and therefore the Public Records Act 2005 applies. The receiving agency must comply by having appropriate storage and disposal procedures in place. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 49 SHARING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION Clause 117(5) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Three submitters support the amendment to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the sharing of biometric information with the Ministry of Social Development. Comment Officials note the submitters’ support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Should the proposed amendment be limited to the Ministry of Social Development? Submission (KPMG) The proposal, as set out in the Commentary to the Bill, is limited to the sharing of voiceprint data with the Ministry of Social Development. However, draft section 81(4)(nb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 appears to allow voiceprint sharing with any “public sector agency”. It is unclear what is actually intended here. Comment Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development are looking at a pilot to determine whether Inland Revenue’s biometric information can be used to identify and verify callers to the Ministry. The legislation is wider than required for the pilot to ensure that if the pilot is successful, the use of Inland Revenue’s voiceprint data can be extended to other government agencies – that is, the intention is to future-proof the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 50 Issue: The giving of consent Submission (KPMG) The draft legislation (proposed section 81(4)(nb)(iv)) requires the Commissioner to seek approval from a taxpayer to exchange biometric information with other Government agencies. It is not clear, practically, how Inland Revenue will attempt to seek consent. We also believe it may be useful for the legislation to allow the other agency (the Ministry of Social Development) to seek consent from the taxpayer, on Inland Revenue’s behalf, if this is an easier option. Comment Officials agree with the submission and consider that the legislation should be clarified and consent obtained by the other agency (for the pilot this would be the Ministry of Social Development). Administratively, this would be a much simpler option. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Extending the types of biometric information Submission (KPMG) Limiting the type of biometric information to be exchanged to the “voice of the person” seems short-sighted. Biometric information encompasses a range of potential identifiers. Consideration should be given to the reasons for limiting the type of biometric information that might be exchanged. This is particularly relevant as electronic communication increases and video as well as voice communication becomes more prevalent. Comment Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 creates an obligation of secrecy for officers of Inland Revenue. However, under section 81(4), there is a list of circumstances in which this obligation has been removed. This provision relates to the sharing of information that Inland Revenue holds, rather than receives. At this stage the only biometric information that Inland Revenue collects relates to voice. Officials consider that at this stage the proposed amendment should be limited to voice biometric information only. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 52 KiwiSaver membership 53 54 IMPACT OF SUBSEQUENT “CONSCIOUS CHOICE” Clauses 205 to 211 Submission (ANZ) We support the amendment to allow minors who have been incorrectly enrolled to opt out should they wish to. We do however propose that the amendments specify that the opt out criteria for minors will not apply if the member has made a conscious decision about their choice of KiwiSaver provider or fund. Comment Minors who have been incorrectly enrolled by their employer but who have, either with the consent of their guardians (if still a minor) or independently (if over the age of 18), subsequently contracted directly with a provider should not be able to opt out under this proposal. This later action should serve to validate their earlier incorrect enrolment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. 55 LIMITING OPT OUTS TO EMPLOYMENT ENROLMENTS ONLY Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We submit that “incorrectly enrolled” should be defined so it occurs only in an employment situation and would not include an enrolment of a minor by a parent or guardian prior to the minor’s emplo yment. Comment New section 59CB only applies to taxpayers who have been incorrectly enrolled due to an error in the application of the automatic enrolment rules, or who have incorrectly been allowed to “opt in” via their employer. It does not allow opt outs in relation to enrolments made on behalf of a minor by their parent or guardian. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 DRAFTING ERROR Clause 205 Submission (EY) The automatic enrolment criteria proposed new section 10 are cumulative. An automatic enrolment will be treated as a “mistaken” enrolment if any one or more of those criteria is not met. As drafted, however, the proposed new section 59A(b)(i) would appear to treat an automatic enrolment as a mistaken enrolment only if there was a failure to meet all three criteria listed. We therefore suggest the wording be revised. Comment The drafting achieves the correct result. New section 59A(b)(i) says that a person who fails to meet the requirements of section 10(a), (b) and (c)(iii) may be treated as “mistakenly” enrolled. If a person failed any one of those three requirements, they would pass the test in section 59A(b)(i). Officials accept, however, that the clause could be made clearer and will redraft to this effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 57 KIWISAVER – MEMBER TAX CREDIT INFORMATION Clause 213 Issue: Privacy protocols Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) support allowing the Commissioner and KiwiSaver fund providers to share information for account maintenance purposes only. Nevertheless, CAANZ has also suggested that: • KiwiSaver providers should be asked to sign a protocol agreeing to use information only for account maintenance purposes before the information is released by Inland Revenue; and • KiwiSaver members should be asked to tick a box if they are happy for their details to be shared with other KiwiSaver providers. Comment KiwiSaver fund providers have all entered into a Scheme Provider Agreement with the Commissioner prior to registering their KiwiSaver scheme with the Financial Markets Authority. That agreement includes a contractual restriction on the use of member/taxpayer information. Accordingly, it does not appear that the addition of a new privacy protocol would add anything further to that restriction as fund providers already receive information about KiwiSaver members, which can only be used for KiwiSaver administration purposes. We disagree with the suggestion that a tick box should be used by KiwiSaver members to provide consent for member tax credit information about them to be shared with other KiwiSaver providers. This is because there are already sufficient exceptions to the privacy requirements, including that an agency can share the information concerned to allow Inland Revenue to maintain the Inland Revenue Acts, and to protect the public revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 Issue: Information sharing requirements Submission (ANZ) ANZ has expressed general support for the proposal which enables the sharing of more information between the Commissioner and KiwiSaver providers. However, ANZ has also said that: • The Bill will likely necessitate changes to its IT systems in order to meet the proposed information sharing requirements. ANZ therefore welcomes discussion with officials on what the additional information sharing requirements will look like from a technology perspective; and • New section 220B(1)(c)(v) should be redrafted to specifically state what member tax credit information will be shared. A possible drafting solution is to use the same wording in section 56(3)(c)(vi) of the KiwiSaver Act to achieve this. Comment With regard to the point about ANZ’s expected IT systems changes as a result of the proposal, officials consider that this is a question of administration, not of potential amendment to legislation. Accordingly, the KiwiSaver Act does not prescribe the mechanism for any information sharing, and there appears to be no reason for prescribing such a mechanism in this case by way of an amendment to the rules. Officials consider that the second suggestion to specify what member tax credit informat ion could be shared, would give rise to systems changes and therefore cost implications for KiwiSaver fund providers. If fund providers are able to participate in terms of being able to transfer certain member tax credit information from old providers to new providers they will be able to do so by virtue of new section 220B(1)(c)(v) as proposed under the Bill. Nevertheless, officials are happy to work with KiwiSaver fund providers regarding the additional time they may need to implement system changes that are expected to arise out of the proposed information sharing requirements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the submission should be noted to the extent that if any KiwiSaver fund provider requires additional time to implement system changes, officials will work with them in that regard. 59 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (KPMG, Office of the Privacy Commissioner, ANZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Four submitters expressed their general support for the proposal which enables the sharing of more information between the Commissioner and KiwiSaver providers to support the administration of the KiwiSaver Scheme. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 60 Other policy matters 61 62 FIF EXEMPTION SIMPLIFICATION FOR ASX Clause 35 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Covisory Partners, KPMG) The submitters were supportive of the amendment, describing it as sensible. Making the exemption applicable to all entities listed on the ASX would greatly reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and provide greater clarity and certainty. This proposal will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers from having to determine whether an Australian investment is included on an approved index or not. Comment Officials welco me the submitters’ support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Not supportive of the amendment Submission (Deloitte) The amendment should not be enacted. We believe that the change proposed does not have the effect intended by officials, and instead the amendment potentially has the opposite effect. Removing this requirement will increase the number of securities potentially eligible for the exemption from 500 to 600 to more than 2,100. As a result, the compliance time and cost would likely increase as there are a greater number of securities to consider, making it more difficult for taxpayers to self-assess their tax positions. Given that the status quo is acceptable from a policy perspective, we suggest that the current rules be maintained which will ensure that an increase in compliance costs and uncertainty is avoided. Comment The current requirement results in considerable uncertainty for investors and administrative cost for Inland Revenue as companies move on or off an approved index from period to period. For investors holding shares in companies on the fringe of the index (for example, the bottom 10 companies in the top 500 list which makes up the ASX All Ordinaries Index) the movement on and off the index as a result of periodic rebalancing results in different tax treatments from period to period. This not only increases their compliance costs as they switch between methods, but it also is not in line with the policy underlying the taxation of these investments, 63 given that nothing else changes for these taxpayers other than the size of the company relative to others on the list (in other words, the company is just as likely to distribute reasonable levels of dividends). Although officials acknowledge that the pool of potential securities which may qualify for the exemption will increase as a result of this amendment, it is not correct to conclude that this will necessarily result in increased compliance costs for taxpayers. Officials expect that the majorit y of investors relying on this exemption are likely to hold shares in companies listed on the All Ordinaries Index. For these investors, the amendment would mean that they no longer have to track index movements from period to period, which is expected to reduce their compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amending the remaining requirements of the FIF exemption Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The remaining requirements of section EX 31 place a significant compliance cost burden on taxpayers. The Corporate Taxpayers Group strongly submits that officials should consider whether the remaining criteria can be further amended to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The remaining requirements for application of the exemption are equally, if not more, onerous. Advice from a specialist may be needed to establish the correct position for some shares. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) If the aim is simplification, the FIF exemption should apply if the share is ASX listed, without also having to consider the other requirements. (KPMG) Comment Officials consider that the removal of the remainder of the requirements of the exemption would not be appropriate. Each of the requirements is necessary both to adequately target the exemption – to those stocks for which dividend-only taxation is appropriate – as well as to protect the FIF tax base from erosion by inappropriate reliance on the exemption (for example, restricting the application to shares only). The residence requirements reflect the fact that dividend-only taxation is appropriate for investments in Australian companies which, like New Zealand companies, are encouraged to distribute dividends as a result of the Australian franking system. Removal of these requirements would allow for ASX-listed stocks in non-Australian companies to be included in the exemption. This could include, for example, US companies which are not tax-incentivised to pay reasonable levels of dividends resulting in effective non- taxation of these investments. This result is contrary to intended policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 Issue: Inland Revenue’s published exemption list Submission (Deloitte, KPMG) Inland Revenue needs to continue to prepare a list of qualifying securities as guidance to taxpayers, to prevent taxpayers incorrectly treating securities. Investors are unlikely to be equipped with the knowledge or resources to complete analysis required by the exemption. If the remainder of the exemption is not simplified Inland Revenue should continue to publish the IR871 (Australian share exemption list) based on the ASX 500. Comment The proposed amendment will improve taxpayers’ ability to self-assess the criteria that the shares are in a company listed on the ASX, as this information is publicly available from the ASX website. Previously the shares had to be included on an approved ASX index and, given that the indexes are not generally publicly available, Inland Revenue published the exemption list, based on the indexes, to assist taxpayer compliance. Submitters have noted, and officials recognise, that many taxpayers rely on Inland Revenue’s published list to assist with their application of the exemption criteria. Post-enactment Inland Revenue will continue to provide guidance on the ASX exemption to assist taxpayer compliance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Retrospective application of the amendment Submission (Deloitte) The proposed timing, application from 2016–17 and later income years, would mean that the amendment applies retrospectively for some taxpayers. For unit valuers, who are required to calculate FIF income on a periodic basis (typically daily) this retrospective application will result in compliance issues as tax calculations and payments have already been completed on the basis of the existing rules. The application date should be amended to apply to income years after the amendment is enacted. Comment Officials agree that for unit valuers, who may be calculating FIF income more regularly, the retrospective application is not appropriate. However, officials do not agree that the amendment should apply to all income years after the enactment of the amendment as this would result in a staggered application over two years (depending on balance date). Instead officials suggest that the application date should be amended to the 2017–18 and later income years to allow for enactment prior to application. 65 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exclusion for Australasian share sale proceeds of managed funds Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also refers to shares included in an approved index under the ASX Market Rules, and in the Group’s view it appears to be an oversight that an amendment is not also proposed to this section. Making an amendment to section CX 55 would be consistent with the policy reasoning stated in the Bill Commentary for the amendment to the FIF ASX exemption, being to reduce the uncertainty that taxpayers face in determining whether a company is on or off an approved index from period to period. Section CX 55 should also be amended to mirror the changes to the FIF ASX exemption as proposed. Comment Officials agree that an amendment is required to bring section CX 55 in line with the proposed amendment to the ASX FIF exemption, but not for the reasons raised by the submitter. Section CX 55 generally treats the proceeds from the disposal of Australasian shares as excluded income for managed funds such as portfolio investment entity (PIE) funds. In the absence of this section proceeds from the disposal of these shares would probably be taxable in the hands of the PIE, for example, as the shares are likely to be held on revenue account. For taxpayers investing directly, who are more likely to hold the shares on capital account, the sale proceeds are not likely to be taxable. Section CX 55 therefore ensures that individuals investing though PIEs, for example, are not tax disadvantaged compared with individuals investing directly in the same stocks. The proposed amendment to the ASX FIF exemption would result in more Australian-listed stocks qualifying for the FIF exemption. Unless the same amendment is also made to CX 55, to bring the two provisions in line, taxpayers investing through a fund (who would rely on section CX 55) would be tax disadvantaged compared with direct investors (relying on the FIF exemption) with respect to the taxation of sale proceeds. This is not the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 66 SUPPORTING CO-LOCATION Clauses 117(1) and 122 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The Office of the Privacy Commissioner supported the proposal to address issues concerning the realities of working in open plan, co-located offices while still maintaining obligations on Inland Revenue employees to maintain a reasonable standard of confidentiality in respect to taxpayer information. The submitter noted that it was logical to remove barriers to efficient open-plan office environments for government agencies. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner had no objections to the proposed amendments. Comment Officials note the support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Whether co-located staff signing Inland Revenue certificates overcomes issue Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supported the co-location of government departments as a measure to achieve efficiencies and cost savings in the public service. However, the submitter believed it would be a simpler process to require staff of co-located government agencies to sign the same secrecy agreements as Inland Revenue staff, rather than amending the law to specify that an employee does not breach the secrecy provisions if they unintentionally disclose tax-secret information in a co-location environment. Comment Officials do not consider that it is appropriate to have co-located staff from other agencies sig n the same secrecy agreement that Inland Revenue employees sign. Further, even if the non- Inland Revenue co-located staff did sign the same secrecy agreement, that would not address the issue of Inland Revenue employees breaching section 81 by inadvertent communication to co- located staff. 67 Inland Revenue employees sign secrecy declarations under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The secrecy declarations under section 81 only relate to officers of Inland Revenue (as defined in section 81(8)) and not to employees of other co-located organisat ions. Under section 81, Inland Revenue employees have an obligation to maintain the secrecy of all matters relating to the tax legislation. This ties in with their broader obligations under section 6 of the TAA to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system (including keeping individual affairs of taxpayers confidential). These broad obligations are reflected in the Inland Revenue code of conduct. In contrast, generally other people who have access to restricted information only have the obligation to protect the secrecy of the information that they receive (section 87 of the TAA). They do not have broader obligations to protect the integrity of the tax system and they are not subject to Inland Revenue’s code of conduct. Officials consider that it is more appropriate, given co-located staff will only inadvertently receive restricted information, that their obligations only relate to the information that they receive. In addition, there are various exemptions in the secrecy obligation that Inland Revenue employees sign that allow them to share information with other government agencies in certain limited situat ions. It is not intended that co-located staff that receive restricted information inadvertently will be able to share that information with other government agencies under the various exemptions. Instead, officials consider it is appropriate that co-located staff have an unqualified obligation to maintain the secrecy of any information they inadvertently receive. Further, having co-located staff sign the same secrecy obligation that Inland Revenue employees sign may blur the information sharing between Inland Revenue employees and the co-located staff. The proposed amendment is not intended to allow a broader sharing of information between Inland Revenue staff and co-located staff than is currently the case. The proposed amendment is only intended to deal with information inadvertently communicated to the co- located staff that arises as a consequence of being co-located. Having co-located staff sign a different secrecy obligation will better reflect the distinction between the Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff to Inland Revenue employees, the co-located staff and to taxpayers. In any event, even if co-located staff did sign the same secrecy agreement as Inland Revenue employees, that would not address the issue of Inland Revenue employees breaching section 81 by inadvertent communication to co-located staff. Inland Revenue employees are only allowed to communicate tax-secret information for the purpose of carrying into effect the Tax Acts or for executing or performing a duty of the Commissioner. An inadvertent communication of tax- secret information by an Inland Revenue employee to a co-located staff member would generally not fall within that category, even if that co-located staff member had signed the relevant secrecy agreement. Therefore, the amendment as proposed is needed to address that issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 68 Issue: Whether the exception for unintentional breaches is necessary Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter suggested that it was unclear whether the proposed exception for unintentional breaches was necessary, given that an offence was committed only if a person "knowingly" acts in contravention of section 81 (section 143C(1) of the TAA). The submission stated it would be an unusual situation when a person knowingly communicates secret taxpayer information to another person in a way that breaches section 81(1) but the communication to that person was unintentional. The examples given in the Bill Commentary would be unlikely to mean that the Inland Revenue staff member has “knowingly” acted in contravention of section 81(1) and therefore committed an offence. Comment Officials consider that the amendment is necessary despite the criminal penalty provision only applying when the employee knowingly acts in contravention of section 81. Officials consider that an employee could be held to have knowingly acted in contravention of section 81 in a situation where there is a real risk that a co-located staff member will overhear a communication, but this risk is inherent in the accommodation arrangements and the premises. This may be the case when the employee is required to carry out their employment duties in co- located premises. In that situation, an employee may be aware that a co-located staff member could overhear a conversation, but not always be able to avoid that possibility. Officials consider it would be unfair to expose the Inland Revenue employee to the risk of a criminal penalty for doing their job in the premises required by their employer. In addition, even if there was not a risk of a criminal penalty, the Inland Revenue employee would still be placed in a position where there was a risk that they were breaching the law. This raises issues for the employee’s broader obligations to ensure the integrity of the tax system and Inland Revenue’s code of conduct. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether a higher secrecy standard should apply Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The proposed amendment will mean an Inland Revenue employee will not breach the secrecy provisio n (sect ion 81) if they do not intend the co-located staff member to overhear the conversation. The submitters stated that a higher standard should be prescribed than “does not intend”. To excuse all unintentional disclosures of secret taxpayer information that would otherwise breach section 81 would mean that negligent or even reckless practices would escape sanct ion. The taxpayer secrecy obligation is important to the integrity of the tax system and the 69 language of any statutory exceptions should reflect that. Accordingly, at a minimum, the amendment should require the Inland Revenue officer to have taken reasonable steps to have avoided the communication being received by the recipient. Comment Officials consider that the amendment is not intended to, and does not, sanction negligent or reckless practices on the part of Inland Revenue staff. The “does not intend” wording seeks to make it clear that the relevant communication is inadvertent. In addition, officials consider that any obligations on ensuring that reasonable steps have been taken to take into account, and mitigate such risks in the context of the premises, should fall on the Commissioner and not the individual employee. Officials consider the amendment will not allow negligent or reckless practices because of the various other obligations on Inland Revenue employees. Specifically, Inland Revenue employees are required under section 6 to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system (including keeping individual affairs confidential). Inland Revenue employees are also subject to a code of conduct which requires staff to ensure secrecy is maintained. Employees risk dismissal if they breach the code of conduct. Inland Revenue also has a strong culture of protecting secret information, and internal practices and training to support that culture. Officials consider the Commissioner’s obligations under section 6 will require her to take secrecy into account in deciding where co-location will occur and what physical safeguards will be put in place. Officials do not consider that it is appropriate to put such an obligation on individual employees if they are required to work in a co-located environment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether the proposal should be limited to Inland Revenue employees and co -located government employees Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The submitters noted that the Commentary to the Bill states that the amendment will remove a barrier to co-location arrangements between Inland Revenue and other government departments. However, the exception as currently drafted is not limited to unintentional disclosure to government employees (as section 87 can also apply to persons who are not government emplo yees). The submitters recommend that the amendment should be limited to Inland Revenue employees and co-located government employees. 70 Comment Officials consider that the law should also apply to contractors who have signed section 87 certificates, as well as Inland Revenue and co-located employees. Consistent with modern work practices, Inland Revenue and other government agencies often engage contractors who can in a practical sense be indistinguishable from employees. This means that Inland Revenue employees may not be able to distinguish contractors from Inland Revenue and co-located employees. Officials consider that it would be unreasonable for Inland Revenue employees to be subject to criminal penalties in such circumstances. Officials consider, therefore, the amendment should apply to inadvertent communications to all staff who sign secrecy certificates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether the proposal should be limited to co-located premises Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The submitters noted that the Commentary to the Bill stated that the proposed amendment was intended to align the approach to co-located staff working in open-plan areas, with the current approach to Inland Revenue staff working in open-plan areas. The submitters note, however, that the exception as currently drafted is not limited to a place where co-location occurs. The submitters noted further that there did not appear to be an exception under current law for Inland Revenue officers that inadvertently disclose taxpayer information to other Inland Revenue officers. Accordingly, contrary to what the Commentary to the Bill suggests, the proposal appears to create an exception for breaches of section 81(1) for Inland Revenue officers that disclose taxpayer information to both Inland Revenue officers and to staff of other government agencies. Comment Officials consider the proposed amendment will clarify the application of the law to Inland Revenue open-plan offices, and extend that application to locations, and in conditions relating to the secrecy of information, where an Inland Revenue employee is expected to work. Officials agree the clarifying aspect of the proposed amendment could have been more clearly set out in the Commentary, and recommend the issue be covered in the Tax Information Bulletin that follows the enactment of the Bill. Officials consider the current law does not prevent Inland Revenue from operating in open-plan workspaces. However, in such an environment, there is an inevitable risk that an Inland Revenue employee may inadvertently overhear a conversation between two other Inland Revenue employees or inadvertently overhear an Inland Revenue officer discussing a matter with a taxpayer on a phone call. It would be impossible in a practical sense to completely 71 eliminate such a risk in an open-plan environment. As a result, as there is not an explicit exception for Inland Revenue employees under the current law, officials consider it is possible that a court could hold an employee liable for criminal sanctions when a conversation was inadvertently overheard in an open-plan Inland Revenue office as well. Officials consider, therefore, the proposed amendment should clarify that Inland Revenue employees do not breach the secrecy provision when they are carrying into effect the tax legislation in an open-plan environment and another Inland Revenue employee inadvertently overhears a conversation. An Inland Revenue employee will still be liable for criminal sanctions if they intentionally communicate tax-secret information to another Inland Revenue employee, other than for carrying into effect the Tax Acts or carrying on a duty of the Commissioner. Officials acknowledge that the exception could be made to apply only to Inland Revenue offices and co-located sites, and the definition could be amended accordingly. However, officials’ preference is that the proposed amendment extends this approach to a location, and in conditions relating to the secrecy of information, where an Inland Revenue employee is expected to work. Officials consider the breadth of the provision will enable Inland Revenue to be flexible about the different work environments that it expects employees to work in. Officials would point out that the breadth of the provision must be read in light of the various requirements and restrictions that will apply to the exception. Specifically: • the Commissioner will need to comply with her general obligation to use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system in determining where she expects employees to work and what secrecy conditions will apply in that environment; • the exception will only apply when the communication is not intentional; • the exception will also only apply when the inadvertent communication is heard by a staff member who has signed a secrecy agreement, and so is subject to severe criminal penalties for knowingly communicating any restricted information; and • all Inland Revenue employees will still be obligated to use their best endeavours to keep a taxpayer’s individual affairs confidential, and there will be sanctions for negligent or reckless behaviour. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 72 SPECIAL TAX CODES FOR THOSE RECEIVING NZ SUPERANNUATION OR VETERAN’S PENSION Clauses 71(5) to (7), 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 101 and 102 Issue: Support for amendments Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The submitters support the amendments to allow the Commissioner to provide special tax code certificates directly to the Ministry of Social Development. These amendments will reduce compliance costs for superannuitants and veteran pensioners by reducing the extent of over- or under-deduction of tax. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Drafting error with section 24B(3) Submission (EY) The submitter proposes that the wording of clause 83, although appropriate, does not read well with regard to how it fits with the section it amends and that the opportunity should be taken to improve the flow and logic of the provisions. Comment Clause 83 amends section 24B(3) of the Tax Administration Act. This section requires the emplo yee to notify their employer of one of the tax codes listed in that section. A “no notification” tax code applies when the employee does not provide their employer with a tax code. However section 24B(3) incorrectly includes the “no notification tax code in a list of codes that the employee advises the employer of. This error has existed for some time and officials agree with the submitter that the opportunity should be taken to correct this legislative error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 73 Issue: Allowing special tax codes to apply to more than one employer Submission (EY) The submitter suggests that the draft legislation is too restrictive and that the special tax code can only apply in respect of a single employer, which is not what the current legislation provides. Comment An employee can apply for a special tax code to apply to their New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension income or their other employment income from one or more employers. The Bill proposes changes to enable the Commissioner to provide the special tax code certificate directly to the Ministry of Social Development instead of having to give the certificate to the superannuitant who has to provide it to the Ministry of Social Development. Officials agree with the submitter. In drafting these amendments, a legislative oversight has resulted in the Bill incorrectly limiting the application of the special tax code to the income of one employer instead of to income from more than one employer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 FACILITATING ADDITIONAL DEDUCTIONS FROM WAGES OR SALARY Clauses 169, 185, 217, 219 and 221 Issue: Defaulting taxpayers should not be able to prevent deduction notices having effect by failing to notify a change of address Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Currently, when a person has defaulted on tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan payment obligations, additional deductions from their wages or salary to recover the shortfall are prevented if the defaulter has failed to notify Inland Revenue of a change of address. Defaulting taxpayers should not be able to prevent deduction notices having effect by failing to notify a change of address. Comment The submission confirms the problem the proposed amendments are intended to address. Some taxpayers choose to ignore their tax obligations and other payment obligations by failing to maintain a valid address that Inland Revenue can use to contact them. When the defaulter’s employer is known, requiring deductions from the defaulter’s wages or salary is an efficient means of recovering the outstanding payments, but that action is prevented if the defaulter has not kept Inland Revenue informed of their correct address. Under the proposed amendments, the deduction notice will be issued to the employer without a copy to the employee, but the defaulter’s rights to challenge an assessment or make alternative arrangements for payment will be protected through earlier correspondence. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: A copy of the deduction notice should be sent to the employee at the employer’s address Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) When a defaulting taxpayer’s address is unknown, or they have not notified a change of address, the notice should be sent to the employee at the employer’s address prior to the deduction from wages or salaries. The submitter does not understand why a copy of the deduction notice cannot be sent to the employee at the employer’s address, as this would not impose a significant compliance burden on employers, who will be the first point of call for queries from employees. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 75 The Commissioner should retain an obligation to issue appropriate notices to taxpayer debtors, although it should not be necessary to prove that the notice had been received. We suggest that the Commissioner should be required to provide notices to the employers or other relevant debtors, which they can issue to the taxpayer debtors. (EY) The Commissioner should be able to issue a deduction notice to a defaulting taxpayer at the employer’s address if the taxpayer’s address cannot be found. (KPMG) Comment Issuing a copy of the deduction notice to the defaulter’s employer to pass on to the employee was one of the options considered by Inland Revenue. The option was discarded because it would require the following manual actions to be taken by Inland Revenue staff: • change the taxpayer’s address on the FIRST system to the employer’s address; • generate the issue of the deduction notice with a copy for the employee; and • change the taxpayer’s address back to “invalid” so other correspondence with the taxpayer is not issued to the employer. It is not clear at this stage of Inland Revenue’s new tax administration system development whether a less manually intensive solution would be available in the new system. Secondly, allowing the employer to pass on the deduction notice would not create any incentive for the defaulting employee to contact Inland Revenue to update their address details. Finally, being required to pass on copies of deduction notices to employees would impose a compliance burden on employers, particularly those with a widely dispersed workforce. Information for employers to support the proposed change would encourage them to direct any employee enquiries to Inland Revenue so that address details can be updated and give the person an opportunity to discuss alternative payment arrangements. It should be noted that the proposed changes are to apply only to copies of notices for deduction from salary or wages. They will not apply to deductions that can be made from payments made to defaulters by other third parties. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 76 Issue: The Commissioner should reconsider processes Submission (KPMG) The waiver of the employee copy of a deduction notice is a step too far, denying the defaulting taxpayer any opportunity to respond to or challenge the Commissioner’s assessment. This right is fundamental to the integrity of the tax system. Comment Before there is an attempt to issue an automatic deduction notice to an employer there will have been earlier communications with the defaulting employee. First, there will have been an assessment, which may have been a self-assessment by the taxpayer. If, however, Inland Revenue has generated the assessment, a notice of assessment will have been issued, giving the taxpayer the opportunity to object and follow through the dispute process. Secondly, a statement of account, which may be issued prior to the due date in response to some transactions, is generally issued once the due date for payment has passed and Inland Revenue records show no or insufficient payment was made. The statement shows any penalties or interest added to the account. In addition, for some taxpayers there will have been e-alerts through their myIR account or payment reminders by text to their mobile phone. Thirdly, if payment has not been made in full within 20 to 50 days (the date varies depending whether the taxpayer is represented by an agent) after the due date for payment, a debt notice is issued. This gives the taxpayer a final opportunity to contact Inland Revenue and discuss the default and possible alternative payment arrangements before a deduction notice is issued to the taxpayer’s employer. It is only when the final form of correspondence with the taxpayer is returned and the address coded as “invalid” that we propose that an automatic deduction notice be issued to the employer without a copy to the employee. At earlier points in the process, if the taxpayer’s address becomes invalid it would be only when the case is identified for manual action that following enquiries, including to the employer about the employee’s address, a deduction notice would be generated. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: The proposed amendments address administrative issues Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Clause 169 removes the obligation on Inland Revenue to advise both a tax-due defaulter and their employer when it plans to initiate deductions from a defaulting taxpayer’s salary or wages if the defaulter has not kept their personal address details up to date with Inland Revenue. This addresses administrative issues arising when taxpayers do not comply with their existing obligations to keep Inland Revenue informed of changes in their contact details. Comment The proposed amendments will create administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue and faster recovery of unpaid taxes and other payments when the defaulter is in paid employment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 78 CHANGES TO PERSONAL TAX SUMMARY THRESHOLDS Clauses 59 and 116 Issue: Support for the proposals Submissions (KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Two submitters expressed their general support for the proposals. We see these changes as an interim step until the broader issues with personal tax summaries and individual tax returns are dealt with as part of the Business Transformation process. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Clarification of interaction with section 80F(2) Submission (EY) Clause 116 proposes amending section 80H(3) with the aim of reducing the time for automatically releasing refunds on unconfirmed personal tax summaries. The assessment could be treated as made on the 15th day after issue of an income statement, rather than on the 30th day under the present section 80H(3)(c), unless one of the other specified dates occurs first. We suggest clarification would be desirable as to how the section 80H(3) provision is intended to fit with the section 80F(2) period (the taxpayer’s terminal tax date or two months after issue of income statement, whichever is the later) for notifying Inland Revenue of errors. Comment The interaction of sections 80H(3) and 80F(2) remain unchanged. Section 80H(3) allows low- value refunds to be issued automatically without requiring an interaction between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue. Section 80F(2) requires any taxpayer receiving an incorrect personal tax summary to contact Inland Revenue and provide the necessary information before their terminal tax due date or the date two months after the personal tax summary was issued, whichever is the later. 79 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of the term “confirms” Submission (EY) It is also proposed to change the section 80H(3)(d) reference to the date on which a person requests a refund to the date on which a person “confirms that the income statement is correct”. The term “confirms” is not one of the new communications terms listed and described in proposed sections 14 to 14G. We suggest the existing wording be retained or one of the specific new communications terms should be used instead of a further, different term, or the term “confirms” should be expressly included within one of the proposed section 14 communication categories. Comment The current section 80H(3)(d) refers to the date “on which the person requests a refund of tax under section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007”. This request can only be made by the person confirming their personal tax summary. The term “confirms” is also used in section RM 5 and is undefined as it retains its normal meaning. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 CHANGES TO RULINGS REGIME Clauses 130, 137, 138, 145 and 152 Issue: Support for the proposal Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitters supported the proposed amendments to the binding rulings regime. The submitters noted that the amendments will remove certain restrictions on Inland Revenue when providing binding rulings in certain circumstance and reduce administrative costs, particularly to clarify that Inland Revenue can rule on issues under dispute by other taxpayers. Comment Officials note the support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Publication requirements Submissions (EY) The submitter noted the proposed amendment to allow the Commissioner to notify extensions of public and status rulings in a publication chosen by the Commissioner, rather than in the New Zealand Gazette. The submitter recommended that it be clarified whether such “publication” includes a website and, if so, that the Commissioner should be required to record, on the face of such website publications, details of the dates of their issue and the dates they become accessible to the public. The submitter also recommended that the Commissioner should also be required to publish similar date details in relation to any subsequent changes or additions affecting such publications. Comment Officials consider the amendment is intended to allow the Commissioner to notify extensions of public and status rulings on Inland Revenue’s website. The use of the term “publication” is intended to be broad enough to cover a wide variety of digital channels. Inland Revenue is currently reviewing the way it publishes items, including on its website. Officials consider the submissions on the details that should be included when publishing should be passed on to the relevant Inland Revenue team to consider as part of their review. 81 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Materiality requirements Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Group supports the move to amend section 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify that an assumption needs to be “materially incorrect” rather than merely “incorrect” for the private ruling to cease to apply. The Group submits that Inland Revenue should release some further guidance as to when the Commissioner believes that the breach of an assumption in a binding ruling is “material”. This will assist taxpayers in determining whether a binding ruling continues to apply, as it will not always be obvious whether a breach of an assumption is “material” in nature. On a related point, the Group notes that the concept of materiality features quite prominently throughout the rulings regime and the continued application of a ruling will often hinge on whether there is a “material” change to the arrangement to which the ruling relates. There is no New Zealand commentary or case law that considers this point, and whether there has been a material change to an arrangement is often an area of uncertainty for taxpayers, noting that rulings are often applied for before transactions or arrangements have been put in place. In the Group’s view, guidance on the concept of materiality as it relates to the rulings regime is required and Inland Revenue should issue an item on this matter. Alternatively, consideration should be given to extending the scope of the “factual review” product offered by Inland Revenue to allow a taxpayer to request a factual review during the period of the ruling. At present Inland Revenue’s guidance states that “\[a\] Factual Review may be requested in writing at any time prior to or immediately following the issue of the ruling”. Comment Officials consider that whether an assumption is material will turn on the particular facts and circumstances. Officials note that Inland Revenue is currently considering whether to provide further guidance on the materiality requirement. We consider, however, that providing further guidance on the issue is beyond the scope of the current Bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 82 STUDENT LOANS – STUDENT LOAN INTEREST No clause Submission (Kim Parker) The submitter proposes the imposition of interest on student loans. Comment Under current law, New Zealand-based student loan borrowers pay no interest on their loan as long as they comply with any assessed repayment obligations. However, interest is imposed on the consolidated loan balance of overseas-based borrowers. There is no provision in the Bill relating to student loan interest and the Government is committed to retaining interest-free student loans for borrowers in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 TAX SECRECY AND SOFTWARE INTERMEDIARIES Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to clarify that the transmission of customer-specific information via business software that is provided and maintained by a software provider (the software intermediary) does not breach the section 81 secrecy provision. Comment Tax secrecy requires Inland Revenue officers to maintain secrecy in all matters relating to Inland Revenue’s functions. Tax-secret information cannot be disclosed unless it is for tax purposes, or is covered by a specific exception contained in the legislation. An integral aspect of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme is that customers will be able to manage most tax transactions, complete their tax affairs and file their tax information directly from their business software. Inland Revenue in turn will be able to send information, confirmation and messages directly to a customer’s business software. However, by transmitting customer information directly to business software, Inland Revenue could be disclosing customer-specific tax information to a third party (the software intermediary that is providing and maintaining the business software) and potentially breach the tax secrecy obligations contained in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act. Officials therefore recommend that section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to clarify that the transmission of customer-specific information via business software provided and maintained by a software intermediary does not breach the secrecy provision. Software intermediaries who wish to offer this new service will be required to enter into an agreement with the Commissioner, which will specify obligations and expectations about access and use of taxpayer information. Officials recommend this amendment apply generally from the date of enactment of the amending legislation, but that it applies retrospectively to any software intermediary agreements that have been entered into with the Commissioner before that date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 84
November 2016 Automatic Exchange of Information Request for submissions – excluded entities (non-reporting financial institutions) and excluded accounts lists Overview Inland Revenue plans to issue the New Zealand lists of “other low risk” excluded entities (non-reporting financial institutions, or NRFIs) and excluded accounts as soon as possible after the legislation from the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill is enacted. Financial institutions and interested parties are invited to submit details of entities and accounts that they believe meet the criteria for exclusion. Submissions should be sent to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz by 31 January 2017. Criteria for exclusion The general criteria for excluded entities (NRFIs) and excluded accounts are set out in the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), available at http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic- exchange/common-reporting-standard/ Entities and accounts that meet the general criteria are automatically excluded – they do not need to be separately approved or published on a list. However, for both excluded entities ( NRFIs) and excluded accounts, the CRS contains “other low risk” categories that involve a consideration of risk and substitutable criteria: NRFIs – CRS section VIII.B(1)(c) ...any other Entity that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax, has substantially similar characteristics to any of the Entities described in subparagraphs B(1)(a) and (b), and is defined in domestic law as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution, provided that the status of such Entity as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution does not frustrate the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard; Excluded Accounts – CRS section VIII.C(17)(g) ...any other account that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax, has substantially similar characteristics to any of the accounts described in subparagraphs 1 C(17)(a) through (f), and is defined in domestic law as an Excluded Account, provided that the status of such account as an Excluded Account does not frustrate the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) requires these other low risk categories to be defined in domestic law. The bill implementing the CRS in New Zealand proposes that entities and accounts will only be within the other low risk excluded entities (NRFIs) or excluded account categories if approved by Inland Revenue and published in a Commissioner’s determination. Submission information Excluded entities (NRFIs) Submissions to treat a financial institution as a non-reporting financial institution should cover: • Why the entity is a financial institution under the CRS in the first place. • Why the entity does not come within any of the other specific categories of non- reporting financial institution. • Whether the entity has substantially similar characteristics to any of the entities described in subparagraphs B(1)(a) and (b) of section VIII of the CRS, focussing specifically on those characteristics which are/are not similar, and whether there are substitute characteristics that provide a similar level of assurance that the entity presents a low risk of being used to evade tax. • Why the entity presents a low risk of being used to evade tax in terms of the following factors (refer to pages 170–173 of the CRS commentary): - Regulation: Is the entity subject to regulation in New Zealand? If so, please describe the regulatory regime. - Reporting: Is the entity required to report information on account holders to Inland Revenue? - Anti-money laundering: Is the entity subject to the anti-money laundering/know your customer procedures? - Other: Are there any other reasons why the entity presents a low risk of being used for tax evasion? What are they? Excluded accounts Submissions to treat a financial account as an excluded account should cover: • Why the account is a financial account under the CRS in the first place. • Why the account does not come within any of the other specific categories of excluded account. 2 • Whether the account has substantially similar characteristics to any of the accounts described in sub-paragraphs C(17)(a)-(f) of section VIII of the CRS, focussing specifically on those characteristics which are/are not similar, and whether there are substitute characteristics that provide a similar level of assurance that the account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax. • Why the account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax in terms of the following factors (refer to pages 187–190 of the CRS commentary): - Regulation: Is the account subject to regulation in New Zealand? If so please describe the regulatory regime. - Tax-favoured: Is the account tax-favoured (are contributions to the account that would otherwise be subject to tax deductible or excluded from the gross income of the account holder or taxed at a reduced rate, or is the taxation of investment income from the account deferred or taxed at a reduced rate)? - Reporting: Is information required to be reported to Inland Revenue for the account? - Limited contributions: Are contributions to the account (or the associated tax relief) limited? - Limited service: Does this type of account provide appropriately defined and limited services to certain types of customers, so as to increase access for financial inclusion purposes? - Anti-money laundering: Is this type of account subject to the anti-money laundering/know your customer procedures? - Other: Are there any other reasons why this account presents a low risk of being used for tax evasion? What are they? 3
July 2016 Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information Information for financial institutions From 1 July 2017, New Zealand financial institutions will (unless exempted) need to review their accounts and collect and report information to Inland Revenue on accounts held or (in certain circumstances) controlled by non-residents. Where necessary, Inland Revenue will then share that information with other tax jurisdictions in specific countries. The objective is to help eradicate tax evasion. A key consideration in implementing the initiative will be in achieving a consistent standard for how the information exchange is conducted between jurisdictions. To address this, the OECD has published its Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which forms part of the Standard outlines the reporting and due diligence requirements for conducting the automat ic exchange of information. The CRS is of particular importance to financial institutions and this fact sheet provides information on proposed measures to be included in draft legislation based on public feedback to its public consultation document, Implementing the global standard on automatic exchange of information, released in February 2016. Draft legislation The draft legislation is based on the options released for public consultation and the feedback received. Generally the legislation aims to: • allow reporting financial institutions to take advantage of options set out in the CRS and commentary; and • not require reporting financial institutions to collect further information than is required under the CRS (with the exception of the ‘wider approach’ to due diligence, which will be mandatory). This approach should help to minimise the compliance costs for reporting financial institutions in implementing the CRS. Policy recommendations This document summarises the key policy recommendations for draft legislation in the following areas: 1. The reporting period 2. The “wider approach” 1 3. Timeframe for review of pre-existing individual and entity accounts 4. Excluded reporting entities and accounts 5. Reportable jurisdictions 6. Enforcement and compliance 7. Alignment with anti-money laundering legislation and FATCA 8. Key dates for financial inst itutions AEOI reporting These proposals will be set out in a Bill to be introduced in August. Important As the Common Reporting Standard is still to become New Zealand law, the details in this fact sheet are subject to change through the parliamentary process and should be read in that context. 1. The reporting period It is proposed that financial institutions will report financial information for eligible accounts to Inland Revenue on a tax year basis as follows: • The first reporting period in New Zealand is the part year 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018. • Subsequent AEOI reporting periods will cover full tax years from 1 April to 31 March. • Reporting New Zealand financial institutions will be required to report to Inland Revenue by 30 June after the end of the tax year. • Reporting on a tax year basis aligns with the annual Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting date, and allows reporting financial institutions three months to prepare data for the reporting deadline to Inland Revenue of 30 June each year. 2. The “wider approach” The CRS procedures are designed to ensure that residents of reportable jurisdictions are identified and subject to reporting. (For New Zealand, reportable jurisdictions are broadly those that New Zealand has agreed to exchange information with under this initiative.) However, the list of reportable jurisdictions will change over time, as additional jurisdictions join the initiative. Strictly, this would require reporting financial institutions to monitor the list on an on-going basis and to update their due diligence and reporting procedures each time the list changes. Importantly, changes to the list could also result in reporting financial institutions being required to repeat due diligence in respect of some or all of their accounts. As a compliance cost reduction measure, the CRS therefore includes an option for jurisdictions to adopt a “wider approach”, either solely in respect of due diligence or in respect of both due diligence and reporting. 2 Due diligence Under the wider approach to due diligence, reporting financial institutions would identify all non-resident account holders (and controlling persons of passive non-financial entities), rather than just those of reportable jurisdictions. It is proposed that this approach be adopted, and that it be mandatory for all reporting financial institutions. Reporting Under the wider approach to reporting financial institutions report any non-resident account holder or controlling person identified as being non-resident, irrespective of whether those persons are from reportable jurisdictions. Inland Revenue would then filter the reported data and exchange the “reportable jurisdiction” information with the relevant jurisdictions. It is proposed that this approach be adopted, but that it be optional for reporting financial inst itutions. (That is, financial institutions that wish to filter the data themselves could do so.) 3. Timeframe for review of pre-existing individual and entity accounts Pre-existing high value individual accounts It is proposed that all high value pre-existing individual accounts will need to be reviewed in the first reporting period (i.e. 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018). However, reporting financial inst itutions will in effect have a 3 month grace period as they may continue conducting due diligence up until 30 June 2018 (the deadline date for reporting). However, if a reporting financial institution identifies a reportable account during the 3 month grace period of 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018, it will need to report this account by 30 June 2018 for the first reporting period ending 31 March 2018. Pre-existing entity accounts and lower value individual accounts The proposed approach is that all pre-existing entity accounts and lower value individual accounts will need to be reviewed by the end of the second reporting period (31 March 2019). However, reporting financial institutions will in effect have a 3 month grace period as they may continue conducting due diligence up until 30 June 2019 (the deadline date for reporting). However, if a reportable account is identified during the 3 month grace period of 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2019, it will need to be reported by 30 June 2019 for the reporting period ending 31 March 2019. 3 4. Excluded reporting entities and accounts It is proposed that Inland Revenue will determine which entities and accounts will be excluded from CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Inland Revenue will invite submissions on excluded entities and accounts before the end of 2016. Submissio ns will be considered in terms of the specific requirements set out in the CRS. The initial list of excluded entities and accounts will be determined by early to mid- 2017. 5. Reportable jurisdictions It is proposed to list New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions by Order in Council. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have the ability to temporarily remo ve a jurisdict ion fro m the list at short notice if necessary. The first step in this process is that Inland Revenue will consider each jurisdiction signed up to AEOI to determine whether they should be reportable. Inland Revenue will then call for submissions, likely by the end of 2016. The Order in Council will be made by early to mid-2017. 6. Enforcement and compliance Transition period It is proposed that there will be a transitional period applying until 31 March 2019, during which reporting financial institutions will generally be able to rely on a ‘reasonable endeavours’ defence to any non-compliance with their CRS obligations – similar to the FATCA two-year ‘good faith’ transit ion period precedent. However, this will be subject to the reporting financial institution rectifying any identified errors within a reasonable period of time. Penalties It is proposed that penalties for non-compliance with CRS obligations will generally be civil in nature (as opposed to criminal for FATCA), apart from knowledge-based offences. Given the importance of effective rules for ensuring compliance, strong sanctions are proposed for serious failure to comply. It is proposed that penalties for non-compliance will be extended beyond reporting financial inst itutions to cover account holders, controlling persons and intermediaries in defined circumstances. This reflects the fact that such persons have the information (or have customer relationships with the persons that have the information) that reporting financial inst itutions will need to obtain in order to comply with their CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. These proposed obligations will also assist in ensuring that reporting financial inst itutions always obtain requisite self-certifications for new accounts, which is a key OECD requirement (as elaborated on below). The proposal is that this extension will also apply for FATCA purposes. 4 Grace period for self-certifications The OECD has highlighted its expectation that jurisdictions implementing CRS will have robust legal, administrative, and operational frameworks in place to ensure that financial institutions always obtain required self-certifications for new accounts. However, the OECD has provided some guidance about how such a process is expected to work in practice. The OECD has stated that a reporting financial institution should generally obtain self- certifications as part of a “day one” account opening process where this is practical in the circumstances. However, such a financial inst itution can be allowed a period of up to 90 days to obtain a self-certification where there are practical difficulties in obtaining a self-certification as part of a “day one” process. Inland Revenue intends to follow this approach. There will be reporting requirements in respect of undocumented pre-existing accounts. Reporting financial institutions will also be required to keep a record of the instances where it has failed to obtain a required self-certification. 7. Alignment with anti-money laundering legislation and FATCA The CRS due diligence procedures leverage off anti-money laundering procedures in a number of areas. The CRS also contains a number of terms and types of procedures that align with FATCA. This means that there will be some alignment between CRS due diligence procedures and anti-money laundering/FATCA due diligence procedures. However, to manage any divergence, it is proposed that the CRS will drive the obligations that reporting financial institutions will have for CRS purposes (for example, “controlling persons” with new accounts are more widely defined in the CRS). As the CRS is a global standard, New Zealand’s compliance with the CRS will be subject to rigorous international scrutiny and peer review by the OECD’s Global Forum. 5 8. Key dates for financial institutions AEOI reporting Dates Actions August 2016 The legislation will be introduced into Parliament (as part of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information and Remedial Matters) Bill. Late 2016 Inland Revenue will call for submissions on reportable jurisdictions and excluded entities and accounts. March 2017 The Bill is expected to receive Royal assent. Early to mid-2017 Initial list of reportable jurisdictions, participating jurisdictions, and excluded entities and accounts. 1 July 2017 Reporting financial institutions commence due diligence procedures. 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018 Reporting financial institutions submit their AEOI reporting to Inland Revenue for the tax year ending 31 March 2018. 30 September 2018 Final date for Inland Revenue to exchange information with other reportable jurisdictions for the reporting period ending 31 March 2018. Further information Further information on the requirements for AEOI and its global implementation can be found on the OECD's automatic exchange portal . 6

\[This guidance is in draft form, based on the proposed approach set out in the 2016 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill, and at this t ime is subject to the Parliamentary process.\] Background 1 Overview of the Common Reporting Standard for the Automatic Exchange of 1.1 Information Globalisation has made it easier for persons to invest outside of their jurisdiction of tax residence. This has provided opportunities for offshore tax evasion. In response, the OECD has developed the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (AEOI) to provide a global framework for the collection, reporting, and exchange of financial account information about persons that invest outside of their jurisdiction of tax residence. This will assist in detecting and deterring offshore tax evasion. In broad terms, the CRS requires that financial institutions carry out the following steps: • Due diligence: o review their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) by foreign tax residents; and o collect prescribed 1 identity and financial account information about such persons; and • Reporting: report this information to the local revenue authority for exchange with the jurisdiction of tax residence of the account holder (or controlling person). The CRS is accompanied by a Commentary (the CRS Commentary), which supplements these due diligence and reporting obligations. The OECD has also produced guidance about the practical application of these obligations. This includes a CRS Implementation Handbook and guidance set out in answers to “Frequently Asked Questions”. All of the OECD guidance is available on the OECD’s website (at http:///www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange). The success of the CRS will depend on how effectively and consistently it is implemented around the world. The OECD will rigorously monitor whether implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) are complying with the CRS. This will occur through the OECD’s monitoring agency – the 1 This prescri bed i nformation is outlined in detail further below at paragraph 6. 6 Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. The G20 has stated that it will (if necessary) apply sanctions to address non-compliance by jurisdictions. Accordingly, the New Zealand Government is taking CRS implementation seriously and has made international commitments to implement the CRS in full accordance with the CRS and the CRS Commentary. Therefore, both the CRS and the CRS Commentary will be directly incorporated into New Zealand law, subject to certain modifications that will be set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The CRS builds largely off a similar bilateral framework that applies for due diligence, reporting, and exchanging of financial account information under the Foreign Account Taxation Compliance Act (FATCA) Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) that New Zealand has entered into with the United States. However, as explained further below, a key difference is that the CRS is multilateral. New Zealand has committed to commencing CRS obligations from 1 July 2017. From that date: 2 • Reporting New Zealand financial institutions will have CRS due diligence obligations (to review their financial accounts) and reporting obligations (to report 3 to Inland Revenue about relevant foreign tax residents they identified when reviewing their financial accounts). A Reporting New Zealand financial institution is a New Zealand financial institution that is not otherwise exempted. • Persons that hold accounts with such reporting NZF Is (or are otherwise connected with such accounts) will sometimes have obligations to obtain and provide information to assist the institution to carry out their due diligence and reporting obligations. • New Zealand (through Inland Revenue) will have obligations to exchange financial account information with certain other jurisdictions for AEOI purposes. The jurisdictions that New Zealand will provide AEOI information to are known as Reportable Jurisdictions. The jurisdictions that New Zealand will receive AEOI information from are known as Participat ing Jurisdict ions. All exchanges of information between jurisdictions will be conducted under, and be subject to the strict terms of, international tax treaties. 4 2 As explained in detail further below, these obligations will be set out in Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 As explained further below at paragraph 1.6, the scope of these reporting obligations will depend on whether the financial institution chooses to adopt what is known as the “wider approach” to reporting. 4 The predominant tax treaty to be used for AEOI exchanges will be the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which New Zealand signed in 2012. Other possible tax treaties that could potentially be used for AEOI exchanges i nclude double tax agreements (DTAs) and tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). 7 Currently, 100 jurisdictions have committed to implement the CRS on a similar or earlier timeline to that adopted by New Zealand. These (future) implementing jurisdictions will not necessarily all exchange with each other. For example, some jurisdictions without tax systems may not be interested in receiving AEOI information as they do not face tax evasion concerns. Importantly, the OECD also acknowledges that information should only be provided to jurisdictions that have confidentiality and data safeguards in place that will ensure that exchanged information is only disclosed to authorised persons and is only used for authorised purposes. Internationally, the OECD has processes in place for reviewing the confidentiality and data safeguards of implementing jurisdictions and for disseminating information on the jurisdictions that have agreed to exchange with each other. Domestically, New Zealand also needs to publish its own lists of Reportable Jurisdictions and Participating Jurisdictions. The Reportable Jurisdiction list will be subject to Government oversight and issued by Order in Council. The Participating Jurisdiction list does not require Government oversight, and will therefore be issued by Commissioner’s determination. 5 Use of information by Inland Revenue 1.2 The exchange of financial account information will mean that New Zealand will receive better information about New Zealand tax residents’ offshore investments. This w ill assist Inland Revenue in verifying that these persons have paid the correct tax on these offshore investments. This will, in turn, aid in detecting and deterring offshore tax evasion by New Zealand tax residents. Information collected from Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions under CRS may also be used by Inland Revenue for purposes other than AEOI. This information will only be used by Inland Revenue for matters consistent with its statutory role and obligations. For example, Inland Revenue could potentially use this information to assist it to verify that the correct rates have been used for non-resident withholding tax. Inland Revenue has been liaising with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner regarding potentially using the information in this way and will continue to do so. Purpose of this guidance 1.3 This guidance is intended to provide operational advice in the New Zealand context, for financial institutions that are implementing the CRS, and others who may have CRS obligations. It includes references to specific parts of the CRS, the CRS Commentary (and the related OECD CRS implementation handbook, and the OECD’s answers to “Frequently Asked Questions”) that the reader may find useful. 5 These lists will be published after enactment of the legislation. The Reportable Jurisdictions list will largely be based on the outcome of the OECD confidentiality and data safeguards reviews, subject to submissions from stakeholders contesting the outcomes of the OECD reviews. 8 This guidance is intended to be a self-contained document that can be used by a wide range of taxpayers to clarify their CRS obligations. The following roadmap should assist taxpayers in identifying the part of the guidance that is most relevant to them: • Taxpayers that are seeking to clarify whether they are Reporting New Zealand financial institutions (Reporting NZFIs) with CRS obligations should go to paragraph 3 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that know they are Reporting NZFIs, but are seeking to clarify what their CRS due diligence obligations are should go to paragraphs 4-5 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that know they are Reporting NZFIs, but are seeking to clarify what their CRS reporting obligations are should go to paragraph 6 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that hold accounts with Reporting NZFIs (or are otherwise connected with such accounts) and want to know what obligations they have should go to paragraph 9.2 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that are seeking to clarify how the CRS applies to fund managers and investment advisers should go to paragraphs 3.1.3 and 4.5.1 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that are seeking to clarify how the CRS applies to trusts should go to paragraphs 11.1 to 11.2 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that are seeking to clarify how the CRS applies to partnerships should go to paragraph 11.3 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that are seeking to clarify how the CRS applies to collective investment vehicles should go to paragraph 11.4 of the guidance. • Taxpayers that are seeking to clarify how the CRS applies to deceased estates should go to paragraph 11.5 of the guidance. The Appendices to the guidance also contains a summary of various matters. This includes: • a comparison between FATCA and CRS; and • the options that Reporting NZFIs can take when carrying out CRS due diligence and reporting. 9 The information in these Appendices will assist Reporting NZFIs that are looking for ways to: • leverage off existing procedures when implementing CRS; and • make decisions to decrease the compliance costs associated with implementing CRS. High level summary of CRS due diligence and reporting obligations 1.4 In broad terms, the CRS will require Reporting NZFIs from 1 July 2017 to: • carry out due diligence on their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) 6 by relevant foreign tax residents; • collect prescribed identity and financial account information about such persons (and accounts); and • report 7 this information annually to Inland Revenue. (For these purposes, an entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes is required to be treated for CRS purposes as being resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated.) Reporting NZFIs will be able to use service providers 8 to carry out these due diligence and reporting obligations on their behalf. However, the legal obligations will remain with the Reporting NZFI. CRS due diligence – incorporating the “wider approach” 1.5 A Reporting NZFI’s due diligence obligations incorporate what is known as the “wider approach” to due diligence. Under the wider approach to due diligence, Reporting NZFIs will be required to identify any relevant foreign tax resident irrespective of whether such persons are from Reportable Jurisdictions (jurisdictions that New Zealand will be providing AEOI information to). Th is is a compliance cost measure to deal with the fact that the number of Reportable Jurisdictions is likely to increase over time. Therefore, without the wider approach to due diligence Reporting NZFIs would need to constantly redo their due diligence each time a new jurisdiction becomes a Reportable Jurisdiction. 6 A Reporting NZFI will be required to identify “controlling persons” when they maintai n an account that is held b y a passive non-financial entity. This is broadly similar to the FACTA due diligence procedures. The due diligence procedures relating to controlling persons are set out at paragraph 5. 7 As explained further below, the scope of these reporting obligations will depend on whether the Reporting NZFI chooses to adopt what is known as t he “wi der approach” to reporting. 8 Pages 132-133 of the CRS Commentary set out the procedures and st eps that a Reporting NZFI would need to have in place if they choose to use such a service provider. 10 Reporting NZFIs will be required to adopt the wider approach to due diligence as follows: • to review their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents; and • to collect prescribed identity and financial information about such persons (and accounts). The relevant persons (in this context) cover all foreign tax residents other than: • a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets; • any corporation that is a related entity of a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets; • a Government entity; • an international organisation; • a central bank; or • a financial institut ion. This guidance will refer to foreign tax residents that are not excluded in this way as being “relevant foreign tax residents”. CRS reporting 1.6 Reporting NZFIs will be required to report prescribed 9 identity and financial information annually to Inland Revenue about accounts they have identified as being held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) by a relevant foreign tax resident if: • The person is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction (a jurisdiction that New Zealand will provide AEOI information to). These are known as “Reportable Persons.” Reporting NZFIs will also have the option of adopting what is known as the “wider approach” to reporting and reporting to Inland Revenue all accounts that they have identified as being held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) by a relevant foreign tax resident, irrespective of whether those persons are resident in Reportable Jurisdictions. This is a compliance cost measure. 9 The information that Reporting NZFIs will need to report about such accounts is outlined in detail at paragraph 6 of this guidance. 11 This is because a Reporting NZFI that chooses to adopt the wider approach to reporting would simply be able to report all of the relevant foreign tax residents they have identified without needing to constantly review the list of Reportable Jurisdictions. For the purposes of this guidance such accounts will be referred to as being “reportable accounts”. Reporting NZFIs will also be required to report to Inland Revenue certain accounts where they have not been able to determine the residency of an account holder. These are known as “undocumented accounts”. 10 New Zealand will be adopting a 31 March tax year for CRS due diligence and reporting purposes. 11 For these purposes, any reference in the CRS (and the related Commentary) to calendar year should be read as referring to the relevant period ended 31 March unless the context requires otherwise. In broad terms, Reporting NZFIs will have a window from 1 April to 30 June of the year to report to Inland Revenue the prescribed information about their reportable accounts for the period ended 31 March. (The CRS reporting for a particular period will generally only cover accounts identified as reportable by the end of the 31 March reporting period. However, as explained further below, there is a special rule for the first two periods, which will require immediate reporting of certain reportable accounts.) Inland Revenue will sort all the information it receives from Reporting NZFIs. It will identify the information for those accounts that are held (and/or controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents from Reportable Jurisdictions (known as Reportable Persons) and will provide the prescribed information about those accounts (and persons) to those jurisdictions by 30 September of the relevant year. These timeframes for CRS reporting and exchanging are in line w ith the FATCA t imelines. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI bank maintains an account held by Tom. The bank carries out due diligence on the account and determines that Tom is tax resident in jurisdiction B. New Zealand has an AEOI exchange relationship to provide financial account information to jurisdiction B (i.e. jurisdiction B is a Reportable Jurisdiction). Therefore, the account is a held by a Reportable Person (Tom). The bank will be required to report prescribed information about the account to Inland Revenue in its annual CRS report by 30 June of the relevant year. Inland Revenue will then provide this information to jurisdiction B by 30 September. Example 2: A Reporting NZFI bank maintains an account held by Daniel. The bank carries out due diligence on the account and determines that Daniel is tax resident in jurisdiction C. New Zealand does not have an AEOI exchange relationship with jurisdiction C. Therefore, the account is held by a relevant person that is tax resident in a foreign jurisdiction (Daniel). However, it is not held by a person from a Reportable Jurisdiction (New Zealand does not have an AEOI exchange relationship to provide information to Daniel’s jurisdiction of tax residence – jurisdiction C). Therefore, the 10 The limited circumstances when a Reporting NZF I is required to report an account as an undocumented account are outlined at paragraphs 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of this guidance. Inland Revenue will not exchange “undocumented account” information. However, as contemplated at page 210 of the CRS Commentary, Inland Revenue may use such information for review and (in certain circumstances) audit activity. 11 The first period will be a transitional period running from 1 Jul y 2017 to 31 March 2018. 12 bank is not required to report this account. However, the bank may choose to adopt the “wider approach” to reporting. If the bank chooses to adopt the wider approach to reporting it would be required to report prescribed information about the account to Inland Revenue in its annual CRS report by 30 June of the relevant year. Meaning of “account holder” and “controlling person” for CRS purposes 1.7 As noted above, Reporting NZFIs will need to carry out due diligence on their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents. Reporting NZFIs will then need to report annually to Inland Revenue prescribed identity and financial account information about the reportable accounts they have identified. 12 There are three important “building blocks” that need to be highlighted at this point: • Who is an “account holder”? • When is it necessary to identify the “controlling persons” of an account holder? • Who will be the “controlling persons” of an account holder? Meaning of “account holder” for the purposes of CRS due diligence 1.8 As noted above, the CRS requires that Reporting NZFIs carry out due diligence on their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents. Therefore, a key threshold issue here is what constitutes who “holds” a financial account for CRS purposes. Section VIII(E)(1) of the CRS defines “account holder” as meaning: the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account by the Financial Institution that maintains the account. A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit or account of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for purposes of the Common Reporting Standard, and such other person is treated as holding the account. In the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, the Account Holder is any person entitled to access the Cash Value or change the beneficiary of the contract. If no person can access the Cash Value or change the beneficiary, the Account Holder is any person named as the owner in the contract and any person with a vested entitlement to payment under the terms of the contract. Upon the maturity of a Cash Value Insurance 12 Reporting NZFIs will also need to report undocumented accounts. The meaning of “undocumented account” is outlined at paragraphs 1.6, 5.2.3 and 5.3.3 of this guidance. 13 Contract or an Annuity Contract, each person entitled to receive a payment under the contract is treated as an Account Holder. Therefore, the general rule is that a Reporting NZFI should treat a person as an account holder if that person is listed or identified as holding the account (including both persons for joint accounts). However, th is is subject to a trace-through rule that applies where the account is held by a person, other than a financial institution, as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary for another person. In such circumstances, the other person that has been “identified” is the relevant account holder. Page 200 of the CRS Commentary provides that for the purposes of identifying “who” an account holder is, in terms of the application of this trace-through rule, a Reporting NZFI is able to rely on the information in their possession (including information collected for Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer procedures) to reasonably determine this point. In most cases, the issue of who holds an account will be fairly self-explanatory. However, the CRS Commentary also provides some useful clarification about how the “account holder” definition will apply in the context of estates, trusts and partnerships. For example, the CRS Commentary states (at page 200) that: • if a trust or an estate is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account the trust or the estate is the account holder, rather than its owners or beneficiaries; and • if a partnership is listed as the holder or owner of a financial account, the partnership is the account holder, rather than the partners of the partnership. Example 1: Reporting NZFI 1 maintains an account for a trustee of a family trust and correctly determines that the account is held by the trust. Example 2: Reporting NZFI 2 maintains an account listed in Tom’s name. Tom holds the account as nominee for Bill. Tom informs Reporting NZFI 2 of this fact when he opens the account. Reporting NZFI 2 correctly determines that the account is held by Bill. Example 3: Reporting NZFI 3 maintains an account held by financial institution 4. Financial institution 4 is a custodial institution that holds fund as custodian for various investors. Reporting NZFI 3 correctly determines that financial institution 4 is the account holder. Reporting NZFI 3 is not required to apply the “trace through” rule in the definition of account holder. This is because the person listed as holding the account is a financial institution. 13 13 However, as explained further below at paragraphs 5.5.2 and 5.6.2, a Reporting NZFI will be required to trace through a managed investment entity account holder that is tax resident in a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction to identify the entity’s controlling persons. This is because such entities are deemed to be passive non-financial entities, as opposed to financial institutions. 14 Identifying “controlling persons” for the purposes of CRS due diligence 1.9 As noted above, the CRS also requires that Reporting NZFIs carry out due diligence on their financial accounts to identify certain accounts controlled by relevant foreign tax residents. This extra step will apply if the account holder is a type of entity known as a passive non-financial entity. This then raises the question of what types of entities are passive non-financial entit ies. There are two types of entities 14 for CRS purposes: financial institutions and non-financial entit ies (NFEs). There are, in turn, four categories of financial institutions: • custodial institution; • depository institution; • investment entity; and • specified insurance company. The meaning of “financial institut ion” is outlined in detail further below at paragraph 3.1. If an entity is not a financial institution it will (by default) be a NFE. There are also two categories of NFEs: active NFEs and passive NFEs. An NFE that is not an active NFE will (by default) be a passive NFE. 14 The CRS definition of “entit y” is broad and i ncludes legal arrangements such as trusts. Financial Institution Non-financial Entity (NFE) Passive NFE (subject to look-through requirements) Active NFE 15 The following matters are relevant when determining whether an NFE is a “passive NFE” (and, therefore, subject to the above “look-through” rule): • In broad terms, a passive NFE will generally cover an entity that: o is not a financial institution; and o either derives predominantly (50% or more) passive income and / or has assets that predominantly produce or are held for the production of passive income. However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, if a registered charity is an NFE it would generally be an active NFE even if it derives predominantly passive income. The reader should refer to the definitions of NFE, active NFE, and passive NFE in Appendix 4 for further detail. • A managed investment entity (discussed below) that is tax resident in a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction is also deemed to be a passive NFE. If a Reporting NZFI maintains an account that is held by a passive NFE it will need to “look through” that entity to identify its controlling persons (just like under FATCA). This then raises the question of who would be a “controlling person” in this context. The CRS defines “controlling persons” of a passive NFE as meaning the natural persons who exercise control over the NFE (as summarised at pages 198 to 199 of the CRS Commentary). The term “controlling persons” must also be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. Th is is broadly in line with FATCA. In the case of a passive NFE trust, this term means the settlor(s), the trustee(s), the protector(s), the beneficiaries or classes of beneficiaries, and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. The CRS Commentary confirms (at page 199) that settlors, trustees, protectors and beneficiaries will be treated as controlling persons of a passive NFE trust irrespective of whether they actually exercise control over the trust. (In the case of a legal arrangement other than a trust, this term means the persons in equivalent or similar positions.) However, Reporting NZFIs that maintain accounts held by passive NFE trusts will have the option of treating discretionary beneficiaries of such trusts as being controlling persons only if these persons receive a distribution in the reporting period. As explained further below, a Reporting NZFI that chooses to exercise this option would be expected to have reasonable safeguards in place to determine whether the trust has made a distribution to a beneficiary in a particular reporting period (see page 17 of the OECD’s CRS implementation handbook). Furthermore, if the Reporting NZFI maintains an account held by a passive NFE trust where the beneficiary(ies) are designated by characteristics or by class, they should obtain sufficient information concerning the beneficiary(ies) to satisfy them that they will be able to establish the identity of the beneficiary(ies) at the time of the pay-out or when the beneficiary(ies) intends to exercise vested rights (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). 16 Options that a Reporting NZFI can adopt for CRS purposes 1.10 The CRS (and related Commentary) contain a number of “options” that Reporting NZFIs can adopt when carrying out these CRS due diligence procedures. The OECD’s CRS implementation handbook and answers to “Frequently Asked Questions” on its Automatic Exchange Portal (AEOI portal) 15 also build on these options by setting out various procedures that Reporting NZFIs are able to adopt when carrying out their CRS obligations. The purpose of these options is to minimise compliance costs and provide for the practical implementation of the CRS. Reporting NZFIs will generally be able to take advantage of any option set out in the CRS (and the related Commentary). Reporting NZFIs will also be able to adopt procedures endorsed by the OECD (including in the CRS implementation handbook and answers to “Frequently Asked Questions”) that are consistent with the CRS. The only current exceptions to this general ability to rely on such options are: • Reporting NZFIs will be required to adopt the reporting period ended 31 March. • Reporting NZFIs will be required to adopt the “wider approach to due diligence”. • Reporting NZFIs will not be able to adopt a transitional approach to the reporting of gross proceeds information (the reporting of gross proceeds information is explained further below). • Reporting NZFIs will not be able to use the average balance or value method. This guidance sets out further below the various CRS options that Reporting NZFIs will be able to take advantage of. These options are also summarised in Appendix 2. Ability for a Reporting NZFI to use Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your 1.11 Customer procedures and FATCA procedures for Common Reporting Standard purposes The CRS due diligence and reporting procedures build largely off a number of key concepts, definitions, procedures, and types of reportable information, from the FATCA IGA. Some of these procedures also leverage off Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Know your customer (KYC) procedures. This provides opportunities for a degree of regulatory alignment between CRS, FATCA, and AML/KYC procedures. This guidance highlights these areas. Appendix 1 also provides a summary of some of the areas where alignment can be achieved between the CRS and FATCA (and where alignment is not possible). 15 See the following link: http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/. 17 However, to the extent that there are any differences between CRS, FATCA and AML, the CRS itself (and the related Commentary), as implemented in New Zealand, will be the driver of CRS obligations. Penalties and anti-avoidance 1.12 As noted above, the success of the CRS for AEOI as a global standard will depend on how effectively and consistently it is implemented around the world. In this context, the OECD has recognised that the effectiveness of the CRS depends on implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) having legal and administrative frameworks to monitor compliance and penalise non-compliance. Therefore, there will be a penalty framework designed to penalise CRS non-compliance at various parts of the “information collection chain” – including the Reporting NZFI, the account holder and other persons connected with an account. The intention underpinning these provisions is to ensure that the required information is able to effectively flow from such persons to Reporting NZFIs and then to Inland Revenue for exchange. Section IX(A)(1) of the CRS and page 208 of the CRS Commentary also require implementing jurisdictions to supplement their compliance framework with an effective anti-avoidance rule. Th is should be designed to prevent persons from adopting practices intended to circumvent the CRS due diligence and reporting procedures. Accordingly, the New Zealand CRS implementing legislation includes an anti-avoidance rule that will apply to arrangements entered into by a person with a main purpose of avoiding CRS due diligence and reporting. The penalties and avoidance framework is set out in detail further below in paragraphs 9 to 10 of this guidance. Roadmap for the following guidance 2 This guidance will now, having set out some high-level background to the CRS for AEOI, outline some of the key CRS “building blocks” in more detail. The purpose of this detail is to highlight the following points: • Who needs to carry out CRS due diligence and reporting? – i.e. What determines when an entity is a Reporting NZFI? • What does CRS due diligence and reporting involve? – i.e. What due diligence and reporting (to Inland Revenue) does a Reporting NZFI need to do? The guidance will then set out how these principles apply in practice for particular types of entities. 18 For the purposes of the following guidance, the reference to “CRS” will be used to refer to the obligations that Reporting NZFIs will have to carry out due diligence and reporting on their financial accounts. The reference to “AEOI” will, in turn, be used to refer to the exchanging of information (which is facilitated by the CRS) between New Zealand (through Inland Revenue) and other jurisdictions. Reporting NZFIs for CRS purposes 3 As noted above, Reporting NZFIs will have CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. This raises the following questions: • When will an entity be a “financial institution”? • When will a financial institution be a “NZFI”? • When will a NZFI be a “Reporting NZFI”? Types of financ ial institutions 3.1 An “entity” will be a financial institution based on the activities that it carries out or how it is managed. It is important to note, for these purposes, that the CRS definition of “entity” covers both legal persons (for example, incorporated companies) and legal arrangements (for example, trusts). This means that such legal persons and legal arrangements can (depending on the circumstances) be financial institutions. However, the definition of “entity” does not cover individuals. This means that individuals cannot be financial institutions. There are four types of financial institutions covered by the CRS: • custodial institutions; • depository institutions; • investment entities; and • Specified insurance companies. These types of financial institutions are broadly similar to FATCA. 3.1.1Custodial institution The first type of financial institution is a custodial institution. 19 A custodial institution is an entity that holds, as a substantial portion of its business, financial assets for the account of others. In this context, a “substantial portion” means at least 20% of the entity’s gross income is attributable to holding financial assets and providing related financial services in the shorter of: • the three-year period ending immediately before the reportable period in which its status as a custodial institution is to be determined; or • the period in which the entity has been in existence. For the purposes of the following this will be referred to as the “specified period”. In this context, a “financial asset” generally covers all assets (including, for example shares, bonds, and money) other than physical commodities or direct interests in real property. Income attributable to holding financial assets and providing related financial services includes the following: • custody, account maintenance and transfer fees; • commissions and fees earned from executing and pricing securities transactions; • income earned from extending credit to customers; • income earned from contracts for differences and as the bid-ask spread of financial assets; • fees for providing financial advice; and • fees for providing clearance and settlement services. Example: Company A carries on a business of holding various financial assets (shares and bonds) as custodian for a unit trust (and performing related financial services for the trust). Company A has derived all of its income from such activities over the specified period. Company A is a custodial institution and, therefore, a financial institution. 3.1.2Depository institution The second type of financial institution is a depository institution. A depository institution is an entity that accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business. 20 An entity is considered to be engaged in a banking or similar business if, in the ordinary course of its business with customers, the entity accepts deposits or other similar investments of funds and regularly engages in one or more of the following activities: a makes personal, mortgage, industrial or other loans, or provides other extensions of credit; b purchases, sells, discounts or negotiates accounts receivable, instalment obligations, notes, drafts, cheques, bills of exchange, acceptances or other evidences of indebtedness; c issues letters of credit and negotiates drafts drawn thereunder; d provides trust or fiduciary services; e finances foreign exchange transactions; or f enters into, purchases, or disposes of finance leases or leased assets. A depository institution will include, for example: • a registered bank under the Reserve Bank Act 1989; and • non-bank deposit takers supervised by the Reserve Bank, such as credit unions and mutual building societies. 3.1.3Investment entity The third type of financial institution is an investment entity. Entities that typically meet this definition would include collective investment vehicles, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, venture capital funds, leveraged buy-out funds or any similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy of investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets. For example, this definition would generally capture unit trusts and managed investment schemes. This list is not exhaustive. Entities such as family trusts may be investment entities, particularly if the trust’s financial assets are managed by another financial institution. Fund managers and investment advisers will also often be investment entities. 21 There are two different sets of criteria for determining whether an entity is an investment entity. If an entity meets either of these it will generally be an investment entity. 16 “ Investment Entity” by vir tue of primar ily conducting an investment business for or on behalf of customers (in business investment entity) An entity will be an investment entity if it primarily conducts as a business for or on behalf of customers one or more of a number of specified investment activities. This is different from the corresponding limb of the FATCA definition of investment entity, which does not contain such a “primarily” requirement. 17 The activities that will bring the entity within the definition are: • Trading in – o money market instruments (cheques, bills, certificates of deposit, derivatives, etc); o foreign exchange; o exchange, interest rate and index instruments; o transferable securities; o commodity futures. • individual and collective portfolio management. • otherwise investing, administering or managing funds or money on behalf of other persons. For the purposes of this guidance such activities will be referred to as being “specified investment activities”. An entity is regarded as “primarily conducting as a business” these specified investment activities for customers when at least half of its gross income (50% or more) is derived from such specified investment activities in the shorter of: 16 The one exception to this is if the entity is an active NFE because it meets the criteria in subparagraphs D(9)(d) through (g) of section VIII of the CRS. The definition of “active NFE” is set out in full in Appendi x 4. 17 However, as explained in the F ATCA/CRS comparison chart in Appendi x 1, the FATCA U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” is in line with the CRS definition of “investment entity”. An entity can choose to adopt the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” for FATCA purposes (in lieu of the corresponding definition in the FATCA IGA) in order to achieve alignment here. 22 • the three-year period ending immediately before the reportable period in which its status as an investment entity is to be determined; or • the period in which the entity has been in existence. For the purposes of this guidance this period will be referred to as the “specified period”. Example 1: Wide Trust is a New Zealand unit trust that carries on, as its business, collective portfolio management activities for customers. Wide Trust derived 80% of its income from such acti vities over the specified period. Is the Wide Trust an “in business” investment entity? Yes: Wide Trust performed specified investment activities (collective portfolio management) for customers over the specified period. Wide Trust also derived its income “primarily” (50% or more) from such activities over that period. Therefore, Wide Trust is an “in business” investment entity. This means that Wide Trust is a financial institution. Example 2: A fund manager (an entity), among its various business operations, organises and manages a variety of funds, including Fund A, a fund that invests primarily in equities. The fund manager has earned all of its gross income over the specified period from providing such services. The fund manager hires an investment adviser (another entity) to provide advice and discretionary management of a portion of the financial assets held by Fund A. The investment adviser has earned all of its gross income over the specified period from providing such services. Is the fund manager an “in business” investment entity? Yes: The fund manager performed specified investment activities (fund management) for customers over the specified period. The fund manager also derived its income “primarily” (50% or more) from such activities over that period. Therefore, the fund manager is an “in business” investment entity. This means that the fund manager is a financial institution. Is the investment adviser an “in business” investment entity? Yes: The investment adviser performed specified investment activities (fund management and related advice) for customers over the specified period. The investment adviser also derived its income “primarily” (50% or more) from such activities over that period. Therefore, the investment adviser is an “in business” investment entity. This means that the investment adviser is a financial institution. “ Investment Entity” by vir tue of being managed by another financial i nstitution (managed investment entity) An entity will be a managed investment entity if: 23 • it derives its income “primarily” (at least half of its gross income – 50% or more) over the specified period from investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets; and • it is managed by another financial institution (other than a managed investment entity). This is different from the corresponding limb of the FATCA IGA definition of “investment entity”, which does not contain a “primarily” requirement for the portion of the entity’s income from financial assets (50% or more) and where the relevant “manager” needs to be an investment entity. 18 Meaning of “financial asset” In this context, a “financial asset” generally covers all assets (including, for example shares, bonds, and money) other than physical commodities or direct interests in real property. Meaning of “managed” by a financial institution Furthermore, in this context, an entity will be regarded as “managed” by another financial institution (that performs specified investment activities for it) where that financial institution has discretionary authority to manage the entity’s assets (either in whole or in part.) A financial institution trustee will generally manage a trust (in this regard). A trustee may also outsource management of the trust’s assets (either in whole or part). For example, where the trustee of a family trust sets the parameters within which a financial institution fund manager can invest some or all of the trust’s assets, but gives the fund manager full discretion to invest within those parameters, the trust’s assets will be managed by the fund manager. However, where the trustee retains full control over the investment decisions and the financial institution fund manager simply acts on instruction from the trustee without discretion, then the assets will not be managed by the fund manager. Furthermore, if a financial institution merely provides advice to an entity, this will not be sufficient by itself to mean that the financial institution manages the entity. It is the discretionary authority to manage the entity’s assets (either in whole or in part) that is crucial. An entity may be managed by a mix of other entities and individuals. If any of the persons involved in the management of the entity is a financial institution the entity will be regarded as managed by that financial inst itution. The residence of the financial institution manager is not relevant in this case. This part of the definition of “managed investment entity” simply requires that the manager is a financial institution (i.e. it does not specify where that institution needs to be resident). 18 However, as explained in the F ATCA/CRS comparison chart in Appendi x 1, the F ATCA U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” is in line with the CRS definition. An entit y can choose to adopt the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition for FATCA purposes (in lieu of the corresponding definition in the FATCA IGA) in order to achieve alignment between the relevant CRS and FATCA definitions of “investment entity”. 24 Example 3: A trust set up in New Zealand has the following investments: • interest-bearing accounts with two different Reporting NZFI banks; • shares and bonds under discretionary investment with a Reporting NZFI fund manager (a provider of discretionary investment management services – DIMS provider); and • a rental property. The trust derived 80% of its income from the accounts, share, and bonds (financial assets) over the specified period. The trust derived the other 20% of its income from the rental property. Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? Yes: The trust derives its income primarily (50% or more) from financial assets (the accounts, shares and bonds) over the specified period. The trust’s assets are also managed (in part) by a financial institution (the Reporting NZFI fund manager – DIMS provider). Therefore, the trust is a managed investment entity financial institution. Example 4: Kea Trust has assets that consist of shares and bonds. The trust has two individual trustees, one of which has been empowered to manage the trust’s assets. Kea Trust does not outsource any management of financial assets to any financial institution. Kea Trust derives its income primarily from the shares and bonds. Is the Kea Trust a “managed” investment entit y? No: The Kea Trust is managed by an individual trustee – an individual is not an “entity” under the CRS. It follows that the trustee cannot be a financial institution under the CRS. The trustee also does not outsource any management to any financial institution. Therefore, the trust is not a managed investment entity. Application of principles to interests in real property It is important to understand how these principles apply in the context of direct and indirect interests in real property. If an entity’s gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading in direct interests in real property, it will not be an investment entity irrespective of whether it is managed. This is because such interests are not financial assets. Example 5: A family trust holds a direct interest in an investment property, which it lets out to generate rental income. The trust has no other assets. The property is managed by a property management company, which arranges tenants and management of rental income and expenditure. 25 Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? No. The trust’s income is primarily attributable (50% or more) to investing in a direct interest in real property (not a financial asset). Therefore, the trust is not an investment entity. However, this principle does not apply to indirect interests in real property. Example 6: A family trust holds shares and units in various property funds. The property funds, in turn, hold interests in real property. The family trust organises for a Reporting NZFI provider of discretionary investment management services to have authority to manage these shares and units. The Reporting NZFI has authority to buy and sell shares and units in such property funds, subject to a mandate that they have agreed with the trustee. The family trust earns all of its income from investing in such shares/units over the specified period (i.e. receiving dividends from those investments). Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? Yes. The trust’s income is primarily attributable to the shares and units (financial assets). The trust is also managed by the Reporting NZFI. Therefore, the trust is a managed investment entity financial institution. 3.1.4Specified insurance company The fourth type of financial institution is a specified insurance company. What is a Specified Insurance Company? 3.1.4.1 For CRS purposes, an entity that is an insurance company (including its holding company) is treated as a “specified insurance company” if it : 19 • issues investment products that are classified as cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts; or • makes payments under the terms and conditions of these contracts. These types of insurance and annuity contracts usually include an investment component. In the New Zealand context and the CRS, an “insurance company” is an entity: • that is regulated as an insurance business under the laws of New Zealand; 19 See CRS section VIII.A(8) definition of “Specified Insurance Company”. 26 • the gross income of which (for example, gross premiums and gross investment income) arising from insurance, reinsurance, and annuity contracts for the immediately preceding period exceeds 50% of total gross income for such period; or • the aggregate value of the assets of which associated insurance, reinsurance and annuity contracts at any time during the immediately preceding period exceeds 50% of total assets at any time during that period. An insurance company that only provides general insurance 20 or term life insurance 21 is usually not a specified insurance company. Neither are reinsurance companies that only provide indemnity reinsurance contracts. These companies are treated instead as non-financial entit ies. Most life insurance companies are generally considered to be specified insurance companies. However, entities that do not issue cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts, and are not obligated to make payments with respect to them, such as most non-life insurance companies, most holding companies of insurance companies and insurance brokers, are usually not specified insurance companies. 22 An insurance broker entity that sells cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts on behalf of an insurance company (and is part of the payment chain), will not be a specified insurance company unless it is obliged to make payments to the account holder under the terms of these contracts. Additionally, the reserving activities of an insurance company do not, themselves, cause it to become another type of financial institution, such as a custodial institution, a depository institution, or an investment entity. As noted above, an insurance company (including its holding company) is treated as a “specified insurance company” if it: 23 • issues investment products that are classified as cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts; or • makes payments under the terms and conditions of these contracts. 20 General insurance is typically any insurance that is not life insurance (other than term life policies), does not include any i nvestment component, and provides payments for economic loss from particular adverse events. For example: business or commercial, health, home and home contents, income protection, motor vehicle, public liability, travel, etc. 21 The CRS includes as an Excluded Account certain term life insurance contracts that meet the conditions specified in CRS section VIII.C(17)(c). See also the CRS Commentary on Section VIII, paragraphs 86 and 91, pages 184 to185 which use the wording “term life insurance contract”. 22 See CRS Commentary, paragraph 28 on page 165. 23 See CRS section VIII.A(8) definition of “Specified Insurance Company”. 27 Therefore, there are two key questions that feed into what comprises a specified insurance company: • what constitutes a “cash value insurance contract”; and • what constitutes an “annuity contract”? What is a “cash value insurance contract”? 3.1.4.2 Definition of “Cash Value Insurance Contract” The te rm “cash value insurance contract” is defined to mean an insurance contract (other than an indemnity reinsurance contract between two insurance companies) that has a cash value. 24 A cash value insurance contract is an insurance contract where the policyholder is entitled to receive payment on surrender or termination of the contract. Definition of “Insurance Contract” The CRS defines the term “insurance contract” 25 as meaning a contract (other than an annuity contract) under which the issuer agrees to pay an amount upon the occurrence of a specified contingency involving mortality, morbidity, accident, liability or property risk. Definition of “Cash Value” The CRS defines “Cash Value” 26 as the greater of: • the amount that the policyholder is entitled to receive on the termination or surrender of the contract without reduction for any surrender charge or loans outstanding against the policy. For example, when the policyholder receives an annual statement of the value of the policy that will be the cash value in that year; and • the amount the policyholder can borrow against according to the policy. Note that the policyholder does not need to have pledged the account as collateral for borrowing for this second test to apply. It is the amount that the policyholder could expect to borrow against the cash value insurance contract if they chose to use it as collateral for a loan. 24 CRS section VIII.C(7); CRS Commentary, pages 179 to181. 25 CRS section VIII.C(5). 26 CRS section VIII.C(8). 28 However, the term “Cash Value” excludes any amount payable under an insurance contract: • solely by reason of the death of an individual insured under a life insurance contract; or • as a personal injury or sickness benefit or other benefit providing indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of the event insured against; or • as a refund of a previously paid premium (less cost of insurance charges whether or not actually imposed) under an insurance contract (other than an investment-linked life insurance or annuity contract) due to cancellation or termination of the contract, decrease in risk exposure during the effective period of the contract, or arising from the correction of a posting or similar error with regard to the premium for the contract; or • as a policyholder dividend (other than a termination dividend) provided that the dividend relates to an insurance contract under which the only benefits payable are described in subparagraph C(8)(b); or • as a return of an advance premium or premium deposit for an insurance contract for which the premium is payable at least annually if the amount of the advance premium or premium deposit does not exceed the next annual premium that will be payable under the contract. Excluded from the term “Cash Value” is also an amount payable under an insurance contract as a personal injury or sickness benefit, or other benefit, providing indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of the event insured against. 27 Such “other benefit” does not include any benefit payable under an “investment-linked life insurance or annuity contract”. A policyholder dividend that satisfies all the requirements described in subparagraph C(8)(d) of Section VIII of the CRS (per above), and relating to a personal injury or sickness insurance policy, is also excluded from the term “Cash Value”. A “policyholder dividend” is any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such, including: • an amount paid or credited (including as an increase in benefits) if the amount is not fixed in the contract but rather depends on the experience of the insurance company or the discretion of management; 27 CRS section VIII.C(8)(b). 29 • a reduction in the premium that, but for the reduction, would have been required to be paid; and • an experience-rated refund or credit based solely upon the claims experience of the contract or group involved. A policyholder dividend cannot exceed the premiums previously paid for the contract, less the sum of the cost of insurance and expense changes (whether or not actually imposed) during the contract’s existence and the aggregate amount of any prior dividends paid or credited according to the contract. A policyholder dividend does not include any amount that is in the nature of interest that is paid or credited to a contract holder to the extent that the amount exceeds the minimum rate of interest required to be credited with respect to contract values under local law. The CRS provides a further exclusion from cash value in relation to a return of an advance premium or premium deposit for an insurance contract for which the premium is payable at least annually, if the amount of the advance premium or premium deposit does not exceed the next annual premium that will be payable under the contract. Investment-linked insurance contracts Investment-linked insurance contracts are treated as cash value insurance contracts for CRS purposes. An “investment-linked insurance contract” means an insurance contract under which benefits, premiums, or the period of coverage are adjusted to reflect the investment return or market value of assets associated with the contract. 28 Insurance wrapper products Insurance wrapper products, such as private placement life insurance contracts, are generally considered to be cash value insurance contracts. An “insurance wrapper product” usually includes an insurance contract, the assets of which are: • held in an account maintained by a financial institution; and • managed in accordance with a personalised investment strategy or under the control or influence of the policyholder, owner or beneficiary of the contract. 28 CRS Commentary, paragraph 76 on page 180. 30 What is an “annuity contract”? 3.1.4.3 The te rm “Annuity Contract” 29 is defined in the CRS to mean a contract under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a period of time determined in whole or in part by reference to the life expectancy of one or more individuals. The te rm “Annuity Contract”, also includes a contract that is considered to be an annuity contract in accordance with the law, regulation or practice of the jurisdiction in which the contract was issued and under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a term of years. For CRS purposes, the following are not considered to be reportable annuity contracts: • certain pension annuities; • certain immediate life annuities; • reinsurance of annuity contracts between insurance companies; and • periodic payment orders. Circumstances when a financial institution will be a “New Zealand Financial 3.2 Institution” This then raises the question of when such a financial institution will have a sufficient connection to New Zealand to be a “NZFI”. A financial institution will be a “NZFI” for CRS purposes if it is a New Zealand resident (excluding any branch located outside New Zealand) or has a New Zealand branch. The general rule is that a financial institution will be “resident” in New Zealand for CRS purposes and, be a NZFI, if it is tax-resident in New Zealand. However, there are special rules that apply for trusts and entities (other than trusts) that do not have a tax residency. In the case of a financial institution trust (irrespective of whether it is resident for tax purposes in New Zealand), the trust will generally be “resident” in New Zealand for CRS purposes, and, therefore an NZFI, if it has one or more trustees that are tax-resident in New Zealand. However, the exception to this is if the trust is tax-resident in another Participating Jurisdiction and reports all the information required to be reported according to the CRS (with respect to reportable accounts maintained by the trust) to that jurisdiction because it is a tax resident in that jurisdiction. 29 CRS section VIII.C(6). 31 Where a financial institution (other than a trust) does not have a tax residence (for example, a financial institution partnership may be treated as fiscally transparent), it will be resident in New Zealand and, therefore, be an NZFI, if: • it is incorporated under the laws of New Zealand; • it has its place of management (including effective management) in New Zealand; or • it is subject to financial supervision in New Zealand. Where such a financial institution (other than a trust) is resident in two or more participating jurisdictions, the financial institution will be subject to the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations of the jurisdiction in which it maintains the financial accounts. 30 A NZFI is generally able to adopt these same residency tests for FATCA purposes as well. This is also summarised in the CRS/FATCA comparison chart in Appendix 1. There are also special rules that apply in determining whether a financial institution has a branch in a participating jurisdiction (such as New Zealand). In this respect, a “branch” for CRS purposes is a unit, business or office of a financial institution that is treated as a branch under the regulatory regime of a jurisdiction or that is otherwise regulated under the laws of a jurisdiction as separate from other offices, units or branches of the financial institution. A branch includes a unit, business or office of an institution located in a jurisdiction in which the financial institution is resident, and a unit, business or office of a financial institution located in the jurisdiction in which the financial institution is created or organised. All units, businesses or offices of an institution in a single jurisdiction should be treated as a single branch. Circumstances when a NZFI will be a “Reporting New Zealand Financial 3.3 Institution” A NZFI will be a “Reporting NZFI” unless it is a “Non-Reporting NZFI”. The following guidance outlines the circumstances when a NZFI will be a Non-Reporting NZFI. Circumstances when a NZFI will be a “Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial 3.4 Institution” As explained below, the CRS explicitly defines various types of financial institutions as being non- reporting financial institutions. The CRS also provides scope for implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) to define other types of financial institution as being a non-reporting financial institution (i.e. non-reporting NZFIs in the context of New Zealand) if certain specified criteria are met. The Commissioner of Inland 30 This is assuming that the financial institution is a Reporting Financial Institution. 32 Revenue will determine what other types of financial institutions are “non-reporting New Zealand financial institutions” (in this regard) and publish a corresponding list of these institutions. This guidance sets out the types of financial institutions that the CRS specifically defines as being “non-reporting financial institutions”. It also sets out the criteria that will be used to determine whether any other types of financial institutions should also be treated as non-reporting financial institutions. Financial institutions that the CRS defines as being “Non-Reporting Financial 3.5 Institutions” Section VIII(B)(1) of the CRS defines a “non-reporting financial institution” as meaning any financial institution that comes within any of the following: a) a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank, other than with respect to a payment that is derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by a Specified Insurance Company, Custodial Institution or Depository Institution; b) a Broad Participation Retirement Fund; a Narrow Participation Retirement Fund, a Pension Fund of a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank or a Qualified Credit Card Issuer; c) any other Entity that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax, has substantially s imilar characteristics to any of the Entities described in subparagraphs B(1)(a) and (b), and is defined in domestic law as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution, provided that the status of such Entity as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution does not frustrate the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard; d) an Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle; or e) a trust to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a Reporting Financial Institution and reports all information required to be reported pursuant to Section I with respect to all Reportable Accounts of the trust (known as “trustee documented trusts”). A full list of the requirements that must be satisfied for these entities to be treated as Non-reporting Financial Institutions is set out in Appendix 7. It is important at this point to briefly outline the trustee documented trust category of non-reporting NZFI set out in section VIII(B)(1)(e) of the CRS. This category is likely to be particularly relevant to NZFI trusts that are managed investment entities and have financial institution corporate trustees. 33 The trustee documented trust category provides that a NZFI trust will be a non-reporting NZFI to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a reporting financial institution and reports all of the information required to be reported with respect to all reportable accounts of the trust. However, it is important to note that if the trustee of a Trustee-Documented Trust does not comply with these obligations the trust will, therefore, not be able to benefit from this exclusion and will be a reporting NZFI. In other words, where a trustee fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the trust will be responsible for completing due diligence or reporting as a reporting NZFI. Therefore, essentially, the trust will be reliant on the trustee complying with its obligations (on behalf of the trust) in order for the trust itself to have complied with the CRS. These points are explained at page 174 of the CRS Commentary. The scope of the various types of “non-reporting financial institutions” is explained in pages 166 to 174 of the CRS Commentary. Readers should refer to those pages of the Commentary for further context. Financial institutions that can be treated by implementing jurisdictions as 3.6 “Non-Reporting Financial Institutions” The CRS also provides in section VIII(B)(1)(c) that a “Part icipating Jurisdict ion” (such as New Zealand) can treat a financial institution as being a “non-reporting financial institution” if: • the financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax; • the financial institution has substantially similar characteristics to any of the types of institutions described in section VIII(B)(1)(a) or (b): Government entity, International Organisation, Central Bank, Broad Participation Retirement Fund, Narrow Participat ion Retirement Fund, Pension fund of a government entity (or International Organisation or Central Bank), or a Qualified Credit Card Issuer; • the financial institution is defined in domestic law as being a “non-reporting financial institution” (i.e. in accordance with a legislative framework that allows the financial institution to be listed as a “non-reporting financial institution”); and • defining the financial institution as a non-reporting financial institution does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. The expectation is that participat ing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) will make their list of “non- reporting financial institutions” publicly available and that each jurisdiction will have a single list of non-reporting financial institutions, as opposed to different lists for different part icipat ing jurisdictions. 34 NZFIs are able to provide submissions (by 31 January 2017) to be considered for being treated as Non-Reporting NZFIs under this provision. These submissions should outline why the NZFI satisfies all of the bullet points outlined above. Pages 170 to 173 of the CRS Commentary provide the following context on how this exemption is intended to apply. This should assist NZFIs that intend to make a submission that they should be treated as Non-Reporting NZFIs. 3.6.1The financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax The first requirement described in subparagraph B(1)(c) of Section VIII of the CRS is that the financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax. Factors that may be considered to determine such a risk include: • Low-risk factors: o the financial institution is subject to regu lat ion; and o information reporting by the financial institution to the tax authorities is required. • High-risk factors: o the type of financial institution is not subject to AML/KYC Procedures; and o the type of financial institution is allowed to issue shares in bearer form and is not subject to effective measures implementing the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations with respect to transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons, and o the type of financial institution is promoted as a tax minimisat ion vehicle. 3.6.2The financial institution has substantially similar characteristics to any of types of institutions described in section VIII(B)(1)(a) or (b) of the Common Reporting Standard The second requirement described in subparagraph B(1)(c) of section VIII of the CRS is that the financial institution has substantially similar characteristics to any of the following types of financial institutions described in subparagraphs B(1)(a) or (b) of section VIII of the CRS: • Government Entity, International Organisation, Central Bank; • Broad Part icipation Retirement Fund; 35 • Narrow Part icipation Retirement Fund; • A pension fund of a Government Entity, International Organisation, Central Bank; or • Qualified Credit Card Issuer. This requirement cannot be used solely to eliminate a specific element of a description. Each jurisdiction may evaluate the application of this requirement to a type of financial institution that does not satisfy all the requirements of a particular description listed in subparagraphs B(1)(a) or (b). As part of such evaluation, a jurisdiction (such as New Zealand) must identify which requirements are satisfied and which are not satisfied, and with respect to the requirements that are not satisfied, must identify the existence of a substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the relevant type of financial institution presents a low-risk of tax evasion. Page 172 of the CRS Commentary sets out (as a guideline) the following examples to illustrate the points that will be relevant when determining whether a financial institution should be treated as a non-reporting financial institution under subparagraph B(1)(c) of section VIII of the CRS. This should assist NZFIs that intend to make a submission that they should be treated as Non-Reporting NZF Is: Example 1 (Non-profit organisation): A type of non-profit organisation that is a financial institution does not satisfy all the requirements of any particular description listed in subparagraphs B(1)(a) or (b). This type of non-reporting financial institution cannot be defined in domestic law as a non-reporting financial institution solely because it is a non-profit organisation. Example 2 (Retirement fund also for self-employed individuals): A type of retirement fund that is a Financial Institution satisfies all the requirements listed in subparagraph B(5). However, under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the fund is established or operates, it is required to also provide benefits to beneficiaries that are self-employed individuals. Because there is an overall substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the fund presents a low-risk of tax evasion, this type of financial institution could be defined in domestic law as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution. Example 3 (Unlimited retirement fund): A type of retirement fund that is a Financial Institution satisfies all the requirements listed in subparagraph B(6), apart from the one contained in subparagraph B(6)(c) (i.e. employee and employer contributions are not limited). However, the tax relief associated to the employee and employer contributions is limited by reference to earned income and compensation of the employee, respectively. Because there is a substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the fund presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of financial institution could be defined in domestic law as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution. Example 4 (Investment vehicle exclusively for retirement funds): A type of investment vehicle that is a Financial Institution is established exclusively to earn income for the benefit of one or more retirement or pension funds described in subparagraphs B(5) through (7), or retirement or pension accounts described in subparagraph C(17)(a). Because all the income of the vehicle inures to the 36 benefit of Non- Reporting Financial Institutions or excluded accounts, and there is an overall, substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the vehicle presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of financial institution could be defined in domestic law as a Non- Reporting Financial Institution. What “financial accounts” are subject to CRS due diligence? 4 This guidance has outlined the key “building blocks” that determine when an entity is a Reporting NZF I. The guidance now sets out the obligations that these Reporting NZFIs will have. Reporting NZFIs need to carry out due diligence on the “financial accounts” they “maintain” to identify accounts held (and/or, in the case of passive non-financial ent it ies, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents. This then raises the following questions: • what constitutes a “financial account”; and • when will a Reporting NZFI “maintain” a financial account? The term “financial account” includes: 31 • Depository Accounts; • Annuity Contracts; • Cash Value Insurance Contracts; • Custodial Accounts; and • Equity and debt interest in certain financial institutions (generally limited to investment entities ). A financial account does not, however, include any account that is an excluded account. A financial account will be “maintained” by a Reporting NZFI in the following circumstances: • in the case of a depository account, by the Reporting NZFI that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding the agent of a Reporting NZFI); 31 This is subject to a number of exclusions that are outlined below. 37 • in the case of a custodial account, by the Reporting NZFI that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a Reporting NZFI that holds assets in street name (i.e. in the broker’s name for an account holder in such institution); • in the case of a cash value insurance contract or an Annuity Contract, by the Reporting NZFI that is obligated to make payments with respect to the contract; and • in the case of any equity or debt interest in a Reporting NZFI that constitutes a financial account, by that institution. This guidance now provides a high level outline of the various types of financial accounts. This w ill assist Reporting NZFIs that maintain such accounts to determine what they need to carry out due diligence on. Depository account 4.1 A depository account is defined in paragraph C(2) of section VIII of the CRS as including any commercial, checking, savings, time or thrift account, or an account that is evidenced by a certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, certificate of indebtedness or other similar instrument maintained by a Reporting NZFI in the ordinary course of banking or similar business. It also includes an amount held by an insurance company pursuant to a guaranteed investment contract or similar agreement to pay or credit interest thereon. Annuity contract 4.2 Annuity contracts will generally be financial accounts. An “annuity contract” is defined in paragraph C(6) of section VIII of the CRS as meaning a contract under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a period of time determined in whole or in part by reference to the life expectancy of one or more individuals. It also includes a contract that is considered to be an annuity contract in accordance with the law, regulation or practice of the jurisdiction in which the contract was issued and under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a term of years. However, an annuity contract is not a financial account if it is a non-investment linked, non- transferable immediate life annuity issued to an individual monetising a pension or disability benefit provided under an excluded account. 32 32 The meaning of “excluded account” is outlined in detail further below in paragraph 4.6. 38 Cash value insurance contract 4.3 A “cash value insurance contract” will be a financial account. It is defined in paragraph C(7) of section VIII of the CRS as meaning an insurance contract (other than an indemnity reinsurance between two insurance companies) that has a cash value. There are three key elements to the definition of “cash value insurance contract”: • insurance contract; • cash value insurance contract; and • cash value. “insurance contract” is defined in the CRS in paragraph C(5) as a contract (other than an annuity contract) under which the issuer agrees to pay an amount upon the occurrence of a specified contingency involving mortality, morbidity, accident, liability or risk. Under paragraph C(7) of the CRS a “cash value insurance contract” means an insurance contract (other than an indemnity reinsurance contract between two insurance companies) that has a cash value. A “cash value” is the greater of the amount a policy holder is entitled to receive upon surrender of the policy, or the amount the policyholder can borrow under it, but does not include an amount payable: • solely upon the death of the insured under a life insurance contract; • as a personal injury or sickness benefit or other benefit providing indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of an event insured against; • as a refund of a previously paid premium due to cancellation or termination of the contract, decrease in risk exposure, or arising from the correction of a posting or similar error with regard to the premium for the contract; • as a policyholder dividend (other than a termination dividend) provided it relates to an insurance contract under which the only benefits payable are for a personal injury or sickness benefit, or other benefit providing indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of an event insured against; or 39 • as a return of an advance premium or premium deposit for which the premium is paid at least annually if the amount of the advance premium or premium deposit does not exceed the next annual premium payable. Custodial account 4.4 A “Custodial Account” is defined in paragraph C(3) of section VIII of the CRS as an account (other than an insurance contract or annuity contract) for the benefit of another person that holds one or more financial assets. As noted above, a financial asset generally covers all assets (including, for example shares, bonds and money) other than physical commodities or direct interests in real property. Equity or debt interest 4.5 4.5.1Equity or debt interest in an investment entity A debt or equity interest in an investment entity is generally considered a financial account. This then raises the following questions: • what constitutes an equity interest; • what constitutes a debt interest; and • when is an equity or debt interest in an investment entity a financial account? What is an “equity interest”? 4.5.1.1 In the case of a partnership that is a financial institution, the term “equity interest” means a capital or profits interest in the partnership. In the case of a trust that is a financial institution, an “equity interest” is considered to be held by any person treated as a settlor or beneficiary of all or a portion of the trust, or any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust (see page 178, paragraph 69 of the CRS Commentary). The following points are relevant in this regard: • If a settlor or beneficiary is an entity the relevant equity interest will be held by the controlling persons of that entity. • A person will be treated as being a beneficiary of a trust if they have the right to receive (directly or indirectly) a mandatory or discretionary distribution from the trust (see page 178, paragraph 69 of the CRS Commentary). However, a discretionary beneficiary will only be 40 treated as having an equity interest if a distribution is paid or payable in the period (i.e. the person receives a distribution in a period). 33 • The reference to “other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust” would, at a minimum, include the trustee. The same criteria for a trust that is a financial institution are applicable for a legal arrangement that is equivalent or similar to a trust, or a foundation that is a financial institution. What is a debt interest? 4.5.1.2 A debt interest would cover amounts loaned to a financial institution and securities and bonds that are not equity interests. When is an equity or debt inter est in an investment entity a financial account? Equity or debt interests in an investment entity will generally be financial accounts (of that entity). It is important to note that the entity does not need to solely be an investment entity (i.e. it could come within another category of financial institution as well). Th is is d ifferent from FATCA, which requires that the financial institution is solely an investment entity in order for such an interest to be a financial account. Equity or debt interests in an investment entity would include, for example, interests in an entity: • that is a professionally managed investment entity; or • that holds itself out as a collective investment vehicle, mutual fund, exchange traded fund, private equity fund, hedge fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund or any similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy or investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. However, the definition of “Financial Account” does not include any equity or debt interest in an entity that is an investment entity solely because it (i) renders investment advice to, and acts on behalf of, or (ii) manages portfolios for, and acts on behalf of, a customer for the purpose of investing, managing or administering financial assets deposited in the name of the customer with a financial institution other than that entity. 33 The OECD has confirmed in an answer to a “Frequentl y Asked Question” that if a discretionary beneficiary receives a distribution in a given period, but not in a following period, the absence of a distribution in the following year should generally not constitute an account closure. However, the exception to this is if the beneficiary is permanentl y excluded from receiving future distributions from the trust (i.e. that would constitute closure of the account). 41 Example: If Investment Entity A (a fund manager) merely facilitated investing a customer’s funds in the customer’s name with an investment entity unit trust the customer would not have an equity interest in Investment Entity A. Instead, the customer would have an equity interest in the unit trust. This means that it would be the unit trust that carries out due diligence on the customer. 4.5.2Equity or debt interest in another type of financial institution An equity or debt interest in any other type of financial institution will also be a financial account if the interest was established with a purpose of avoiding reporting under the general CRS reporting requirements. What accounts are excluded from being “financial accounts”? 4.6 As noted above, Reporting NZFIs need to carry out due diligence on financial accounts they maintain. However, a financial account does not include an account that is an excluded account. This raises the question of what accounts are “excluded accounts” for these purposes, and therefore, excluded from CRS due diligence. 4.6.1Accounts that the CRS explicitly defines as “excluded accounts” The CRS defines “excluded account” as meaning the following accounts in section VIII(C)(17(a) to (f): • retirement and pension accounts; • non-retirement tax-favoured accounts; • term life insurance contracts; • estate accounts; • escrow accounts; and • depository accounts due to non-returned overpayments. The scope of these “excluded accounts” is explained in pages 184 to 187 of the CRS Commentary. Readers should refer to those pages of the Commentary for further background. A full list of the requirements that must be satisfied for these accounts to be excluded is also set out in Appendix 5. 42 4.6.2Accounts that can be treated as “Excluded Accounts” The CRS also provides in section VIII(C)(17)(g) that an implementing jurisdiction (such as New Zealand) can treat an account as an excluded account if: • The account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax. • The account has substantially similar characteristics to any of types of accounts that are explicit ly defined in the CRS as “excluded accounts” (see above). • The account is defined in domestic law as an excluded account (i.e. in accordance with a legislative framework that allows the account to be listed as an excluded account). • Defining the account as an “excluded account” would not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will determine what types of accounts are “excluded accounts” (in this regard). The expectation is that jurisdictions will make their list of excluded accounts publicly available (just like the list of non-reporting financial institutions) and that they will have a single list of excluded accounts, as opposed to different lists for different Participating Jurisdictions. Therefore, Inland Revenue will produce a single list of excluded accounts. Reporting NZFIs are able to make submissions (by 31 January 2017) for their accounts to be treated as excluded accounts under this provision. Submitters should outline why the account satisfies all of the bullet points outlined above. The CRS Commentary also provides the following context to the criteria that will need to be satisfied before an account is treated as an “excluded account” (in this way) by an implementing jurisdiction (such as New Zealand). Submitters should consider these points when they are preparing their submission. The account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax 4.6.2.1 The first requirement for an account to be treated as an excluded account under Section VIII(C)(17)(g) of the CRS is that the account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax. The CRS Commentary provides that the following factors may be used when considering whether an account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax: • Low-risk factors: o the account is subject to regulation; o the account is tax-favoured; 43 o information reporting to the tax authorities is required with respect to the account; o contributions or the associated tax relief are limited; and o the type of account provides appropriately defined and limited services to certain types of customers, so as to increase access for financial inclusion purposes. • High-risk factors: o the type of account is not subject to AML/KYC Procedures; and o the type of account is promoted as a tax minimisation vehicle. The account has substantially similar characteristics to any of types of accounts that are explicitly defined in the CRS as “excluded accounts” in section VIII(c)(17)(a) to (f). The second requirement for such an account being treated as an “excluded account” is that the account has substantially similar characteristics to any types of accounts that are explicitly defined in section VIII(C)(17(a) to (f) of the CRS as “excluded accounts”. The CRS Commentary also provides that the requirement that the account has substantially similar characteristics to any types of accounts that are explicitly defined in the CRS as “excluded accounts” cannot be used solely to eliminate a specific element of a description. Each jurisdiction (including New Zealand) may evaluate the application of this requirement to a type of account that does not satisfy all the requirements of an explicitly “excluded account” in section VIII(C)(17(a) to (f) of the CRS. As part of the evaluation, a jurisdiction (including New Zealand) must identify which requirements are satisfied and which are not satisfied, and with respect to the requirements that are not satisfied, must identify the existence of a substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the relevant type of account presents a low risk of tax evasion. Page 189 of the CRS Commentary sets out (as a guideline) the following examples to illustrate the points that will be relevant when determining whether an account could be treated as “excluded accounts” under section VIII(C)(17)(g). Submitters should consider these examples for further context. Example 1 (Un limited annuity contract): A type of annuity contract satisfies all the requirements listed in subparagraph C(17)(a), apart from the one contained in subparagraph C(17)(a)(v) (i.e. contributions are not limited). However, the applicable penalties apply to all withdrawals made before reaching a specified retirement age and include taxing the contributions that were previously tax-favoured with a high flat-rate surtax (e.g. 60%). Because there is a substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the account presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of account could be defined in domestic law as an excluded account. 44 Example 2 (Unlimited savings account): A type of savings account satisfies all the requirements listed in subparagraph C(17)(b), apart from the one contained in subparagraph C(17)(b)(iv) (i.e. contributions are not limited). However, the tax relief associated to the contributions is limited by reference to an indexed amount. Because there is a substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the account presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of account could be defined in domestic law as an excluded account. Example 3 (Micro cash value insurance contract): A type of cash value insurance contract only satisfies the requirement described in subparagraph C(17)(b)(i) (i.e. it is regulated as a savings vehicle for purposes other than for retirement). However, under the micro insurance regulations of the Participating Jurisdiction, (i) it is targeted to individuals (or groups of individuals) that are below the poverty line (e.g. living on less than USD 1.25 per person per day in 2005 US dollars), and (ii ) the total gross amount payable under the contract cannot exceed USD 7,000. Because there is an overall, substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the account presents a low-risk of tax evasion, this type of account could be defined in domestic law as an excluded account. Example 4 (Social welfare account): A type of savings account only satisfies the requirement described in subparagraph C(17)(b)(i) (i.e. it is regulated as a savings vehicle for purposes other than for retirement). However, under the social welfare regulations of the Participating Jurisdiction, it can solely be held by an individual that (i ) is below the poverty line (e.g. living on less than USD 1.25 per person per day in 2005 US dollars) or otherwise low-income, and (ii) is participating in a social welfare programme. Because there is an overall substitute requirement that provides equivalent assurance that the account presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of account could be defined in domestic law as an excluded account. Example 5 (Financial inclusion account): A type of depository account only satisfies the requirements described in subparagraph C(17)(b)(i) and (iv) (i.e. it is regulated as a savings vehicle for purposes other than for retirement, and annual contributions are limited). However, under the financial regulations of the Participating Jurisdiction, (i) it provides defined and limited services to individuals, so as to increase access for financial inclusion purposes; (ii ) monthly deposits cannot exceed USD 1,250 (excluding deposits by an authorised government body under a social welfare programme); and (iii) financial institutions have been allowed to apply simplified AML/ KYC Procedures with respect to this type of account, since it has been regarded as having a lower money laundering and terrorist financing risk in accordance with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. Because there are overall substitute requirements that provide equivalent assurance that the account presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of account could be defined in domestic law as an excluded account. Example 6 (Dormant account): A type of depository account (i) with an annual balance that does not exceed USD 1,000, (ii) that is a dormant account (see paragraph 9 of the CRS Commentary on section III). Because there are overall substitute requirements that provide equivalent assurance that the account presents a low risk of tax evasion, this type of account could be defined in domestic law as an excluded account during the dormancy period. 45 What does the CRS “due diligence” process involve? 5 This guidance has set out above: • when an entity will be a Reporting NZFI with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations; and • what financial accounts will be in scope for such CRS due diligence. It now outlines what the CRS due diligence process will involve. High level overview of the CRS due diligence process 5.1 The CRS requires that Reporting NZFIs carry out due diligence on their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in the case of passive NFEs, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents. 34 Reporting NZFIs will need to use different due diligence procedures (in this regard) depending on when the financial account is opened and whether the account is held by an individual or entity. The following is a high-level summary of these different due diligence procedures. A more detailed outline is provided further below: • Pre-existing individual accounts: Accounts held by an individual that are open as of 30 June 2017. These accounts are, in turn, split into the following categories: o lower-value accounts with a balance or value of less than USD 1,000,000; and o high-value accounts with a balance or value of USD 1,000,000 or more. As explained further below, Reporting NZFIs will be required to carry out enhanced due diligence on these high-value accounts. 34 However, there are some special rules that apply here for identifying such foreign tax residents in the context of certain insurance products that provide death benefits to beneficiaries and for employer-sponsored group insurance schemes (see page 153 of the CRS Commentary). 46 Pre-existing individual account due diligence will generally involve the Reporting NZFI either: o applying a “residential address test” 35 (supported by documentary evidence) to determine whether the account holder is a foreign tax resident; or o reviewing the information they have for indicia (indicators) that the account holder is a foreign tax resident. 36 For example, the Reporting NZFI may identify in its electronic records that the account holder has a mailing address in a foreign jurisdiction and is a foreign tax resident. • New individual accounts: Accounts held by an individual that are opened on or after 1 July 2017 (for example, an account that an individual opens with a bank on 10 August 2017). New individual account due diligence will generally involve the Reporting NZFI: o obtaining self-certifications from the account holder as to whether they are a relevant foreign tax resident (i.e. the account holder signing or affirming whether they are a foreign tax resident); and o cross-checking the reasonableness of this self-certification against other information obtained in connection with the opening of the account (including AML/KYC information). This process is known as “validating” the self-cert ificat ion. This is important because a Reporting NZFI cannot rely on a self-certification or documentary evidence if they know or have reason to know that it is incorrect or unreliab le. • Pre-existing entity accounts: Accounts held by an entity (such as a trust, partnership or company) that are open as of 30 June 2017. Pre-existing entity account due diligence will generally invo lve the Reporting NZFI relying on a combination of information on file and valid self-certifications to determine: 35 As explained in detail further below, a Reporting NZFI is only able to adopt the “residential address test” for lower value pre-existing individual accounts. 36 If a Reporting NZF I mai ntains a pre-existing individual account (as of 30 June 2017), and has already carried out due diligence on the account for FATCA purposes, it is generally able to rely on the residential address test or indicia review for CRS purposes (i.e. generally the Reporting NZFI will not need to obtain a further self-certification for CRS purposes). 47 o whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident; and o whether the account holder is a passive NFE with controlling persons that are relevant foreign tax residents. • New entity accounts: Accounts held by an entity (such as a trust, partnership or company) and that are opened on or after 1 July 2017. New entity account due diligence will generally involve the Reporting NZFI obtain ing valid self-certifications to determine: o whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident; and o whether the account holder is a passive NFE with controlling persons that are relevant foreign tax residents. These due diligence procedures often involve the Reporting NZFI relying (in part) on documentary evidence to determine the residency of the account holder (or controlling person). The relevant types of documentary evidence are summarised in Appendix 3. There are also a number of threshold rules and exclusions that feed into these due diligence procedures. 37 For example: • Pre-existing individual accounts: There is a USD 1,000,000 balance test (which a Reporting NZFI can simply treat as NZD 1,000,000), which will determine whether an account is a lower-value account or a high-value account. For example, whether or not the balance or value of the account is USD 1,000,000 or more on 30 June 2017 or any subsequent 31 March, and, therefore is a h igh-value account subject to enhanced due diligence. • Pre-existing entity accounts: There is a USD 250,000 de minimis threshold exclusion (which a Reporting NZFI can simply treat as NZD 250,000) from due diligence and reporting. Th is would apply if the account has a balance or value that does not exceed USD 250,000 on 30 June 2017 or any subsequent 31 March. A Reporting NZFI is able to choose not to adopt this threshold exclusion. • Pre-existing entity accounts: A USD 1,000,000 balance test (which a Reporting NZFI can simply treat as NZD 1,000,000), which will determine what due diligence process the Reporting NZFI needs to follow to identify whether any of a passive NFE’s controlling 37 The method that a Reporting NZFI should use for determining the balance or value of an account is outlined in detail in paragraph 6.2 of this guidance. 48 persons are foreign tax residents. The Reporting NZFI will need to obtain self-cert ificat ions if the balance exceeds USD 1,000,000. The CRS also contains various aggregation rules a Reporting NZFI will need to adopt when applying these threshold balance tests. These aggregation rules cover the following circumstances: • Aggregation of individual accounts: For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of financial accounts held by an individual: o A Reporting NZFI is required to aggregate all financial accounts maintained by the Reporting NZFI, or by a related entity, 38 but only to the extent that the Reporting NZF I’s computerised systems link the financial accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or taxpayer identification number (TIN), and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held financial account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held financial account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described above. And: o For the purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of pre-exist ing individual financial accounts held by a person to determine whether a financial account is a high-value account, a Reporting NZFI is also required:  In the case of any financial accounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly or indirectly owned, controlled or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts. • Aggregation of entity accounts: For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of financial accounts held by an entity, a Reporting NZFI is required to take into account all financial accounts that are maintained by the Reporting NZFI, or by a related entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting NZFI’s computerised systems link the financial accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held financial account shall be attributed the 38 Under the CRS an entity is a “related entity” of another entity if either entity controls the other entity or the two entities are under common control. For this purpose, control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the vote and value of such entity. Additionally, two managed investment entities can be related entities if they are under common management and such management fulfils the due diligence obligations of such investment entities. 49 entire balance or value of the jointly held financial account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described above. Reporting NZFIs are required to carry out these due diligence procedures on their financial accounts (including applying these balance or value thresholds and aggregation rules) to determine whether these accounts are held (and/or, in the case of a passive NFE, controlled) by foreign tax residents. It is important to note that these due diligence requirements are not merely a one-off “snapshot”. Instead, these requirements are on-going in nature. For example, suppose that a Reporting NZFI has carried out due diligence on an individual account holder, obtained a valid self-certification from that account holder (supported by documentary evidence), and has determined that the account is not held by a foreign tax resident. The expectation in the CRS is that the Reporting NZFI will have procedures in place to identify when there is subsequently a “change in circumstances” that may call into question the validity of the self- certification (or documentary evidence) and require it to carry out further due diligence. Th is is in line with an over-arching pillar in the CRS that a Reporting NZFI cannot rely on a self-cert ification, documentary evidence or other information to determine the CRS status of an account if they know or have reason to know that it is incorrect or unreliable (i.e. potentially because of a change in circumstance that calls it into question). Page 130 of the CRS Commentary states (in this regard) that: ...a Reporting Financial Institution is expected to institute procedures to ensure that any change that constitutes a change in circumstances is identified by the Reporting Financial Institution. (Emphasis added). Page 116, paragraph 17 of the CRS Commentary, in turn, provides that a “change in circumstances” includes any change that results in the addition of information relevant to a person’s status or otherwise conflicts with such a person’s status. In addition, a change in circumstances includes any change or addition of information to the account (including the addition, substitution or other change of an account holder) or any change or addition of information to any account associated with such an account (applying the aggregation rules) if that change or addition of information affects the status of the account. The emphasis here is on Reporting NZFIs having procedures in place to identify and follow up on changes that may affect the classification of a financial account. This would include: • having procedures in place to identify the addition of indicia 39 of foreign tax residence relating to an account; 39 The type of indicia that would be relevant i n this context would include the indicia of foreign tax residency described in the pre-existing individual account due diligence procedures (see section III(B)(2)(a)-(f) of the CRS), and that is explained in detail in paragraph 5.3.2 of this guidance. 50 • informing a person providing a self-certification or documentation relating to an account of the person’s obligation to notify the Reporting NZFI of a change in circumstances that they are aware of (see pages 130 and 205 of the CRS Commentary). This is important because, as noted above, a Reporting NZFI cannot rely on a self-certification or documentation that it knows or has reason to know is incorrect or unreliable; • having procedures to ensure that any change to the customer master files that constitutes a change in circumstances is identified (see page 204 of the CRS Commentary); • having procedures in place to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances relating to a pre-exist ing h igh-value individual account that they act as relationship manager for (see section III(C)(9) of the CRS); • having procedures in place to identify when a pre-existing individual account has become a high-value account (and, therefore, subject to enhanced due diligence procedures); and • if the Reporting NZFI maintains an account held by a passive NFE trust where the beneficiary(ies) is designated by characteristics or by class (i.e. as opposed to being individually named beneficiaries), it should obtain sufficient information concerning the beneficiary(ies) to satisfy itself that it will be able to establish the identity of the beneficiary(ies) at the time of the pay-out or when the beneficiary(ies) intends to exercise vested rights (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). Example 1: A Reporting NZFI obtains a self-certification on account opening that an account holder is resident in New Zealand. Three years after account opening, the account holder rings the Reporting NZFI to add a foreign mailing address to the account. This is a change in circumstances that calls into question the original self-certification. The Reporting NZFI would need to re-determine the status of the account. However, it important to note that a Reporting NZFI will not necessarily know or have reason to know about every change in circumstances pertaining to an account that they maintain. For example, a Reporting NZFI may have reasonable procedures in place to identify a change in circumstances, but still not identify a particular change. In this respect, page 130 of the CRS Commentary states that a Reporting NZFI may rely on a self-certification without having to enquire into possible changes of circumstances that may affect the validity of the statement, unless it knows or has reason to know that circumstances have changed. 51 Example 2: A Reporting NZFI has procedures in place to determine that a self-certification is correct (including informing any person providing a self-certification of the person’s obligation to notify them of a change in circumstances). An account holder has provided a self-certification that they are a New Zealand tax resident and are not a foreign tax resident. The account holder subsequently becomes a foreign tax resident. However, the account holder deliberately fails to inform the Reporting NZFI of this change. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI is not aware of this change. However, it is not at fault. In such circumstances, the Reporting NZFI would not have breached its CRS due diligence obligations. Detailed outline of due diligence procedures 5.2 This guidance now outlines in detail the due diligence procedures that Reporting NZFIs will need to carry out for the four different types of financial accounts: • pre-existing individual accounts (accounts held by an individual that are open as of 30 June 2017); • new individual accounts (accounts held by an individual that are opened on or after 1 July 2017); • pre-existing entity accounts (accounts held by an entity (such as a trust, partnership, or company) that are open as of 30 June 2017); and • new entity accounts (accounts held by an entity (such as a trust, partnership or company) that are opened on or after 1 July 2017). Pre-existing individual accounts 5.3 5.3.1Overview In broad terms, a pre-existing individual account is an account that is both: • maintained by a Reporting NZFI as of 30 June 2017; and • held by an individual. An additional account opened by a pre-existing customer on or after 1 July 2017 is also treated as a pre-existing account in the following circumstances: • the account holder holds with the Reporting NZFI (or a related entity in New Zealand) a financial account that is a pre-existing account; 52 • the Reporting NZFI (and any related entity) treats both accounts as a single account for the purposes of satisfying the “standards of knowledge” requirements and determining the balance or value of the account when applying any account thresholds; • if the financial account is subject to AML/KYC procedures, the Reporting NZFI is permitted to satisfy such procedures for the financial account by relying on the AML/KYC procedures performed for the pre-existing account; and • opening the financial account does not require the account holder to provide new, additional or amended customer information other than for the purposes of the CRS. A Reporting NZFI is generally required to carry out due diligence on all pre-existing individual financial accounts to determine whether they are held by relevant foreign tax residents. There is no de minimis threshold (compared with FA TCA, which has various de minimis thresholds). However, a Reporting NZFI is not required to review a pre-existing individual account that is a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract if they are effectively prohibited by law from selling the contract to relevant foreign tax residents. The type of due diligence procedures that the Reporting NZFI will need to carry out on pre-existing individual accounts will depend on whether: • the account is a lower value-account: With a balance or value of USD 1,000,000 or less (which a Reporting NZFI can simply treat as NZD 1,000,000) as of 30 June 2017; or • the account is a high value account: With a balance or value that exceeds USD 1,000,000 (which a Reporting NZFI can simply treat as NZD 1,000,000) as of 30 June 2017 or any subsequent 31 March. As explained further below, Reporting NZFIs need to carry out enhanced due diligence for high-value accounts. This raises the following questions: • What will due diligence involve for “lower-value” pre-existing individual accounts? • What will due diligence involve for “high-value” pre-existing individual accounts? 5.3.2CRS due diligence procedures for lower-value pre-existing individual accounts Reporting NZFIs have some flexibility when carrying out due diligence on lower-value pre-exist ing individual accounts: 53 • they can choose to adopt a “residence address test” as a proxy for determining whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident; or • alternatively, they can choose to rely on a “foreign indicia test” (searching for indicators that the account holder is a foreign tax resident) as a proxy for determining whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident. This guidance now explains how Reporting NZFIs can carry out due diligence under each of these due diligence pathways for lower-value accounts. R esidence address t est Reporting NZFIs have the option of using a current residence address test (based on documentary evidence) 40 as a proxy to determine whether a lower-value pre-existing individual account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident. This is a key difference from FATCA, which does not have such a test. Example: Reporting NZFI chooses to adopt the “residence address test” to determine the status of its lower-value pre-existing individual accounts. Reporting NZFI maintains a pre-existing individual account held by Claire. The account has a balance of NZD 10,000 as of 30 June 2017. The Reporting NZFI’s records show that Claire has a current residential address in foreign jurisdiction B. Reporting NZFI has documentary evidence supporting the fact that Claire is resident in foreign jurisdiction B. Reporting NZFI treats Claire as tax resident in foreign jurisdiction B for CRS purposes. If a Reporting NZFI has relied on the residence address test to determine an account holder’s tax residency (like the Reporting NZFI did for Claire in the above example) and there is a change in circumstances that causes the institution to know or have reason to know that the documentary evidence (or other documentation relied on) is incorrect or unreliable, it is are required to carry out further due diligence on the account to determine its status. This may involve redoing the residence address test or carrying out the indicia test outlined below. Indic ia test A Reporting NZFI that does not adopt the residential address test (or is not able to apply that test) will need to determine the account holder’s tax residence by reviewing its electronic records for relevant indicia (indicators) that the account holder is a foreign tax resident. Such indicia (if identified) will be used as a proxy for determining the account holder’s tax residence (i.e. indicia of tax residence in a foreign jurisdiction leading to a presumption of tax residence in that jurisdiction), unless the Reporting NZFI chooses to “cure” such indicia. The concept of “curing indicia” is outlined further below. 40 The relevant types of documentary evidence for CRS purposes are set out in Appendix 3 of this guidance. 54 The Reporting NZFI must (in these circumstances) review electronically searchable data that it maintains for records of the following indicia: a) identification of the account holder as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction; b) current mailing or residence address (including a post office box) in a foreign jurisdiction; c) one or more telephone numbers in a foreign jurisdiction and no telephone number in New Zealand; d) standing instructions (other than with respect to a depository account) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a foreign jurisdiction; e) currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in a foreign jurisdiction; or f) a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address in a foreign jurisdiction if the Reporting NZFI does not have any other address on file for the account holder. If the Reporting NZFI does not discover any of these indicia in the electronic search, it is not required to take any further steps until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a high value account. If the Reporting NZFI discovers any of the indicia of foreign tax residence listed in (a) through (e) above in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account holder as a resident for tax purposes of each foreign jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified, unless it chooses to (and is able to) cure the indicia. The relevant “curing” procedures are generally based on the Reporting NZFI obtaining a combination of self-certifications 41 and documentary evidence 42 to establish the account holder’s residence. These procedures are further explained on pages 120 to 121 of the CRS Commentary. If the Reporting NZFI discovers a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address in the electronic search (and no other address) and does not identify any of the other indicia of foreign tax residence listed in (a) through (e) above for the account holder they must, in the order most appropriate to the circumstances, adopt the following procedures to determine whether the account holder is a foreign tax resident: 41 Reporting NZFIs should refer to the guidance set out below for new individual account due diligence (paragraph 5.4.1) for the details of who can provide such a self-certification and what form the self-certification can take. 42 The types of documentary evidence are set out in Appendix 3. 55 • apply a paper record search; or • seek to obtain from the account holder a self-certification or documentary evidence to establish their residence(s) for tax purposes. The paper record search that a Reporting NZFI may need to carry out in these circumstances is as follows: • Review its current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and it has obtained within the last five years for any of the indicia of foreign tax residence in a foreign jurisdiction listed in (a) through (e) above for the account holder: o the most recent documentary evidence collected with respect to the account; o the most recent account opening contract or documentation; o the most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting NZFI according to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; o any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and o any standing instructions (other than with respect to a depository account) to transfer funds currently in effect. If the paper search fails to establish an indicium and the attempt to obtain the self-certification or documentary evidence is not successful, the Reporting NZFI must report the account as an undocumented account. Information to collect 5.3.2.1 If a Reporting NZFI carries out the above procedures, and identifies that the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident, they will need to collect prescribed information from the account holder. 43 This will include (subject to the following exceptions and qualifications): 43 It is assumed, for the purposes of the following, that the Reporting NZF I will already have the account holder’s name and address in its records. A full list of the information that the Reporting NZFI needs to collect and report (if the account is a reportable account) is set out in paragraph 6 of this guidance. 56 • the account holder’s tax identification number (TIN) (or a functional equivalent, 44 in the absence of a TIN) with respect to each 45 foreign jurisdiction they are identified as being tax resident in; and • the account holder’s date of birth. The OECD’s AEOI portal 46 contains the rules that jurisdictions adopt for issuing TINs (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) and the format of such TINs. The information on this portal will assist Reporting NZFIs in carrying out their due diligence and determining when they need to collect TINs. A Reporting NZFI is generally not required to confirm the format and other specifications of a TIN with the information on the AEOI Portal. Reporting NZFIs may nevertheless wish to do so to enhance the quality of the information collected and minimise the administrative burden associated with any follow-up concerning reporting of an incorrect TIN. Notwithstanding the general rule expressed above, a Reporting NZFI should be familiar with, and check for, the validity of TINs from another jurisdiction in which the Reporting NZFI or a related entity operates if: • there are simple or standard rules for TINs in that jurisdiction (such as the structure or number of digits); and • the IT systems used across the jurisdictions are shared or sufficiently similar that the validation task would not be onerous. Exceptions: The Reporting NZFI is not required to obtain the account holder’s TIN (or functional equivalent) if either: • the account holder has not been issued with a TIN (or functional equivalent). For example, if: o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or a functional equivalent); or 44 The meaning of “functional equivalent” to a TIN is outlined on page 202 of the CRS Commentary. 45 This principle that a Reporting NZFI must obtain such TIN information for all of the jurisdictions that the account holder (or, if applicable, controlling person) is identified as being tax-resident in applies to all accounts. 46 http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/. 57 o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or a functional equivalent) to them. For example, the account holder may be a child that has not been issued with a TIN; or • the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax does not require the collection of the TIN issued by such jurisdiction. If the account holder claims not to have a TIN (or functional equivalent) the Reporting NZFI should refer to the AEOI portal for information about whether the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence issues TINs to all tax residents. Qualificat ion: A Reporting NZFI is also not required to obtain an account holder’s TIN (or functional equivalent) or date of birth for such a pre-existing account if this information is not in its records. 47 However, the Reporting NZFI is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain 48 such information by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which the account holder is identified as being a Reportable Person. Timing for completion of due diligence and reporting 5.3.2.2 Reporting NZFIs must complete their initial review and any reporting (if the accounts are identified as reportable) of pre-ex ist ing individual lower-value accounts by 30 June 2019. Reporting NZFIs will have the option of taking advantage of the whole period up to 30 June 2019 to complete their due diligence on such accounts provided these accounts are reported by 30 June 2019 if indeed they are identified as being reportable. 5.3.3CRS due diligence procedures for high-value pre-existing individual accounts – balance or value that exceeds USD 1,000,000 as of 30 June 2017 or any subsequent 31 March 49 A Reporting NZFI that maintains a high value pre-existing individual account needs to perform enhanced due diligence procedures on the account to determine if the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident. Th is includes, in addition to the Reporting NZFI being required to review electronic records for indicia 50 that the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident (in the way outlined above with respect to lower-value accounts): 47 A Reporting NZFI is sometimes required to obtain date of birth information for Anti-Money Laundering purposes (see section 15(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financi ng of Terrorism Act 2009), and, if so, would already have such information in their records. 48 However, this is subject to the exceptions outlined above. This principle applies to all pre-existing accounts. 49 A Reporting NZFI is able to choose to adopt these procedures for lower-value accounts as well. 50 The same indicia are relevant for both lower-value and high-value accounts. 58 • sometimes being required to conduct a paper record search for such indicia; and • applying an actual knowledge test when a relationship manager has actual knowledge that the account is held by a Reportable Person (the “relationship manager test”). A Reporting NZFI is not able to apply the “residence address” test for such high-value accounts. The paper-b ased sear ch As noted above, the issue of whether a Reporting NZFI that maintains a high-value account needs to do a paper-based search for foreign indicia will depend on the facts. A Reporting NZFI is not required to perform this paper record search if its electronically searchable information includes the following: • the account holder’s residence status; • the account holder’s residence address and mailing address is currently on file with the Reporting NZFI; • the account holder’s telephone number(s) (if any) is currently on file, with the Reporting NZF I; • in the case of financial accounts other than depository accounts, whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting NZFI or another financial institution); • whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” instruction for the account holder; and • whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. However, if the Reporting NZFI’s electronically searchable information does not include the above information it is (in addition to the electronic records search for foreign indicia) required to perform the following paper-based search for indicia of whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident. The Reporting NZFI needs to review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and that they have obtained within the last five years for any of the indicia of tax residence in a foreign jurisdiction referred to above: 59 • the most recent documentary evidence collected with respect to the account; • the most recent account opening contract or documentation; • the most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting NZFI pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; • any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and • any standing instructions (other than with respect to a depository account) to transfer funds currently in effect. If no indicia of foreign tax residence are discovered in the enhanced review of high value accounts described above, and the account is not identified as held by a Reportable Person under the “relationship manager knowledge test” (outlined further below), no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account. If any of the indicia of foreign tax residence are discovered in the enhanced review of high value accounts described above, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account holder as a resident for tax purposes of each foreign jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to (and is able to) cure the indicia. The relevant “curing” procedures are generally based on obtaining a combination of self-certifications and documentary evidence to establish the account holder’s residence. These procedures are further elaborated on pages 120 to 121 of the CRS Commentary. If a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address is discovered in the enhanced review of high value account described above (and no other address) and none of the other indicia of foreign tax residence are identified for the account holder, the Reporting NZFI must obtain from such account holder a self- certification or documentary evidence to establish their residence(s) for tax purposes. If the Reporting NZFI cannot obtain such self- certification or documentary evidence, it must report the account as an undocumented account. The r elationship manager tests In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting NZFI must treat as a reportable account any high value account assigned to a relat ionsh ip manager (including any financial accounts aggregated with that high value account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the account holder is a Reportable Person. Section III(C)(9) of the CRS provides (in this regard) that a Reporting NZFI must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances relating to an account that it acts as relationship manager for. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the 60 account holder has a new mailing address in a foreign jurisdiction, the Reporting NZFI is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and apply further prescribed due diligence procedures to the account. Information to collect 5.3.3.1 If a Reporting NZFI carries out these procedures, and identifies that the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident, it will need to collect the account holder’s TIN (or functional equivalent) and date of birth. However, this is subject to the same exceptions and qualification outlined above for pre-existing individual lower value accounts. Timing for completion of due diligence and reporting 5.3.3.2 Reporting NZFIs will need to have completed their initial review and any reporting (if the accounts are identified as reportable) of pre-ex isting individual h igh-value accounts by 30 June 2018. Reporting NZFIs will have the option of taking advantage of the whole period up to 30 June 2018 to complete their due diligence on such accounts provided that the accounts are reported by 30 June 2018 if indeed they are identified as being reportable. If a pre-exist ing individual account is not a high value account as of 30 June 2017, but becomes a high-value account as of 31 March of a subsequent period, the Reporting NZFI must complete the enhanced review procedures described above with respect to such an account within the reporting period following the period in which the account becomes a high-value account. Once a Reporting N ZFI applies the enhanced review procedures described above to a high-value account, the Reporting NZFI is generally not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager enquiry, to the same high-value account in any subsequent year. However, if the account is undocumented the Reporting NZFI should re-apply the procedures annually until the account ceases to be undocumented. New individual accounts 51 5.4 In broad terms, a new individual account is an account that a Reporting NZFI opens on or after 1 July 2017 that is held by an individual. Section IV of the CRS states that a Reporting NZFI must carry out the following due diligence procedures for such accounts: • obtain a self-certification “upon account opening” that allows it to determine the account holder’s residence(s) for tax purposes; 51 A Reporting NZFI is also able to choose to use these procedures for pre-existing individual accounts. 61 • confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information it has obtained in connection with the opening of the account (including any documentation collected in accordance with AML/KYC Procedures). This is known as the “reasonableness” test for “validating” the self-certification; and • there is no de minimis due diligence exclusion (compared with FATCA where there is a USD 50,000 threshold exclusion for certain individual accounts). A Reporting NZFI is able to rely on a self-certification that it has obtained for such accounts unless it knows or has reason to know that the self-certification is incorrect or unreliable. The following extract from page 211 of the CRS Commentary highlights how obtaining such valid self-cert ificat ions is a fundamental element of the CRS: “it is expected that jurisdictions have strong measures in place to ensure that valid self certifications are always obtained for New Accounts.” (Emphasis added) Th is raises the following questions: • how can such self-certifications be obtained; • when can such self-certifications be obtained; and • what information will a self-certification need to include? 5.4.1Form of self-certification A self-certification must be signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by any person authorised to sign on behalf of the account holder. A parent or guardian who opens an account for a child will be required to provide the self-certification on behalf of the child account holder. A self-certification will be considered to be positively affirmed if the person making the self- certification provides the Reporting NZFI with an unambiguous acknowledgement that it agrees w ith the representations made through the self-certification. In all cases the affirmation should be recorded by the Reporting NZFI (e.g. for an oral self-certification, a voice recording or digital footprint, so a Reporting NZFI can demonstrate that the self-certification was positively affirmed). A self-certification may be obtained in any manner and in any form, i.e. in writ ing, electronically or orally. The only requirement is that the self-certification contains all the required information and is signed or positively affirmed. For record-keeping purposes, a Reporting NZFI will need to keep a record of self-cert ificat ions obtained, the process followed to obtain such certifications, and a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification. 62 These requirements apply to CRS self-certifications for all types of accounts. 5.4.2Obtaining a valid self-certification on “account opening” The OECD has also provided the following guidance (in an answer to a “Frequently Asked Question” on the AEOI portal) about what it considers would satisfy the requirement that such self- certifications are obtained “upon account opening”. The following guidance applies for the purposes of both individual and entity account due diligence: “the Standard provides that a Reporting F inancial Inst itut ion must obtain a self-certification upon account opening (Sections IV(A) and V(D)(2)). Where a self-certification is obtained at account opening but validation of the self-certification cannot be completed because it is a “da y t wo” process undertaken by a back- office function, the self-certification should be validated within a period of 90 days. There are a limited number of instances, where due to the specificities of a business sector it is not possible to obtain a self- certif ication on “day one” of the account opening process, for example whe re an insura nce contract has been assigned f rom one person to another or in t he case where an investor acquires sha res in an investment t rust on the secondary market. In such circumstances, the self-certification should be both obtained and validated as quickl y as feasibl e, and in any case within a period of 90 days. Given that obtai ning a self-certification for New Accounts is a critical aspect of ensuring that the CRS is effective, it is expected that jurisdictions have strong measures in place to ensure that valid self-certifications are always obtained for New Accounts (see examples in paragraph 18 of the Commentary on Section IX). In all cases, Reporting F inancial Inst it utions sha ll ensure that they have obtained and validated the self-certification in time to be able to meet their due diligence and report ing obligations wit h respect to the report ing period during which t he account was opened. (Emphasis added) Therefore, the OECD considers that the CRS requirement for a Reporting NZFI to obtain a self- certification for an account “upon account opening” generally requires that it obtains a self- certification on ““day one” of the account opening process”. “Day one”, in this context, would be when the Reporting NZFI takes the first steps to materially progress the account opening process. It is accepted that a Reporting NZFI may not be able to immediately obtain a complete and valid self-certification from a person wanting to open an account (for example, the person may not have their TIN with them when they seek to open an account). However, as explained further below, a Reporting NZFI can generally make the opening of an account contingent on first obtaining a valid self-certification (i.e. the Reporting NZFI can generally decide not to take steps to materially progress the account opening process until it obtains a self- certification). This is the most efficient way for a Reporting NZFI to ensure it meets the expectation in the CRS that it always obtains valid self-certifications for new accounts. However, the OECD has acknowledged that there may be exceptional circumstances when it is not possible for a Reporting NZFI to obtain a self-certification on account opening. For example: • where an annuity contract has been assigned; or 63 • where an investor acquires shares/units in a collective investment vehicle on the secondary market. In such exceptional circumstances, the Reporting NZFI should have processes in place to obtain a validated self-certification within 90 days of the account being opened (or in time to meet due diligence and reporting obligations in the period when the account is opened – if th is is earlier). The OECD’s answer to the above “Frequently asked Question” is clear that in such circumstances the Reporting NZFI will have complied with its requirement to obtain a self-certification “upon account opening” in the requisite sense. However, it is important to note that the OECD’s answer to the above “Frequently Asked Question” is clear that it is a very high bar before such exceptional circumstances would apply. The emphasis is on such exceptional circumstances (where up to 90 days would be permissible to obtain a self- certification) only applying where it is not possible for the Reporting NZFI to obtain a self- certification on day one of the account opening process, not when it would merely be difficult for the Reporting NZFI to obtain such a self-certification. Inland Revenue considers that, taking into account the reference in page 211 of the CRS Commentary to the requirement for a Reporting NZFI to always obtaining valid self-certifications “upon account opening” and how the OECD has interpreted this requirement, generally: • a Reporting NZFI should seek to obtain self-certifications on “day one” of the account opening process; and • a Reporting NZFI must obtain a valid self-certification upon account opening or decline to open the account (for example, the Reporting NZFI should not take material steps to progress the account opening process – such as accepting deposits – before obtaining the requisite self- certification). In this regard, the requirement for a Reporting NZFI to obtain a valid self-certification on account opening includes: • the Reporting NZFI obtaining all of the information it needs to obtain as part of the self- certification (including, for example, TIN and date of birth information of a foreign tax resident – see below); and • the Reporting NZFI confirming the reasonableness of the self-cert ificat ion (i.e. validating the self-cert ificat ion). The OECD’s answer to the above “Frequently Asked Question” is clear that where this “validation process” cannot be completed on “day one” of account opening because it is a “day two” process undertaken by a back office function of a Reporting NZFI, the validation should be completed within 90 days of commencement of the account 64 opening process (or in time to meet due diligence and reporting obligations in the period when the account is opened – if this is earlier). Examples of when a Reporting NZFI would have “reason to know” that a self-certification is unreliable (i.e. where the self-certification would not pass this validation test) are: • The se lf-certification is incomplete with respect to any item on the self-certification that is relevant to the account holder’s claims. • The se lf-certification contains any information which is inconsistent with the account holder’s claims. • There is information in the Reporting NZFI’s account files that conflicts with or calls into question the account holder’s self-certification. The emphasis, in this regard, is not on the Reporting NZFI needing to conduct a legal analysis of the account holder’s tax residency. Instead, this “reasonableness” validation is more focused on having cross-checks that look for “flags” that the self-certification may be incorrect or unreliable. These validation requirements apply to CRS self-certifications for all types of accounts. In this respect, the OECD has provided the following guidance in an answer to a “Frequently Asked Question”: A Financial Institution is not required to provide customers with tax advice or to perform a legal analysis to determine the reasonableness of self-cert ificat ion. Instead, as provided in the Standard, for New Accounts the Financial Institution may rely on a self-certification made by the customer unless it knows or has reason to know that the self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, (the “reasonableness” test), which will be based on the information obtained in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation obtained pursuant to AML/KYC procedures. The Standard provides examples of the application of the reasonableness tests (section IV, A, and the associated Commentary). A self-certification of an individual account holder’s tax residence will only be valid if: • It is signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by the account holder or person with authority to sign for the account holder. • It is dated at the latest at the date of receipt. • It contains each account holder’s: 65 o name; o address; o jurisdiction(s) of residence for tax purposes. • TIN (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction (subject to the exceptions outlined below). • Date of birth. A Reporting NZFI is generally not required to confirm the format and other specifications of a TIN with the information on the AEOI Portal. Reporting NZFIs may nevertheless wish to do so in order to enhance the quality of the information collected and minimise the administrative burden associated with any follow-up concerning reporting of an incorrect TIN. Notwithstanding the general rule expressed above, a Reporting NZFI should be familiar with, and check for, the validity of TINs from another jurisdiction in which the Reporting NZFI or a related entity operates if: • There are simple or standard rules for TINs in that jurisdiction (such as the structure or number of digits). • The IT systems used across the jurisdictions are shared or sufficiently similar that the validation task would not be onerous. Exception: The Reporting NZFI is not required to obtain the account holder’s TIN (or functional equivalent) if either: • The account holder has not been issued with a TIN (or functional equivalent). For example, if: o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or a functional equivalent); or o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or a functional equivalent) to them. For example, the account holder may be a child that has not been issued a TIN; or • The account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of the TIN issued by such jurisdiction. 66 If the account holder claims not to have a TIN (or functional equivalent): • This statement should be part of the self-certification collected for the account, unless the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines, based on information on the AEOI Portal, that the person would not have a TIN for the relevant foreign jurisdiction. • If the information included on the AEOI Portal indicates that the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence issues TINs to all tax residents, the Reporting NZFI would have reason to know that the self-certification may be unreliable or incorrect and would be expected to seek either a valid (new) self-certification or a reasonable explanation as to why the person has not provided the TIN. Example 1: Bob wants to open a depository account with a Reporting NZFI bank. The Reporting NZFI informs Bob that he needs to provide a self-certification of his tax residency before they will open the account. Bob says he does not want to provide such a self-certification. However, Bob still wants to deposit funds into the account. The Reporting NZFI decides not to open the account and informs Bob that it will not open the account until Bob provides a self-certification. Bob never provides a self-certification and the account is never opened. Reporting NZFI keeps a record of Bob’s failure to provide a self-certification. In these circumstances, the Reporting NZFI would not have obtained a self-certification from Bob. However, the Reporting NZFI has not opened the account or indeed taken the first material steps to progress the account opening process (compared with if the Reporting NZFI had accepted a deposit from Bob). Therefore, the Reporting NZFI has not breached the CRS requirement to obtain a self-certification on account opening. The Reporting NZFI did not obtain a self-certification. However, the Reporting NZFI did not progress the account opening procedures in a material way. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI did not breach its obligations. Example 2: Clive wants to open a depository account with a Reporting NZFI bank. The Reporting NZFI informs Clive that he needs to provide a self-certification of his tax residency before it wi ll open the account. Clive says he does not want to provide such a self-certification. However, Clive still wants to deposit funds into the account. The Reporting NZFI decides not to open the account and informs Clive that it will not open the account until Clive provides a self-certification. Reporting NZFI assigns a reference number to Clive for administrative purposes in case Clive subsequently provides the requisite self-certification in order for the account to be opened. Clive never provides a self-certification and the account is never opened. Reporting NZFI keeps a record of Cli ve’s failure to provide a self-certification. In these circumstances, the Reporting NZFI would not have obtained a self-cert ificat ion from Clive. 67 However, the Reporting NZFI has not opened the account or indeed taken the first material steps to progress the account opening process (compared with if the Reporting NZFI had accepted a deposit from Clive). Therefore, the Reporting NZFI has not breached the CRS requirement to obtain a self-certification on account opening. The Reporting NZFI did not obtain a self-certification. However, the Reporting NZFI did not progress the account opening procedures in a material way. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI did not breach its obligations. Example 3: Daniel tries to open a depository account with a Reporting NZFI. The Reporting NZFI informs Daniel that he needs to provide a self-certification of his tax residency. Daniel says that he is a foreign tax resident from jurisdiction A but that he cannot complete the self-certification at that stage as he does not have his TIN with him. Reporting NZFI still allows Daniel to progress account opening procedures and deposit $50,000 in the account. Reporting NZFI subsequently endeavours to obtain Daniel’s completed self-certification (including his TIN). However, the Reporting NZFI is never able to obtain the TIN and Daniel does not provide a reasonable reason for not providing a TI N. The AEOI portal also indicates that jurisdiction A issues TINs to all residents. The Reporting NZFI would have breached its CRS requirement to obtain a self-certification on account opening: • “Day one” of the account opening process occurred. • Daniel was allowed to deposit funds in the account (a material step in advancing the account opening process). • The Reporting NZFI has failed to obtain a completed self-cert ification from Daniel. The Reporting NZFI would potentially be liable for a penalty for this failure. The Reporting NZFI would also need to continue to try to obtain a completed and validated self-cert ificat ion from Daniel. If it is unsuccessful, the reasonable course of action may be to close the account. This is consistent with the expectation (outlined above) that Reporting NZFIs will always obtain a valid self- certification for new accounts. Example 4: Erin seeks to open an account with a Reporting NZFI. Erin self-certifies that she is a New Zealand tax resident, but asks for all her mail to be sent to a U.K. Residential address. This is a potential flag that indicates that Erin could in fact be tax resident in the U.K. (i.e. a person is often tax resident in the jurisdiction where they reside). This means that the Erin’s self-certification is potentially unreliable. The Reporting NZFI should ask Erin further questions to determine whether or not the self-certification is reliable. The Reporting NZFI should generally not open the account unless it is able to obtain a valid self-certification. Example 5: A Reporting NZFI has obtained a self-certification from Fred upon account opening. The self-certification includes all of the requisite information. The Reporting NZFI has a “day 2” validation process for self-certifications. Fred self-certifies that he is tax resident in New Zealand 68 and is not a foreign tax resident. However, the information collected as part of the account opening specifies a telephone number, signatory authority and standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in Country B (a foreign jurisdiction). The self-certification is potentially unreliable. The Reporting NZFI would be expected to ask Fred further questions to determine whether or not the self-certification is reliable. 5.4.3Changes in circumstances If a Reporting NZFI maintains a new individual account, obtains a self-certification of the account holder’s residence(s), and there is a change in circumstances that subsequently causes the Reporting NZF I to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, it cannot rely on the original self-certification and must carry out further due diligence on the account and obtain a valid self- certification (i.e. a further self-certification) that establishes the account holder’s residence(s) for tax purposes. A change in circumstances affecting a self-certification will terminate the validity of the self- certification with respect to the information that is no longer reliable, until the information is updated. A self-certification becomes invalid on the date that the Reporting NZFI holding the self- certification knows or has reason to know that circumstances affecting the correctness of the self- certification have changed. However, a Reporting NZFI may choose to treat a person as having the same status that it had prior to the change in circumstances until the earlier of 90 days from the date that the self-certification became invalid due to the change in circumstances, the date that the validity of the self-certification is confirmed, or the date that a new self-certification is obtained. Example 6: A Reporting NZFI obtains a self-certification on account opening from George that he is tax-resident in New Zealand. Three years after account opening, George rings the Reporting NZFI to add a foreign mailing address to the account. This is a change in circumstances that calls into question George’s original self-certification. The Reporting NZFI would need to re-determine the status of the account by obtaining a valid self-certification for George. Pre-existing entity accounts 5.5 A pre-existing entity account is an account maintained by a Reporting NZFI as of 30 June 2017 52 that is held by an entity (for example, held by a trust, company or partnership). Reporting NZFIs are generally required to conduct due diligence on pre-existing entity accounts to determine: • whether the entity is a relevant foreign tax resident; • whether the entity is a passive NFE; and 52 A further account opened by a pre-existing entity customer on or after 1 July 2017 is treated as a pre-existing entity account in the same circumstances outlined above for pre-existing individual accounts in paragraph 5.3. 69 • if the entity is a passive NFE, whether it has any controlling persons that are relevant foreign tax residents. However, there is a de minimis exception that applies here. If a pre-existing account has a balance or value that does not exceed USD 250,000 as of 30 June 2017 it will not be subject to due diligence unless it exceeds USD 250,000 on any subsequent 31 March. Th is de minimis exception is similar to the FATCA exclusions for such accounts. However, the CRS/FATCA comparison chart in Appendix 1 highlights where there are some differences. A Reporting NZFI is able to choose to disregard this de min imis exception and review all of its pre- existing entity accounts (or a clearly identified group of such accounts) irrespective of the balance or value of the account. The following guidance applies to those pre-existing accounts where the de minimis exception does not apply (either because the account is above the threshold or because the Reporting NZFI has chosen to disregard the threshold). 5.5.1Whether the entity is a relevant foreign tax resident The Reporting NZFI first needs to determine whether the entity is a relevant foreign tax resident. The Reporting NZFI is required to review information it maintains for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures) to determine the account holder’s tax residence. For these purposes, information indicating the account holder’s residence includes a place of incorporation or organisation, or an address in a foreign jurisdiction. 53 If the information indicates that the account holder is a Reportable Person, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account as a reportable account unless it obtains a self-certification from the account holder or reasonably determines, based on information that is publicly available or is in their possession, that the account holder is not a Reportable Person. The relevant “publicly available information” that can be used to determine an account holder’s status is outlined on page 137 of the CRS Commentary. This includes information in a publicly accessible register maintained or authorised by an authorised government body. The reader should refer to the CRS Commentary for further context of the types of information that would come within this category. A Reporting NZFI is also able to use as documentary evidence in its possession (to reasonably determine the account holder’s status) any classification in its records for the account holder that was determined based on a standardised industry coding system recorded consistent with its normal business practices for purposes of AML/KYC procedures or another regulatory purpose (other than for tax purposes). This is provided that it was implemented by the Reporting NZFI prior to the date 53 For example, in the case of a trust account holder, the address of the trustee in a foreign jurisdiction will be relevant indicia. 70 used to classify the account. Page 204 of the CRS Commentary provides further context to the circumstances when a Reporting NZFI will be able to rely on such information to determine the account holder’s status. If the Reporting NZFI determines that the entity account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident based on indicia/information in its possession (or information that is publicly available) it should (subject to the exceptions/qualification outlined below) collect the account holder’s TIN (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN). 54 Alternatively, a Reporting NZFI may choose to obtain a self-certification from the account holder to determine whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident. A self-certification of the account holder’s tax status would only be valid if: • it is signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by the account holder or person with authority to sign for the account holder; • it is dated at the latest at the date of receipt; and • it contains each account holder’s: o name (i.e. the name of the entity); o address; o jurisdiction(s) of residence for tax purposes; and o TIN (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction (subject to various exceptions/qualifications – outlined below). A Reporting NZFI is generally not required to confirm the format and other specifications of a TIN with the information on the AEOI Portal. Reporting NZFIs may nevertheless wish to do so in order to enhance the quality of the information collected and minimise the administrative burden associated with any follow-up concerning reporting of an incorrect TIN. Notwithstanding the general rule expressed above, a Reporting NZFI should be familiar with, and check for, the validity of TINs from another jurisdiction in which the Reporting NZFI or a related entity operates if: 54 It is assumed, for the purposes of the following, that the Reporting NZFI will already have the entity’s name and address in its records. A full list of the information that a Reporting NZFI needs to collect and (if the account is a reportable account) report is set out in paragraph 6 of this guidance. 71 • there are simple or standard rules for TINs in that jurisdiction (such as the structure or number of digits); and • the IT systems used across the jurisdictions are shared or sufficiently similar that the validation task would not be onerous. Exceptions: The Reporting NZFI is not required to obtain the account holder’s TIN (or functional equivalent) if either: • the account holder has not been issued with a TIN (or a functional equivalent). For example, if: o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or a functional equivalent); or o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or a functional equivalent) to them; or • the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of the TIN issued by that jurisdiction. If an account holder claims not to have a TIN (or a functional equivalent): • This statement should be part of the self-certification collected for the account, unless the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines, based on information on the OECD’s AEOI Portal, that the person would not have a TIN for the relevant foreign jurisdiction. • If the information included on the AEOI Portal indicates that the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence issues TINs to all tax residents, the Reporting NZFI would have reason to know that the self-certification may be unreliable or incorrect and would be expected to seek either a valid (new) self-certification or a reasonable explanation as to why the person has not provided the TIN. Qualificat ion: A Reporting NZFI is also not required to obtain a TIN (or a functional equivalent) for an account holder of such a pre-existing account if it is not in its records. However, the Reporting NZFI is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the TIN by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which the account holder is identified as being a Reportable Person. 72 5.5.2Whether the entity account holder is a passive non-financial entity A Reporting NZFI that maintains a pre-existing entity account is also required to determine: • whether the account holder is a passive NFE; and • if the account holder is a passive NFE, whether any of its controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. The Reporting NZFI will need to carry out these steps irrespective of whether the entity account holder is a foreign tax resident. If an entity account holder is not a financial institution it will (by default) be a NFE. There are also two categories of NFE; active NFEs and passive NFEs. A NFE that is not an active NFE will (by default) be a passive NFE. The following matters are relevant when determining whether a NFE is a “passive NFE” (and, therefore, subject to the above “look-through” rule): • In broad terms, a passive NFE will generally cover an entity that: o is not a financial institution; and Financial Institution Non-financial Entity (NFE) Passive NFE (subject to look-through requirements) Active NFE 73 o either derives predominantly (50% or more) passive income and/or has assets that predominantly produce, or are held for, the production of passive income. However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, a registered charity that is a NFE would generally be an active NFE even if it derives predominantly passive income. The definitions of NFE, active NFE and passive NFE are outlined in full in Appendix 4. • A managed investment entity that is tax resident in a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction is also deemed to be a passive NFE. “Passive income” will be defined for CRS purposes in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as: passive income, in the application of the FATCA agreement or the CRS applied standard to a person or entity for a period, means an amount that is not income from a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of the business of a dealer in financial assets and that is— (a) a dividend: (b) interest: (c) income equivalent to interest: (d) rent or a royalty, other than rent or a royalty derived in the active conduct of a business conducted, partly or wholly, by employees of the person or entity: (e) an annuity: (f) for financial assets that give rise to amounts included under paragraphs (a) to (e), the amount by which gains from the sales or exchanges of the financial assets in the period exceed losses from the sales or exchanges: (g) the amount by which gains from the transactions in financial assets in the period exceed losses from the transactions: (h) the amount by which gains from the foreign currency transactions in the period exceed losses from the transactions: (i) the amount by which gains from the swaps in the period exceed losses from the swaps: (j) an amount received under a cash value insurance contract. (Emphasis added) For some entity account holders the active/passive assessment may be straightforward and be made on the basis of available information (in the Reporting NZFIs possession or that is publicly available). 74 However, the Reporting NZFI may sometimes need to obtain a self-certification from the account holder (i.e. as to whether it is a passive NFE, as opposed to an active NFE or financial institution). The Reporting NZFI, when requesting such a self-certification, is expected to provide the account holder with the information that is relevant to them determining their status (for example, the definition of “active NFE”). 5.5.3When an entity account holder is a passive non-financial entity – identifying controlling persons If a Reporting NZFI has identified that a pre-existing entity account it maintains is held by a passive NFE it is then required to: • identify the entity’s controlling persons; and • determine whether any of the entity’s controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. Section VIII(D)(6) of the CRS defines “controlling persons” as meaning the natural persons who exercise control over the entity, with some elaboration (outlined below) on how this would apply to trusts. The term “controlling persons” must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. For the purposes of identifying the controlling persons of a passive NFE, a Reporting NZFI may (subject to the following) rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. Page 199 of the CRS Commentary sets out how this would apply in the context of pre-existing and new entity accounts. This guidance explains how these principles will apply to the following types of passive NFEs: • legal persons; and • trusts and other legal arrangements. For a passive NFE that is a legal person, page 198 of the CRS Commentary provides that the term “controlling person” means the natural person(s) who exercise control over the entity. “Control” over an entity is generally exercised by the natural person(s) who ultimately has a controlling ownership interest in the entity. A “controlling ownership interest”, in turn, depends on the ownership structure of the legal person and is usually identified on the basis of a threshold applying a risk-based approach (for example, any person(s) owning more than a certain percentage of the legal person, such as 25%). Where no natural person(s) exercises control through ownership interests, the controlling person(s) of the entity will be the natural person(s) who exercise control of the entity through other means. Where no natural person(s) is identified as exercising control of the entity, the controlling person(s) of the entity will be the natural person(s) who holds the position of senior managing official. 75 In the case of a passive NFE trust, the term “controlling persons” mean the settlor(s), the trustee(s), the protector(s) (if any), the beneficiary(ies) or classes of beneficiaries and any other natural person(s) exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. In the case of legal arrangements other than a trust, the term means persons in equivalent or similar positions. The following points are relevant when determining whether persons connected with a passive NFE trust are “controlling persons” of the trust: • The settlor(s), the trustee(s), the protector(s) (if any), the beneficiary(ies) or classes of beneficiaries of a trust must (subject to the following) always be treated as controlling persons of the trust, irrespective of whether any of them exercises control over the trust (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). • A settlor is a controlling person of a trust irrespective of whether the trust is a revocable trust or an irrevocable trust. • If a person connected to a trust (such as a trustee) is an entity the Reporting NZFI will need to identify the natural persons that control that entity. • For beneficiaries that are designated by characteristics or by class, a Reporting NZFI should obtain sufficient information concerning the beneficiary(ies) to satisfy it that it will be able to establish the identity of the beneficiary(ies) at the time of the pay-out or when the beneficiary(ies) intends to exercise vested rights. Therefore, that occasion will constitute a change in circumstances and will trigger the relevant procedures (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). This could be relevant if, for example, a trust has a “children of the settlor” class of beneficiaries. A child within that class would not be a relevant controlling person that needs to be identified until they receive a distribution from the trust or intend to exercise vested rights. • A specified discretionary beneficiary of a passive NFE trust will generally be a controlling person of the trust. However, a Reporting NZFI has the option of only treating such a beneficiary as being a controlling person of the trust if that person receives a distribution in a reporting period (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). The meaning of “receives a distribution” in this context is when an amount is paid or payable to the beneficiary. A Reporting NZFI that chooses to adopt this option will need to have reasonable safeguards and 76 procedures 55 in place to determine when such a distribution has been made. This could include the Reporting NZFI having an arrangement with the trustee (possibly in terms and conditions) that the trustee will inform the Reporting NZFI when it has made such a distribution. There is no compulsion for a Reporting NZFI to adopt this option. A Reporting NZFI could simply choose to treat all beneficiaries as being controlling persons (in this context) if it considers that this would be preferable from an operational point of view. If a Reporting NZFI maintains an account held by a passive NFE, and has identified the controlling persons, they must then determine whether any of those persons are relevant foreign tax residents. The process that the Reporting NZFI needs to follow (in this regard) depends on the balance or value of the account: • The Reporting NZFI can, if the account has a balance or value that does not exceed USD 1,000,000 (which the Reporting NZFI can simply treat as NZD 1,000,000), rely on information they have collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC procedures to determine whether any of the controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. If the Reporting NZFI adopts these procedures, and determines that a controlling person is a relevant foreign tax resident, they will need to collect the passive NFE’s TIN (or functional equivalent) 56 and the controlling person’s name, address, TIN (or functional equivalent), and date of birth. However, this is subject to the exceptions/qualifications outlined below; or • The Reporting NZFI must otherwise obtain a self-cert ification from the account holder (or controlling person) to determine whether any of the controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. If a self-certification is not provided, the Reporting NZFI should establish such residence by applying the pre-existing individual account indicia procedures (see above at paragraph 5.3). If a Reporting NZFI has no such indicia in its records, no further action will be required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia with respect to the controlling person being associated with the account. With respect to pre-existing entity accounts held by a passive NFE, such a self-certification of the controlling person’s tax residence would only be valid if: 55 See page 17 of the OECD”s CRS Implementation Handbook. 56 It is assumed, for these purposes, t hat the Reporting NZFI would already have the passive NFE”s name and address in its records, so would not need to collect this information as well. 77 • it is signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by the account holder (or controlling person) with authority to sign; • it is dated at the latest at the date of receipt; and • it contains each controlling person’s: o name; o address; o jurisdiction(s) of residence for tax purposes; o TIN (or a functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction (subject to various exceptions/qualifications – outlined below); 57 and o date of birth (subject to the qualification outlined below). A Reporting NZFI is generally not required to confirm the format and other specifications of a TIN with the information on the AEOI Portal. Reporting NZFIs may nevertheless wish to do so in order to enhance the quality of the information collected and minimise the administrative burden associated with any follow-up concerning reporting of an incorrect TIN. Notwithstanding the general rule expressed above, a Reporting NZFI should be familiar with, and check for, the validity of TINs from another jurisdiction in which the Reporting NZFI or a related entity operates if: • there are simple or standard rules for TINs in that jurisdiction (such as the structure or number of digits); and • the IT systems used across the jurisdictions are shared or sufficiently similar that the validation task would not be onerous. Exception: The Reporting NZFI is not required to obtain the controlling person’s TIN (or functional equivalent) if either: • the controlling person has not been issued with a TIN (or a functional equivalent). For example, if: 57 The Reporting NZF I would also need to collect the passive NFE”s TIN(s) (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN). 78 o the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or a functional equivalent); or o the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or functional equivalent) to them. For example, the controlling person may be a child that has not been issued a TIN; or o the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of the TIN issued by that jurisdiction. If a person (either the account holder or controlling person) claims that a controlling person does not have to have a TIN (or functional equivalent): • This statement should be part of the self-certification collected for the account, unless the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines, based on information on the OECD’s AEOI Portal, that the controlling person would not have a TIN for the relevant foreign jurisdiction. • If the information included on the AEOI Portal indicates that the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence issues TINs to all tax residents, the Reporting NZFI would have reason to know that the self-certification may be unreliable or incorrect and would be expected to seek either a valid (new) self-certification or a reasonable explanation as to why the controlling person’s TIN has not been provided. Qualificat ion: A Reporting NZFI may not have obtained the TIN (or functional equivalent) and date of birth information about a controlling person they have identified as being a relevant foreign tax resident. However, they are required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the controlling person’s TIN and date of birth by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which that person has been identified as being a Reportable Person. 5.5.4Timeframe for completion of initial due diligence and reporting Reporting NZFIs will need to have completed their initial review and any reporting (if the accounts are identified as reportable) of pre-existing entity accounts by 30 June 2019. Reporting NZFIs will have the option of taking advantage of the whole period up to 30 June 2019 to complete their due diligence on such accounts. However, this is provided that the account is reported by 30 June 2019 (if indeed it is identified as being reportable). 5.5.5Record-keeping requirements For record-keeping purposes, a Reporting NZFI will also need to keep a record of self-certifications obtained, the process they followed to obtain such certifications and a record of any failure to obtain 79 a self-certification (for example, when an account holder or controlling person does not provide a self-certification on request). 5.5.6Change in circumstances If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Pre-existing Entity Account that causes the Reporting NZFI to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting NZFI must re-determine the status of the account. The Reporting NZFI must adopt the following procedures by the later of the last day of the relevant reporting period or 90 calendar days following the notice or discovery of the change in circumstances: 58 • With respect to the determination whether the account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident, the Reporting NZFI must obtain either (i) a self-certification, or (ii) a reasonable explanation and documentation (as appropriate) supporting the reasonableness of the original self-certification or documentation (and retain a copy or a notation of that explanation and documentation). If the Reporting NZFI fails to either obtain a self-certification or confirm the reasonableness of the original self-certification or documentation, it must treat the account holder as being a Reportable Person with respect to both jurisdictions. • With respect to the determination of whether the account holder is a financial institution, 59 active NFE or passive NFE, a Reporting NZFI must obtain additional documentation or a self-certification (as appropriate) to establish the status of the account holder. If the Reporting NZFI fails to do so, it must treat the account as a passive NFE. • With respect to determining whether a controlling person is a relevant foreign tax resident, the Reporting NZFI must obtain either (i) a self-certification, or (ii) a reasonable explanation and documentation (as appropriate) supporting the reasonableness of the original self- certification or documentation (and retain a copy or a notation of that explanation and documentation). If a Reporting NZFI fails to obtain either a self-certification or confirm the reasonableness of a previously collected self-certification or documentation, it must rely on indicia of foreign tax residence in its records. 58 See page 142 of the CRS Commentary. 59 As noted at paragraphs 1.9 and 11.1.6 of this guidance, foreign financial institutions will not be relevant foreign tax residents (potentially subject to reporting) unless they are managed investment entities that are tax residents in jurisdictions that are not Participating Jurisdictions, and, therefore, are deemed to be passive NFEs. 80 New entity accounts 60 5.6 A new entity account is an account opened by a Reporting NZFI on or after 1 July 2017 that is held by an entity (for example, held by a trust, company, or partnership). Reporting NZFIs are required to conduct due diligence on new entity accounts to determine: • whether the entity is a relevant foreign tax resident; • whether the entity is a passive NFE; and • if the entity is a passive NFE, whether it has any controlling persons that are relevant foreign tax residents. There is no de minimis threshold exemption from these procedures. 5.6.1Whether the entity is a relevant foreign tax resident The Reporting NZFI first needs to determine whether the entity is a foreign tax resident. The Reporting NZFI needs to obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows it to determine the account holder’s residence for tax purposes and to confirm the reasonableness of that self-certification based on the information it obtained in connection with the opening of the account (including any documentation it has collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures). If the self-certification indicates that the account holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account as being a reportable account unless it reasonably determines, based on information in its possession or that is publicly available (see above with regards to pre- existing entity accounts), that the account holder is not a Reportable Person. The form, procedures, and timeframes that a Reporting NZFI would need to adopt for obtaining and validat ing such self-certifications are the same as those outlined above for new individual accounts. A self-certification of the account holder’s tax status would only be valid if: • it is signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by the account holder or person with authority to sign for the account holder; • it is dated at the latest at the date of receipt; and • it contains each account holder’s: 60 A Reporting NZFI is also able to choose to adopt these procedures for pre-existing entity accounts. 81 o name (i.e. the name of the entity); o address; o jurisdiction(s) of residence for tax purposes; and o TIN (or a functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) for each foreign tax jurisdiction (subject to various exceptions – outlined below). If the entity certifies that they have no residence for tax purposes, the Reporting NZFI may rely on the address of the entity’s principal office to determine its residency. A Reporting NZFI is generally not required to confirm the format and other specifications of a TIN with the information on the AEOI Portal. Reporting NZFIs may nevertheless wish to do so in order to enhance the quality of the information collected and minimise the administrative burden associated with any follow-up concerning reporting of an incorrect TIN. Notwithstanding the general rule expressed above, a Reporting NZFI should be familiar with, and check for, the validity of TINs from another jurisdiction in which the Reporting NZFI or a related entity operates if: • there are simple or standard rules for TINs in that jurisdiction (such as the structure or number of digits); and • the IT systems used across the jurisdictions are shared or sufficiently similar that the validation task would not be onerous. Exceptions: The Reporting NZFI is not required to obtain the account holder’s TIN if either: • The account holder has not been issued with a TIN (or a functional equivalent). For example, if: o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or a functional equivalent); or o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or a functional equivalent) to them; or o the account holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of the TIN issued by that jurisdiction. If the account holder claims not to have a TIN (or functional equivalent): 82 • This statement should be part of the self-certification collected for the account, unless the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines, based on information on the OECD’s AEOI Portal, that the person would not have a TIN for the relevant foreign jurisdiction. • If the information included on the AEOI Portal indicates that the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence issues TINs to all tax residents, the Reporting NZFI would have reason to know that the self-certification may be unreliable or incorrect and would be expected to seek either a valid (new) self-certification or a reasonable explanation as to why the person has not provided the TIN. 5.6.2Whether the entity is a passive non-financial entity A Reporting entity that maintains a new-existing entity account is also required to determine whether the account holder is a passive NFE. The same procedures outlined above for pre-existing entity accounts (at paragraph 5.5.2) apply equally here. 5.6.3When an entity account holder is a passive non-financial entity – identifying controlling persons If a Reporting NZFI has identified that a new entity account is held by a passive NFE it is required to: • identify the entity’s controlling persons; and • determine whether those controlling persons are foreign tax residents. For the purposes of determining the controlling persons of a passive NFE account holder, the Reporting NZFI should adopt the same procedures outlined above (at paragraph 5.5.3) for pre- existing entity accounts. Page 199 of the CRS Commentary also sets out how these procedures would apply in the context of new accounts held by passive NFE trusts. If a Reporting NZFI maintains an account held by a passive NFE, and has identified the controlling persons, it must then determine whether any of those persons are relevant foreign tax residents by obtaining a self-certification (from the account holder or such controlling persons) as to whether any of those controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. With respect to new entity accounts held by a passive NFE, a self-certification of the controlling person’s tax residence would only be valid if: • it is signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by the account holder (or controlling person) with authority to sign; 83 • it is dated at the latest at the date of receipt; and • it contains each controlling person’s: o name; o address; o jurisdiction(s) of residence for tax purposes; o TIN (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction (subject to various exceptions – outlined below); 61 and o date of birth. A Reporting NZFI is generally not required to confirm the format and other specifications of a TIN with the information on the AEOI Portal. Reporting NZFIs may nevertheless wish to do so in order to enhance the quality of the information collected and minimise the administrative burden associated with any follow-up concerning reporting of an incorrect TIN. Notwithstanding the general rule expressed above, a Reporting NZFI should be familiar with, and check for, the validity of TINs from another jurisdiction in which the Reporting NZFI or a related entity operates if: • there are simple or standard rules for TINs in that jurisdiction (such as the structure or number of digits); and • the IT systems used across the jurisdictions are shared or sufficiently similar that the validation task would not be onerous. Exception: The Reporting NZFI is not required to obtain the controlling person’s TIN (or functional equivalent) if either: • The controlling person has not been issued with a TIN (or functional equivalent). For example, if: o the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or functional equivalent); or 61 The Reporting NZF I would also need to collect the passive NFE”s TIN. 84 o the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or functional equivalent) to them. For example, the person may be a child that has not been issued a TIN); or o the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of the TIN issued by that jurisdiction. If a person (either the account holder or controlling person) claims that a controlling person does not have to have a TIN: • This statement should be part of the self-certification collected for the account, unless the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines, based on information on the OECD’s AEOI Portal, that the controlling person would not have a TIN for the relevant foreign jurisdiction. • If the information included on the AEOI Portal indicates that the controlling person’s jurisdiction of tax residence issues TINs to all tax residents, the Reporting NZFI would have reason to know that the self-certification may be unreliable or incorrect and would be expected to seek either a valid (new) self-certification or a reasonable explanation as to why the controlling person’s TIN has not been provided. 5.6.4Record-keeping requirements For record-keeping purposes, a Reporting NZFI will also need to keep a record of self-certifications obtained, the process they followed to obtain such certifications, and a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification (for example, when an account holder or controlling person does not provide a self-certification on request). 5.6.5Change in circumstances Page 148 of the CRS Commentary provides that if there is a change in circumstances with respect to a new entity account that causes the Reporting NZFI to know, or have reason to know, that the self- certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting NZFI must re-determine the status of the account. The procedures that the Reporting NZFI would need to follow in this regard are the same as the procedures when there is a change in circumstances for pre-existing entity accounts (referred to above at paragraph 5.5.6). Outline of the CRS information that needs to be reported 6 Th is gu idance has so far outlined the following points: • the circumstances when an entity will be a Reporting NZFI; and 85 • the due CRS diligence obligations that Reporting NZFIs have to identify reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. This then raises the question of what information a Reporting NZFI will need to report to Inland Revenue if an account is reportable. In broad terms, a Reporting NZFI will be required to report to Inland Revenue prescribed identity and financial account information about a financial account it maintains in the following circumstances: 62 • the Reporting NZFI has identified that the account is held (and/or, in the case of a passive NFE, controlled) by a Reportable Person from a Reportable Jurisdiction; or • the Reporting NZFI has decided to adopt the wider approach to reporting and has identified that the account is held (and/or, in the case of a passive NFE, controlled) by a relevant foreign tax resident. Reporting NZFIs must report two types of information about such accounts: • identity information about the relevant foreign tax resident account holder (and foreign tax- resident controlling person – in the case of accounts held by passive NFEs); and • financial account information – for example, the account balance or value and payments made to the account holder. These reporting requirements will apply on an annual basis (i.e. by 30 June of the relevant year). In other words, Reporting NZFIs that have identified an account as reportable should continue to report the account annually to Inland Revenue unless there is a change in circumstances that means that the account is not reportable. A Reporting NZFI that does not have any accounts to report for a particular reporting period will also have the option of providing a nil report. Th is gu idance now outlines in detail the identity and financial account information that Reporting NZFIs need to report annually about any reportable accounts it has identified. 62 Reporting NZFIs also need to report accounts that they have i dentified as being undocumented accounts. The circumstances when an account will be an undocumented account are outlined at paragraphs 1.6, 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of this guidance. 86 Identity information that Reporting NZFIs will need to report for a 6.1 reportable account Reporting NZFIs will generally need to annually report the following identity information to Inland Revenue about reportable accounts: • The name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence, TIN(s) 63 and date of birth in the case of any individual account holder that is a Reportable Person. (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting). • The name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence and TIN(s) of any entity account holder that is a Reportable Person. (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting.) • In the case of any passive NFE account holder that is identified as having one or more controlling persons that is a Reportable Person: o the name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence, TIN(s) of the passive NFE; and o the name, address, jurisdiction(s) of residence, TIN(s), and date of birth of the controlling person (or persons). (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting.) • The account number (or functional equivalent in the absence of an account number). • The name and identifying number (if any) of the Reporting NZFI. Th is guidance now provides some further context to some of the identification information that Reporting NZFIs need to provide and the exceptions/qualifications that apply. TIN A Reporting NZFI generally needs to report a TIN (or functional equivalent, in the absence of a TIN) for reportable accounts (i.e. the TIN of the relevant foreign tax resident account holder or controlling person). However, there are some important exceptions and qualificat ions to this. 63 As noted above, in the absence of a TIN, the functional equivalent should be collected and reported. 87 Exception: A TIN (or functional equivalent) is not required to be obtained and reported if: • the person has not been issued with a TIN (or functional equivalent). For example, if: o the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not issue TINs (or functional equivalent); or o the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence has not issued a TIN (or functional equivalent) to them; or • the person’s jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of TINs issued by that jurisdiction. Qualificat ion: Furthermore, a Reporting NZFI that identifies that an account holder (or controlling person) of a reportable pre-existing account is a relevant foreign tax resident, and does not otherwise have the person’s TIN (or functional equivalent) in its records, will also only be required to use reasonable efforts to obtain and report the TIN (or functional equivalent) by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which the account is identified as being held (or controlled) by a Reportable Person. D ate of bir th A Reporting NZFI generally needs to report date of birth information of the relevant individual account holder (or controlling person) for reportable accounts (i.e. the date of birth information of the relevant foreign tax resident account holder or controlling person). Qualificat ion: However, a Reporting NZFI that identifies that an account holder (or controlling person) of a pre-exis ting account is a relevant foreign tax resident, and does not otherwise have the person’s date of birth in their records, will only be required to use reasonable efforts to obtain and report the date of birth by the end of second reporting period following the period in which the account is identified as being held (or controlled) by a Reportable Person. It should be further noted that, while the date of birth must be reported, the place of birth is not required to be reported, and should not be reported to Inland Revenue. Financial account information that Reporting NZFIs will need to report for a 6.2 reportable account Reporting NZFIs will also need to report the following financial information about reportable accounts: • The account balance or value as at the end of the reporting period (i.e. 31 March) or, if the account was closed during that period, the closure of the account. 88 • In the case of a custodial account: o the total gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the relevant period ending 31 March; o the total gross amount of dividends paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the relevant period ending 31 March; o the total gross amount of other income generated with respect to the assets held in the account and paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the relevant period ending 31 March; and o the total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the relevant period ending 31 March with respect to which the Reporting NZFI acted as a custodian, broker, nominee or otherwise as an agent for the account holder. • In the case of a depository account, the total gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the relevant period ending 31 March. • In the case of any other type of account, the total gross amount paid or credited to the account holder with respect to the account during the relevant period ending 31 March with respect to which the Reporting NZFI is the obligor or debtor. This includes the aggregate amount of any redemption payments made to the account holder during the reporting period. Where an account is jointly held, each holder of the account is attributed the entire balance or value of the joint account, as well as the entire amounts paid or credited to the joint account (or with respect to the joint account). This guidance now provides some further context to the financial information that Reporting NZFIs need to report about such reportable accounts. Account balance or value Reporting NZFIs are (subject to the following) required to report the account balance or value of a reportable account as of the end of the relevant period ending 31 March. However, if an account was closed during that period, the Reporting NZFI must report the closure of the account. An account will be considered to be closed according to the Reporting NZFI’s normal operating procedures that are consistently maintained for all accounts. In most cases, it w ill be fairly self-explanatory as to whether an account has been closed. An equity or debt interest account would 89 generally be considered to be closed upon termination, transfer, surrender, redemption, cancellation or liquidation. An account with a balance or value equal to zero or that is negative will not be considered to be closed solely by reason of having such a balance or value. 64 If the account was closed during the period, the Reporting NZFI must report that the account was closed, but not the account balance or value before or at the time of closure. This is a key difference between the CRS and FATCA. For FA TCA, it is the balance immediately prior to closure that needs to be reported. The following points are relevant when determining the account balance or value: • In general, the balance or value of a financial account is the balance or value calculated by the Reporting NZFI for purposes of reporting to the account holder (see paragraph 12 on page 98 of the CRS Commentary). However, as explained below, other methods are permissible where the Reporting NZFI does not report to the account holder. • The balance or value of depository financial accounts in a Reporting NZFI is self-explanatory (i.e. it would simply be the funds held in the account). • The balance or value of an equity interest financial account is the value calculated by the Reporting NZFI for the purpose that requires the most frequent determination of value (which may be for reporting/investment purposes). If the Reporting NZFI has not otherwise recalculated the balance or value for other reasons (such as reporting/investment purposes), the balance or value will be the value of the interest upon acquisition or otherwise will be the total value of the Reporting NZFI’s property (see page 82 of the OECD’s CRS Implementation Handbook). • The balance or value of a debt interest financial account is its principal amount. • In the case of a cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract financial account, the account balance or value includes the cash value 65 or surrender value. • The balance or value of a financial account is not to be reduced by any liabilities or obligations incurred by an account holder with respect to the account or any of the assets held in the account. 64 See page 99 of the CRS Commentary. 65 The meaning of “cash value” is outlined in detail in paragraph 3.1.4.2 of this guidance. 90 • Where a financial account is jointly held, each holder of the account is attributed the entire balance or value of the joint account, as well as the entire amounts paid or credited to the joint account (or with respect to the joint account). • A financial account with a balance or value that is negative must be reported as having an account balance or value equal to zero. • Where an account is held by a Passive NFE with more than one controlling person that is a Reportable Person, each controlling person is attributed the entire balance or value of the account held by the Passive NFE, as well as the entire amounts paid or credited to the account. (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting.) • Where an account is held by an account holder that is a Reportable Person who is identified as having more than one jurisdiction of residence, the entire balance or value of the account, as well as the entire amount paid or credited to the account, must be reported with respect to each jurisdiction of residence of the account holder. (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting.) • Where an account is held by a Passive NFE with a controlling person that is a Reportable Person and is identified as having more than one jurisdiction of residence, the entire balance or value of the account held by the Passive NFE, as well as the entire amount paid or credited to the account, must be reported with respect to each jurisdiction of residence of the controlling person. (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting.) • Where an account is held by a Passive NFE that is a Reportable Person with a controlling person that is a Reportable Person, the entire balance or value of the account held by the Passive NFE, as well as the entire amount paid or credited to the account, must be reported with respect to both the Passive NFE and the controlling person. (This requirement would apply to all relevant foreign tax residents if the Reporting NZFI adopted the wider approach to reporting.) 91 Gr oss proceeds A clearing or settlement organisation that maintains accounts, and settles sales and purchases may not know the gross proceeds from sales and dispositions. Where this is the case, gross proceeds are limited to the net amount paid or credited to a member’s account that is associated with sales or other dispositions of financial assets by that member as of the time that the transactions are settled under the organisation’s settlement procedures (see paragraph 18 on page 100 of the CRS Commentary). With respect to a sale that is effected by a broker that results in a payment of gross proceeds, the date the gross proceeds are considered paid is the date that the proceeds of sale are credited to the account of, or made available to, the person entitled to the payment. Currency The information that the Reporting NZFI reports must identify the currency in which each account is denominated (compared with how a currency conversion can be used for due diligence purposes). Format that a Reporting NZFI can use for reporting CRS information 7 Inland Revenue is currently considering the format that Reporting NZFIs will be able to use for reporting such CRS information. Three approaches are being considered: • XML file upload • Template spread-sheet • Online form (IR site) Inland Revenue intends to provide further guidance on the reporting formats that Reporting NZFIs will be able to use. CRS record-keeping obligations 8 Obligation to keep and retain records 8.1 Reporting NZFIs will also (in addition to their other CRS due diligence and reporting obligations) be required to keep records of the steps they have taken and the evidence they have relied upon for the performance of their CRS obligations. This includes a specific requirement for these NZFIs to keep a record of any failure to obtain a required self-cert ificat ion. These specific CRS obligations are set out in sections 22(2)(1d) and (1e) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and reflect the expectations set out in section IX(A)(1) of the CRS. These record-keeping requirements will also assist Inland Revenue in monitoring and verifying a Reporting NZFI’s compliance with the CRS and addressing any non-compliance (including considering the application of any penalties). 92 In accordance with section 25 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002, Reporting NZFIs have the option of using technology to store source paper documents by electronic means. The main requirements to retain records (in this way) under that Act, whether the records were originally in paper form or electronic form, are that: • the integrity of the information contained in the records is to be maintained; and • the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for future reference. Further conditions for legal requirements to retain records under the Inland Revenue Acts are provided in schedule 1, clause 4 of the Electronic Transactions Regulations 2003. Accordingly, a Reporting NZFI is able to hold its records in either paper-based form or electronic copies. Records do not need to be the original, and can encompass certified copies, or photocopies (including by microfiche, electronic scan or similar means of electronic storage). As explained further below, there is also sometimes scope for a Reporting NZFI to keep a notation of information or documentation reviewed in defined circumstances. However, to the extent that information is held electronically, Reporting NZFIs must be able to produce to the Commissioner a paper copy. For example, a NZFI that operates a document imaging system will not need to retain original documents for CRS purposes as long as it can easily produce an imaged copy which can be converted into paper form if requested by the Commissioner. 8.1.1Records to be in English and retained in New Zealand In accordance with the general tax record-keeping requirements set out in section 22(2BA) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a Reporting NZFI must also retain such records in English, in New Zealand. Records must be able to be produced to the Commissioner, in English, when requested. However, in accordance with section 22(8)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Reporting NZFIs may upon application in writing to the Commissioner: • to keep and retain a record or type of record: o in a language other than English: o in a place outside New Zealand. If the Commissioner approves the application, she may impose any conditions she thinks necessary, and may subsequently vary or withdraw the authorisation. 8.1.2Period of retention of records The proposed approach is that Reporting NZFIs will need to keep such records: 93 • for seven years from the end of the relevant reporting period in accordance with section 22(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is in line with the FATCA record-keeping period. This includes a specific requirement to keep a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification. This will enable Inland Revenue to request a copy of such records (if necessary) to determine whether the Reporting NZFI has complied with its due diligence and reporting obligations. The guidance now outlines how these record-keeping requirements will apply in the following circumstances: • When a Reporting NZFI relies on publicly available information as part of CRS due diligence (i.e. what records does the NZFI need to keep about the publicly available information it has relied on). • When a Reporting NZFI relies on documentary evidence obtained as part of CRS due diligence (i.e. what records does the NZFI need to keep about the documentary evidence it has relied on). • When a Reporting NZFI relies on a self-certification obtained as part of CRS due diligence (i.e. what records does the NZFI need to keep about a self-certification it obtains). • When a self-certification would otherwise fail the “reasonableness test” and a Reporting NZFI gathers further information to determine the veracity of the self-certification (i.e. what records does the NZFI need to keep about such information). • When there has been a change in circumstances that calls into question a self-certification a Reporting NZFI has obtained and it has gathered further information to determine the valid ity of the self-certification (i.e. what records does the NZFI need to keep about such information?). • The procedures adopted by a Reporting NZFI as part of the requirement to use “reasonable efforts” to obtain TINs for pre-existing accounts held or controlled by Reportable Persons (i.e. what records does the NZFI need to keep about the steps that it follows for obtaining TINs for such accounts?). This is not an exhaustive list of circumstances where a Reporting NZFI will have CRS record- keeping obligations. However, it does set out some of the key areas where a Reporting NZFI will have such obligations. The reader should refer to the CRS Commentary for further detail about the 94 range of circumstances where they will need to keep records of the steps that they have undertaken and the evidence they have relied upon in carrying out their CRS due diligence and reporting. 8.1.3Publicly available information The CRS provides that, in certain defined circumstances, a Reporting NZFI is able to rely on “publicly available” information when carrying out CRS due diligence. For example, by using information published by an authorised government body, information in a publicly accessible register, information disclosed on an established securities market or any publicly accessible classification determined on an industry coding system in order to identify whether or not an entity account holder is a Reportable Person (see section V(C)(1)(b) and section VI(A)(1)(b)). If a Reporting NZFI relies upon “publicly available” information in carrying out CRS due diligence, it must retain a notation of the type of information reviewed, and the date it was reviewed. 66 The notation will form part of the records the Reporting NZFI is required to retain. 8.1.4Due diligence – documentary evidence The CRS also provides scope in certain defined circumstances for a Reporting NZFI to rely on documentary evidence 67 when carrying out CRS due diligence. The relevant types of documentary evidence are summarised in Appendix 3. If a Reporting NZFI has relied on such documentary evidence when carrying out its CRS due diligence, it will need to keep a record of that evidence. A Reporting NZFI does not need to retain original documentary evidence. The evidence may be a certified copy, a photocopy (including a microfiche, electronic scan, or similar means of electronic storage), or at least a notation of the type of documentation reviewed, the date the documentation was reviewed, and the document’s identification number (if any) (for example, a passport number). Any documentation that is stored electronically must be made available in hard copy form upon request. 68 A Reporting NZFI may also accept a copy of documentary evidence electronically if the electronic system ensures that the information received is the information sent, and documents all occasions of user access that result in the submission, renewal or modification of the documentary evidence (see page 205 at paragraph 158 of the CRS Commentary). The system must also ensure that the person accessing it and furnishing the documentary evidence is the person named on the documentary evidence. Reporting NZFIs should keep a record of such steps, which must be able to be provided to the Commissioner on request. 66 See page 137, paragraph 12 of the CRS Commentary. 67 In general, a Reporting NZFI must obtain documentary evidence on an account-by-account basis. However, a Reporting NZF I may rel y upon the documentary evidence furnished by a customer for another account if both accounts are treated as a single account for purposes of satisfying the standards of knowledge requirements in paragraph A of section VII of the CRS (see page 205 of the CRS Commentary). 68 See page 205, paragraph 157 of the CRS Commentary. 95 8.1.5Self-certifications Copy of self-certification 8.1.5.1 As noted above, the CRS often requires Reporting NZFIs to obtain self-certifications from account holders (and in certain circumstances controlling persons) as to whether or not they are foreign tax residents. A Reporting NZFI must retain a copy of these self-certifications. This may be an original, certified copy or photocopy (including a microfiche, electronic scan or similar means of electronic storage). If stored electronically, the electronic system must ensure that the information received is the information sent, and must document all occasions of user access including the submission, renewal or modification of a self-certification. The system must also ensure that the person accessing the system and furnishing the self-certification is the person named in the self-certification. A Reporting NZFI must be able to provide on request a hard copy of all electronic self-certifications. 69 A self-certification may be signed (or otherwise positively affirmed) by any person authorised to sign on behalf of the account holder (or controlling person) under domestic law. The self-certification, authorisations to sign and details of user access must be able to be made available to the Commissioner in hard copy upon request. These obligations align with the requirement for a Reporting NZFI to keep records (available for request by the Commissioner) of the steps undertaken and evidence relied upon for the purposes of undertaking due diligence. Reporting NZFIs are also required to keep a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification. Th is will assist with monitoring and verifying compliance with CRS. Positive affirmation 8.1.5.2 As noted above, for a self-certification to be valid, the CRS requires that it must be signed or “otherwise positively” affirmed by the relevant account holder or (if applicable) controlling person. In addition to manually signed self-cert ificat ions, this allows the self-certification to be completed online or orally, including over the phone. In accordance with an answer to a “Frequently Asked Question”, the OECD has confirmed (see https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/CRS-related-FAQs.pdf ) that a self-certification will be “otherwise positively affirmed” if the person making the self- certification provides the Reporting NZFI with an unambiguous acknowledgment that they agree with the representations made through the self-certification. In all cases, the positive self- certification is expected to be captured by the Reporting NZFI in a manner such that it can credibly demonstrate that the self-certification was positively affirmed (for example, by voice recording, digital footprint etc.) The approach taken by the Reporting NZFI in obtaining the self-cert ificat ion is expected to be in a manner consistent with the procedures they follow for the opening of the account. The Reporting NZFI will need to maintain a record of this process for audit purposes, in addition to 69 See page 129, paragraph 9 of the CRS Commentary. 96 the self-cert ificat ion itself. Th is aligns with the requirement that a Reporting NZFI keeps a record of both the steps undertaken (which would cover such processes) and evidence that it has relied on (which would cover the self-certification itself) in carrying out CRS due diligence. Incorrect or unreliable self-certifications/change of circumstances 8.1.5.3 As noted above, a Reporting NZFI cannot rely upon a self-certification for CRS due diligence purposes if it knows, or has reason to know, that the self-certification is incorrect or unreliable. If a Reporting NZFI has carried out CRS due diligence on a financial account and, as part of that process, obtained a self-certification about the tax residence of an account holder (or, if applicable, controlling person), and there is a change of circumstances that causes a Reporting NZFI to know that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting NZFI cannot rely upon the original self-certification. The Reporting NZFI would need to obtain either a valid self-cert ificat ion that establishes the residence for the tax purposes of the account holder (or, if applicable, controlling person), or a reasonable explanation and documentation (as appropriate) supporting the validity of the original self-cert ificat ion. If the Reporting NZFI obtains a new self-certification it would need to keep a record of that self- certification – just like any other self-cert ificat ion it obtains. If the Reporting NZFI relies on a reasonable explanation and documentation supporting the validity of the original self-certification it will be required to retain a copy or a notation of the explanation and documentation. 70 This is in addition to the requirement to keep a record of the self-certification itself. 8.1.6Reasonable efforts to obtain a TIN As noted above, if a Reporting NZFI maintains a pre-existing account that is held (and/or, in the case of a passive NFE, controlled) by a relevant foreign tax resident, and it does not have the person’s TIN (or functional equivalent) in its records, it is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the person’s TIN by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which the account is identified as being held (and/or controlled) by a Reportable Person. “Reasonable efforts” in this context means genuine attempts to obtain the TIN, which must be made at least once a year by, for example, contacting the account holder by mail, in person or by phone, including a request made as part of other documentation or electronically (for example, by facsimile or by email) and reviewing electronically searchable information maintained by a related entity of the Reporting NZFI. 71 70 See page 130 of the CRS Commentary. 71 See page 103 of the CRS Commentary. 97 The only exceptions to this are if either: • the Reportable Person is tax-resident in a jurisdiction that does not issue TINs or a functional equivalent (or has not had a TIN or a functional equivalent issued to them); or • the Reportable Person is tax-resident in a jurisdiction that does not require the collection of TINs. It is expected that a Reporting NZFI would keep a record of the steps that it undertakes to obtain TINs in such circumstances and the evidence of how those policies and procedures are followed. 72 This will assist Inland Revenue in monitoring compliance and, in particular, determining whether the Reporting NZFI has made reasonable efforts to obtain TINs in such circumstances. A procedural manual describing appropriate “reasonable efforts” can be a record describing the “steps” undertaken provided there is also evidence as to how those policies and procedures are followed. In the case of a mail merge, for example, this would not require a Reporting NZFI to keep actual copies of the letters sent, but it must be able to provide, upon request, the document that contains the information that is the same in each version and the data file where the unique information is stored. 73 Penalties regime 9 This guidance will now, having outlined the obligations Reporting NZFIs have to carry out CRS due diligence (including record keeping) and reporting, set out the penalties regime that will apply if there is non-compliance. Section IX(A)(5) of the CRS provides that implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) are required to have rules and administrative procedures in place to ensure effective implementation of, and compliance with, the CRS due diligence and reporting procedures. Therefore, a comprehensive suite of obligations and penalties have been introduced to assist with achieving CRS compliance and to address non-compliance. These obligations cover: • reporting NZFIs; and • account holders (and other persons connected with accounts – such as intermediaries that hold funds for other persons, and controlling persons). 72 See page 209 of the CRS Commentary. 73 See page 209, at paragraph 9 of the CRS Commentary. 98 The specific types of penalties that will be imposed under New Zealand legis lat ion are outlined in detail further below. Some of these penalties also apply for the purposes of FATCA, where similar compliance issues arise. Penalties regime – financ ial institutions 9.1 In brief terms, financial penalties will apply to Reporting NZFIs that fail to undertake their due diligence obligations, fail to report the requisite information, or who provide inaccurate or false information (i.e. Reporting NZFIs that fail to comply with their CRS obligations under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Th is includes: • civil absolute liability penalties; • civil penalties for failing to take reasonable care; and • criminal knowledge-based penalties. These penalties are all mutually exclusive. For example, if a penalty is imposed on a Reporting NZF I for a failure to take reasonable care an additional absolute liability penalty would not be able to be imposed for that same failure. This guidance now outlines how these “financial institution” penalties would apply in practice. 9.1.1Civil absolute liability penalties A Reporting NZFI that does not comply with its CRS obligations could (depending on the circumstances) be liable for the following absolute liability penalties: Section 142H(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: $300 per failure (capped at $10,000 per reporting period) to comply with any CRS obligation (other than failing to obtain a self- certification for a new account – see below). This will be subject to the following defences: • that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the Reporting NZFI’s control; and • for a transitional period ending 30 June 2019, that the Reporting NZFI made reasonable efforts to meet its CRS requirements (including making reasonable efforts to correct any failure w ithin a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of the failure). Section 142H(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: $300 per account (capped at $10,000 per reporting period) for failure to obtain a required self-certification on account opening. This will be subject to the following defence: 99 • for a transitional period ending 30 June 2019, that the Reporting NZFI made reasonable efforts to meet its CRS requirements (including making reasonable efforts to correct any failure w ithin a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of the failure). The expressions “reasonable efforts” and “reasonable period” are not explicitly defined in the CRS or domestic tax legislation. As a general guideline, “reasonable” is what is fair, proper or appropriate in the circumstances. The “reasonableness” concept can also be found in the CRS due diligence procedures as well as being a familiar legal concept. For example, in the CRS a Reporting NZF I : • cannot rely on documentary evidence or a self-certification that it has reason to know is incorrect or unreliable; 74 • must undertake a “reasonableness” review of all new account self-certifications; 75 and • must make reasonable efforts to obtain TINs and date of birth of pre-existing accounts within two years of the end of the reporting period when an account is identified as being held or controlled by a Reportable Person. The CRS Commentary provides helpful guidance of what is reasonable in this context. 76 In simple terms, “reasonable effort” and “reasonable period” should be assessed in terms of what a prudent Reporting NZFI would consider appropriate in the same or similar circumstances. As assessment of whether a Reporting NZFI has made “reasonable efforts” or rectified an error within a “reasonable period” of time will depend on matters such as the nature of the failure/error (including whether reasonable procedures were in place) and how difficult it would be to rectify the error. What may constitute “reasonable efforts” may also depend on the type of account (i.e. pre-exist ing or new). For example, the CRS Commentary acknowledges (at page 103, paragraph 28) that “reasonable efforts” in the context of pre-existing individual account due diligence would not necessarily involve the Reporting NZFI closing, blocking or transferring the account, nor conditioning or otherwise limiting its use if the Reporting NZFI is unable to obtain CRS information (such as an account holder’s TIN ). However, the CRS Commentary is also clear that a more rigorous standard is required for new account due diligence. For example, page 211 of the CRS Commentary sets out the base expectation that valid self-cert ificat ions will always be obtained for new accounts. The meaning of “reasonable efforts” in the defence to the imposition of penalties under section 142H(1) and (3) needs to be read in this context (i.e. a higher standard is required to 74 See pages 149 to 152 of the CRS Commentary. 75 See page 133 of the CRS Commentary. 76 See pages 102 to104 of the CRS Commentary. 100 meet this level of reasonable efforts for new accounts. This reflects the fact that the Reporting NZFI has more control for new accounts. For example, it could simply not open an account if an account holder fails to provide a self-certification. “Failure” to meet a CRS requirement (other than obtaining a self-certification) 9.1.1.1 under section 142H(1) A penalty will (subject to the application of the defences) be imposed under section 142H(1) of the Tax Admin istrat ion Act 1994 for a “failure” to comply with a CRS obligation (other than an obligation to obtain a self-certification for a new account). The following principles are relevant when determining what constitutes a “failure” in this regard: • The CRS is concerned with Reporting NZFIs obtaining and (where relevant) reporting “financial account” information. In this context, a “failure” under section 142H(1) would generally be an error that relates to a single account (i.e. failure to carry out sufficient due diligence or reporting in relation to a single account). • If a Reporting NZFI fails to carry out due diligence on a particular account and, as a result of that error, does not report the account this would generally also be considered a single “failure” (as opposed to two failures). This is because the reporting error is, essentially, a corollary of the due diligence failure. • A systemic error that incidentally affects a number of accounts would generally constitute a single failure. There is a $10,000 cap that will apply for penalties in a particular period under section 142H(1). Example 1: A Reporting NZFI fails to carry out due diligence on one of its pre-existing entity accounts by 30 June 2019 (the deadline for carrying out the initial review of such accounts). This would constitute a “failure” under section 142H(1). The issue of whether a penalty could be imposed under section 142H(1) would be a question of fact and would depend on whether any of the defences apply. Example 2: A Reporting NZFI reports its CRS information for the first reporting period on 20 June 2018. The Reporting NZFI’s computer system has a virus that corrupts 30 of the accounts that it reports. This means that the Reporting NZFI’s report contains errors related to 30 accounts. This would constitute a single “failure” under section 142H(1), not 30 failures. The issue of whether a penalty would be imposed under section 142H(1) would be a question of fact and would depend on whether any of the defences apply. 101 Example 3: A Reporting NZFI carries out CRS due diligence on a pre-existing individual account held by Tom. The Reporting NZFI identifies that Tom is a foreign tax resident that is a Reportable Person. The Reporting NZFI does not have Tom’s TIN and date of birth in its records. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI is required to take reasonable efforts to obtain Tom’s TIN and date of birth by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which it identified Tom’s account as being a Reportable Account. The Reporting NZFI does not make genuine efforts to obtain this information from Tom at least once a year during the period between identifying the account as a Reportable Account and the end of the second reporting period following the period of the identification. A penalty of $300 could be imposed on the Reporting NZFI under section 142H(1). “Failure” to obtain a self-certification under section 142H(3) 9.1.1.2 A penalty will also be able to be imposed under section 142H(3) where a Reporting NZFI fails to obtain a self-certification for a new account, subject to the “reasonable efforts” defence ending on 30 June 2019. Section 142H(3) is specifically worded so that the “failure” is on a per account basis (i.e. if there is failure to obtain one or a number of self-certifications for a particular account a penalty of $300 will apply. There is a $10,000 cap that could apply for penalties in a particular period under section 142H(3). Example 1: On 1 September 2017 Bob attempts to open a depository account with a Reporting N Z FI bank. The Reporting NZFI seeks a self-certification from Bob. Bob does not provide a self- certification. The Reporting NZFI completes the account opening process even though Bob has not provided the required self-certification. This includes allowing Bob to deposit NZD 10,000 into the account. The CRS provides (in this regard) that such self-certifications must always be obtained for new accounts. As noted above, the OECD has confirmed in an answer to a “Frequently Asked Question” that self-certifications must generally be obtained at “day one of the account opening process”. Reporting NZFI has failed to obtain a self-certification from Bob on his account opening (a “failure” under section 142H(3)). The Reporting NZFI could have simply not opened the account in the first place (i.e. made the opening of the account contingent on obtaining Bob’s self-certification). The Reporting NZFI’s decision to open the account without first obtaining Bob’s self-certification was not a reasonable step. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI has not made “reasonable efforts” to obtain a self-cert ificat ion from Bob on account opening. Accordingly, a penalty of $300 could be imposed on the Reporting NZFI under section 142H(3). The Reporting NZFI would also be expected to take reasonable steps to continue to try to obtain the required self-certification from Bob. These reasonable steps could, depending on the circumstances, involve needing to close the account if Bob continues to refuse to provide the self-certification for a 102 material period of time. This is consistent with the expectation (as outlined above) that a self- certification will always be obtained for new accounts. Example 2: On 1 October 2017 Cameron attempts to open a depository account with a Reporting NZFI. The Reporting NZFI seeks a self-certification from Cameron. Cameron advises that he cannot provide a self-certification on that day because he does not have all of the information with him to make the certification. The Reporting NZFI informs Cameron that it can undertake account pre-opening procedures (including allocating a number to Cameron for administrative purposes), but that the account will not be opened, and indeed, the account opening procedures cannot be progressed, until he provides the self-certification (i.e. the Reporting NZFI informs Cameron that he will not be able to deposit funds into the account and/or make transactions with respect to the account until he provides the certification). Cameron does not provide a self-certification. The Reporting NZFI keeps a record of Cameron’s failure to provide the self-certification. The Reporting NZFI has not obtained a self-certification from Cameron. However, the Reporting NZFI has not proceeded with the account opening process in a material sense. The Reporting NZFI would not be liable for a penalty of $300 under section 142H(3). Civil penalties on financial institutions for lack of reasonable care 9.1.1.3 A Reporting NZFI that does not comply with its CRS obligations could (depending on the circumstances) be liable for a penalty for lack of reasonable care under section 142H(5) of $20,000 for the first failure and $40,000 for each further failure (capped at $100,000 per reporting period). The concept of “reasonable care” as applied under New Zealand law should be applied. What will amount to taking reasonable care will be dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case. As a general guide, it will be determined in the context of the degree of caution and concern which a prudent Reporting NZFI would use in similar circumstances. This is, essentially, the same point made above about what would constitute “reasonable efforts”. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI sets up its CRS due diligence procedures, but does not build into these procedures the fact that it is required to carry out due diligence on its pre-existing entity accounts by 30 June 2019 (the deadline for carrying out the initial review and reporting of such accounts). As a result of this, the Reporting NZFI fails to carry out due diligence on its pre-existing accounts by 30 June 2019. The Reporting NZFI would be liable for a penalty under section 142H(5). A prudent Reporting NZFI would have built into its due diligence procedures the requirement to finish its pre-ex ist ing entity account due diligence by 30 June 2019. The Reporting NZFI would be liable for a penalty of at least $20,000 for this failure. It is likely that this would be considered to be a systemic failure that simply incidentally affects multiple accounts. If this is the case, there would be a single failure and penalty (for that failure) of $20,000. The maximum amount of penalties that could be imposed under section 142H(5) in a reporting period is $100,000. 103 9.1.2Criminal knowledge-based penalties A Reporting NZFI that knowingly does not comply with its CRS obligations could (depending on the circumstances) be liable for a penalty under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the following types of offences: • knowingly not keeping documents required to be kept by a tax law; • knowingly not providing information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law. This is subject to a defence that can apply if the person – the Reporting NZFI in this context – does not have the information in its knowledge, possession, or control; or • knowingly providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information to the Commissioner in respect of its CRS obligations. The penalties that apply for such offences, upon conviction, are $25,000 for a first offence, and up to $50,000 for subsequent offences. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI has in place enhanced due diligence procedures for pre-existing individual accounts, where the only indicia is a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address and there is no other address on file. The Reporting NZFI seeks to obtain a self-certification from the account holder to determine their status. The account holder does not provide a self-certification. The Reporting NZFI is aware of its obligations to keep a record of a failure to obtain a self- certification (see section 22(2)(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). However, it decides not to keep a record of the failure. The Reporting NZFI would have knowingly failed to keep records of the steps it has undertaken, and any evidence it has relied upon, for the purposes of undertaking its due diligence obligations under the CRS set out in part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI would have knowingly not kept documents required to be kept by a tax law. Accordingly, a penalty could be imposed on the Reporting NZFI, upon conviction, under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Penalties regime – information providers 9.2 As noted above, Reporting NZFIs have obligations to undertake due diligence on their accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in the case of passive NFEs, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents, to collect prescribed information about such persons, and to report 77 prescribed identity 77 As noted above, this would appl y if either the relevant foreign tax resi dent is a Reportable Person from a Reportable Jurisdiction or the Reporting NZF I otherwise chooses to adopt the wider approach to reporting. 104 and financial account information about those persons (and accounts) to Inland Revenue 78 . Reporting NZFIs are potentially subject to penalties if they do not comply with these obligations. As part of this due diligence process, a Reporting NZFI may (depending on the type of account) be required to take the following steps: • request self-certifications and other information from account holders (including a passive NFE account holder about its status or the status of its controlling persons); • request and obtain information from a person acting on behalf of an account holder (e.g. intermediary or nominee that is not the account holder) about the account holder and (if the account holder is a passive NFE) the account holder’s controlling persons; and • request self-certifications and other information from a controlling person of a passive NFE. The Reporting NZFI will request this information so it can determine whether the account is held (or controlled) by a relevant foreign tax resident and obtain information about such accounts that it may need to report. Therefore, account holders, intermediaries/nominees, and controlling persons will sometimes be asked to obtain and provide self-certifications or other information (generally about whether they are foreign tax residents or whether they hold funds for foreign tax residents) to assist a Reporting NZFI to carry out its due diligence. A self-certification will generally involve such persons signing or otherwise affirming whether they (or persons that they hold funds for) are foreign tax residents. These persons will be referred to as “information providers” for the purposes of the following guidance. In order to provide an incentive for information providers to obtain and provide such information, and in acknowledgement of the fact that such persons often control the information that the Reporting NZFI is required to obtain (or at least can take reasonable steps to obtain this information), various requirements will be imposed on information providers. These requirements will apply for the purposes of both CRS and FATCA. The requirements are set out in section 185P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as follows: (1) This section applies to a person or entity associated with a financial account if the financial institution that maintains the financial account is required under the FATCA agreement or CRS applied standard (the account requirements) to perform due diligence for the financial account. (2) When a financial institution requests a person or entity (the institution contact) to provide information or a self-certification that the financial institution is required to obtain under the account requirements for the financial account, the institution contact must— 78 Reporting NZFIs will also need to report undocumented accounts. 105 (a) provide to the financial institution the required information or self-certification for the institution contact; and (b) make reasonable efforts to obtain the required information or self-certification for each other person or entity associated with the financial account, and provide the information and self- certifications to the financial institution. (3) When a person or entity associated with the financial account (the secondary contact) is asked by an institution contact or other person or entit y (the requesting person) to provide i nformation or self- certifications related to the financial account and referred to in subsection (2)(b), the secondary contact must— (a) provide the requesting person with the required information or self-certification for the secondary contact; and (b) make reasonable efforts to obtain the required information or self-certification for each other person or entity associated with the financial account and the secondary contact, and provide the information and self-certifications to the requesting person. (4) If a person or entity provides information or a self-certification to another person or entity as required by this section, the person or entit y must inform the other person or entit y of any material change i n circumstances affecting that information or self-certification within a reasonable time of becoming aware of the material change. 9.2.1Civil penalties If an information provider does not comply with these requirements they can be subject to a penalty under section 142I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of $1,000 (subject to various defences, outlined below) for the following offences, which will apply for both CRS and FATCA purposes: • providing false information, other than a self-certification, relating to the information provider or to another person or entity; • sign ing or otherwise affirm ing a false self-certification for the information provider; • providing a false self-certification for another person or entity; • failing to provide information, other than a self-certification, relating to the information provider within a reasonable time after receiving a request for the information; • failing to sign, or otherwise affirm, and provide a self-certification related to the information provider within a reasonable time after receiving a request; • failing to provide information, other than a self-certification, relating to another person or entity within a reasonable time after receiving a request; 106 • failing to provide a self-certification relating to another person or entity within a reasonable time after receiving a request obliging the self-certification to be provided; and • after providing a person or entity with a self-certification or other information, failing to inform the person or entity of a material change in the circumstances relating to the self- certification or information within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the change. Defences The above penalties are subject to the following defences: • a “no fault” defence where the information is within the control of the information provider, but where the information provider is not at fault; and • a “reasonable efforts” defence where the information relates to another person or entity and is not within the control of the information provider (e.g. an intermediary acting on behalf of an account holder) and the information provider has made reasonable efforts to obtain and provide the information. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI undertakes new entity account due diligence on a family trust account holder and obtains a self-certification from the trust that it is a passive NFE. The Reporting NZFI then asks the trust to obtain self-certifications from its controlling persons as to whether any such persons are relevant foreign tax residents. In turn, the trust asks for self-certifications from its controlling persons as to their tax residency. One mandatory beneficiary (a controlling person) does not provide a self-certification of their tax residency, even though they are able to provide this information. The mandatory beneficiary will be subject to a penalty of $1,000 under section 142I(f) for refusing to provide a self-certification. The beneficiary has no defence as they are at fault. The passive NFE would not be subject to such a penalty. This is because it has made reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite self-certification from the beneficiary. Example 2: A Reporting NZFI maintains a pre-existing entity account held by a trust. The Reporting NZFI tries to ring the trustee’s New Zealand land line to obtain a self-certification as to whether the trust is a passive NFE. The trustee is on a six-month holiday in Europe, so does not respond to the call, and has left no forwarding contact details. The trustee is not at fault and would not be liable for a penalty for failing to provide a self- certification. 107 9.2.2Criminal knowledge-based penalties Information providers can also be subject to criminal penalties under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 if they: • knowingly fail to provide information to another person when required to do so under Part 11B. (This is subject to a defence that would apply in certain circumstances where the person does not have the information in their knowledge, possession or control); or • knowingly provide altered, false, incomplete or misleading information to another person in respect of a matter or thing relating to a requirement in Part 11B. The penalties that would apply for such offences, upon conviction, are $25,000 for a first offence, and up to $50,000 for subsequent offences if convicted of the offences listed above. These penalties apply for both CRS and FATCA purposes. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI asks a passive NFE account holder to confirm whether any of its controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. The account holder, in turn, asks its controlling persons to provide such information to it. One of the controlling persons (for example, a settlor) has this information but deliberately does not respond to the account holder’s request. The controlling person would be guilty of a knowledge offence under section 143A upon conviction. The penalties that would apply for such offences, upon conviction, are $25,000 for a first offence, and up to $50,000 for subsequent offences. CRS requirement to have an avoidance provision 10 As noted above, section IX(A)(1) of the CRS requires that implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) have rules to prevent financial institutions, persons or intermediaries from adopting practices intended to circumvent the CRS due diligence and reporting procedures. The CRS Commentary on the application of section IX states that the form of the CRS “anti-avoidance” rule is not important as long as the rule is effective to prevent circumvention of the CRS reporting requirements and the due diligence procedures. 79 The CRS Commentary provides that an implementing jurisd ict ion’s anti-avoidance rule needs to cover arrangements such as: 80 • Example 1 (Sh ift maintenance of an account): A Reporting Financial Institution advises a customer to maintain an account with a related entity in a non-participating jurisdiction that enables the Reporting Financial Institution to avoid reporting while offering to provide 79 See page 208 of the CRS Commentary. 80 See page 208 of the CRS Commentary. 108 services and retain customer relations as if the account was maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution itself. In such a case, the Reporting Financial Institution should be considered to maintain the account and have the resulting reporting and due diligence requirements. • Example 2 (Year-end amounts): Financial Institutions, individuals, entities or intermediaries manipulate year-end amounts, such as account balances, to avoid reporting or being reported on. • Example 3 (Park money with qualified credit card issuers): Individuals or entities park balances from other reportable accounts with quali fi ed credit card issuers for a short period at the end of the year to avoid reporting. • Example 4 (Electronic records and computer systems): A Reporting Financial Institution deliberately does not create any electronic records (such that an electronic record search would not yield any results) or maintains computerised systems artificially dissociated (to avoid the account aggregation rules). The common theme in each of these examples is that an arrangement has been entered into to circumvent the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. This is an important part of the background context to the following guidance. New Zealand’s anti-avoidance provision 10.1 In order to meet the OECD’s expectations set out in section IX of the CRS, there will be a specific anti-avo idance rule in section 185R of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This provision will have application for both CRS and FATCA purposes. Section 185R (1) provides that if a main purpose of a person in entering an arrangement is to avoid a requirement under this part (Part 11B)), the arrangement is treated as having no effect in relation to the person’s requirements under this part (Part 11B). Part 11B is the subpart of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that contains the following requirements: • the FATCA and CRS due diligence and reporting requirements of N ZFIs; 81 and 81 These obligations are set out in sections 185E to185O of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 109 • the information collection and provision requirements applicable to persons or entities connected with a financial account (information providers), to assist NZFIs in carrying out their FATCA and CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Section 185R(2) provides that when an arrangement has been voided (as having no effect) under section 185R(1) (the anti-avoidance rule discussed above) the person has the requirements under Part 11B that “the Commissioner considers appropriate in the absence of the arrangement”. This section allows the Commissioner to reconstruct the avoidance arrangement to ensure that the CRS requirements are best complied with. This guidance now outlines the following matters that are relevant to section 185R(1): • what constitutes an “arrangement” under section 185R(1); and • what is meant under section 185R(1) by “a main purpose of a person” (in entering into such an arrangement) being to “avoid a requirement” that they have under Part 11B. What constitutes an “arrangement” under section 185R(1) 10.2 The term “arrangement” is broadly defined in the domestic context 82 to mean an agreement, contract, plan, or undertaking, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. The section YA 1 “arrangement” definition also applies to section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and the same definition is used in section 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – the general anti-avoidance provisions applying to income tax and GST respectively. This broad definition, as interpreted by New Zealand courts and in the avoidance context, should be applied when applying section 185R(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as this provision does not provide a specific alternate definition for the term. What is meant by “a main purpose of a person” in entering into such an 10.3 arrangement being to “avoid a requirement under” Part 11B Section 185R(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would apply if a person (or entity) enters into such an arrangement with a main purpose of avoiding a requirement under Part 11B. Such an arrangement would be treated as having no effect in relation to the person’s requirements under Part 11B. As noted above, Part 11B is the subpart of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that contains the following requirements: 82 Refer to section YA 1 Income Tax Act 2007 for the definition of the term “arrangement”. 110 • the FATCA and CRS due diligence and reporting requirements of NZFIs 83 that have FATCA and CRS due diligence and reporting obligations; and • the information collection and provision requirements applicable to persons or entities connected with a financial account, to assist NZFIs in carrying out their FATCA and CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Section 185R(1) would apply if a person entered into an arrangement with a main purpose of avoid ing such a requirement. There are some important points to highlight here: • the avoidance purpose need only be “a” “main purpose” of a person in entering into the arrangement. It does not need to be the person’s only purpose; and • it is the avoidance purpose of “a person” in entering into the arrangement that is relevant, not the purpose of the “arrangement”. Determining a “main” purpose of the arrangement If such a person enters into an arrangement with a main purpose of avoiding their requirements under part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the arrangement would have no effect in relation to those requirements. For example, if a person or entity 84 associated with a financial account (such as the account holder) entered into an arrangement with a main purpose of avoiding a requirement to provide required information about the account to the Reporting NZFI, that arrangement would have no effect (would be void) in relation to that person’s requirements under Part 11B. The reference to a “main” purpose (in this context) would cover a “substantial” purpose. Th is would be a higher threshold than when such avoidance is merely incidental (i.e. a mere result of due diligence and reporting not applying would not, in and of itself, be enough for section 185R(1) to apply). 10.3.1The avoidance purpose need only be “a” main purpose Section 185R(1) also refers to “a” main purpose of avoidance, so that it is not a requirement to the section applying that the avoidance purpose be the “sole” purpose or “the” main purpose. An arrangement might be entered into with several main purposes. Provided one of those main purposes 83 These obligations are set out in sections 185E to 185O of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 84 The proposed section 185Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would appl y to the extent that the entity is not a person. 111 is the avoidance of a requirement, then section 185R(1) can apply to void the arrangement in relation to the person’s requirements. 10.3.2The avoidance purpose of “a person” Section 185R(1) refers to “a main purpose of a person” in entering into an arrangement (being to avoid a requirement they have under Part 11B). This is a subjective test to be viewed from the perspective of the person entering into the arrangement. However, the Commissioner is permitted to test the veracity of an asserted subjective purpose by considering objective evidence. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI bank maintains an account held by Tom. Tom wants to move to Australia. Tom opens another account in Australia. Tom calls the bank to close the account and instructs the bank to transfer the funds to Australia. This arrangement, would on the face of the facts provided, not be avoidance under section 185R(1). This is because the arrangement is clearly entered into because of Tom moving to Australia. It is not an arrangement entered into with a main purpose of avoiding CRS due diligence and reporting. The fact that the arrangement would mean that the Reporting NZFI would not need to carry out any ongoing due diligence in the future on the account would not by itself constitute avoidance under section 185R(1). Instead, any such avoidance appears to merely be an incidental effect of the arrangement. This can be easily contrasted with the four examples of avoidance set out in the CRS Commentary (referred to above), which clearly involve arrangements entered into with a main purpose of avoiding CRS and where such avoidance is a driver of the arrangement. Example 2: A Reporting NZFI maintains an account held by Steve. S teve is a foreign tax resident from a Reportable Jurisdiction. Steve does not want to be reported on for CRS purposes because he has not paid tax in his jurisdiction of tax residence on his foreign investments. The Reporting NZFI offers a service of relocating Steve’s accounts to a related entity resident in a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction, so that Steve will be able to avoid being reported on for CRS purposes. Steve accepts the Reporting NZFI’s offer. He is not moving to the jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction. However, he wants to move his accounts to that jurisdiction, so that he will not be reported for CRS purposes. This arrangement would be avoidance under section 185R(1). Clearly, a main purpose of Steve and the Reporting NZFI entering into the arrangement is to avoid CRS reporting. This conclusion is supported by the background context to section 185R(1). The arrangement is very similar to example 1 in the CRS Commentary (referred to above). This is precisely the type of arrangement that is intended to be captured by this provision. Example 3: The same facts as example 2 above. However, the related entity in the jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction is able to provide financial accounts which provide a rate of return slightly higher than the New Zealand accounts would. Steve asserts that a main purpose for relocating the accounts into a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction was to derive a better rate of return. 112 Section 185R(1) would still be applicable because Steve and the Reporting NZFI still entered into an arrangement with “a” main purpose of avoiding a CRS requirement. This is the case even though there is arguably a “commercial” purpose for the decision as well. Reconstruction 10.4 As noted above, section 185R(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that when an arrangement has been voided (as having no effect) under s185R(1) the person has the requirements under Part 11B that “the Commissioner considers appropriate in the absence of the arrangement”. This section allows the Commissioner to reconstruct the avoidance arrangement to ensure that the CRS requirements are best complied with. Example: A Reporting NZFI advises a customer to shift an account to a relat ed entity in a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction with a main purpose of avoiding the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. The Commissioner could consider the Reporting NZFI as nonetheless “maintaining the account” and therefore continuing to have the resulting CRS reporting and due diligence obligations. Application of CRS to particular types of entities and structures 11 Trusts 11.1 Over view The following guidance provides a high-level summary of how the CRS applies to trusts. A trust is a fiduciary relationship where property is settled by a settlor on a trustee who acts and holds the property for the benefit of specified beneficiaries (usually in terms of a trust deed). Such trusts are often referred to as “express trusts”. A discretionary trust is a common example of an express trust. A protector may also be appointed in connection with a trust. A protector’s role is to ensure that the trustee acts in accordance with their powers as authorised in the trust deed. A trust is defined in section VIII(E)(3) of the CRS as being an “entity”. All trusts will be entities irrespective of whether they are revocable or irrevocable. The fact that a trust is an entity 85 for CRS purposes means that a trust will either be a: • financial institution (commonly as an investment entity); or • NFE (passive NFE or active NFE). 85 In contrast, an individual cannot be a financial institution. 113 If a trust is a Reporting N ZF I (Reporting NZFI) it will have CRS due diligence and reporting obligations in New Zealand. If a trust is a NFE that holds a financial account with a Reporting NZFI it will be subject to due diligence (and possibly reporting) by that Reporting NZFI in New Zealand. The NFE trust will (as part of this process) have obligations to provide self-certifications and other information (on request) to the Reporting NZFI to assist the NZFI with its own due diligence. If the NFE trust is a passive NFE, this will include providing details of its controlling persons to the Reporting NZFI. The NFE trust will potentially be subject to penalties if it fails to provide this information. This guidance is in three parts. First, it outlines the circumstances when a trust will be a Reporting NZFI with due diligence and reporting obligations in New Zealand. This part will address the following points: • when will a trust be a “financial institution”; • when will a trust be a “New Zealand” financial institution (N ZF I); • when will a trust be a “Reporting” N ZFI; and • what will be a Reporting NZFI trust’s due diligence and reporting obligations? A trust (is an "entity" under the CRS) Financial Institution (commonly known as an Investment Entity) Non-financial Entity (NFE) Passive NFE (subject to look- through requirements) Active NFE 114 The second part of this guidance deals with the circumstances when a NFE trust holds an account with a Reporting NZFI and is subject to due diligence (and potentially reporting) by that Reporting NZF I. This part of the guidance also outlines the obligations that the trust (and sometimes controlling persons of the trust) will have to provide self-certifications and other information to assist the Reporting NZFI in carrying out this due diligence. The third part of the guidance provides a high-level summary of how the CRS will apply to the following types of trusts: • family trusts; • charitable trusts; • foreign trusts; and • solicitors’ trust accounts. 11.1.1When will a trust be a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution? A trust will be a Reporting NZFI if: • it is a “financial institution”; • it is a “New Zealand” financial institution (NZFI); and • it is a “Reporting” N ZFI . This guidance now explains all of these “building blocks” to set out the circumstances when a trust will be Reporting NZFI. 11.1.2When will a trust be a financial institution? A “financial institut ion” is defined in the CRS as covering the following types of entities: • a depository institution; • a custodial institution; • an investment entity; or • a specified insurance company. These types of financial institution are outlined in detail in paragraph 3.1 of this guidance. They generally require that the entity carries on a particular type of business for customers (such as a bank 115 – depository business for customers). However, as explained further below, an entity (such as a trust) can be a “managed investment entity” even if it does not carry on a business for customers. The following chart provides a high-level summary of the circumstances when a trust will be a financial institution: Step Yes No 1 Does the trust carry on a “business” for customers? Go to step 2 Go to step 3 2 Is the trust any of the following financial institutions? • an “in business” investment entity that is not excluded from the definition of the “investment entity”; or • another type of financial institution? The trust is an “in business” financial institution Go to Step 3 3 Does the trust meet all of the following: • is it managed by a financial institution; 86 • is its gross income primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets; and • is it not excluded from the definition of “investment entity”? The trust is a “managed” investment entity financial institution The trust is a NF E The type of financial institution that is most likely to apply to trusts is the investment entity category. Therefore, the following guidance focuses on this category. 86 However, the “managing” financial institution cannot itself be a managed investment entity. 116 A trust will be an investment entity in the following circumstances: 87 • if it is an “in business” investment entity; or • if it is a “managed” investment entity. When will a trust be an “in business” investment entity? A trust will be an "in business" investment entity if it primarily conducts as a business the following specified investment activities for customers: • trading in money market instruments, foreign exchange, exchange, interest rate and index instruments, transferable securities, or commodities futures trading; • individual and collective portfolio management; or • otherwise investing, administering or managing financial assets or money on behalf of persons. A trust will be treated as “primarily conducting as a business” these specified investment activities for customers if its gross income from these activities equals or exceeds 50% of the trust’s gross income over the following specified period: The shorter of: • the three-year period ending on 31 March of the period preceding the period in which the determination is made; or • the period during which the entity has been in existence. The following types of trusts would generally be “in business” investment entities: • a unit trust; • a collective investment vehicle constituted as a trust; and • a managed investment scheme (under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) constituted as a trust. 87 However, an active NFE coming within section VIII(D)(9)(d)-(g) of the CRS is excluded from bei ng an investment entity. This exclusion is unlikely to apply to trusts, so will not be considered here. However, readers should refer to the definition of “active NFE” in Appendix 4 for further detail about this exclusion. 117 Other common forms of trusts, such as family trusts, would generally not carry on a business for customers. However, as explained below, they could still (depending on the circumstances) be managed investment entities. Example: Trevor Funds is a managed investment scheme that carries on as its business collective portfolio activities for customers. It derived all of its income from such activities over the specified period. Is it an “in business” investment entity? Yes. Trevor Funds carried out specified investment activities for customers (collective portfolio management) and derived its income primarily from such activities over the specified period. Therefore, it is an “in business” investment entity. When will a trust be a “managed” investment entity? The second type of investment entity is a “managed” investment entity. A trust will be a managed investment entity if: • it derives its income primarily (50% or more) from investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets over the specified period; and • it is managed by a financial institution (other than a managed investment entity). This then raises the following questions: • what is a “financial asset”; and • what does “managed” mean? What is the meaning of “financial asset”? A “financial asset” generally covers all assets (including, for example, shares, units, bonds and money) other than physical commodities or direct interests in real property. What is the meaning of being “managed” by a financial institution? An entity will be regarded as “managed” by another financial institution (that performs specified investment activities for it) where that financial institution has discretionary authority to manage the entity’s assets (either in whole or in part.) A financial institution trustee will generally manage a trust (in this regard). A trustee may also outsource management of the trust’s assets (either in whole or part). For example, where the trustee of a family trust sets the parameters within which a fund manager can invest some or all of the trust’s assets, but gives the fund manager full discretion to invest within those parameters, the trust’s assets will be managed by the fund manager. 118 However, where the trustee retains full control over the investment decisions and the fund manager simply acts on instruction from the trustee without discretion, the assets will not be managed by the fund manager. Furthermore, if a financial institution merely provides advice to an entity, this will not be sufficient by itself to mean that the financial institution manages the entity. It is the discretionary authority to manage the entity’s assets (either in whole or in part) that is crucial. An entity may be managed by a mix of other entities and individuals. If any of the persons involved in the management of the entity is a financial institution, then the entity will be regarded as managed by that financial institution. The residence of the financial institution manager is not relevant in this regard. This part of the definition of “managed investment entity” simply requires that the manager is a financial institution (i.e. It does not specify where that institution needs to be resident). Example 1: A trust set up in New Zealand has the following investments: • shares under discretionary investment with a Reporting NZFI fund manager (a provider of discretionary investment management services – DIMS provider); and • a rental property. The trust derived 80% of its income from the shares (financial assets) over the specified period. The trust derived the other 20% of its income from the rental property. Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? Yes: The trust derived its income primarily (50% or more) from financial assets (shares) over the specified period. The trust’s assets are also managed (in part) by a financial institution (the Reporting NZFI fund manager – DIMS provider). Therefore, the trust is a managed investment entity financial institution. Example 2: The facts are the same as example 1. However, the trust decides to acquire three more rental properties. The trust now derives 60% of its income from rental properties (and 40% from the shares). Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? No: The trust derived its income primarily from direct interests in real property (not financial assets). Therefore, the trust is not a managed investment entity. Example 3: A trust has assets that comprise a share portfolio and the family home. The trust has two individual trustees, one of which has been empowered to manage the trust’s assets. The trust does not outsource any management of its assets to any financial institution. The trust derives its income primarily from the shares. 119 Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? No: The trust is managed by an individual trustee – an individual is not an “entity” under the CRS. It follows that the trustee cannot be a financial institution under the CRS. The trustee also does not outsource any management to any financial institution. Therefore, the trust is not a managed investment entity. Example 4: A trust holds shares in various property funds. The property funds, in turn, hold interests in real property located in Australia. The trust organises for a Reporting NZFI provider of discretionary investment management services (DIMS provider) to have authority to manage these shares. The trustee provides that Reporting NZFI DIMS provider with discretionary authority to buy and sell shares in such property funds subject to an agreed mandate. The trust earns all of its income from investing in such shares over the specified period (i.e. receiving dividends from those investments). Is the trust a “managed” investment entity? Yes. The trust’s income is primarily attributable to the shares (financial assets). The trust is also managed by the Reporting NZFI DIMS provider. Therefore, the trust is a managed investment entity financial institution. 11.1.3When will a trust be a New Zealand financial institution? This guidance has outlined the circumstances when a trust will be a financial institut ion. It now sets out the circumstances when a financial institution trust will be a “New Zealand” financial institut ion trust. A financial institution trust will generally be resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes, and, therefore, a NZFI, if it has one or more trustees that are tax-resident in New Zealand. However, the exception to this is if the trust is tax resident in another Participating Jurisdiction and reports all the information required to be reported under the CRS with respect to reportable accounts maintained by the trust to that jurisdiction because it is a tax resident in that jurisdiction. Example 1: A financial institution trust has a single trustee who is tax-resident in New Zealand. Is the financial institution trust a “New Zealand” financial institution? Yes: The general rule is that a financial institution trust will be resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes if it has a trustee that is tax-resident in New Zealand. The general rule applies to these facts. Example 2: The facts are the same as example 1. However, the financial institution trust contracts an overseas fund manager to manage some of its assets. Is the financial institution trust a “New Zealand” financial institution? 120 Yes: The fact that the trust has an overseas fund manager is irrelevant to whether or not it is a “New Zealand” financial institution. Instead, as noted above, it is the trustee’s jurisdiction of tax residence, which is the crucial point. Example 3: The facts are the same as example 1. However, the financial institution trust adds a further trustee in jurisdiction B (a Participating Jurisdiction). The trustee reports all of the CRS information for the trust in jurisdiction B because the trust is tax-resident in that jurisdiction. Is the financial institution trust a “New Zealand” financial institution? No: The exception applies here. The trust’s connection to New Zealand is negated by the reporting overseas. This then raises the question of when a NZFI trust will be a “Reporting NZFI”. 11.1.4When will a trust be a Reporting NZFI? A NZFI trust will a Reporting NZFI (by default), unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI. The types of Non-Reporting NZFI that could (depending on the circumstances) apply to trusts are: • a trustee documented trust; • a broad participation retirement fund (if constituted as a trust); • a narrow participation retirement fund (if constituted as a trust); • a pension fund of a Government entity, international organisation, or Central bank (if constituted as a trust); and • an exempt collective investment vehicle (if constituted as a trust). These types of Non-Reporting NZFI are outlined in full in Appendix 6 of this guidance. However, it is useful at this point to provide some detail about the application of the trustee documented trust type, which is likely to be the most relevant type of Non-Reporting NZFI for trusts. The trustee documented trust category provides that a NZFI trust will be a Non-Reporting NZFI to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a Reporting Financial Institution and reports all of the information required to be reported with respect to all reportable accounts of the trust. However, it is important to note that if the trustee of a trustee-documented trust does not comply with these obligations the trust will, therefore, not be able to benefit from this exclusion and will be a Reporting NZFI. In other words, where a trustee fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the trust will be responsible for completing due diligence or reporting as a Reporting NZFI. Therefore, essentially, the trust will be reliant on the trustee complying with its obligations (on behalf of the 121 trust) in order for the trust itself to have complied with the CRS. These points are further explained on at page 174 of the CRS Commentary. 11.1.5What are the due diligence and reporting obligations of Reporting NZFI trusts? This guidance has outlined the circumstances when a trust will be a Reporting NZFI. It now sets out the due diligence and reporting obligations that such Reporting NZFI trusts will have. A Reporting NZFI trust will need to: • carry out due diligence on its financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in the case of passive NFEs, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents; and • report prescribed identity and financial account information to Inland Revenue about reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. The Reporting NZFI trust’s financial accounts will include the following (assuming that the trust is an investment entity – the category of financial institution that is most likely to apply to trusts): • debt interests; and • equity interests. A trust’s debt interests would cover anyone that has provided debt funding to the trust (including through a current account held by a beneficiary or through a third party advance). A trust’s equity interest account holders would cover: • the trust’s settlors (irrespective of whether the trust is revocable); • the trust’s beneficiaries (subject to the following); and • any other natural person that exercises ultimate effective control over the trust (which would, at a minimum, cover the trustee). If these persons are “entities” the equity interest account holders would be the natural persons that are “controlling persons” of the entity. 122 A discretionary beneficiary will only have an equity interest if they receive a distribution in the period in question. 88 A person coming within a class of beneficiaries would only have an equity interest if they receive distribution in the period in question or intend to exercise vested rights. Example 1: A Reporting NZFI investment entity trust has a settlor (Simon), trustee (Ruth), and discretionary beneficiary (Tom). Tom does not receive a distribution in the period. Who are the trust’s equity interest account holders? Simon – the settlor and Ruth – the trustee (a natural person that has ultimate effective control of the trust). Tom is a discretionary beneficiary who did not receive a distribution in the period. Therefore, he is not an equity interest account holder. Example 2: The facts are the same as example 1. However, the trustee is a corporate trustee that is controlled by Ruth. Who are the trust’s equity interest account holders? The answer is the same as for example 1. Ruth still holds an equity interest account. This is because, as noted above, it is necessary to trace through entities connected with a financial institution trust to identify the relevant equity interest account holders of a trust. As noted above, a Reporting NZFI trust will need to carry out due diligence on its financial accounts (i.e. these debt and equity interests) to determine whether those accounts are held (and/or, in the case of passive NFE account holders, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents. The due diligence processes that a Reporting NZFI trust will need to adopt (in this regard) are set out in detail in paragraph 5 of this guidance and would depend on whether the account is a pre-ex isting account (open on 30 June 2017) or a new account (open on or after 1 July 2017). However, at a high level: • Pre-exist ing accounts: The Reporting NZFI trust will generally need to adopt a residential address test or a search for foreign indicia for accounts held as of 30 June 2017 (for example, if a sett lor had an equity interest as of 30 June 2017). And: 88 The OECD has confirmed in an answer to a “Frequently Asked Question” that if a discretionary beneficiary receives a distribution in a given period, but not in a following period, the absence of a distribution in such following year should generally not constitute an account closure. However, the exception to this is if the beneficiary is permanently excluded from receiving future distributions from the trust (i.e. that would constitute closure of the account). 123 • New accounts: The Reporting NZFI trust will generally need to obtain a self-cert ificat ion for accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017 (for example, if a new mandatory beneficiary was added to the trust on 10 July 2017). The reader should carefully review the detailed outline of these due diligence processes in paragraph 5 of this guidance. If a Reporting NZFI carries out such due diligence on these accounts and identifies that they are held (and/or controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents it will need to collect the person’s name, address, jurisdiction of residence, TIN (or functional equivalent) 89 and date of birth (subject to various exceptions and qualifications outlined in paragraph 5 of this guidance). The Reporting NZFI will then need to report prescribed identity and financial information about the account to Inland Revenue if either: 90 • the Reporting NZFI has identified that the person is a Reportable Person (i.e. from a Reportable Jurisdiction that New Zealand will be providing CRS information to); or • the Reporting NZFI has chosen to adopt the wider approach to Reporting. This prescribed identity information that the Reporting NZFI would need to report to Inland Revenue about such accounts would include the relevant person’s name, address, jurisdiction of tax residence, and TIN 91 (or functional equivalent) and date of birth (subject to various exceptions and qualifications outlined in paragraph 5 of this guidance). The prescribed financial information that the Reporting NZFI would need to report would include the account balance or value and amounts paid or credited to (or with respect to) the account. The reader should refer to paragraph 6 of this guidance for further details about the information they need to report for such reportable accounts. 11.1.6Accounts held by non-financial entity trusts This guidance will now shift focus to outline how the CRS will affect NFE trusts that hold accounts with Reporting NZFIs. There are three key elements to this: • The CRS is clear that a trust will be the relevant account holder (rather than the trustees of the trust). 89 If a Reporting NZF I has a passive NFE with a controlling person that is a relevant foreign tax resident it would also need to collect the passive NFE’s name, address and TIN (or functional equivalent). 90 The Reporting NZF I trust will also need to report undocumented accounts. The meaning of “undocumented account” is outlined in paragraphs 1.6, 5.3.2, and 5.3.3. 91 As noted above, a person may be identified as being resident in multiple jurisdictions. If this is the case, the person’s TIN (or TIN equivalent) should be collected and reported for all of such jurisdictions. 124 • The Reporting NZFI will have obligations to carry out due diligence on the NFE trust account to determine if it is held (and/or, if the trust is a passive NFE, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents. • The NFE trust (and persons connected with the trust) will sometimes have obligations to provide self-certifications and other information to assist the Reporting NZFI in carrying out its due diligence. The trust (and such persons) may be subject to penalties if they do not provide this information. This guidance now provides a high-level outline of the due diligence obligations that a Reporting NZFI will have to review for a NFE trust account. It also outlines what obligations the NFE trust (and sometimes persons connected with the trust) will have to provide in self-certifications and other information to the Reporting NZFI to assist it with its due diligence. The steps that the Reporting NZFI would need to carry out when conducting such due diligence are as follows: • determining whether the NFE trust account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident; • determining whether the NFE trust is a passive NFE; and • if the NFE trust is a passive NFE, identifying the trust’s controlling persons and determining whether any of those persons are relevant foreign tax residents. (It is important to note that a Reporting NZFI will need to carry out the last two steps irrespective of whether the NFE trust account holder is a relevant foreign tax resident.) The Reporting NZFI will first need to determine whether the NFE trust is a relevant foreign tax resident. The process that the Reporting NZFI will need to follow in this regard will depend on whether the NFE account is a pre-existing account open on 30 June 2017 or whether it is a new account opened on or after 1 July 2017. These processes are outlined in detail in paragraph 5 of this guidance. However, at a high level this would involve: • Pre-existing accounts: The Reporting NZFI generally relying on information in its possession or that is publicly available to determine whether the NFE trust is a relevant foreign tax resident. Alternatively, the Reporting NZFI could seek a self-certification. • New accounts: The Reporting NZFI generally obtaining a self-cert ificat ion of whether the NFE trust is a relevant foreign tax resident. 125 Therefore, the Reporting NZFI may request self-certifications or other information to determine whether the NFE trust is a relevant foreign tax resident. If the Reporting NZFI determines that the NFE trust is a relevant foreign tax resident they will then ask for the trust’s name, address, jurisdiction(s) of tax residence and TIN(s)(or functional equivalent). As noted above in paragraph 5.5.1, there is a special rule that applies to when such a TIN would need to be obtained for pre-existing accounts (by the end of the second reporting period following from when the account is identified as being held by a Reportable Person). As noted in paragraphs 5.5.3, 6.1 and 8.1.6, there are also some circumstances when the Reporting NZFI does not need to obtain the TIN (or functional equivalent) – i.e. when the account holder does not have a TIN or their jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of TINs. The NFE trust generally needs to provide this information within a reasonable period of time and is potentially subject to a penalty if they fail to do so (see paragraph 9). However, as noted above, there are some circumstances when an account holder is not required to provide a TIN (i.e. when they do not have a TIN or functional equivalent or where their jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of TINs). The Reporting NZFI will then need to determine whether the NFE trust is a passive NFE. The following matters are relevant when determining whether a NFE is a “passive NFE”: • In broad terms, a passive NFE will generally cover an entity that: o is not a financial institution; and o either derives predominantly (50% or more) passive income and / or has assets that predominantly produce or are held for the production of passive income. • However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, if a registered charity is a NFE it would generally be an active NFE even if it derives predominantly passive income. The definitions of NFE, active NFE, and passive NFE are outlined in full in Appendix 4. • A managed investment entity that is tax resident in a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction is also deemed to be a passive NFE. “Passive income” will, in turn, be defined for CRS purposes in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as: passive income, in the application of the FATCA agreement or the CRS applied standa rd to a person or entity for a period, means an amount that is not income from a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of the business of a dealer in financial assets and that is— (a) a dividend: (b) interest: 126 (c) income equivalent to interest: (d) re nt o r a ro ya lty, other than rent or a royalt y deri ved in the active conduct of a business conducted, partl y or wholly, by employees of the person or entity: (e) an annuity: (f) for financial assets that give rise to amounts included under paragraphs (a) to (e), the amount by which gains from the sales or exchanges of the financial assets in the period exceed losses from the sales or exchanges: (g) the amount by which gains from the transactions in financial assets in the period exceed losses from the transactions: (h) the amount by which gains from the foreign currency transactions in the period exceed losses from the transactions: (i) the amount by which gains from the swaps in the period exceed losses from the swaps: (j) an amount received under a cash value insurance contract . (Emphasis added) For some NFE trust account holders the active/passive assessment may be straightforward and can be made on the basis of available information (in the Reporting NZFIs possession or that is publicly available). However, the Reporting NZFI may sometimes need to obtain a self-certification from the account holder (i.e. as to whether it is a passive NFE as opposed to an active NFE or financial institution). The Reporting NZFI, when requesting such a self-certification, is expected to provide the account holder with the information that is relevant to them determining their status (for example, the definit ion of “active NFE”). Therefore, the Reporting NZFI may request self-certifications or other information to determine whether the trust is a passive NFE. The trust needs to provide this information within a reasonable period of time and is potentially subject to a penalty if it fails to do so (see paragraph 9). If the Reporting NZFI determines that the trust is a passive NFE, it will then need to identify the trust’s controlling persons and determine whether any of those persons are relevant foreign tax residents. This raises the following questions: • what does the Reporting NZFI need to do to identify the trust’s controlling persons; and • what does the Reporting NZFI need to do to determine whether any of the trust’s controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents? 127 What does a Reporting NZFI need to do to identify a passive NFE trust’ s controlling persons? Section VIII(D)(6) of the CRS defines “controlling persons” as meaning the natural persons who exercise control over the entity, with some elaboration (outlined below) on how this would apply to trusts. In the case of a Passive NFE trust, the term “controlling persons” mean the settlor(s), the trustee(s), the protector(s) (if any), the beneficiary(ies) or classes of beneficiaries, and any other natural person(s) exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. In the case of legal arrangements other than a trust, the term means persons in equivalent or similar positions. The term “controlling persons” must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. For the purposes of identifying the controlling persons of a passive NFE, a Reporting NZFI may (subject to the following) rely on information collected and maintained according to AML/KYC Procedures. Page 199 of the CRS Commentary sets out how this would apply in the context of pre-existing and new entity accounts. The following points are relevant when determining whether persons connected with a passive NFE trust account holder are “controlling persons” of the trust: • The settlor(s), the trustee(s), the protector(s) (if any), the beneficiary(ies) or classes of beneficiaries of a trust must (subject to the following) always be treated as controlling persons of the trust, irrespective of whether any of them exercises control over the trust (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). • A settlor is a controlling person of a trust irrespective of whether the trust is a revocable trust or an irrevocable trust. • If a person connected to a trust (such as a trustee) is an entity the Reporting NZFI will need to identify the natural persons that control that entity. • For beneficiaries that are designated by characteristics or by class, Reporting NZFIs should obtain sufficient information concerning the beneficiary(ies) to satisfy it that it will be able to establish the identity of the beneficiary(ies) at the time of the pay-out or when the beneficiary(ies) intends to exercise vested rights. Therefore, that occasion will constitute a change in circumstances and will trigger the relevant procedures (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). This could be relevant if, for example, a trust has a “children of the settlor” class of beneficiaries. A child within that class would not be a relevant controlling person that needs to be identified until they receive a distribution from the trust or intend to exercise vested rights. 128 • A specified discretionary beneficiary of a passive NFE trust will generally be a controlling person of the trust. However, a Reporting NZFI has the option of only treating such a beneficiary as being a controlling person of the trust if that person receives a distribution in a reporting period (see page 199 of the CRS Commentary). The meaning of “receives a distribution” in this context means when an amount is paid or payable to the beneficiary. A Reporting NZFI that chooses to adopt this option will need to have reasonable safeguards and procedures in place to determine when such a distribution has been made. 92 This could include the Reporting NZFI having an arrangement with the trustee (possibly in terms and conditions) that the trustee will inform the Reporting NZFI when it has made such a distribution. There is no compulsion for a Reporting NZFI to adopt this option. A Reporting NZFI could simply choose to treat all beneficiaries as being controlling persons (in this context) if it considers that this would be preferable from an operational point of view. What does the Reporting NZFI need to do to identify whether any of the passive NFE trust’ s controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents? Once the Reporting NZFI has identified a passive NFE trust’s controlling persons, it will then need to determine whether any of those persons are relevant foreign tax residents. The process that a Reporting NZFI will need to follow will depend on whether the trust account is a pre-exist ing account (open on 30 June 2017) or a new account (opened on or after 1 July 2017). The detail of these processes is outlined in paragraphs 5.5 and 5.6 of this guidance. However, at a h igh level this will generally involve the following: • Pre-existing accounts: The Reporting NZFI relying on AML/KYC information that it has obtained to determine whether any of the controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. 93 • New accounts: The Reporting NZFI obtaining a self-certification (from either the trust or the controlling person) about whether any of the controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. If a Reporting NZFI identifies that a controlling person is a relevant foreign tax resident it will need to collect: 92 See page 17 of the CRS Implementation Handbook. 93 However, the Reporting NZFI will need to obtain a self-certification of the residency of the controlling persons if the account has a balance or value of more than USD 1,000,000. 129 • the passive NFE’s name, address, jurisdiction(s) of tax residence and TIN(s)(or functional equivalent) (subject to the exceptions/qualifications outlined in paragraphs 5.5.3 and 5.6.3); and • the controlling person’s name, address, jurisdiction(s) of tax residence, TIN(s)(or functional equivalent) and date of birth (subject to the exceptions/qualifications outlined in paragraphs 5.5.3 and 5.6.3). If a trust (or any of its controlling persons) is asked to provide such a self-certification or other information it will be required to provide this information 94 within a reasonable period of time after the request is made. If the trust (or the controlling persons) does not respond to such requests they may be subject to a penalty (see paragraph 9). What would the Reporting NZFI need to report about a trust account that is identified as being held or controlled by a relevant foreign tax resident? This then raises the question of what a Reporting NZFI would need to report about a trust account that it has identified as being held and/or controlled by a relevant foreign tax resident. The Reporting NZFI will need to report prescribed identity and financial information about the account to Inland Revenue if either: 95 • the Reporting NZFI has identified that the person is a Reportable Person (i.e. from a Reportable Jurisdiction that New Zealand will be providing CRS information to); or • the Reporting NZFI has chosen to adopt the wider approach to reporting. This prescribed identity information that the Reporting NZFI would need to report about such accounts would include: • the trust’s name, address, jurisdiction(s) of tax residence and TIN(s) (or functional equivalent) (subject to the exceptions and qualifications outlined above); and • if a controlling person is identified as being reportable, the controlling person’s name, address, jurisdiction(s) of tax residence and TIN(s)(or functional equivalent) and date of birth (subject to the exceptions and qualifications outlined above). 94 However, they would not be required to provide their TIN (or functional equivalent) if either they do not have a TIN (or functional equivalent) or their jurisdiction of tax residence does not require the collection of TINs, 95 The Reporting NZFI is also required to report undocumented accounts. 130 The prescribed financial information that the Reporting NZFI would need to report would include the trust’s account balance or value and amounts paid or credited to (or with respect to) the trust account – which would be attributed in full to any reportable controlling persons. The reader should refer to paragraph 6.2 of this guidance for further details about the information they need to report about such reportable accounts. Application of CRS to specific types of trusts 11.2 This guidance now outlines how the above principles apply to the following types of trusts: • Family trusts; • Charitable trusts; • Foreign trusts; and • Solicitors’ trust accounts. 11.2.1Family trusts A “family trust” is simply a trust that has a beneficiary class centred around a family group. There are no other defining features in respect of the assets they hold or activities they carry out that separates family trusts from other discretionary trusts. They operate in a spectrum from “simple trusts” that hold one asset (i.e. a family home) through to trusts that hold numerous complex assets and/or engage in complex financial dealings. As such, there is no “one size fits all” approach to the treatment of family trusts for CRS purposes. Family trusts that are financial institutions 11.2.1.1 A family trust w ill either be a financial institution or a NFE. A family trust will generally not carry on a business for customers. This means that the only category of financial institution which could apply to family trusts is the managed investment entity category. The key elements of this category are that: • The trust derives its income primarily (50% or more) from investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets over the specified period. • The trust is managed by a financial institution (other than a managed investment entity). 131 If a family trust is a financial institution (i.e. a managed investment entity) and has only 96 New Zealand trustees it will, therefore, be a New Zealand financial institution. A New Zealand financial institution family trust will be a Reporting NZFI with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations, unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI. The category of Non-Reporting NZFI that is most likely to apply to such family trusts is the trustee documented trust category and is outlined in detail in paragraph 3.5. The due diligence and reporting obligations that a Reporting NZFI family trust will have are outlined in paragraph 11.1.5. Example 1: A family trust has the following assets: • Shares; • Bonds; • A rental property; and • Units in various Reporting NZFI unit trusts (that are managed investment schemes). The family trust derives 80% of its income from the shares, bonds and units over the specified period. The family trust derives the other 20% of its income from its rental property. Is the family trust a financial institution? No: The family trust is not in business. Therefore, the only way that it could be a financial institution is if it is a managed investment entity. The trust derives its income primarily (50% or more) from financial assets (the shares, bonds and units) over the specified period. However, the trust is not managed by a financial institution. It is important to note, in this regard, that the fact that the trust holds units in various Reporting NZFI unit trusts does not mean that those unit trusts manage the trust. Therefore, the trust is not a managed investment entity. This means that it is not a financial institution. Example 2: The facts are the same as example 1. However, the trustee of the trust is concerned that the trust is not getting a good return from its investments in shares and bonds. Therefore, the trustee decides to engage a Reporting NZFI discretionary investment service provider (DIMS provider) to manage the trust’s investments in shares and bonds. The trustee provides the Reporting NZFI with discretionary authority to buy and sell shares and bonds within the parameters of an agreed mandate. 96 As noted in paragraph 11.1.3, there is a rule that could potentially negate the trust’s residency connection to New Zealand if the trust also had trustees in another Participating Jurisdiction and reported for CRS purposes in that other jurisdiction because it is tax-resident in that jurisdiction. This guidance will not set out this negation rule in detail here because New Zealand family trusts will typically only have trustees that are New Zealand tax residents. 132 Is the family trust a financial institution? Yes: The family trust derived its income primarily from financial assets (the shares, bonds and units) over the specified period. The trust’s assets are also managed (in part) by the Reporting NZFI (the DIMS provider). Therefore, the trust is a managed investment entity financial institution. Family trusts that are NFE account holders 11.2.1.2 If a family trust is not a financial institution it will be a NFE (by default). If a NFE family trust holds an account with a Reporting NZFI they will be subject to due diligence by that NZFI. This means that they (along with other persons connected to the trust) may be asked to provide a self- certification and other information about whether they are a relevant foreign tax resident to assist the Reporting NZFI with its own due diligence, and may be subject to penalties if they fail to provide the information within a reasonable period of time. This is outlined in detail in paragraph 9.1.1. 11.2.2Charitable trusts Charitable trusts that are financial institutions 11.2.2.1 A charitable trust will either be a financial institution or a NFE. A charitable trust is unlikely to be carrying on a business for customers. Therefore, as is the case with respect to family trusts, the circumstances when a charitable trust will be a financial institution are likely to be limited to when the charitable trust is a managed investment entity. For example where: • the trust derives its income primarily (50% or more) from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets over the specified period; and • the trust is managed by a financial institution (other than a managed investment entity). A charitable trust will be a managed investment entity in the same circumstances outlined above for family trusts (i.e. The examples would apply equally to charitable trusts). If a charitable trust is a financial institution (i.e. a managed investment entity) and has only 97 New Zealand trustees it will, therefore, be a New Zealand financial institution. A New Zealand financial institution charitable trust will be a Reporting NZFI with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations, unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI. The category of Non- Reporting NZFI that is most likely to apply to such charitable trusts is the trustee documented trust category and is outlined in detail in paragraph 3.5. 97 As noted in paragraph 11.1.3, there is a rule that could potentially negate the trust’s residency connection to New Zealand if the trust also had trustees in another Participating Jurisdiction and reported for CRS purposes in that other jurisdiction because it is tax resident in that jurisdiction. This guidance will not set out this negation rule in detail here because New Zealand charitable trusts will typically only have trustees that are New Zealand tax residents. 133 The due diligence and reporting obligations that a Reporting NZFI charitable trust will have are outlined in paragraph 11.1.5. Charitable trusts that are NFE account holders 11.2.2.2 A charitable trust that is not a financial institution will (by default) be a NFE. A NFE charitable trust may hold an account with a Reporting N ZFI and be subject to due diligence by that NZFI. An NFE charitable trust will generally be an active NFE coming within section VIII(D)(9)(h) of the CRS. However, the reader should refer to the definition of “active NFE” in Appendix 4 when seeking to determine if a charitable trust is an active NFE. If a New Zealand charitable trust is an active NFE it will not be reportable for CRS purposes (and there is no need to “look through” to controlling persons – compared with passive NFEs). A charitable trust that holds an account with a Reporting NZFI may be asked for a self-cert ification as to whether it is an active NFE (in this regard). The trust should, in these circumstances, consider whether they meet the definition of “active NFE” and provide a self-certification within a reasonable period of time of receiving the request. 11.2.3Foreign trusts Broadly, a foreign trust is any trust where no settlor is or has been resident in New Zealand at any time. Foreign trusts may have a New Zealand-resident trustee, often a limited liability company, which provides professional trustee services. It is normal for all the beneficiaries of a foreign trust to be resident offshore but there is no prohibition against having New Zealand beneficiaries. The CRS applies to foreign trusts in the same way as any other trust. This means that a foreign trust will either be a financial institution or a NFE. A foreign trust is unlikely to be carrying on a business for customers (just like family trusts and charitable trusts). Therefore, the circumstances when a foreign trust will be a financial institution are likely to be limited to when it is a managed investment entity. That is: • the trust derives its income primarily (50% or more) from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets over the specified period; and • the trust is managed by a financial institution (other than a managed investment entity). If a foreign trust is a financial institution (i.e. a managed investment entity) and has only New Zealand tax-resident trustees it will, therefore, be a New Zealand financial institution. As noted above, most foreign trusts have a trustee that is tax resident in New Zealand, often a limited liability company, which provides professional trustee services. 134 However, if such a financial institution foreign trust also has another trustee in another Participating Jurisdiction, is tax resident in that other jurisdiction, and reports for CRS purposes in that jurisdiction because it is tax resident in that jurisdiction, the reporting overseas would negate the New Zealand CRS residency connection that would otherwise apply (i.e. the trust would not be a New Zealand financial institution). A New Zealand financial institution foreign trust will be a Reporting NZFI with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations, unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI. The category of Non-Reporting NZFI that is most likely to apply to these financial institution foreign trusts is the trustee documented trust category and is outlined in detail in paragraph 3.5. The due diligence and reporting obligations that a Reporting NZFI foreign trust will have are outlined in paragraph 11.1.5. Example 1: A New Zealand foreign trust is settled by a settlor from jurisdiction A. The trust has a single New Zealand tax-resident trustee. The trust’s beneficiaries are all located in jurisdiction A. The trust’s only assets are direct interests in various investment properties, which it rents. The trust’s income is derived solely from rental income over the specified period. Is the foreign trust a financial institution? No: The trust does not carry on a business for customers. The trust also does not derive its income primarily (50% or more) from investing in financial assets. All of its income is derived from investing in direct interests in real property, which is not a financial asset. Therefore, it is not a managed investment entity. Example 2: The foreign trust in example 1 decides to rebalance its investments. It sells a number of its investment properties. It then uses the proceeds to invest in a portfolio of debt and equity instruments. The trust engages a Reporting NZFI fund manager to manage the portfolio. The trustee gives the fund manager discretionary authority to buy and sell debt and equity instruments within the parameters of an agreed mandate. The trust derives 60% of its income from the portfolio over the specified period. Is the foreign trust a financial institution? Yes: The trust derived its income primarily from financial assets (the portfolio of debt and equity instruments) over the specified period and is managed by a financial institution (the Reporting NZFI fund manager). Therefore, it is a managed investment entity. Is the foreign trust a “New Zealand” financial institution? Yes: The foreign trust is a financial institution (a managed investment entity). The foreign trust’s sole trustee is also tax-resident in New Zealand. Therefore, the foreign trust is a NZFI. This means that the foreign trust will be a Reporting NZFI with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations in New Zealand, unless it comes within any of the categories of Non-Reporting N ZIFs. 135 Example 3: The facts are the same as in example 2. However, the foreign trust adds a further trustee in jurisdiction B (a Participating Jurisdiction). The trust is tax-resident in jurisdiction B. The trustee reports all of the CRS information for the trust in jurisdiction B because the trust is tax- resident in jurisdiction B. Is the financial institution trust still a “New Zealand” financial institution? No: The exception applies here. The trust’s New Zealand connection is negated by the reporting overseas. Foreign trusts that are NFE account holders 11.2.3.1 If a foreign trust is not a financial institution it will be a NFE (by default). If a NFE foreign trust holds an account with a Reporting NZFI it will be subject to substantive due diligence by that NZFI. This means that it (along with other persons connected to the trust) may be asked to provide a self- certification and other information to assist the Reporting NZFI with its own due diligence, and may be subject to penalties if it fails to provide the information within a reasonable period of time. Th is is outlined in detail in paragraph 9.1.1. 11.2.4Solicitors’ trust accounts The following guidance outlines how CRS due diligence and reporting applies to trust accounts that a Reporting NZFI bank maintains for a law firm. The same analysis can be applied to other professionals to the extent that the factual framework is materially the same. The same analysis can also be applied for FATCA purposes. Background 11.2.4.1 A law firm which holds moneys on behalf of clients must open a trust bank account, into which client funds are deposited. The trust bank account must be designated “trust account” and the bank and other interested parties must be notified that the money in the trust account is trust money. A law firm can open more than one trust account. A law firm is under a duty to ensure whenever practicable that client moneys earn interest. It is pursuant to this duty that a law firm may advise a client that moneys held in a law firm’s general trust account be placed into an Interest Bearing Deposit Account (IBDA). According to the Lawyers Trust Accounting Guidelines the following points apply to IBDAs: • Each client must have its own separate IBDA (the bank records must show that there are separate client accounts, grouped so that it is clear that all of the IBDAs are within the control and responsibility of a law firm). • Paragraph 9.4 of the guidelines describes how a bank will administer the IBDA. Key points are: 136 o The bank maintains separate accounts, interest and tax calculations for each client. o The bank credits each IBDA with interest as it accrues. o On 31 March each year, the bank will issue resident withholding tax certificates. o When the bank sends a RWT certificate, the law firm must send the certificate to the relevant clients for action by them in respect of their tax returns. Money in the general trust account 11.2.4.2 A Reporting NZFI bank that maintains a law firm’s general pooled trust account may take the following approach when carrying out due diligence on the account where funds are not “designated” in the name of the clients (compared with IBDAs where there is a separate designated client account with the bank for the purpose of allocating interest): The approach is that where: • the funds of underlying clients of the law firm are held on a pooled basis with a bank; • the only person identified in relation to the bank account is the law firm; and • the law firm is not required to disclose or pass its underlying client or clients’ information to the bank for the purposes of AML/KYC or other regulatory requirements – • the bank is required to undertake due diligence procedures only in respect of the law firm. For CRS purposes this means that a Reporting NZFI will need to determine the residency of the law firm and the status of the law firm, i.e. generally whether the law firm is a passive or active NFE (with active NFE classification most commonly applying). Money held on IBDA 11.2.4.3 If a Reporting NZFI bank maintains IBDAs in the names of a law firm’s clients it will have, therefore, identified the clients, and should treat each client IBDA as if it was a depository account directly made by the client. Each designated IBDA will be subject to the standard due CRS diligence procedures outlined above. Excluded accounts 11.2.4.4 Some funds held in a law firm’s trust accounts (either in the general trust account or on IBDA) contain escrow funds that are excluded accounts for CRS purposes. For example, certain escrow funds relating to the sale and purchase of property are excluded accounts (see Appendices 1 and 5). 137 If a Reporting NZFI reasonably determines that funds in such a trust account are excluded escrow funds it will not be required to carry out due diligence on those funds – i.e . the account will be an excluded account. Application of CRS to partnerships 11.3 This guidance now summarises how the CRS applies to partnerships. A partnership is defined in section VIII(E)(3) of the CRS as being an “entity”. This is the case irrespective of whether it is structured as a legal person or a legal arrangement. This is broadly similar to FATCA where a partnership is also defined as being an “entity”. All partnerships, including general partnerships, limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships or any similar legal arrangement will be entities for CRS purposes. This would include a partnership as defined in the Partnership Act 1908 and a limited partnership as defined in the Limited Partnership Act 2008. The fact that a partnership is an “entity” for CRS purposes means that a partnership will either be a: • financial institution; or • NFE. This guidance now outlines the circumstances when a partnership will be a Reporting NZFI with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations in New Zealand. 98 This will address the following points: • when will a partnership be a “financial institution”; • when will a partnership be a “New Zealand” financial institution; and • when will a partnership be a “Reporting” New Zealand financial institution with due diligence and reporting obligations? 11.3.1When will a partnership be a financial institution? As noted above, a partnership can be a financial institution. The category of financial institution that is most likely to apply to partnerships is the investment entity category. For example, a partnership could (depending on the circumstances) be: 98 This guidance will not focus on the circumstances when a partnership will be an NFE account holder. The same analysis outlined above at paragraph 11.1.6 for NFE account holder trusts would apply to partnerships in this context. 138 • an “in business” investment entity – if it derives its income primarily (50% or more over the specified period) from carrying out specified investment activities for customers; or • a “managed” investment entity – if it derives its income primarily (50% or more over the specified period) from investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets and is managed by a relevant financial institution. Example 1: Partnership A invests in a portfolio of foreign equities. It engages a Reporting NZFI discretionary investment services provider (DIMS provider) to manage these investments. The partnership has given the Reporting NZFI DIMS provider discretionary authority to buy and sell such equities within the parameters of an agreed mandate. The partnership derived all of its income from these equities over the specified period. Is the partnership an investment entity? Yes: The partnership derived its income primarily (50% or more) from financial assets (foreign equities) over the specified period. The partnership is also managed by a financial institution (the Reporting NZFI DIMS provider). Therefore, the partnership is a managed investment entity. A partnership could also (depending on the circumstances) come within one of the other categories of financial institution. The reader should refer to paragraph 3.1 of the guidance for detail on the potential application of those other categories. 11.3.2When will a partnership be a New Zealand financial institution? This then raises the question of when a financial institution partnership (for example, an investment entity partnership) will be a New Zealand Financial Institution (NZFI). A financial institution partnership will be a N ZFI if: • it is resident in New Zealand (excluding offshore branches); or • it has a branch located in New Zealand. The general rule is that a partnership will be considered to be resident for CRS purposes based on where it is tax-resident. However, partnerships do not always have a tax residence. Some jurisdictions treat partnerships as taxable units, sometimes even as companies. However, other jurisdictions such as New Zealand adopt a fiscally transparent approach where the partnership is disregarded for tax purposes. A partnership that does not have a residence for tax purposes will be considered to be resident for CRS purposes in a Participating Jurisdiction (such as New Zealand) if: • it is incorporated under the laws of the Participating Jurisdiction; 139 • it has its place of management (including effective management) 99 in the Part icipating Jurisdiction); or • it is subject to financial supervision in the Participating Jurisdiction. It is important to note that these criteria for determining the CRS residency of partnerships that do not have a residence for tax purposes have the potential to link a financial institution partnership to multiple jurisd ict ions. Where such a financial institution is resident in two or more Participating Jurisdictions under these criteria, it will be subject to the reporting and due diligence obligations of the jurisdict ion in which it maintains the financial account. This is to avoid duplication of obligations. Example 2: Partnership A is a financial institution that operates in New Zealand. Partnership A is not tax resident in any jurisdiction, is unincorporated, and is not subject to financial supervision in any jurisdiction. However, Partnership A is effectively managed in New Zealand. Partnership A is treated as a “resident” of New Zealand for CRS purposes. This is because it is effectively managed in New Zealand. It will be a NZFI. 11.3.3When will a partnership be a Reporting NZFI? A NZFI partnership will be a Reporting NZFI unless it comes within any of the categories of Non- Reporting NZFI. It is unlikely that any of these categories will apply to partnerships. Therefore, this guidance will proceed on the basis that the NZFI partnership being considered is a Reporting NZFI. A Reporting NZFI partnership will need to carry out due diligence on its financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in the case of passive NFE account holders, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents and, if so, collect prescribed identity information about such persons. The Reporting NZFI partnership’s financial accounts (in this regard) would include: 100 • Equity interests: Persons that have a capital or profit interest in the partnership; and • Debt interests: Persons that have provided debt funding to the partnership. 99 Page 192 of the CRS Commentary states that the "place of effective management" is the place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the entity’s business as a whole are in substance made. All relevant facts and circumstances must be examined to determine the place of effective management. An entit y may have more than one place of management, but it can have only one place of effective management at any one time. 100 It is assumed for these purposes that the Reporting NZFI partnership is an investment entity (the most likel y category of financial institution to apply to partnerships.) 140 The Reporting NZFI partnership would need to carry out due diligence on such accounts and report prescribed identity and financial account information about reportable accounts they identify. 101 11.3.4What are the due diligence and reporting obligations of a partnership? The due diligence and reporting obligations of such a partnership are in line w ith those referred to in paragraph 11.1.5 with respect to trusts. Application of CRS to collective investment vehicles 11.4 The following guidance now provides a high-level outline of how the CRS applies to collective investment vehicles (CIVs). This will cover the following points: • an outline of what constitutes a CIV; • an outline of the circumstances when a CIV will be a Reporting NZFI; and • an outline of what due diligence and reporting a Reporting NZFI CIV will need to carry out. 11.4.1What is a collective investment vehicle? A CIV is an entity that pools funds on behalf of investors for investment purposes. This would include the following (non-exhaustive) types of entities: • Unit trusts; • Managed funds; • Group investment funds; • Superannuation schemes; and • Entit ies provid ing part icipat ing securit ies. A “managed investment scheme” subject to section 9 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (which would cover, for example, entities such as unit trusts and superannuation schemes) would also be a CIV. A CIV will be a Reporting N ZFI if all of the fo llow ing are sat isfied: • the CIV would need to be a “financial institution”; 101 The Reporting NZFI would also need to report undocumented accounts. 141 • the CIV would need to be a “New Zealand” financial institution; and • the CIV would need to be a “Reporting” NZFI (i.e. not a Non-Reporting NZFI). This guidance will now explain these key building blocks to outline the circumstances where CIVs will be Reporting NZFIs with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. 11.4.2When will a collective investment vehicle be a financial institution? A CIV will generally be an investment entity for CRS purposes. It is also possible, albeit less likely, that a CIV could come within another category of financial institution (for example, being a custodial institution). A CIV will be an investment entity for CRS purposes if: • It primarily conducts a financial services business (i.e. the collective pooling of funds and investing, administering, or managing of funds or money on behalf of investors). The CIV will be treated as primarily conducting a financial services business where its financial services income is 50% or more of its total gross income over the specified period; or • It is managed 102 by another financial institution (e.g. a trustee or investment manager which is a financial institution) and derives its income primarily (50% or more over the specified period) from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets (as distinct from, for example, from direct interests in real property). 103 Example 1: Wide Trust is a New Zealand unit trust that carries on, as its business, collective portfolio management activities for customers. Wide Trust derived 80% of its income from such acti vities over the specified period. Is the Wide Trust an “in business” investment entity? Yes: Wide Trust performed specified investment activities (collective portfolio management) for customers over the specified period. Wide Trust also derived its income “primarily” (50% or more) from such activities over that period. Therefore, Wide Trust is an “in business” investment entity. This means that Wide Trust is a financial institution. 11.4.3When will a collective investment vehicle be a NZFI? A CIV that is a financial institut ion will be a “N ZFI” if either: 102 The relevant “manager” in this context must be a financial institution that is not itself a “managed” investment entity. 103 Refer to Commentary on section VIII in paragraph 17 of the CRS. 142 • it is resident in New Zealand (excluding branches located offshore); or • it has a New Zealand branch. The residency rules that apply for CRS purposes will depend on the type of entity that constitutes the CIV. The residency rules that apply in this regard are summarised in paragraph 3.2 of this guidance. However, most CIVs will be trusts. In broad terms, a financial institution CIV trust will generally 104 be resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes if it has a trustee that is a New Zealand tax resident. 11.4.4When will a NZFI collective investment vehicle be a “Reporting” NZFI? A NZFI CIV will be a Reporting NZFI unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI. A CIV will be a Non-Reporting NZFI under subparagraph B(1) of section VIII of the CRS if it is : • a broad participat ion retirement fund; • a narrow participat ion retirement fund; • a pension fund of a Government entity, international organisation or Central bank; • an exempt collective investment vehicle; • a trustee documented trust, where the trust is a CIV; or • determined by the Commissioner to be a Non-Reporting NZFI. These categories are outlined in detail in appendices 6 and 7 of this guidance. The reader should also refer to pages 166 to 174 of the CRS Commentary for further detail. 11.4.5What are the due diligence and reporting obligations of a Reporting NZFI collective investment vehicle? A Reporting NZFI CIV will need to carry out due diligence on its financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in the case of passive NFE account holders, controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents and, if so, collect prescribed identity information about such persons. The Reporting NZFI CIV’s financial accounts (in this regard) would include: 105 104 However, as noted above in paragraph 11.1.3 this residency connection can be negated if the trust is tax-resident in another Participating Jurisdiction and reports all of the relevant CRS information for the trust in that jurisdiction because it is tax-resident in that jurisdiction. 105 It is assumed for these purposes that the Reporting NZFI CIV is an investment entity (the most likely category of financial institution to apply to CIVs.) 143 • Equity interests: The funds from investors that have invested in the CIV; and • Debt interests: Amounts loaned to the CIV or that are otherwise debt interests in the CIV. The Reporting NZFI CIV would need to carry out due diligence on such accounts and report prescribed identity and financial account information about reportable accounts it identifies. 106 The due diligence and reporting obligations of such a CIV are in line with those referred to in paragraphs 11.1.5 with respect to trusts. Example: Fund B is a Reporting NZFI CIV investment entity unit trust. Fund B has a Reporting NZFI trustee and a Reporting NZFI fund manager (both are investment entities that are Reporting NZFIs in their own right). Fund B also has a Reporting NZFI custodian that holds various instruments on its behalf. Investors receive units in Fund B in return for their investments and Fund B uses the pooled funds to invest in overseas shares and bonds. The custodian holds these interests on behalf of Fund B. The interests that the investors have in Fund B are in scope financial accounts (i.e. not excluded accounts). Fund B will need to carry out due diligence on: • Equity interest account holders: The persons that have placed amounts in the fund, including, if such persons are passive NFEs, any controlling persons; and • Debt interest account holders: The persons that have loaned amounts to the fund or that otherwise have debt interests in the fund, including, if such persons are passive NFEs, any controlling persons. Fund B would need to carry out due diligence on such accounts (i.e. to identify accounts held and/or, in the case of passive NFEs, controlled by relevant foreign tax residents), collect prescribed identity information about any relevant foreign tax residents they identify, and report prescribed identity and financial account information about any reportable accounts. 107 Fund B’s due diligence and reporting obligations are in line with those referred to in paragraphs 11.1.5 with respect to trusts. It is important to note that the NZ fund manager, NZ trustee, and Custodian Ltd would not be required to report on Fund B. This is because Fund B is a financial institution from a Participating Jurisdiction (New Zealand), so is excluded from being reportable (i.e. financial institutions are excluded from the definition of “Reportable Person”). Th is is an anti-duplicative measure. 106 The Reporting NZFI would also need to report undocumented accounts. 107 The Reporting NZFI would also need to report undocumented accounts. 144 Deceased estates 11.5 For the purposes of the following, the reference to “estate” should be read as covering New Zealand’s particular rules on the transfer or inheritance of rights and obligations in the event of death (for example the rules of universal succession). 108 This guidance will now consider the issues of: • whether a deceased estate will be a financial institution; and • whether deceased estates will be subject to CRS due diligence. 11.5.1Will a deceased estate be a financial institution? Deceased estates are a type of trust, but will generally not be financial institutions. 108 CRS Commentary on section VIII paragraph 92. Investors CRS due diligence and reporting obligations Reporting NZFI Fund B (Unit trust): $ NZ Fund manager Reporting NZFI NZ Trustee Reporting NZF I Custodian Ltd Reporting NZFI: holds instruments on trust for Fund B Equity Co Debt Co 1 145 So long as the administration of the estate is directed at the winding up and distributing of assets and not an indefinite activity of investing, reinvesting or trading financial assets, it will not be a financial institution. 109 However, a testamentary trust set up as a result of the winding up of an estate could (depending on the circumstances) be a financial institution, just like the other types of trusts outlined above. 11.5.2Whether accounts held by deceased estates are subject to due diligence An account held by a deceased estate will also be an “excluded account” where the Reporting N ZF I that maintains the account is in possession of a formal notification of the account holder’s death. The formal notification would include a copy of the deceased’s will, or the deceased’s death certificate. The estate must be the sole account holder. The exemption does not apply if there are two or more account holders even where the estate is one of the account holders. Example 1 (exempt account): An account holder has died leaving an open New Zealand bank account with a Reporting NZFI. The account is frozen. The executors complete and provide a death certificate and a copy of the deceased’s will to the bank. The estate is the sole account holder. The executor winds up the estate through paying debts and distributing property. The account is an excluded account. Example 2 (non-exempt account): Same facts as Example 1, except the account holder at death holds the New Zealand bank account jointly with another person. The exclusion does not apply. This is because the exclusion does not apply where there are two account holders (even where the estate is one of the account holders). The account will be an in scope financial account. The Reporting NZFI would need to carry out due diligence on the account. 109 CRS Commentary on section VIII paragraph 17. Subparagraph A(6)(b) definition of “Investment Entity”. 146 Appendix 1: A Comparison between the CRS and FATCA Pages 87–101 of the OECD’s CRS implementation handbook contain a detailed comparison of CRS and FATCA. The following is intended to supplement the comparison in the handbook by focusing on some of the most important similarities and differences between the CRS and FATCA: FATCA Inter-Governmental Agreement 1 FATCA is U.S. law enacted in 2010 to target tax evasion by U.S. taxpayers using foreign accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign passive entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold any ownership and/or control interests. Via FATCA Intergovernmental Agreements (FATCA IGAs), FFIs must register with the IRS, and comply with the FATCA IGA that is in effect in their tax jurisdiction (including carrying out due diligence on their financial accounts and reporting prescribed information about reportable accounts to the local revenue authority – Inland Revenue, in the case of New Zealand – for exchange with the U.S.). The NZ/U.S. FATCA IGA is defined as the “FATCA agreement” in section 3 (Interpretation) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, as: ...the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA, commonly known as the intergovernmental agreement, which was brought into force for New Zealand by the Double Tax Agreements (United States of America–FATCA) Order 2014 (LI 2014/209), as amended from time to time Common Reporting Standard 2 The “Common Reporting Standard” (CRS), formally referred to as the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, is an information standard to facilitate the automatic exchange of financial account information between jurisdictions, developed in the context of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Group of Twenty countries (G20). The aim of the CRS for AEOI is to detect and deter offshore tax evasion. The CRS is broadly similar to FATCA, but is multilateral in nature. The legal basis for exchange of data is generally the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and much of the structure of the CRS is based on the FATCA IGA model. The CRS will be defined three different ways in section 3 (Interpretation) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; as: 147 • “CRS publicat ion”; 110 • “CRS standard”; 111 • “CRS applied standard”. 112 Residence 3 D ue diligence and r epor ting nexus of f inanc ial institutions The CRS and the FATCA IGA use the residence of a financial institution (i.e. New Zealand resident – excluding a foreign branch) as the due diligence and reporting nexus between that financial institution and a particular jurisdiction: • See the definition of “Participat ing Jurisd ict ion Financial Inst itution” in Section VIII(A)(2) of the CRS; and • See the definition of “New Zealand Financial Institution” and “Reporting U.S. F inancial Institution” in Article 1(1)(l) and (p) respectively of the FATCA IGA. New Zealand branches of foreign financial institutions are also included in the AEOI due diligence and reporting nexus. The CRS Commentary contains detailed guidance on the definition of “residence” for a financial institution for determining whether a financial institution is “resident” in a Part icipating Jurisdiction, and therefore has a due diligence and reporting nexus to that jurisdiction (excluding foreign branches). A financial institution is generally treated as resident for CRS purposes in this regard, based on where it is resident for income tax purposes. However, special rules apply for: • Financial institution trusts; and 110 “CRS publication means the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, published by t he Organisation for Economic and Cultural Development”. 111 “CRS standa rd means the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information, as amended from time to time, which is a standard – (a) developed by the Organisation for Economic and Cultural Development and the Group of Twent y countries; and (b) agreed by t he Council for the Organisation for Economic and Cultural Development on 15 July 2014; and (c) contained in Part IIB of the CRS publication”. 112 “CRS applied standa rd means the CRS standard as modified by section 185O \[Application of Common Reporting Standard\] for the determination of requirements under this Act”. 148 • Financial institutions (other than trusts) that do not have a residence for tax purposes (i.e. a partnership is an example of a type of entity that often does not have a residence for tax purposes). A financial institution trust is generally treated as resident for CRS purposes based on where its trustees are resident for tax purposes. However, if the trust has multiple trustees in different Participating Jurisdictions, and the trust fully reports all of the CRS information about the trust in one Participating Jurisdiction because it is tax resident in that jurisdiction, it is deemed to be CRS resident in that jurisdiction only (negating the trust’s CRS residency in the other relevant jurisdictions). A financial institution (other than a trust) that does not have a residence for tax purposes (e.g. because it is treated as fiscally transparent) is treated as resident for CRS purposes based on the following criteria: • Place of incorporation under the laws of the Participating Jurisdiction; • Place of management (including effective management) in the Participating Jurisdiction; or • Where it is subject to financial supervision in a Participating Jurisdiction. Where this test results in a financial institution (other than a trust) being resident in two or more Participating Jurisdictions, the financial institution is subject to the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations in each of the Participating Jurisdictions in which it maintains financial account(s). This is to avoid duplicate reporting. The FATCA IGA does not have an explicit definition of “residence” for a financial institution i.e. for determining when a financial institution is resident in New Zealand and is therefore a “New Zealand” financial institution (excluding foreign branches). The FATCA IGA provides that for terms not defined in the FATCA IGA, the Competent Authorities can agree a common meaning. In the absence of any agreed common meaning, any term has the meaning it has at that time under the applicable tax law of the party applying the FATCA IGA (i.e. New Zealand tax law, when considering whether an entity is a N ZF I for FATCA purposes). The residency of a financial institution for FATCA purposes is determined as follows: • Any relevant New Zealand tax law definitions of residency applicable to the entity. Th is is broadly in line with the general rule that applies to determine the residency of a financial institution for CRS purposes (referred to above); 149 • For financial institution trusts (other than unit trusts), applying the following definition that was agreed between the Competent Authorities of New Zealand and the U.S. on 21 August 2015: o Where the entity is a trust (other than a unit trust), and prior to 1 April 2017 the entity may rely on any reasonable definition for the term “resident in New Zealand” including that a trust is established under the laws of New Zealand, whereby the trust is settled, executed and governed by New Zealand law, or o Alternatively, beginning on or before 1 April 2017, an entity that is a trust (other than a unit trust) can be treated as resident in New Zealand if one or more trustees is resident in New Zealand for New Zealand income tax purposes, or the trust is managed by a branch of a trustee located in New Zealand (provided that the branch of the trustee and trust are subject to regulatory supervision in New Zealand). However, this residency is negated if there is reporting in another Participating Jurisdiction. This residency rule is broadly in line with the CRS trust residency rule (referred to above). This rule becomes mandatory from 1 April 2017; and • Certain entities for FATCA (e.g. partnerships or joint ventures), are not treated as legal entities for New Zealand tax law. In this context, Inland Revenue considers that (unless the entity is treated as a trust for New Zealand tax purposes, and so subject to the above- mentioned trust residency tests), the special residency rules in the CRS Commentary (referred to above) that are used for CRS purposes to determine the residency of such entities can also be used for FATCA purposes. This is supported by the fact that the CRS framework is based largely on the FATCA IGA. Dual or multiple residency of account holders and controlling persons For CRS purposes, in the case of dual or multiple residency of an account holder or Controlling Person (determined on the basis of the due diligence procedures), CRS information is collected for all jurisdictions in which the account holder (or Controlling Person) is found to be resident for tax purposes. This rule is not contemplated under the bilateral FATCA IGA between New Zealand and the U.S. The FATCA IGA focuses on identifying and collecting (for reporting and exchange) information about US citizens and tax residents. As long as the account holder (or Controlling Person) is a U.S. person, it does not matter (for FATCA purposes) that they may also be tax resident in another jurisdiction. 150 Passive NFEs and their c ontrolling p er sons If a Reporting NZFI maintains an account held by a passive NFE they will (for CRS purposes) need to identify the passive NFE’s controlling persons and determine whether these persons are relevant foreign tax residents. The same broad rule applies for FATCA (for passive NFFEs), albeit that FATCA is about identifying “U.S.” controlling persons. However, there are two key differences: • The Reporting NZFI will be required to identify such controlling persons for CRS purposes, irrespective of where the passive NFE is tax resident. However, they will only be required to identify these controlling persons for FATCA purposes if the passive NFFE is a “non-U.S. entity”; and • The passive NFE may be a relevant foreign tax resident that is reportable for CRS purposes, irrespective of whether any of its controlling persons are relevant foreign tax residents. In contrast, a passive NFFE will not be reportable for FATCA purposes (as, by definition, it is not a US. Person). In this respect the CRS adopts a different approach from the FATCA IGA, so two different approaches need to be maintained. Non-Reporting Financial Institutions 4 FATCA only – Exempt Beneficial Owners and Deemed Compliant FFIs Annex II of the FATCA IGA describes which entities are treated as Non-Reporting N ZFIs, as: • Exempt Beneficial Owners (i.e. entities that are exempt from reporting and withholding under the FATCA rules); and • Deemed Compliant Foreign Financial Institutions (i.e. financial institutions that are deemed to be compliant with the FATCA requirements provided that certain matters are satisfied). In addition, the definition of a “Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution” in Article 1(1)(q) of the FATCA IGA includes Deemed-Compliant Financial Institutions or Exempt Beneficial Owners described in the U.S. FATCA Regulations. The CRS does not contain these sub-categories. The CRS only requires Entities to determine whether they are in the categories of Reporting NZFIs or Non-Reporting N ZFIs. 151 Therefore the FATCA Non-Reporting financial institution subcategories of Exempt Beneficial Owner and Deemed Compliant FFI are irrelevant for CRS purposes. FATCA only – Non-R eporting NZFIs Annex II to the FATCA IGA includes several categories of entities that are treated as Non-Reporting N ZFIs, which are not included in the list of Non-Reporting financial institution for CRS purposes. These are: • Treaty Qualified Retirement Funds; • Local Banks; and Financial Institutions with a Local Client Base; • Certain non-registering local banks; • Financial Institutions with only low-value accounts; • Investment Entity wholly owned by Exempt Beneficial Owners; • Sponsored Investment Entity and Controlled Foreign Corporation; • Sponsored Closely Held Investment Vehicles; and • Investment Advisors and Investment Managers (see Sections II through IV of Annex II of the FATCA IGA). Further categories are also treated as Non-Reporting financial institutions in the definition in the FATCA IGA by reference to Financial Institutions treated as Deemed-Compliant F inancial Institutions or Exempt Beneficial Owners in the current U.S. FATCA Regulations. These categories are either not suitable for the CRS (due to the differing context or approach of the CRS compared with the FATCA IGA, for example, Treaty Qualified Retirement Funds), or have been incorporated elsewhere in the CRS (for example, investment advisers and investment managers): • Treaty Qualified Retirement Funds, Local Banks, and financial institutions with a Local Client Base, do not translate into a multilateral setting, so the CRS does not exclude these types of financial institutions; • Financial institutions with only low-value accounts were not included as they rely on the USD 50,000 threshold for certain types of accounts, which is not present in the CRS; 152 • Investment entity wholly owned by Exempt Beneficial Owners. These entities are treated as Non-Reporting N ZFIs for FATCA purposes on the basis that none of their direct account holders are persons that trigger any reporting obligation. As noted above, the Exempt Beneficial Owner sub-category is not used in the CRS; • Sponsored Investment Entity and Controlled Foreign Corporation; and Sponsored Closely Held Investment Vehicle: These exceptions are based on the condition that a sponsor is performing the due diligence and reporting on behalf of the financial institution. These categories do not apply in CRS. However, the CRS does allow a financial institution to use a service provider to carry out their reporting and due diligence obligations (or where relevant, the CRS also allows a “trustee-documented trust” exclusion similar to that which applies in the FATCA IGA); and • Investment Advisors and Investment Managers: A number of financial institution investment advisors and investment managers may not maintain accounts (see the exclusion from the definition of “financial account” in CRS Section VIII(C)(1)(a), which can apply to certain financial institution investment advisors and managers). If this is the case, such financial institutions will not have any due diligence and reporting obligations. CRS – Non-Reporting Financial Institutions – Government Entities, International Organisations, Central Banks (including related pension funds) Government entities, international organisations, and central banks that are financial institutions (including their pension funds) are treated as Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions for both FATCA (see sections I(A), I(B) and II(D) of Annex II of the FATCA IGA) and CRS purposes (see CRS Section VIII(B)(1)(a) & (b)) provided that certain defined requirements are met. CRS – Non-Reporting Financial Institutions – Broad & Narrow Participation Retirement Funds Section II(B) of Annex II of the FATCA IGA provides that a Broad Participation Retirement Fund is a Non-Reporting NZF I. Section II(C) of Annex II of the FATCA IGA provides that a Narrow Participation Retirement Fund is a Non-Reporting NZF I. Similarly, Section VIII(B)(1)(b) of the CRS provides that Broad Participation Retirement Funds and Narrow Participation Retirement Funds are Non-Reporting financial institutions. 153 CRS – Non-Reporting Financial Institutions – Qualified Credit Card I ssuer s Section III(D) of the FATCA IGA provides that a Qualified Credit Card Issuer is a Non-Reporting NZF I. Similarly, Section VIII(B)(1)(b) of the CRS provides that a Qualified Credit Card Issuer is a Non- Reporting financial institution. CRS – Non-Reporting Financial Institutions – Exempt Collective Investment Vehicles Certain Collective Investment Vehicles as set out in sections IV(E) and (F) of Annex II to the FATCA IGA are treated as Non-Reporting N ZFIs because the account holders are, for example: not Specified U.S. Persons; or are financial institutions which report on their account holders; or are low- risk Exempt Beneficial Owners. In the CRS these entities are referred to as Exempt Collective Investment Vehicles (see CRS Section VIII(B)(9)). The conditions in the CRS to qualify as an Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle have been amended to take into account the multilateral context, and remove U.S. specificit ies. For CRS purposes, an Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle is an investment entity where all account holders are not Reportable Persons (except a Passive NFE with Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons). The logic is the same for treating these types of entities as Non-Reporting financial institutions for both FATCA and CRS purposes. CRS – Non-Reporting Financial Institutions – “ Trustee-Documented Trust” Section IV(A) of Annex II of the FATCA IGA provides that a financial institution trust established under the laws of New Zealand is a Non-Reporting N ZFI to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution, Reporting Model 1 FFI, or Participating FFI and reports all information required to be reported pursuant to the IGA with respect to all U.S. Reportable Accounts of the trust. Section VIII(B)(1)(E) of the CRS provides that a financial institution trust is a Non-Reporting financial institution to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a reporting financial institution and reports all information required to be reported with respect to all Reportable Accounts of the trust. Note that for both AEOI regimes, the “trustee” of a trustee-documented trust must be a financial institution. Therefore, a New Zealand financial institution trust, with a financial institution trustee that carries out reporting for it, is able to be a Non-Reporting financial institution “trustee- documented trust” for both FATCA and CRS purposes. However, for both regimes, the status of the trust as being a Non-Reporting financial institution is contingent on the financial institution trustee fully carrying out the requisite due diligence and reporting on behalf of the trust. 154 CRS – other low-r isk Non-Reporting Financial Institutions The CRS includes the additional general category of other low-ris k Non-Reporting financial institutions to be determined under domestic law (see CRS Section VIII(B)(1)(c)). Any entity which is a Non-Reporting N ZFI in Annex II of the FATCA IGA and does not fall into a specific category of Non-Reporting financial institution for CRS, needs to consider whether they are eligible to be treated as a Non-Reporting financial institution, viz. as a low-risk entity under Section VIII(B)(1)(c) of the CRS. To be treated as a low-risk Non-Reporting financial institution, an entity that does not already fully met any of the criteria of subparagraph B(1)(a) or (b) of Section VIII(B) of the CRS, must apply for a determination from the Commissioner and demonstrate that they meet the requirements of being a low-risk entity, by specifying why: • Such an entity is a financial institution that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax; and • Such an entity has “substantially similar characteristics” to those entities already described in Section VIII(B)(1)(a) or (b) of the CRS; and • Treating the entity as a Non-Reporting financial institution would not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. Inland Revenue will produce a list of entities that it has determined as being Non-Reporting financial institutions. In this regard, the CRS range of entities likely to be treated as low-risk non-reporting entities is very narrow because of the requirement that the entity has “substantially similar characteristics” to those entities already described in Section VIII(B)(1)(a) or (b) of the CRS. Excluded accounts 5 CRS – Excluded Accounts The CRS list of non-reportable excluded accounts that are not subject to due diligence or reporting, includes: 113 • Retirement and pension accounts (there is a similar FATCA exclusion in Annex II(V)(B)(1) of the IGA); 113 CRS Section VIII(C)(17)(a) to (f). 155 • Non-retirement tax-favoured accounts (there is a similar FATCA exclusion in Annex II(V)(B)(2) of the IGA); • Term life insurance contracts (there is a similar FATCA exclusion in Annex II(V)(C) of the IGA); • Estate accounts (there is a similar FATCA exclusion in Annex II(V)(d) of the IGA); • Escrow accounts (there is a similar FATCA exclusion in Annex II(V)(e) of the IGA); and • Depository accounts due to non-returned overpayments (this category of account is not an excluded account in Annex II of the FATCA IGA). CRS – Excluded Accounts – Retirement & pension accounts For CRS purposes, a retirement or pension account can be an Excluded Account, provided that it satisfies all the requirements listed in Section VIII(C)(17)(a): • The account is subject to regulation; and • The account is tax-favoured; and • Information reporting is required to the tax authorities with respect to the account; and • Withdrawals are conditioned on reaching a specified retirement age, disability, or death, or penalties apply to withdrawals made before such specified events; and • Either (i) annual contributions are limited to USD 50,000 or less, or (ii) there is a maximum lifetime contribution limit to the account of USD 1,000,000 or less, (excluding rollovers), in each case applying the CRS account aggregation and currency translation rules. CRS – Excluded Accounts – Non-r etir ement tax-favour ed accounts For CRS purposes, a tax-favoured account can be an Excluded Account, provided that it satisfies all the requirements listed in Section VIII(C)(17)(b): • The account is subject to regulation, either as a non-retirement savings vehicle or, in the case of a regulated non-retirement investment vehicle, it is also regularly traded on an established securities market; and 156 • The account is tax-favoured; and • Withdrawals are conditioned on meeting specific criteria related to the purpose of the investment or savings account, or penalties apply to withdrawals made before such criteria are met; and • Annual contributions are limited to USD 50,000 or less, applying the CRS account aggregation and currency translation rules, and excluding rollovers. CRS – Excluded Accounts – Ter m life insur ance contr acts For CRS purposes, certain term life insurance contracts are treated as Excluded Accounts if the meet all of the following requirements: • The coverage of the life insurance contract ends before the insured individual attains the age of 90 years; and • Periodic premiums, which do not decrease over time, are payable at least annually; and • The contract has no value that any person can access (by withdrawal, loan, or otherwise) without terminating the contract; and • Other than a death benefit, the amount (other than a death benefit) payable upon cancellation or termination of the contract cannot exceed the aggregate premiums paid for the contract, less the sum of mortality, morbidity, and expense charges (whether or not actually imposed) for the period or periods of the contract’s existence and any amounts paid prior to the cancellation or termination of the contract; and • The contract is not held by a transferee for value. CRS – Excluded Accounts – Estate accounts For FATCA and CRS purposes, an account of an estate is an excluded account if the account is held solely by an estate, and the documentation for such account includes a copy of the deceased’s will or death certificate. This exclusion applies to simple estates that go through probate then testamentary amounts are distributed to beneficiaries of the estate within a reasonable period of time. Note that this excluded account status, for FATCA or CRS purposes, does not apply to a testamentary trust that has been formed under the deceased’s will. 157 CRS – Excluded Accounts – Escr ow accounts For CRS purposes, a certain escrow account is treated as an excluded account, if it is estab lished in connection with: • A court order or judgment; or • A sale, exchange, or lease of real or personal property, provided that the account was established for such purposes; or • An obligation of a financial institution servicing a loan secured by real property to set aside a portion of a payment solely to facilitate the payment of taxes or insurance related to the real property at a later time; or • An obligation of a financial institution solely to facilitate the payment of taxes at a later time. A similar escrow account exclusion applies for FATCA purposes. CRS – Excluded Accounts – D epositor y accounts (overpayments) The CRS excludes (as excluded accounts) certain depository accounts that exist solely because a customer makes a payment in excess of a balance due with respect to a credit card or other revolving credit facility and the overpayment is not immediately returned to the customer (provided that specified policies and procedures are implemented). There is no corresponding exclusion in Annex II of the FATCA IGA. However, financial institutions that maintain such accounts may, depending on the circumstances, come within the definition of “qualified credit card issuer” in section III(D) of the FATCA IGA, and therefore be Non-Reporting NZFIs. Therefore, if this is the case a similar result will apply for FATCA purposes (i.e. the accounts would be excluded from due diligence). Other low-risk Excluded Accounts The CRS includes an additional general category of low-risk excluded account to be determined under domestic law (CRS Section VIII(C)(17)(g)). In contrast, the excluded accounts contained in the FATCA IGA have been agreed through a bilateral agreement. While there is considerable overlap between the excluded account definitions under the CRS and the FATCA IGA, there is not a complete overlap. Any NZFI that maintains a financial account which is specifically referred to as an excluded account in Annex II of the FATCA IGA, but not covered by any of the types of excluded accounts already in 158 the CRS, needs to apply to the Commissioner for a determination for the account to be treated as a low-risk excluded account. To qualify as low-ris k excluded account for CRS purposes, the following conditions must be satisfied: • The Account must be a financial account that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax; and • The account must have “substantially similar characteristics” to any of the excluded accounts already listed in the CRS (see CRS Section VIII(C)(17)(a) to (f)); and • Treatment as an excluded account would not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. Inland Revenue will produce a list of accounts that it has determined to be excluded accounts. Due diligence and reporting 6 Account closure Under the FATCA IGA, where Reportable Accounts are closed in the reporting period, a financial institution must report the account balance or value immediately before closure (see Article 2(a)(4) of the FATCA IGA). However, under the CRS only the fact that the Reportable Account has been closed is required to be reported (see Section I(A)(4)-(7) of the CRS), along with relevant total amounts of income, gross proceeds, or redemption amounts paid or credited to the account during the reporting period. Average monthly balance r epor ting This option is not allowed for CRS purposes in New Zealand. The CRS does not permit reporting of the average monthly balance of a financial account as being the balance of the financial account for the reporting period. This approach aligns with FATCA. Citizenship – pre-existing & new individual accounts Annex I to the FATCA IGA includes indicia for a pre-exist ing individual account of identification of the account holder as a U.S citizen or resident (see section II(B)(1)(a) of Annex I of the FATCA IGA), as well as self-certification of a new individual account with regard to U.S. citizenship or residency (see also Section III(B) of Annex I of the FATCA IGA). Under U.S. tax law, a U.S. tax resident includes a U.S. citizen. The FA TCA cit izenship requirements were designed solely with the U.S. tax law in mind. 159 Internationally, tax residency is generally based on residency as opposed to citizenship. Therefore the CRS does not focus on citizenship. Currency translation The currency conversion rules for CRS and the FATCA IGA are different. The FATCA IGA prescribes that when applying the thresholds USD amounts must be converted into non-USD amounts using the published spot determined as of the last day of the calendar year preceding the year in which the financial institution is determining the balance or value (see Section VI(C)(4) of Annex I to the FATCA IGA). Under the CRS and its Commentary, jurisdictions can convert USD amounts in the CRS by applying domestic law methodologies (e.g. see section YF 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 regarding foreign currency conversion and the use of spot rates). Additionally, new Schedule 2 (clause 12) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a Reporting NZF I to treat all dollar amounts referred to in the CRS as being in New Zealand dollars. D ate of bir th Date of birth has received additional emphasis under the CRS to enhance the accuracy of data matching in an international and multilateral context. Pre-existing accounts – date of bir th The CRS requires the collection and reporting of an account holder’s (or, in the case of passive NFE account holders, Controlling Person’s) date of birth for pre-existing accounts where the account holder (or controlling person), is a Reportable Person and the account is a Reportable Account. A Reporting NZFI that does not already have this information in its records is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain this date of birth information by the end of the second reporting period following the period when the account is identified as being a reportable account. The FATCA IGA only requires the reporting of date of birth for reportable pre-existing accounts where the TIN, or functional equivalent, is not available and the Reporting NZFI has such date of birth information in its records. However, for the 2017 and subsequent FATCA periods Reporting NZF Is will need to obtain and report TINs, as opposed to date of birth information. New acc ounts – date of birth For CRS purposes, date of birth information is required to be collected for new accounts when an account is held or controlled by a foreign tax resident, and the person is not an excluded person. The issue of whether the account is reportable (and whether this information is reportable as part of that) depends on whether New Zealand has entered into an AEOI exchange relationship with the 160 person’s jurisdiction of tax residence, or whether the financial institution has otherwise chosen to adopt the wider approach to reporting. For FATCA purposes, date of birth information is not required to be collected or reported for new accounts. Debt or Equity Interests in an Investment Entity The FA TCA IGA excludes as a financial account of an investment entity (that does not come within any other category of financial institution; i.e. that is solely an investment entity) interests in such entity that are “regularly traded on an established securities market” (see the definition of “financial account” in Article 1(1)(s) of the FATCA IGA). However, the exclusion does not apply if the holder of the interest (other than a financial institution acting as an intermediary) is registered on the books of the investment entity (except for interests first registered on the books of the investment entity prior to 1 July 2014, and with respect to interests first registered on the books of the financial institution after 1 July 2014, a financial institution is not required to apply the exclusion until 1 January 2016; i.e. the accounts would be in scope on 1 January 2016). The CRS does not exclude equity or debt interests in an investment entity from the definition of “financial account”, where the interests are regularly traded on an established securities market. Depositor y Accounts due to non-returned overpayments This category is included in the definition of excluded accounts under Section VIII(C)(17)(f) of the CRS. It allows for the exclusion of depository accounts that meet certain requirements including that the financial institution implements policies and procedures either to prevent the customer from making an overpayment in excess of USD 50,000 or to ensure that any customer overpayment in excess of USD 50,000 is refunded to the customer within 60 days. NZF Is that maintain such accounts could also (depending on the circumstances) come within the definition of “qualified cred it card issuer” in section VIII(B)(8) of the CRS, and therefore be Non- Reporting N ZFIs. This category of Excluded Account is not contained in Annex II of the FATCA IGA. However, NZF Is that issue such accounts may (depending in the circumstances) come within the definition of “Qualified Credit Card Issuer” in section III(D) of the FATCA IGA, and therefore be Non-Reporting NZF Is. Indic ia – Pr e-existing Individual Accounts – “ hold mail” or “in-c ar e-of” addresses Under the FATCA IGA a “hold mail” or “in-care- of” address that is the sole address on file is (subject to the following) indicia for a pre-ex isting individual account. However, in the case of low- 161 value accounts, an “in-care-of address” outside the US or “hold mail” address shall not be treated as U.S. indicia (see Section II(B)(1)(g) of Annex 1 of the FATCA IGA). Under the CRS, a “hold mail” or “in-care-of” address in a foreign jurisdiction is indicia if the institution does not have any other address on file for the account holder. In such circumstances, and where there is no other relevant foreign indicia, certain procedures must be followed to clarify the Account Holder’s status. If the financial institution is still not able to document the account holder’s status, the account must be reported as an “undocumented account” (see Section III(B)(2)(f), Section III(B)(5), & Section III(C)(6) of the CRS). Indic ia – Pr e-existing Individual Accounts – standing instructions The FATCA IGA includes all “standing instructions” to transfer funds to U.S. accounts as indicium for a pre-ex isting individual account (see Section II(B)(1)(e) of Annex I to the FATCA IGA). Under the CRS, standing instructions (other than with respect to a depository account) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a foreign jurisdiction is indicium (see Section III(B)(2)(d) of the CRS). This carve-out for standing instructions for transfers from depository accounts in the CRS was introduced to reduce burdens for financial institutions associated with the application of indicia search in a multilateral context. Indic ia – Pr e-existing Individual Accounts – telephone number The FATCA IGA includes, as an indicium for a pre-ex isting individual account, a U.S. telephone number (see Section II(B)(1)(d) of Annex I of the FATCA IGA). Under the CRS a telephone number is only an indicium where it is in a foreign jurisdiction and there is no telephone number in New Zealand (see CRS Section III(B)(2)(c)). I ndic ia search – New accounts The approach to due diligence for new individual and entity accounts under CRS and FATCA is broadly similar, so some alignment can be achieved. Under the CRS and FATCA IGA: • The status of new individual account holders is determined by self-cert ificat ion (indicia search is not available for new individual accounts); and • For new entity accounts, the status of the account holder is based on a factual determination or self-certification. If the account holder is a Passive NFE, the status or residency of its Controlling Persons is based on self-certifications. 162 Pre-existing Individual High-Val ue Acc ounts For both FATCA and CRS purposes, enhanced review due diligence procedures are required for “high value” pre-exist ing individual accounts having a balance or value that exceeds USD1,000,000 as of 30 June 2014 (FATCA) or 30 June 2017 (CRS). Pre-existing Individual Account that becomes a High-Value Account Both the CRS and FATCA IGA require that a financial institution, within a specified period of time, completes the enhanced review with respect to a pre-exist ing individual account that becomes a high- value account as of the last day of a subsequent reporting period. The FATCA IGA requires such review to be performed within 6 months of the end of the reporting period in which the account becomes a high-value account. The CRS requires the enhanced review be performed within the reporting period following the period in which the account became a high- value account. Treating Low-Val ue Acc ounts as High-Value Accounts For CRS purposes, Reporting N ZFIs are permitted to apply the due diligence procedures for high- value accounts to low-value accounts (CRS Section II(E)). Treating accounts as New Accounts For CRS purposes, Reporting N ZFIs are permitted to apply the due diligence procedures for new accounts to pre-existing accounts (CRS Section II(E)). Treating New Account as Pre-existing for Pre-existing Account Holder The CRS contains rules allowing financial institutions to treat a new account opened by an account holder of a pre-exist ing account, as being a pre-ex isting account provided that certain conditions are satisfied. The conditions for a new account to be treated as a pre-existing account are similar to those in the current U.S. FATCA regulations. However the CRS contains one additional condition, which is that no new, additional, or amended information is required to be obtained from the account holder (other than for other CRS purposes). The FATCA IGA does not explicitly provide for this option. A Reporting N ZFI is permitted for FATCA purposes to use the definition of “Pre-existing Account” in the current U.S. FA TCA Regulations in lieu of the definition in the FATCA IGA to be able to treat certain new accounts as pre-existing accounts. This means that if the Reporting NZFI is also a Reporting NZFI for CRS purposes, it is able to achieve a degree of alignment between FATCA and CRS due diligence procedures. 163 Plac e of b irth – not requir ed The CRS (as applied in New Zealand) does not require the collection and reporting of an account holder’s place of birth (i.e. there is no legal requirement to obtain and report an account holder’s or a Controlling Person’s place of birth). Similarly, the FATCA IGA also does not require the reporting of an account holder’s (or a Controlling Person’s) place of birth for FATCA purposes (see Article 2(2)(a)(1) of the FATCA IGA). Residence address test The “residence address test”, a concessionary CRS due diligence option for low-value pre-exist ing individual accounts, is not available for FATCA purposes. Self-certification – New Individual Account – date of birth Under the CRS, financial institutions must obtain the date of birth of a new individual account holder (or Controlling Person, in the context of an account held by a Passive NFE) as part of the self- certification process (see Section I(A)(1) of the CRS). This is not required under the FATCA IGA (see Article 2(2)(a)(1)). Date of birth is reportable information under the CRS as it is a core element for data matching in an international context. There is a degree of alignment of due diligence between the CRS and other domestic regulatory requirements on this point, for example, New Zealand’s AML legis lat ion requires as part of the account holder identification process that a new individual account holder must include their date of birth on account opening. Self-certification – unr eliable or incorrect after change in circumstances Under the CRS, where there is a change in circumstances for individual accounts and, as a result of that change, a self-certification previously relied upon may no longer be reliable or correct, the financial institution must obtain either: • A valid self-certification that establishes the residence(s) for tax purposes of the account holder; or • A reasonable explanation and documentation, as appropriate, supporting the validity of the original self-certification (and retaining a copy or a notation of such explanation and documentation). See Section IV(c) of the CRS and pages 116 and 130 of the CRS Commentary. 164 Under the CRS, where there is a change in circumstances for a pre-existing or new entity account and (as a result of that change) a self-certification originally obtained is found to be incorrect or unreliable, the financial institution must re-determine the status of the account (see pages 148 and 142 of the CRS Commentary). This includes either obtaining a valid self-certification or confirming the validity of the original self-cert ificat ion (similar to individual accounts). For FATCA purposes, under Section IIII(B)(2) of Annex I of the FATCA IGA, where there is a change in circumstances with respect to a new individual account that causes the Reporting NZFI to know, or have reason to know, that a self-certification it has obtained is incorrect or unreliable, they must obtain a valid self-certification. If the Reporting NZFI is unable to obtain a valid self- certification, they must report the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. Broadly the same point would apply where a Reporting NZFI needs to obtain a self-certification in the context of trying to cure indicia for pre-ex isting individual accounts. Under Sections (IV)(E)(3) and (V)(B) of Annex I of the FATCA IGA, where there is a change in circumstances for pre-existing or new entity accounts that causes the Reporting NZFI to know, or have reason to know, that a self-cert ificat ion it has obtained is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting NZF I must re-determine the status of the account, including obtaining any required valid self- certifications. The CRS and FATCA procedures are broadly similar when there has been a change in circumstances that calls into question the validity of a self-certification that has been originally obtained. In broad terms, both sets of procedures involve the Reporting NZFI needing to obtain either: • A valid self-certification that establishes the residence(s) for tax purposes of the account holder (or, in the case of Passive NFE/NFFE Account Holders, the status of the account holder and its Controlling Persons); or • A reasonable explanation and documentation, as appropriate, supporting the validity of the original self-certification, and retaining a copy or a notation of such explanation and documentation. Similar procedures also apply for both CRS and FATCA purposes if there is a change in circumstances that calls into question documentary evidence that the financial institution has relied on when carrying out due diligence. This involves obtaining valid documentary evidence from the account holder, or confirming the reasonableness of documentary evidence that has been obtained. Self-Certification – verbal The CRS allows a financial institution to gather verbally the information that is required to populate or otherwise obtain a self-certification. The CRS permits a Reporting NZFI to obtain a verbal self- certification from an account holder or Controlling Person, provided it contains all the required information (see for example, Commentary on CRS Section IV, paragraph 7 and example 8 at page 165 106 of the CRS Implementation Handbook); and that the self-certification is signed or positively affirmed by the person (or a person authorised to act on their behalf). A self-certification is otherwise positively affirmed if the person making the self-cert ificat ion provides the financial institution with an unambiguous acknowledgement that they agree with the representations made through the self-certification. In all cases, the positive affirmation is expected to be captured by the Reporting NZFI in a manner such that it can credibly demonstrate that the self- certification was positively affirmed (e.g. voice recording, digital footprint, etc.). A Reporting NZFI , in obtaining the self-certification, is expected to be in a manner consistent with the procedures that it follows for the opening of the account and it must maintain a record of this process for audit purposes, in addition to the self-cert ificat ion itself. The same process for obtaining and recording the obtaining of a verbal self-cert ification for CRS purposes can be applied for obtaining a verbal self-certification under FATCA from an account holder or, in the case of accounts held by Passive NFEs, a Controlling Person. Thresholds for Individual Accounts, Cash Value Insurance Contracts and Annuity Contracts The FATCA IGA includes de minimus thresholds for: • Pre-existing and new individual accounts (USD 50,000 threshold, for certain accounts); or • Cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts (USD 250,000 threshold). These are not included in the CRS (refer to Section III(A) of the CRS, and Section II(A) of Annex I to the FATCA IGA). A policy decision was made to not to include these thresholds under the CRS. A Reporting NZFI that wants to achieve a degree of alignment between FATCA and CRS due diligence can elect to disregard the thresholds for FATCA due diligence purposes. However, the FATCA thresholds cannot be disregarded for FATCA reporting purposes (see section 185F(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). In other words, a Reporting N ZF I is not permitted to elect to report information on these accounts or contracts that are under the FATCA thresholds for reporting. Therefore, it is not possible to fully align the FATCA and CRS reporting regimes with respect to thresholds. Thr esholds for Pr e-existing Entity Accounts Under the CRS a pre-exist ing entity account becomes in scope for due diligence and (if reportable) reporting when the aggregate balance or value exceeds USD 250,000 (see Section V(A) of the CRS) either at 30 June 2017 or on a subsequent 31 March. However, a financial institution is able to 166 choose to elect out of this threshold (i.e. to choose to review and, if reportable, report every pre- existing entity account). Under the FATCA IGA, a pre-ex ist ing entity account that has a balance or value of USD 250,000 or less as of 30 June 2014 is not required to be reviewed or reported unless its balance or value exceeds USD 1,000,000 as of any subsequent 31 March (see section IV(A) of Annex I to the FATCA IGA). A Reporting NZFI is able to elect out of this threshold for due diligence purposes, but not for reporting purposes (again, see section 185F(7)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which does not permit a Reporting N ZFI to elect to report a Pre-existing Entity Account that falls under the FATCA threshold for reporting). The CRS and FATCA IGA provide the same USD 250,000 threshold for initially excluding a pre- existing entity account from due diligence, but different thresholds when the previously excluded account becomes subject to due diligence (for example, USD 250,000 for CRS; and USD 1,000,000 for FATCA). The USD 250,000 threshold for the CRS reflects the general approach in the CRS to remove de minimis thresholds, while recognising the compliance costs associated with reviewing low-value entity accounts. A Reporting NZFI can elect out of the threshold for CRS purposes. A financial institution is also able to elect out of this threshold for FATCA due diligence purposes. Therefore, a Reporting NZFI is able, through making such elections, to achieve a degree of alignment between its due diligence procedures for pre-existing entity accounts under both of these regimes. However, as advised, for FATCA purposes a Reporting NZFI is not able to elect out of the reporting threshold, and report relevant amounts under the relevant thresholds. Therefore, complete alignment between the two regimes is not possible. Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) A relevant TIN, or functional equivalent, is required to be obtained and reported for both CRS and FATCA purposes. Pre-existing accounts – TINs (or functional equival ents) The CRS requires the collection and reporting of an account holder’s (or, in the case of Passive NFE account holders, Controlling Person’s) TIN for pre-existing accounts where such account holder (or Controlling Person), is a Reportable Person and the account is a Reportable Account. A Reporting NZF I that does not already have this information in their records is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain this TIN information by the end of the second reporting period following the period when the account is identified as being a Reportable Account. The FATCA IGA requires the reporting of a TIN, or functional equivalent, for a reportable pre- existing account if the Reporting NZFI has this information in its records. For the 2017 and 167 subsequent periods, Reporting NZFIs will be required to obtain and report such TINs. In other words, they will be required to collect such TINs if they do not already have them in their records. New acc ounts – TINs (or functional equivalents) A TIN, or functional equivalent, is generally required to be collected for new accounts for CRS purposes when an account is held or controlled by a relevant foreign tax resident. U.S. TIN information is also required to be collected for FATCA purposes. Validity of documentary evidence The general rules for validity of documentation under the CRS are that: • Certain documents remain valid indefinitely (e.g. a passport or certification of incorporation); • Documents with an expiry date are valid till the later of the expiry date or five years from the end of the fifth reporting period following the period when the documentary evidence is provided to the Financial Institution; and • All other documents are valid until the last day of the fifth reporting period following the period in which the documentary evidence is provided to the Reporting NZFI. See CRS Commentary on Section VIII at paragraph 155. The CRS contains a number of exceptions to the general rules that, in practice, are likely mean that they only apply in a limited number of cases. While the FATCA IGA does not provide a period of validity for documentary evidence, a Reporting NZFI can align FATCA with CRS by adopting the CRS validity timeframes. Definitions 7 Cash Value The definition of “Cash Value” in Article 1(1)(z) of the FATCA IGA is different from the equivalent definition in Section VIII(C)(8) of the CRS. The CRS definition of “Cash Value” excludes more amounts payable to the policyholder than the Cash Value definition in the FATCA IGA. This definition more closely aligns with that in the U.S FATCA Regulations. Closer alignment between the CRS and FATCA can be achieved if a Reporting NZFI elects to use the U.S. FATCA Regulation’s definition of “Cash Value” in lieu of the FATCA IGA definition. 168 Cash Value Insurance Contract The definition of “cash value insurance contract” in the FATCA IGA excludes insurance contracts with a cash value of USD 50,000 or lower (see Article 1(1)(y) of the FATCA IGA). The CRS does not have this exclusion (see Section VIII(C)(7) of the CRS). This difference is due to a policy decision taken when developing the CRS, and is in line with the fact that the CRS generally does not have de minimis exclusions. Financial Asset Only the CRS defines the term “financial asset”. The term “financial asset” is defined in the CRS (see CRS Section VIII(A)(7)) and is used in the CRS definitions of “investment entity” (see CRS Section VIII(A)(6)) and “Custodial Institution” (see CRS Section VIII(A)(4)). However, Inland Revenue considers that the use of the CRS definition of “financial asset”, for both CRS and FATCA purposes, is consistent with the interpretation of Article 1(2) of the FATCA IGA because: • The context in which the FATCA IGA was agreed (i.e. the definition of financial asset in the CRS is consistent with the current U.S. FATCA Regulations); and • Both the CRS and FATCA regimes having been incorporated into New Zealand law. Investment Entity The definition of “investment entity” in CRS Section VIII(A)(6) differs from the FATCA “investment entity” definition in Article 1(1)(j) of the FATCA IGA – in terms of the “income” and “management” tests. However, the CRS definition of “investment entity” is broadly similar to the investment entity definition in the FATCA U.S. Treasury Regulations. An entity can broadly align its treatment about whether it is an investment entity under both CRS and FATCA by electing to use the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity for FATCA purposes (as permitted by Article 4(7) of the FATCA IGA). Where an entity makes such an election, it must notify any financial institution in which it holds any financial accounts that it has elected to use the U.S. Treasury Regulations’ definition of “investment entity” in lieu of the FATCA IGA definition. 169 Passive NFE Under the CRS, the definition of a Passive NFE includes “managed investment entities” that are not resident in a Participating Jurisdiction (see CRS Section VIII(D)(8)). The inclusion of these entities in the CRS definition of Passive NFE ensures transparency by requiring reporting on their Controlling Persons. The inclusion of these entities does not exist under the FATCA IGA (see Section VI(B)(3) of Annex I). R elated Entity Under the CRS, an entity is a “related ent ity” of another entity if: • Either entity controls the other entity; or • The two entities are under common control. For this purpose, control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the voting and value of such entity. Additionally, two Investment Entities, as defined in CRS Section VIII(A)(6)(b) can be related entities if they are under common management, and such management fulfils the due diligence obligations of such investment entities. The definition of “related ent ity” in the FATCA IGA is different, in that: • Control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the vote “or” value in an Entity (the CRS requirements are conjunctive – “and”); • The FATCA IGA permits New Zealand to treat an entity as not being a related entity if the two Entities are not members of the same expanded affiliated group, as defined in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; and • The FATCA IGA does not have the additional “common management test” for related investment entities. Therefore, two separate approaches are required for FATCA and CRS purposes. 170 Appendix 2: Options permitted by the Common Reporting Standard The CRS and Commentary contain a number of options that financial institutions can adopt when carrying out their CRS due diligence and reporting. This includes options that jurisdictions can take when deciding on the due diligence and reporting procedures that financial institutions are required to carry out. The aim of such optionality is to provide financial institutions with some flexibility when carrying out such functions, so that they can make decisions that operationally may decrease their compliance costs. Jurisdictions can also take advantage of options that they consider will decrease compliance costs for financial institutions (with those options then becoming mandatory for such institutions). Some of these options will be mandatory for Reporting NZFIs. For example: • Reporting NZFIs will be required to adopt the wider approach to due diligence. In broad terms, this will involve Reporting NZFIs collecting all of the prescribed information about relevant foreign tax residents they have identified (and the account) irrespective of whether those persons are from Reportable Jurisdictions. 114 It is anticipated that the wider approach to due diligence will decrease compliance costs for Reporting NZFIs because they will not need to redo their due diligence procedures every time New Zealand enters into a new AEOI exchange relationship with a particular jurisdiction. • Reporting NZFIs will be required to use a 31 March reporting period. It is anticipated that this will decrease compliance costs for Reporting NZFIs by aligning with the FATCA and general tax periods. However, Reporting NZFIs will be able to choose to adopt the following options (set out in the CRS and Commentary) when carrying out their CRS due diligence and reporting. Reporting NZFIs are not compelled to adopt any of these options. Therefore, Reporting NZFIs will be able to simply make such decisions taking into account what procedures are operationally more efficient for their business. Reporting NZFIs are not required to notify the Commissioner of any such decisions. However, they would be expected to retain a record of any such decisions made for audit purposes. CRS due diligence options • Alternative due diligence procedures: A Reporting N ZFI w ill be ab le to : 114 However, there are some exceptions to this. A Reporting NZFI is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the TINs and date of birth i nformation with respect to pre-existing accounts by the end of the second reporting period following the period in which such accounts are identified as Reportable Accounts. 171 o Apply the due diligence procedures for new accounts to pre-existing accounts. The Reporting NZFI can carry out such an election either with respect to all pre-ex ist ing accounts or separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts. o Use the residence address test (including the change in circumstances procedures) when carrying out due diligence on lower value pre-existing individual accounts. This is an alternative to the electronic records test. o Apply the due diligence procedures for high-value pre-existing individual accounts to lower-value pre-existing individual accounts. The Reporting NZFI can carry out such an election either with respect to all pre-existing accounts or separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts. o Choose to exclude from due diligence procedures pre-exist ing entity accounts with a balance or value of USD 250,000 or less as of 30 June 2017 or any subsequent 31 March. o Choose to treat dollar threshold values in the CRS as being in New Zealand dollars. (For example, instead of treating the high-value pre-exist ing individual threshold as being USD 1,000,000, that threshold could be treated as being NZD 1,000,000 instead.) o A Reporting NZFI that is carrying out pre-existing entity due diligence is able to use as documentary evidence any classification in its records with respect to the account that was determined based on a standard industry coding system (provided that various conditions set out on pages 203 to 204 of the CRS Commentary are met). • Due diligence grace period: A Reporting NZFI will have the option of using the following grace periods when carrying out due diligence: o High-value pre-existing individual accounts:  Continuing to carry out due diligence beyond 31 March 2018 up until 30 June 2018 (provided that any account identified as reportable by 30 June 2018 is reported in the report for the period ended 31 March 2018 – i.e. reported by 30 June 2018). 172 o Other pre-existing accounts:  Continuing to carry out due diligence beyond 31 March 2019 up until 30 June 2019 (provided that any account identified as reportable by 30 June 2019 is reported in the report for the period ended 31 March 2019 – i.e. reported by 30 June 2019). It is acknowledged that the option of utilising such grace periods could increase compliance costs for some Reporting NZFIs and pose operational difficulties. Such Reporting NZFIs are not compelled to adopt the option and could simply choose not to do so. A Reporting NZFI is also able to choose to merely utilise a portion of the grace period if it considers this would be efficient. • Service providers: A Reporting NZFI is able to use a service provider to fulfil due diligence obligations. The Reporting NZFI remains responsible for fulfilling these requirements and the actions of the service provider are imputed to the NZFI. This is in line w ith FA TCA. • Trustee documented trust: A NZFI trust that has a financial institution trustee is able to use that trustee to carry out any due diligence on its behalf. The NZFI trust will (in such circumstances) be a Non-Reporting NZFI provided that the trustee reports all of the requisite information on the trust’s behalf. • Discretionary beneficiaries as “controlling persons”: The general rule in the CRS is that a discretionary beneficiary will be a Controlling Person of a passive NFE trust account holder. For example, if Bob is a discretionary beneficiary of a passive NFE trust account holder he will, therefore, be a controlling person of that trust (under this general rule). However, a Reporting NZFI is able to choose to treat a discretionary beneficiary as being a controlling person of a passive NFE trust only if they receive a distribution in the period. For example, the Reporting NZFI could decide to treat Bob as only being a controlling person in a period if he receives a distribution in that period. If a Reporting NZFI chooses to adopt this option they will need to have reasonable safeguards and procedures in place to identify whether a distribution has been made to the beneficiary (Bob in this example). It is acknowledged that this option could actually increase compliance costs for some Reporting NZFIs and pose operational difficulties. Such Reporting NZFIs are not compelled to adopt the option and could simply choose not to do so. 173 CRS reporting options • Option to adopt the “wider approach” to reporting: A Reporting NZFI is able to choose to report all relevant foreign tax residents that they have identified, as opposed to merely reporting those foreign tax residents from Reportable Jurisdictions. Inland Revenue will then sort the relevant information and exchange the information with the relevant Reportable Jurisdictions. • Service Providers: A Reporting NZFI is able to use a service provider to fulfil reporting obligations. The Reporting NZFI remains responsible for fulfilling these requirements and the actions of the service provider are imputed to the NZFI. This is in line w ith FA TCA. • Trustee documented trust: A NZFI trust that has a financial institution trustee is able to use that trustee to carry out any reporting on their behalf. The NZFI trust will (in such circumstances) be a Non-Reporting NZFI provided that the trustee reports all of the requisite information on the trust’s behalf. • Option to submit nil reports: A Reporting NZFI that has no accounts to report in a particular period will have the option of submitting a nil report for that period. However, Reporting NZFIs are not compelled to submit nil reports. Options in the OECD handbook and OECD answers to “Frequently Asked Questions” A Reporting NZFI is also able to adopt any options set out in other background documents and materials such as the OECD handbook and OECD answer to “Frequently Asked Questions” to the extent that such options are consistent with the CRS. 174 Appendix 3: Documentary evidence under the CRS Reporting NZFIs are sometimes able to rely (in part) on documentary evidence when carrying out CRS due diligence. “Documentary evidence” is defined in the CRS (see page 209 at paragraph 8 of the CRS Commentary and subparagraph E(6) of Section VIII of the CRS) for these purposes as including any of the following: • A certificate of residence issued by an authorised government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) of the jurisdiction in which the payee claims to be a resident. Examples of such a certificate include a certificate of residence for tax purposes indicating that the account holder has filed its most recent income tax return; residence information published by an authorised government body of that jurisdiction such as a list published by a tax administration that includes the names and residences of taxpayers, and residence information in a publicly accessible register maintained or authorised by an authorised government body of a jurisdiction, such as a public register maintained by a tax administration. • With respect to an individual, any valid identification issued by an authorised government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality), that includes the individual’s name and is typically used for identification purposes. • With respect to an entity, any official documentation issued by an authorised government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) that includes the name of the Entity and whether the address of its principal office in the jurisdiction in which it claims to be a resident or the jurisdiction in which the entity was incorporated or organised. The address of the principal office will generally be where its place of effective management is situated. The address of a Financial Institution with which the entity maintains an account, a post office box or an address used solely for mailing purposes is not an address of the Entity’s principal office unless it is the only address used by the Entity and appears as its registered address in its organisational documents. Further, an address that is provided subject to instructions to hold all mail to that address is not the address of the Entity’s principal office. 175 • Any audited statement, third-party credit report, bankruptcy filing or securities regulator’s report. 176 Appendix 4: Definitions of “Non-Financial Entity”, “active Non-Financial Entity”, “Passive income”, and “Passive Non-Financial Entity” An “NFE” is defined in Section VIII(D)(7) of the CRS as meaning: “any Entity that is not a Financial Institution”. “Active NFE” is defined in Section VIII(D)(8) of the CRS as meaning: “any NFE that meets any of the following criteria: a) less than 50% of the NFE’s gross income for the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period is passive income and less than 50% of the assets held by the NFE during the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income; b) the stock of the NFE is regularly traded on an established securities market or the NFE is a related entity of an Entity the stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market; c) the NFE is a Governmental Entity, an international organisation, a Central bank, or an Entity wholly owned by one or more of the foregoing; d) substantially all of the activities of the NFE consist of holding (in whole or in part) the outstanding stock of, or providing financing and services to, one or more subsidiaries that engage in trades or businesses other than the business of a Financial Institution, except that an Entity does not qualify for this status if the Entity functions (or holds itself out) as an investment fund, such as a private equity fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any investment vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies and then hold interests in those companies as capital assets for investment purposes; e) the NFE is not yet operating a business and has no prior operating history, but is investing capital into assets with the intent to operate a business other than that of a Financial Institution, provided that the NFE does not qualify for this exception after the date that is 24 months after the date of the initial organisation of the NFE; 177 f) the NFE was not a Financial Institution in the past five years, and is in the process of liquidating its assets or is reorganising with the intent to continue or recommence operations in a business other than that of a Financial Institution; g) the NFE primarily engages in financing and hedging transactions with, or for, Related Entities that are not Financial Institutions, and does not provide financing or hedging services to any Entity that is not a Related Entity, provided that the group of any such Related Entities is primarily engaged in a business other than that of a Financial Institution; or h) the NFE meets all of the following requirements: (i). it is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence exclusively for religious, charitab le, scient ific, art ist ic, cu ltural, ath let ic or educational purposes; or it is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence and it is a professional organisation, business league, chamber of commerce, labour organisation, agricultural or horticultural organisation, civic league or an organisation operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare; (ii). it is exempt from income tax in its jurisdiction of residence; (iii). it has no shareholders or members who have a proprietary or beneficial interest in its income or assets; (iv). the applicable laws of the NFE’s jurisdiction of residence or the NFE’s formation documents do not permit any income or assets of the NFE to be distributed to, or applied for the benefit of, a private person or liquidation or dissolution, all of its assets be distributed to a Governmental Entity or other non-profit organisation, or escheat to non-charitable Entity other than pursuant to the conduct of the NFE’s charitable activities, or as payment of reasonable compensation for services rendered, or as payment representing the fair market value of property which the NFE has purchased; and 178 (v). the applicable laws of the NFE’s jurisdiction of residence or the NFE’s formation documents require that, upon the NFE’s the government of the NFE’s jurisdiction of residence or any political subdivision thereof. “Passive income” is defined for CRS purposes in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as meaning: “in the application of the CRS applied standard to a person or entity for a period,....an amount that is not income from a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of the business of a dealer in financial assets and that is— a) a dividend: b) interest: c) income equivalent to interest: d) rent or a royalty, other than rent or a royalty derived in the active conduct of a business conducted, partly or wholly, by employees of the person or entity: e) an annuity: f) for financial assets that give rise to amounts included under paragraphs (a) to (e), the amount by which gains from the sales or exchanges of the financial assets in the period exceed losses from the sales or exchanges: g) the amount by which gains from the transactions in financial assets in the period exceed losses from the transactions: h) the amount by which gains from the foreign currency transactions in the period exceed losses from the transactions: i) the amount by which gains from the swaps in the period exceed losses from the swaps: j) an amount received under a cash value insurance contract. 179 “Passive NFE” is defined in Section VIII(D)(8) of the CRS with reference to subparagraph A(6)(b) of the CRS. For the purposes of this guidance, the definition of “Passive NFE” means any: (i). NFE that is not an Active NFE; or (ii). A managed investment entity from a jurisdiction that is not a Participating Jurisdiction. 180 Appendix 5: Definition of “Excluded Account” Section VIII of the CRS provides relevant definitions.

Section VIII.B(1) defines a “Non-Reporting Financial Institution” as: 1. The te rm “Non-Reporting Financial Institution” means any Financial Institution that is: a) a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank, other than with respect to a payment that is derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by a Specified Insurance Company, Custodial Institution, or Depository Institution; b) a Broad Participation Retirement Fund; a Narrow Participation Retirement Fund; a Pension Fund of a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank; or a Qualified Credit Card Issuer; c) any other Entity that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax, has substantially similar characteristics to any of the Entities described in subparagraphs B(1)(a) and (b), and is defined in domestic law as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution, provided that the status of such Entity as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution does not frustrate the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard; d) an Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle; or e) a trust to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a Reporting Financial Institution and reports all information required to be reported pursuant to Section I with respect to all Reportable Accounts of the trust. 185 Appendix 7: Requirements to be satisfied to be a “Non-Reporting Financial Entity” under the Common Reporting Standard Section VIII(B)(2)-(9) of the CRS provides the following detail about some of these types of “Non- Reporting Financial Institutions”: 2. The te rm “Governmental Entity” means the government of a jurisdiction, any political subdivision of a jurisdiction (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes a state, province, county, or municipality), or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of a jurisdiction or of any one or more of the foregoing (each, a “Governmental Entity”). This category is comprised of the integral parts, controlled entities, and political subdivisions of a jurisdiction. a) An “integral part” of a jurisdiction means any person, organisation, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a jurisdiction. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the jurisdiction, with no portion inuring to the benefit of any private person. An integral part does not include any individual who is a sovereign, official, or administrator acting in a private or personal capacity. b) A controlled entity means an Entity that is separate in form from the jurisdiction or that otherwise constitutes a separate juridical entity, provided that: (i). the Entity is wholly owned and controlled by one or more Governmental Entities directly or through one or more controlled entities; (ii). the Entity’s net earnings are credited to its own account or to the accounts of one or more Governmental Entities, with no portion of its income inuring to the benefit of any private person; and (iii). the Entity’s assets vest in one or more Governmental Entities upon dissolution. c) Income does not inure to the benefit of private persons if such persons are the intended beneficiaries of a governmental programme, and the programme activities are performed for the general public with respect to the common welfare or relate to the administration of some phase of government. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, income is considered to inure to the benefit of private persons if the income is derived from the use of a governmental entity to conduct a commercial business, such as a commercial banking business, that provides financial services to private persons. 186 3. The te rm “International Organisation” means any international organisation or wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof. This category includes any intergovernmental organisation (including a supranational organisation) (1) that is comprised primarily of governments; (2) that has in effect a headquarters or substantially similar agreement with the jurisdiction; and (3) the income of which does not inure to the benefit of private persons. 4. The te rm “Central Bank” means an institution that is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government of the jurisdiction itself, issuing instruments intended to circulate as currency. Such an institution may include an instrumentality that is separate from the government of the jurisdiction, whether or not owned in whole or in part by the jurisdiction. 5. The te rm “Broad Participation Retirement Fund” means a fund established to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits, or any combination thereof, to beneficiaries that are current or former employees (or persons designated by such employees) of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered, provided that the fund: a) does not have a single beneficiary with a right to more than five per cent of the fund’s assets; b) is subject to government regulation and provides information reporting to the tax authorities; and c) satisfies at least one of the following requirements: (i). the fund is generally exempt from tax on investment income, or taxation of such income is deferred or taxed at a reduced rate, due to its status as a retirement or pension plan; (ii). the fund receives at least 50% of its total contributions (other than transfers of assets from other plans described in subparagraphs B(5) through (7) or from retirement and pension accounts described in subparagraph C(17)(a)) from the sponsoring employers; (iii). distributions or withdrawals from the fund are allowed only upon the occurrence of specified events related to retirement, disability, or death (except rollover distributions to other retirement funds described in subparagraphs B(5) through (7) or retirement and pension accounts described in subparagraph C(17)(a)), or penalties apply to distributions or withdrawals made before such specified events; or 187 (iv). contributions (other than certain permitted make-up contributions) by employees to the fund are limited by reference to earned income of the employee or may not exceed USD50,000 annually, applying the rules set forth in paragraph C of Section VII for account aggregation and currency translation. 6. The te rm “Narrow Participation Retirement Fund” means a fund established to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits to beneficiaries that are current or former employees (or persons designated by such employees) of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered, provided that: a) the fund has fewer than 50 participants; b) the fund is sponsored by one or more employers that are not Investment Entities or Passive NFEs; c) the employee and employer contributions to the fund (other than transfers of assets from retirement and pension accounts described in subparagraph C(17)(a)) are limited by reference to earned income and compensation of the employee, respectively; d) participants that are not residents of the jurisdiction in which the fund is established are not entitled to more than 20% of the fund’s assets; and e) the fund is subject to government regulation and provides information reporting to the tax authorities. 7. The te rm “Pension Fund of a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank” means a fund established by a Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits to beneficiaries or participants that are current or former employees (or persons designated by such employees), or that are not current or former employees, if the benefits provided to such beneficiaries or participants are in consideration of personal services performed for the Governmental Entity, International Organisation or Central Bank. 8. The te rm “Qualified Credit Card Issuer” means a Financial Institution satisfying the following requirements: a) the Financial Institution is a Financial Institution solely because it is an issuer of credit cards that accepts deposits only when a customer makes a payment in excess of a balance due with respect to the card and the overpayment is not immediately returned to the customer; and b) beginning on or before 1 July 2017, the Financial Institution implements policies and procedures either to prevent a customer from making an overpayment in excess of USD50,000, or to ensure that any customer overpayment in excess of 188 USD 50,000 is refunded to the customer within 60 days, in each case applying the rules set forth in paragraph C of Section VII for account aggregation and currency translat ion. For this purpose, a customer overpayment does not refer to credit balances to the extent of disputed charges but does include credit balances resulting from merchandise returns. 9. The te rm “Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle” means an Investment Entity that is regulated as a collective investment vehicle, provided that all of the interests in the collective investment vehicle are held by or through individuals or Entities that are not Reportable Persons, except a Passive NFE with Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. An Investment Entity that is regulated as a collective investment vehicle does not fail to qualify under subparagraph B(9) as an Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle, solely because the collective investment vehicle has issued physical shares in bearer form, provided that: a) the collective investment vehicle has not issued, and does not issue, any physical shares in bearer form after 30 June 2017; b) the collective investment vehicle retires all such shares upon surrender; c) the collective investment vehicle performs the due diligence procedures set forth in Sections II through VII and reports any information required to be reported with respect to any such shares when such shares are presented for redemption or other payment; and d) the collective investment vehicle has in place policies and procedures to ensure that such shares are redeemed or immobilised as soon as possible, and in any event prior to 30 June 2018. 189
June 2016 New Zealand’s plan to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tax strategies allow mult inat ionals to exploit gaps and discrepancies in tax rules to shift their profits to foreign countries where tax rates are lower. New Zealand has been working with the OECD and G20 to develop a co-ordinated global solut ion to address BEPS. In October 2015, the OECD released an international action plan to help achieve this. This fact sheet summarises the changes New Zealand is planning to make to address BEPS based on the OECD action plan, as well as the significant steps we have already taken as part of this glo bal effort. We want to ensure that all profits earned in New Zealand incur tax in New Zealand. This means that: • all revenue earned in New Zealand should be reported; and • any deductions from revenue should reflect actual costs of production, and not be designed to reduce tax. It will often be legitimate for a New Zealand subsidiary to make payments to a foreign parent – such as when it is importing goods from the parent. However, we need to ensure the amount of these payments is appropriate, and not designed to shift profits away from New Zealand to reduce or eliminate a company’s tax liability. Other BEPS strategies take advantage of international tax rules that are still grounded in a bricks and mortar, rather than a digital economy. New Zealand’s international tax rules are already sound. However, there are always areas for improvement and further changes are in the pipeline. This work broadly falls into three categories: 1. Making tax law more robust 2. Increasing international cooperation 3. Improving transparency and exchange of information. 1 June 2016 1. Making tax law more robust New Zealand has already... • Reformed controlled foreign company rules, by closing gaps and repealing eight country-based exemptions for non-active subsidiaries, as well as putting limits on interest costs that could be deducted in relation to outbound investment. • Strengthened the thin capitalisation rules to reduce the amount of debt a foreign- controlled entity can have before interest deductions will be disallowed. The rules were also widened to capture more foreign ownership structures. • Introduced the bank minimum equity rules that limit interest deductions taken by foreign-owned New Zealand banks by requiring them to have minimum amount of capital. • Removed the foreign dividend exemption for deductible foreign equity, removing an opportunity for tax arbitrage between New Zealand and other jurisdictions. • Eliminated the conduit regime which allowed New Zealand subsidiaries controlled by foreign shareholders to flow foreign income through New Zealand without paying any New Zealand tax. Further changes in the pipeline • From 1 October, GST will apply to cross border services – including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from overseas websites. • Limiting the use of look-through companies as conduit vehicles – that is, New Zealand companies used by non-residents to invest in foreign markets to generate income that is not taxable in New Zealand. This was included in the May 2016 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill. • The May 2016 tax Bill also strengthened non-resident withholding tax rules and clarified that New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule may override the application of tax treaties. • Introducing hybrid mismatch rules, which prevent companies avoiding tax by structuring their businesses or financing arrangements to take advantage of differences between New Zealand’s rules and the rules of other countries. New Zealand will soon consult on proposed changes. • Consultation in 2016 on strengthening the interest limitation rules, which will further limit the ability of mult inationals to strip profits out of New Zealand through excessive interest payments. 2. Increasing international cooperation New Zealand has already... • Entered into bilateral tax treaties and tax information exchange agreements with over 50 countries. 2 June 2016 • Signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters in order to increase the exchange of tax information with the 93 other signatories. Further changes in the pipeline • New Zealand intends to sign-up to the OECD’s Multilateral Instrument which strengthens the international rule for whether a business has a taxable presence in a country, introduces a treaty anti-abuse rule and provides for new dispute resolution/arbitration procedures. • New Zealand will apply the strengthened OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which determine how much of a multi-national’s profit should be taxed in a particular jurisdiction. 3. Improving transparency and exchange of information New Zealand has already... • Introduced an International Questionnaire for 292 foreign-owned companies to collect further information about financing, debt and transfer pricing to help enforce current rules. • Implemented FATCA measures to collect and exchange information from financial institutions about investments by US citizens in New Zealand. • Begun exchanging information with foreign tax administrators on taxpayer-specific rulings on cross-border activities that could give rise to BEPS concerns. Further changes in the pipeline • The Government will soon issue a formal response to John Shewan’s independent inquiry into the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts. • Automat ically exchange a non-resident’s investment information internationally, limiting the ability of non-residents to hide assets offshore to evade tax obligations. This is much like FATCA, but not limited to the US. • Requiring large mult inationals to prepare country-by-country reports, including the allocation of income and taxes paid. This will be shared with other tax authorities to give a full picture of a company’s activities in all countries. As part of this work it is important to balance the need for our international tax laws to be robust, with the need to ensure that taxes do not unduly discourage foreign investment. The draft officials’ paper, New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment outlines New Zealand’s approach to taxing investment into New Zealand and sets out our policy framework for considering this trade-off. 3

Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information Graham Hunt, Tony Loo and Chris Orchard 7 March 2016 Auckland Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Introduction “Vast amounts of money are kept offshore and go untaxed to the extent that taxpayers fail to comply with tax obligations in their home jurisdiction. Countries have a shared interest in maintaining the integrity of their tax systems. Co-operation between tax administrations is critical in the fight against tax evasion and in protecting the integrity of tax systems. A key aspect of that co- operation is exchange of information” Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information In Tax Matters © OECD 2012 Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz The Standard • Full name: Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters • Short name: Automatic Exchange of Information (or AEOI) • Comprises: –Common Reporting Standard (or CRS) –Commentaries –Other elements (e.g. exchange between countries and technical issues) Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz AEOI Timetable 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 FATCA switches on 1/7/14. First exchanges with USA under FATCA in September. CRS switches on for early adopter jurisdictions from 1/1/16. FATCA exchanges continue in September. CRS switches on for 2 nd wave adopter jurisdictions most from 1/1/17, some later in the year (including NZ). Early adopters make first CRS exchanges in September. FATCA exchanges continue - business as usual. 2 nd wave adopters make first CRS exchanges in September. Early adopter CRS exchanges make 2 nd year exchanges in September. FATCA exchanges continue - business as usual. All AEOI business as usual going forward. Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz New Zealand Timeline • Closing date for submissions on the issues paper is 31 March 2016 • Parliamentary timetable (subject to change): – Bill scheduled for introduction in early July 2016 – Referral to Select Committee (and start of submission process) in July 2016 – Enactment by December 2016 • Due diligence rules first apply from 1 July 2017 Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz CRS vs. FATCA • CRS builds on FATCA Model 1 IGA – core concepts around Reporting Financial Institutions, due diligence and reporting are closely aligned. • Differences in approach arise from multilateral nature of CRS which has had to adapt the FATCA model to remove a number of US specificities. • The key differences are: – No withholding tax under the CRS. – No thresholds for individual accounts under the CRS. – More Financial Institutions in scope under CRS because of more restrictive approach to defining Non-reporting Financial Institutions. – Alternative due diligence for lower-value pre-existing individual accounts based on residential address of the account holder. Most jurisdictions tax on the basis of residence unlike the USA that taxes based on residence or citizenship. Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Applying the Standard Reporting Financial institutions Financial Accounts Reportable Accounts Due Diligence Rules Report the Relevant Information for exchange, reciprocal information flowing to Inland Revenue Review To Identify By Applying And then Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Reporting Financial Institutions (1) • Any Financial Institution resident in New Zealand, but excluding any branch of that Financial Institution that is located outside of New Zealand. • Any branch located in New Zealand of a Financial Institution that itself is not resident in New Zealand. BUT • Excluding any Financial Institution that is defined as a Non-Reporting Financial Institution under New Zealand domestic law. Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Reporting Financial Institutions (2) •In general an entity is regarded as resident in New Zealand if it is tax resident here. • If it has no tax residence, unless it is a trust, it is resident in New Zealand where: – it is incorporated here; – it has its place of management (including effective management) here; or – it is subject to financial supervision here. • A trust is resident in New Zealand if one or more of its trustees are so resident.

The fourth consultation, Making Tax Simpler - Better administration of PAYE and GST (the discussion document) outlined proposals to design digital services for PAYE and GST that will integrate tax requirements into tasks that people would already be doing as part of running their business, such as running their payroll. An online forum, makingtaxsimpler. ird.govt.nz, provided the opportunity for the public to submit comments online and answer three opinion polls linked to specific questions. Written submissions were also received through the normal submission process. Over 1000 online comments were received as well as 87 written submissions. This document summarises the main themes from both the online consultation and written submissions. The comments quoted in the summaries are representative examples of the comments received and are quoted as supplied, apart from the correction of typographical errors. It also sets out the results from the opinion poll questions for some of the proposals. The summary is organised by the chapter headings used in the discussion document. The submissions received were generally supportive of the overall direction of the document but highlighted concerns or issues that would need to be addressed. Most submitters did not support payday remittance of PAYE and other deductions or an electronic filing threshold for GST. Also the theme that “one size does not fit all” was evident from the submissions and online comments. CHAPTER 1 55 INTEGRATING TAX REQUIREMENTS INTO BUSINESS PROCESSES USING SOFTWARE This section of the discussion document proposed integrating PAYE and GST requirements into business processes using software so that the tax processes are part of the normal business activity and would enable business and the like to use their business software to also meet their tax obligations. Summary of comments Submissions were generally supportive of the approach, but there was a view that the use of business software should be optional. Also submissions noted a number of concerns or issues that would need to be considered in the detailed design. Feedback on the integration of tax obligations into business software is also covered in chapters 4, 5 and 7. “Any increase in filing frequency must come with an increased tolerance in relation to accuracy. Businesses operate to a level of materiality and will incur significant additional compliance costs if they are required to provide information to a level of accuracy over and above that which they apply in their business operations.” “For those businesses that use commercially available software this makes sense.” “...we consider paper-based alternatives will continue to be required for some time yet.” “Customers need to remain in control of their own data and it must be easy for them to manage and keep track of their interactions with IR.” “We submit that businesses should always be aware at which point information is being sent to Inland Revenue, and there should be an option to save the information and delay sending it to Inland Revenue (i.e. to enable it to be reviewed by a manager or tax adviser).” “It is however important to recognise that the “do it yourself” nature of the small NZ business means that a large number do run a paper based system and do not want the extra monthly cost that accounting packages have... the freedom should be maintained to use a CHAPTER 2 66 paper based system.” “We are supportive of the Government’s initiative to integrate tax requirements into business processes using software, as such a change can be expected to reduce compliance costs for businesses in the long term...” “Changes to business processes will involve short-term compliance costs for businesses.” “Employers should be able to “self- correct” this \[errors\] on a go forward basis (that is, in future pay periods) without any imposition of penalties... We believe that such error correction should not be limited to minor errors (i.e. constrained by a $ figure).” “...there should be an onus on Inland Revenue to respond to employers in a timely manner to allow them to update their payroll information...If employers are expected to update their systems and processes to interact with Inland Revenue in real-time, approval should be available in real-time.” 7 MODERNISING THE PAYE RULES This chapter of the discussion document consulted on potential changes to the PAYE rules relating to secondary tax codes, extra pays, holiday pay, an extra pay day in a tax year, as well as how legislated rate changes should be dealt with. Secondary tax codes The discussion document set out the Government’s approach for reducing existing pressure points around secondary tax codes through improved administrative intervention during the year, as a result of Inland Revenue receiving more timely PAYE information. Summary of comments This approach was widely supported in written submissions, although many of the submitters emphasised that care must be taken to ensure that this does not increase compliance costs for employers. Some submitters considered that secondary tax codes were unfair and should be abolished. “The setting of individual rates should be optional. Some taxpayers may wish to maintain their privacy if they have income from other sources such as a second job, investment or family trust distributions.” Suggestion for reducing secondary tax pressure points: “Allowing taxpayers to set own rates based on previous year’s marginal tax rate.” “... supports the above vision for reducing existing pressure points by way of receiving more timely PAYE information. While we agree that IRD intervention during the year will help in reducing over and under payments of tax, this intervention should be managed and applied (by the IRD) in a way that does not increase compliance costs for employers, or result in special tax codes being applied incorrectly due to incomplete employment information being held regarding an employee.” “...the employee must make the decision whether to apply for a special tax code to change the withholding rate. An employer has imperfect information regarding an employee’s overall income profile and as such, it is only the employee that is in a position to determine whether a special tax code is appropriate. Further we note that it is CHAPTER 3 88 essential that the employee make this decision, as changes in withholding rates to correct for tax previously under-withheld or over-withheld without notifying the employee could cause issues in the employer-employee relationship.” “I think there shouldn't be secondary tax. Why should someone who is happy or needs to work 2+ jobs be taxed more? We should be thanking them for getting out there and doing everything they can to be a part of the working world.” Tax treatment of extra pays The discussion document sought feedback on what was more important in relation to the tax treatment of extra pays – a simple calculation method or withholding accuracy. It also sought feedback on the idea of introducing two options that an employer could use to determine the amount of tax to withhold from an extra pay – a simple method (suitable for employers doing their payroll manually), and a more accurate, but more complex, method (suitable for employers with payroll software). Feedback was also sought on what the calculation method(s) should be. Summary of comments Consultation responses were mixed. Small employers running their payroll manually and the accounting profession generally thought simplicity was more important, while payroll software providers and large employers generally thought withholding accuracy was more important. There were also a number of suggestions to improve the calculation method for calculating tax on an extra pay. “On balance, making the method simpler for employers is more important. A degree of inaccuracy should be tolerated.” “... does not consider the current calculation of extra pay to be overly complex from an employer perspective (using payroll software), and is of the view that accuracy should be prioritised in this instance to reduce the occurrences of over withholding of tax from employees...we do not agree that the introduction of an annual 'square-up' would reduce the need for accuracy in the withholding of tax. Rather it would place a heightened importance on employers to get the tax "right" during the year, as the employee will be required to pay additional underpayments at year end (which does not necessarily occur now), which is likely to result in additional queries to the employer.” “we do question whether this (greater accuracy) is consistent with the overall vision of “Making Tax Simpler” as noted in the title to this discussion document. In \[our\] view, a drive for greater accuracy will lead to more complexity in the PAYE rules, and this is not necessarily a desirable outcome. In addition, accuracy in the calculation of PAYE appears to be of less importance in a post- Business Transformation world where it is envisaged that all taxpayers will be required to complete an annual square- up of income tax.” 9 Revenue publication is sufficient. Several submitters thought that taxing holiday pay paid in advance as an extra pay is unfair as it results in over withholding. It is common in some industries for employees to work extra hours in the lead up to Christmas, which can exacerbate the over-withholding if the extra pay formula is used. “...treating advance payments of holiday pay as extra pay can be seen as unfair to employees, and as such, more employers could be fielding more queries from potentially disgruntled employees.” Extra pay day in a tax year The idea of introducing a mechanism to withhold additional PAYE in tax years in which an extra pay day will occur was consulted on. Summary of comments Consultation responses were mixed. Some submitters supported introducing a mechanism, but amongst supporters there was division about whether it should be mandatory or optional at the employers’ discretion. Other submitters were against introducing a mechanism, on the basis that it would introduce additional complexity for little benefit. Several submitters favoured retaining the status quo for now and revisiting the question if, and when, it is decided to make all individuals undertake an annual square-up. “We are supportive of proposals to modernise the existing PAYE rules, such as secondary tax, extra pay and holiday pay. On balance, we support greater simplicity over complexity, particularly for smaller employers. However, a more accurate option (for calculating tax on extra pays) for employers who have more sophisticated payroll systems should be available.” “We consider trying to achieve tax positions that are "correct" on a comprehensive annual liability basis solely by source deductions requires too much administration and compliance by employers and other payers to be entirely successful in a progressive tax rate system...” Tax treatment of holiday pay This section of the discussion document consulted on clarifying the tax treatment of holiday pay through either legislation or an Inland Revenue publication. Submitters were also asked whether the tax treatment of holiday pay is unclear. Summary of comments The majority of large employers and tax advisors thought that the existing tax treatment of holiday pay is clear. The online forum comments suggested that there may be some lack of clarity amongst small employers. There were mixed views about whether legislative clarity should be provided, or whether clarification in an Inland Revenue publication would be sufficient. However, the majority of submitters thought clarification in an Inland 10 “... for the next few years the status quo should be preserved and the problem dealt with if and when there is a requirement for all individuals to undertake an annual income tax square-up. Any firm decision at this point would risk following a different path from that eventually taken by the business transformation process.” Application of legislated rate changes Different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products have different rules on what is to be done when there is a legislated rate (or threshold) change during a pay period, or if there is rate (or threshold) change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. The discussion document consulted on aligning the rules about how legislated rate changes are applied across the different PAYE-related tax types/products. Summary of comments Consultation responses strongly supported alignment. The majority of submitters favoured a pay date-based approach for alignment. “Yes this will help the simplification process”. “If the pay date approach is for pay periods starting after the rate change then it will be the best option.” “...we support alignment based on a pay-date approach on the basis that this would minimise compliance costs for employers.” “Apply rate changes from first pay after 1 April consistently. Better chance of everyone getting right then.” 11 PAYE - MODERNISING HOW INFORMATION IS PROVIDED Problems with current PAYE process Submitters were asked a number of questions regarding what aspects of PAYE processes caused problems or were sources of frustration. The Discussion Document also outlined a number of concerns identified from previous feedback which submitters agreed were concerns and should be addressed. A number of the suggestions to deal with problems with the current process are administrative and these concerns and suggestions will be passed onto Inland Revenue for its consideration. Summary of comments Error correction - “Inability to correct errors in real time or self-correct errors on-line.” “Difficulty in making changes to information that has already been filed.” IRD response time – “Concern with the amount of time it takes IRD to process employer monthly schedules and action amendments.” “The amount of time it takes for amendments to KiwiSaver employer contributions to be processed.” “Of primary importance is the need for Inland Revenue to update PAYE records on a more real time basis.” MyIR – “...using separate log in details for the IRD portal means that is not possible to see if one member of the team has already dealt with email communications. It would be useful if the portal provided for a better ‘paper’ trail that allows multiple users from a single entity to be able to identify what actions other users had taken.” Some common themes from the online comments: “A reminder notice for payments due for PAYE would be helpful in the same way that we receive one for GST.” “I don't know why the IRD website doesn't save all historical data from using the PAYE calculator so you can then just press a button and do the monthly schedules based off what you already entered...” “It is also frustrating that the complexity of IRD rules seems to prevent amalgamation of the EMS & EDF into CHAPTER 4 1212 just one form.” Providing PAYE information at time of business process This section of the discussion document outlined in more detail the PAYE processes and how those processes could be integrated into the payroll processes so that the PAYE obligations such as providing PAYE information and remitting the PAYE and other deductions could be met as part of the business’ payroll process. In other words, the PAYE obligations being met as a consequence of the payroll event such as paying staff. Summary of comments Feedback from written submissions from larger employers and representative groups was generally in favour of, or silent on, providing PAYE information at the time of the business process, although it was noted that there would be one off upgrade costs. “In general, we agree that this \[using software to send payroll info to IR at the time staff are paid\] would reduce compliance costs for employers. However some of our members did not feel that there would be a significant reduction in compliance costs arising as a result of being able to send payroll information to Inland Revenue at the same time staff are paid, particularly those who already use the file transfer method to provide employer monthly schedule information to Inland Revenue”. “... current payroll software system cannot provide pay information to the IRD on a real time basis. The initial cost of upgrading/replacing software to enable this to occur would be substantial, however it would likely reduce ongoing compliance costs due to the reduction in errors and quicker amendment of incorrect tax and PAYE information held.” Most, albeit not all, feedback on the online forum (assumed to largely be from SMEs) was strongly opposed to payday reporting of pay period information assuming it would increase their current workload in proportion to their paydays in a month and, that it would impose additional costs to adopt or upgrade software. There were positive comments, often from submitters who identified themselves as users of software. Becoming an employer/ceasing to be an employer The discussion document proposed that payroll software packages include a feature that requires employers to notify Inland Revenue of a decision to commence or cease being an employer and asked whether such requirements should be included in legislation. Summary of comments There was strong support for this from written submitters. The general consensus was that this should not be a legislative requirement but some submitters considered that being a legislative requirement would mean that software developers would build 13 this feature into software. Some smaller employers were against this proposal due to the compliance costs. There was the belief that the EMS already serves this purpose. “\[We\] would not support any move to make such a change a legal requirement. As in all areas of regulation, moving from an operational matter to a legal requirement should occur only when there is a significant problem at hand requiring a move up the regulatory pyramid. \[We\] see no primary reason why these provisions should be included in legislation; any moves in this direction would likely worsen, rather than improve, the current employer-IRD relationship.” “We support the proposal in principle...” “It may be useful to include these requirements in legislation so that this encourages software developers to build this option into their software payroll packages.” Employing staff, maintaining their details and ceasing to employ staff The discussion document proposed that employers provide, via their payroll software, employee details to Inland Revenue at the time those details are entered, changed, or removed from the payroll system. It was proposed that the following information be provided: • Employee’s name; • IRD number; • Tax code; • Contact details; • Start date; and • Date of birth. It was also proposed that Inland Revenue would continue to communicate any change of employee obligations to the employee. Summary of comments The majority of written submissions supported the proposal to use payroll software to provide employee details to IR at the time those details were entered/changed/removed from the payroll system. “We agree with this proposal. In addition, we believe that employers would value a response from Inland Revenue in real-time once this information is sent via the payroll system in order to verify that the information provided is correct prior to the first pay run to that employee. \[We see\] a lot of value in this as if new employees can be correctly ‘on-boarded’ this should ensure more accurate PAYE withholding.” Smaller employers were less supportive of this proposal due an increase in compliance costs arising from entering employee details into the payroll system. “No. This effectively turns the payroll system into an HR system, and to achieve the aims stated on pages 38 – 39 require the information in the payroll system to be submitted to IRD 14 has increased/reduced.” “We also support the proposal that IR continue to communicate any change of employee obligations or details to the employee. This enables employees to remain in control of their information and to immediately correct anything they consider to be wrong.” Poll question: Do you support the proposal that Inland Revenue should continue to communicate any change of employee obligations or details to the employee? 7 responses, all yes. 10 0 % Ye s Poll question: Do you agree that employers should be able to send new employee details to Inland Revenue before the employees are first paid - this should ensure that new employees are correctly set up from the beginning of employment? 6 responses, 4 said yes (67%) and 2 said no. 33% No 67% Ye s prior to the first pay. This is not usually realistic. Additionally, this would impose significant extra cost on those without an electronic payroll system which communicates with IRD.” “IRD already receives the information that a new employee has started or finished via the EMS. It would be onerous to have to separately advise them that an employee has finished or started. We use a lot of casual staff over the Christmas period and they may then work for us intermittently during the year. I can just put them into the system for a couple of weeks here or there without having to make any special notification to the IRD.” “This is a great idea. Very helpful to have that information before the employee starts – very annoying when start getting letters from IRD about child support etc, then at least can confirm it with the employee.” “We generally only add new employees to the payroll software when we are about to pay them so I can’t see the benefit in the information being sent to IRD at that time.” There was strong support for Inland Revenue continuing to communicate any change of employee obligations to the employee. “\[in regards to IRD communicating changes to employees\] Yes then the employee has full knowledge of any amounts withheld. It is critical any such changes are notified to employees; otherwise employees will be requesting information from employers who may not know the reason why the tax rate 15 Date of birth information Submitters were asked whether employers should obtain date-of-birth information from their new employees and provide this information to Inland Revenue, in order to help Inland Revenue confirm taxpayers’ identities. Summary of comments Feedback was generally but not universally positive. The main message from submissions was that if employers are going to be required to obtain employee date of birth information and provide it to Inland Revenue, then it should be legislated for. Alternatively, Inland Revenue could provide a channel for employees to provide that information directly. Online comments in favour amounted to 56% of responses. Many of those opposed assumed that the alternative, direct employee provision of identity information to IR, was straightforward with employees happy to contact IR to provide details. “We support this requirement being included in legislation. Due to the sensitivities in the employer collecting this information from an employee, if this was not included as a legislative requirement, employees may otherwise refuse to provide this information.” “We are not comfortable with the proposal that employers should obtain date of birth information and provide it to Inland Revenue. Age is a sensitive issue for some and age discrimination still exists in New Zealand workplaces. IR will already have the employee’s name and IRD number in order to verify their identity. If a birth date is also needed for verification purposes, we recommend the employee provide this directly to Inland Revenue.” Poll question: Do you agree employees should provide date of birth information to their employer along with their IRD number? 17 responses, 13 said yes (76% in favour) and 4 said no. 34% No 76% Ye s Compliance cost implications of provision of PAYE information at the time staff are paid The consultation sought information on the compliance cost implications of using software to send payroll information at the time staff are paid and whether it would increase or reduce such costs and if possible quantify that effect. Summary of comments The responses were mixed. Some submitters, particularly those who made on-line comments (assumed to largely be small to medium businesses) considered pay day reporting would increase compliance costs because of the need to check information on a pay period basis 16 cost of upgrading/replacing software to enable this to occur would be substantial, however it would likely reduce ongoing compliance costs due to the reduction in errors and quicker amendment of incorrect tax and PAYE information held.” “I think that this would increase compliance costs. It would also remove the internal process of checking for errors. If something was mis-entered in the pay run, for example, it can be corrected before the month end return to the IRD. Commonly, businesses perform reconciliations on a month end basis, to tie in with their management reporting, not after each payroll. Sending information to the IRD automatically after each pay run would therefore increase the possibility for error and also compliance.” “It would reduce compliance costs because it would save having to reenter the same data on a different day to file with IRD. It saves double handling and is more efficient doing both tasks at the same time.” “I think that submitting to the IRD every time we have a pay run increases compliance rather than decreases it.” “...we would be disadvantaged straight away with extra compliance costs as we do not use a digital payroll system at present.” Amending PAYE information The consultation proposed that employer’s payroll systems calculate and submit amending data to Inland Revenue at the same time the changes rather than monthly and / or the need to purchase payroll software. This concern was reflected in a number of written submissions also. A number of submitters were comfortable with their current process and did not want to change. A number of submitters that currently use payroll software supported the proposal. Again some submitters thought that this should be optional. Some submitters noted that there would be a one-off cost in upgrading systems to allow for pay-day reporting, but considered on-going compliance costs would reduce. Others considered the compliance cost savings to be quite small as the transmission of data is only a small part of the payroll process. “In our view, the more frequently the information is required, the more likely that there will be additional cost to employers. While electronic transfer costs are low, the cost is in employee time required for compilation and verification. If Inland Revenue is prepared to relax the rules around penalties, this would reduce the costs because employers would be more confident to send information directly from the payroll system without incurring such high compliance costs in compilation and verification. One option would be to allow the information to be submitted on the following working day to allow time for the detection and correction of errors.” “...Our current payroll software system cannot provide pay information to the IRD on a real time basis. The initial 17 whether submitters provide information to other government agencies that they think would more appropriately be provided to and passed on by Inland Revenue as part of the PAYE information process. Summary of comments There was marginal support for this, however it was noted that other Government agencies’ officers must be subject to the same secrecy requirements as IR officers. “We believe there still needs to be controls on information flows from Inland Revenue to other government departments for privacy reasons. Information from Inland Revenue should be available to other government agencies on a need basis only, especially where it is individual information. If a person is applying for social assistance or for income related payments from ACC, it is appropriate for Inland Revenue to release income information to the particular department and for this purpose. There should still be restrictions on the release of income information to other government departments. For example, in our view IR should not be allowed to release information that would result in it being required to police legislation and policy in relation to pay rates (i.e. compliance with minimum wage rules), working hours and secondary jobs.” “Could the IRD please also share data with Statistics New Zealand. Their quarterly employment surveys are a complete waste of our time given the government already has this information through the PAYE system.” are made to the employer’s own records. Summary of comments There was general support for using payroll software to amend payroll records and to send that information to Inland Revenue at the time the records are amended. Also there was support for the ability to correct errors in a subsequent period as is the case for other taxes such as GST. There was no consensus on which option should be chosen regarding the method for amending PAYE information. “We believe this would be an advantage.” “The majority of our members were indifferent as to which option is selected. We expect that provided whichever option is selected, the process should be automated within the payroll software, and therefore it should not make a significant difference to employers as to what option is selected.” “The proposal to expand s 113A of the TAA to allow corrections of PAYE errors in the next period is welcome and could provide sufficient relief in many cases... we doubt that change would provide a complete solution, particularly where errors or adjustments (increasing or reducing tax payable) may not become apparent until some pay periods later.” “Automated corrections would be great.” Information provided to other agencies The discussion document asked 18 PAYE INFORMATION - IMPLEMENTING CHANGE Threshold for electronic filing The discussion document consulted on reducing the electronic filing threshold for the employer monthly schedule (EMS) from $100,000 PAYE and ESCT to $50,000 a year. Also it asked if such threshold should be based on something other than the value of PAYE and ESCT deductions and if so, what. A process for obtaining an exemption from digital filing would remain, and focus on whether the employer is unable to access digital services. Summary of comments Feedback from the online consultation was generally opposed to a reduction in the threshold. Some submitters were opposed to an electronic filing threshold altogether. Feedback from written submissions was mixed. “Threshold should remain at $100,000. Was set some years ago and wage increases have eroded this anyway. Some businesses still prefer manual systems to computer software.” “We consider $50,000 to be an appropriate threshold for filing PAYE information electronically...we consider the number of employees is a viable option. Above a certain number, electronic filing of PAYE information could be compulsory.” “With the lack of guidance as to whether a drop from $100,000 to $50,000 would make any material difference, we believe it would be more beneficial if any decision on the future PAYE threshold is not made until (a) more information is provided so that an informed choice can be made on an optimal threshold level, and (b) submitters have a better understanding of likely significant changes to PAYE processes so that these can be taken into account when examining a revised threshold.” “The $50,000 threshold is much lower than the current $100,000 e-filing threshold and is not supported. Our concern is that this will capture very small employers and impose compliance costs on them to upgrade. This will be a “cliff”, from a compliance cost perspective, for an employer who CHAPTER 5 1919 Also views were sought on whether employers would seek to change the frequency with which they pay staff, if required to provide information at the time the business process occurred. Summary of comments Almost all of the online submitters who responded on this topic stressed that the provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process should be voluntary. This was not necessarily support for a voluntary- first approach which allowed for the possibility of a subsequent legislative requirement but support for employers always having a choice. The preference amongst the written submitters was mixed. The general consensus was that uptake should be voluntary - however some submitters were of the view that more time is required for large employers and software developers to adapt to the changes and therefore there should not be a set review period. The feedback in response to whether employers would change pay cycles in response to the requirement to provide information at the time of the business process was mixed. The majority of the submitters who responded to this question said they would not change their pay cycle. “Agree that the Government needs to be able to balance the employer’s interest in choosing how to provide PAYE information against the wider system benefits. Prefer the voluntary approach. Think Government should require employers to use payroll software has PAYE obligations of $50,001.” “...the electronic filing option should not apply to businesses with PAYE of $100,000 or less or 3 or fewer employees.” Providing PAYE information when the business process occurs – implementation options The consultation proposed three options for implementing the provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process: 1) Voluntary-first approach - Once a critical mass of employers are using the new software the Government may review the situation and require all employers (or all of a certain class) to provide PAYE info at the time of the business process. 2) Legislated approach - Initial legislation would set out dates by which time employers would be required to provide PAYE information at time of business process (possibly different dates for different classes of employers). 3) Review approach – Legislation would be amended to allow employers to voluntarily submit PAYE information when the business process occurs. This would be reviewed 12 – 36 months after introduction and mandated for employers (or certain classes) if the Government concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs. The review approach would have a time- tabled review period from the outset, whereas the voluntary-first approach would not. 20 capable of providing PAYE information at the time of the business process – but there should be some payback for additional costs. I wouldn’t seek to change the frequency of paying staff if required to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process.” “have no issue with processing PAYE at same time as doing wages (but don’t think payroll software should be mandatory). May seek to do wages monthly if this was introduced.” “We recommend the voluntary-first approach...there will be a range of employers with different levels of capability that will need to be accommodated...PAYE technology solutions will need time to develop and gain buy-in...therefore, we do not believe the review period should be time constrained.” “We prefer that IR adopt the review approach in the first instance, rather than mandating electronic filing of PAYE information. If the systems and processes that IR implements are time saving and user friendly taxpayers will be keen to adopt them. If they are not, further work should be undertaken to ensure that they are useful to business and fit for purpose...over time this would be in the best interest of the tax system. However, we do not believe it should be required at first instance. In our view, it would be preferable to encourage employers to use such software. This would also encourage software developers to develop it.” Factors influencing the uptake of software The discussion document asked what factors would influence submitters as to whether or not they would upgrade their software to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs. Also, it sought views that if some employers were exempt from the requirement to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process occurs, whether such employers should provide disaggregated PAYE (pay day) information and when that information should be provided by. Summary of comments For large employers it was stressed that a long lead in time was essential in order for them to upgrade their software. For smaller employers, the most influential factor mentioned was cost, ease of use and the benefits to the business. A number of submitters mentioned the provisions of free software or Inland Revenue providing a basic payroll system for small employers to use. “A more realistic timeframe would be around 24-36 months to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible for businesses employing the largest percentage of employees.” (The discussion document referred to 12 – 24 month lead time.) Other factors mentioned: “Whether \[we\] are able to access the new PAYE services (i.e. employers can only utilise the new services once their 21 that moving to digital services will help make this possible, but we also see clients who are at risk of being left behind...we also recommend that, for the small number of people who will never make the transition to the digital environment, non-digital services be available for as long as is needed, without penalty or charge. We do not want to see people forced to use accountants or tax agents, or decide not to bother filing at all, because of the absence of a non-digital option.” “Most influential factors for determining whether to upgrade will be minimising fixed ongoing costs, access to support, ease of use and interactivity with other systems. If we were required to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process I would consider outsourcing the job.” Financial assistance Submitters were asked for their views on whether financial assistance should be available to assist employers to take advantage of the new digital services proposed to modernise PAYE information. Summary of comments In the online submissions there was overwhelming support for the Government to provide financial assistance, however a proportion said that financial assistance would not influence them to purchase software. Some submitters were of the view that the current payroll subsidy is too low. Some suggested that Inland Revenue should provide a basic payroll package for small employers payroll software provider updates the employer’s current system to take advantage of the new PAYE services); The timeframe in which their current payroll software provider will upgrade the system to the required standard to access the new PAYE services; Whether using the new PAYE services is required by legislation; The cost of upgrading the payroll software system; Efficiencies achieved in utilising upgrading payroll software to take advantage of the new PAYE services; Whether the new PAYE services will be easy to use within a payroll software package; Whether adopters of the new PAYE services experience system ‘errors’; Potential for disruption and the time it will take for the organisation to implement and adapt to the new computer software.” “While it is reasonable to expect those using non-digital services to provide Inland Revenue with some of or the same information, there will need to be separate requirements for how this information is to be provided and the timeframe for providing it. In our view, exempt employers will still need to provide some form of non-digital form to Inland Revenue, such as a revised EMS schedule.” “We support a tax system that is fair, simple to use and efficient. We recognise 22 should be available, particularly if an employer will be required to purchase or modify software. We believe IR should consider building a portal that all employers can access, rather than requiring them to purchase software in order to be able to take advantage of the new digital services. Given Government’s need to remain neutral, we would not support IR favouring or preferring one software provider over another. Subsidies always have issues with targeting. Unless it is a universal subsidy there will be perceptions of inequity. Also any subsidy needs to be paid to employers, not a third party.” IR 56 taxpayers The discussion document asked whether IR 56 taxpayers (that is employees responsible for their own PAYE rather than their employer) should remain responsible for their own PAYE, and whether the due date for filing and payment should be brought forward from the 20th of the month following payment. Summary of comments Written submissions and most online comments supported the continuation of the current system. However, two online commentators questioned the current system and suggested a schedular payment type withholding tax and an end of year return as an alternative. The consensus among submitters was that the suggested due date of the 5th of the following month would be impractical, with most submitters being of the view that the 20th of the following month remained to use. The majority of written submitters were silent on the question of whether the Government should provide financial assistance. Those that did submit on the issue were generally supportive. “Small to medium businesses should have assistance from the government. Any changes made to the tax system should fall on IRD and the government. For example, a new staff member starts. It's up to the employer to provide all the necessary information and equipment related to that job description. You’re the boss IRD. If you want certain systems in place, then it's up to IRD to provide and equip the new system. Our tax system is suffocating small business!” “We believe financial assistance may be required to compensate for the transitional cost as well as ongoing costs (the latter particularly if employers are to lose the cash-flow benefit from holding PAYE as working capital prior to remittance)...assistance could be targeted by size of business, with smaller employers more likely to be disproportionately impacted by the changes (see also above our suggestion to limit the PAYE proposals to employers with more than 3 employees).” “This subsidy \[the payroll subsidy\] should be retained or even increased to assist employers to take advantage of the new digital services proposed to modernise PAYE information.” “Financial assistance can aid in uptake, also potential assistance to education and upskilling.” “Yes - financial assistance or a subsidy 23 appropriate for IR 56 taxpayers. “...I consider the IR56 tax payment model a liability as an employer. Asking people to file their own PAYE is tedious for them to do and me to manage. ...I can see no reason why employees who currently fit the IR56 criteria could not be registered as self-employed like so many other freelance workers and either have WHT deducted and/or pay tax at the end of their financial year.” “We agree that IR 56 taxpayers should remain responsible for their own PAYE information and deductions...we believe that 20th of the month following payment filing is still appropriate.” 24 PAYE - ALIGNING PAYMENTS The discussion document consulted on the possibility of aligning the process of making PAYE payments (and related deductions and contributions such as for KiwiSaver, child support and student loan repayments) to IR with the timing and business process of paying salary and wages to employees. Summary of comments Most submitters (including online) did not support payday remittance of PAYE. The minority that supported paying PAYE at the time wages are paid considered it would save time, be more efficient and would allow employers to better manage their tax liabilities. Those in support said: “\[We support\] the voluntary introduction of pay-day payment of PAYE to IR. The most time efficient processing of payroll can be achieved when the payroll calculation, payment instructions, PAYE payment and IR information filing are all completed at the same time, as part of the usual business process of paying employees. We recognise that some employers will choose to retain the status quo and pay PAYE in arrears. However, some small businesses will value the certainty and finality of a pay- day payment over the cash flow benefit from paying in arrears.” “We are generally supportive of the proposal for PAYE to be paid to Inland Revenue on a pay day basis, due to the expected reductions in compliance and administration costs as well as a potential to help reduce PAYE payment default. However, we submit that there should be an extended transition period for small businesses if pay day payment is adopted.” “... would not be against the proposal to combine the payment of salary and wages to employees, the payment of PAYE deductions to IRD, and providing PAYE information to IRD on the same day, on the condition that the process of payment and filing of information to the IRD is fully automated.” “Don’t mind paying PAYE at the same time as the wages – would make the process more efficient instead of having to do it later. But will consider paying monthly instead of fortnightly.” CHAPTER 6 2525 The main reasons submitters gave against the proposal were: (1) Cash flow Employers and their representatives were largely concerned about the impact it would have on the cash flow of businesses, especially on small businesses, which are often under- capitalised and most likely to be adversely affected by the impact of the proposal. Because of this, some submitters suggested that payday alignment should only be targeted at large employers. “We believe a change to align PAYE payment with salary payments would have a significant effect on overall cash flow in the New Zealand economy. Officials should conduct an analysis of the effects on New Zealand’s business and economy.” “This would impact cash flow of under- capitalised small businesses. Would be extra work for IRD arranging delayed payments – businesses would be charged penalties and interest resulting in additional tax effectively.” (2) Ability to offset costs Employers (being “unpaid” intermediaries in the tax system) would lose the advantage of interest on the PAYE deductions they hold between the time they pay their staff and the time they pay the PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue. Currently employers may offset some of their PAYE compliance costs with the benefit provided by holding the PAYE until payment is due. “It is often pointed out that some employers consider the time use of money from the delay in paying PAYE is a form of payment from IRD for costs incurred in complying with PAYE obligations...\[We have\] much sympathy for this view...” (3) May compromise digital filing through intermediaries Payroll intermediaries are able to provide electronic filing services at a cheaper price because of the timing delay (30-40% of their revenue comes from interest earned on trust account). Without it, prices will need to be increased (or the payroll subsidy will have to increase) which may result in fewer employers using payroll intermediary services. “The proposal to align PAYE payment obligations would eliminate a key revenue stream that PAYE Intermediaries rely on to fund and subsidise their services. Without increases in the current subsidies paid by the Commissioner, the proposal would result in payroll intermediaries having to increase their prices charged to employers, or abandon the additional services that they provide, which would in turn result in fewer employers (particularly small employers) using their services. This would leave Inland Revenue to manage these employers directly, at significant additional cost.” “\[this proposal would\] increase business costs by an estimated $175M in funding costs if all employers had to borrow to fund the short-fall.” 26 Other comments: “This just looks like a scheme to improve the government's cashflow under the guise of tax simplification. I cannot see the time or cost saving.” “...the 20th of the month following is when most small businesses are paid by their clients, meaning that the 20th is a good time cash flow-wise for them to meet their obligations re IRD to PAYE.” (4) Additional administrative costs Most submitters thought that more frequent payment was likely to introduce additional administrative burdens and costs to many employers (payroll staff involved, authorisation, and transaction costs). Some large employers make several pay runs a week (sometimes daily) due to different categories of employees being paid on a different frequency. “An approach which requires PAYE to be paid each time a payment is made to an employee will result in more frequent payments of PAYE. This is particularly the case in large organisations where a large number of extra pays are made to employees through the year, or where employees are paid on a weekly basis...Given the internal administrative costs and transaction costs involved in making a payment of PAYE, this would likely increase compliance costs for many large employers.” (5) No time for error correction Payday remittance would expose employers to potential penalties as there will be no time for error correction. “Filing the EMS with IR requires additional compilation, verification and, often, error correction, over and above the work done for the monthly or fortnightly payment run. If IR were to require the EMS or equivalent at the same time as the payment run, IR would need to waive all interest and penalties payable on the filing of the EMS.” 27 GST - MODERNISING HOW INFORMATION IS PROVIDED Using integrated software to provide GST information The discussion document proposed that taxpayers would be able to provide GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their integrated accounting software used as part of their business processes. This would replace the manual filing of GST returns. Summary of comments The majority of written submitters supported this, however some took the view that because of the large amount of manual adjustments that are required for GST returns, integrated software may not be all that useful. The lack of time for error correction was also raised as a concern. Small business registered for GST generally opposed using integrated software for the following reasons: • Current system works fine/have no need for software; • Cost; • Inability to correct errors. A significant proportion of SMEs were still in favour of it provided it was voluntary. Also concerns were expressed about the ability to correct errors or make adjustments. Comments were made that these proposals rely on the correct information being inputted into the accounting software in the first place. One submitter recommended that the proposal needs to be further explored with an emphasis on how incorrect information provided by the GST registered person is handled. “Given the bespoke nature of most large employer’s accounting systems, it would be difficult to produce a GST return directly from the firm’s accounting system given the number of manual adjustments required. In addition, some employers do not use their accounting software to calculate their GST obligations.” “As a chartered accountant I see the CHAPTER 7 2828 checks and not "blindly" on accounting software. Definitively a "no" from us - not good for small businesses!” “I do not think this should be made compulsory as a lot of people (such as myself) are registered for GST (although the present size of business is smaller than the minimum threshold for GST) and do not have accounting software as the business cannot afford it. Electronic submission of GST returns is fine but should be optional, not compulsory.” “If you are going to do this, it must be optional. A lot of small businesses and independent contractors in NZ run their business without accounting software. To impose the cost of having to use accounting software on all organisations in NZ could pose a substantial net cost to the economy; and provide a barrier for new start-ups. Other options: Let small businesses file once a year - that'd halve my compliance costs. For me the current categories of costs required by IRD are meaningless and not how I prepare my accounts for any other purpose. Having to recode for tax/GST purposes adds compliance costs. Tax returns may be made on cash or accrual basis - that flexibility/choice should definitely be retained. As a CA I also have some concerns about the practicality of feeding the information for medium- larger businesses given the need for month/year end adjustments and adjustments to GL coding made for tax reasons .” “I would welcome the ability to have my accounting software send information directly to IR, with suitable controls. This would reduce my effort. I am only mistakes people make using accounting software. Software should prevent people from filing until certain checks have been made such as: 1. All transactions from the bank feeds have been allocated, coded, processed, leaving none un-coded for the period in review. 2. The Bank reconciliation has been completed and all outstanding items on the bank rec are brought to the clients attention before the return is processed. 3. The accounting system ensures that the debtors ledger reconciles with the balance in the general ledger. 4. The accounting system ensures that the creditors ledger reconciles with the balance in the general ledger.” “We support the proposal to allow the submission of GST returns online via accounting software as an additional option...in order for the proposal to work efficiently, Officials should develop a process to allow subsequent error correction for GST returns.” “...although the future state looks to simplify the lines of required communication and data transfer, success is still predicated on the notion of the right information being inputted to provide the correct result. Therefore, the future state could lessen, but not eliminate, the age-old technological problem of “garbage-in-garbage-out.” “I would not be happy if the accounting software was directly linked - small adjustments have to be made, etc- I rely on our accountant and my own 29 practical”. It would be helpful for Inland Revenue to publish guidelines on when the exemption may apply and how taxpayers can utilise it.” “We do not support the proposal that GST refunds should only be made by direct credit into a taxpayer’s nominated bank account. We consider the proposal is open to abuse and would require a greater degree of accurate record- keeping than is presently happening. If the measure was to be made compulsory we believe additional security checks would be necessary.” Electronic submission of GST information for some registered persons The discussion document asked whether GST-registered persons over a certain threshold should be required to submit their GST information to Inland Revenue in an electronic format. Summary of comments The majority of online submitters were of the view that electronic filing of GST information should be voluntary and there is no compulsion to use accountancy software to submit digitally. The response among the written submitters was mixed: “We do not support a compulsory electronic filing threshold for GST. We expect over time, with the development of technology, that the number of electronic filing will increase naturally. Compulsion is therefore not required.” a one-man band, but anything which reduces effort and cuts down chance of error would be good. Support others comments that this should only be optional, but not those that say 'make no changes' - don’t hold back those who are willing and able to improve their efficienc y.” Direct crediting of GST refunds The discussion document proposed GST refunds should only be made by direct credit into a customer’s nominated bank account, unless it would cause undue hardship to a customer or is not practicable. Summary of comments The majority of submitters (written & online) that responded on this issue were in support. Some submitters indicated that it should be the default option, but not compulsory. “Making it compulsory won’t be an improvement and won’t benefit anyone – will place hardship on those that currently choose to receive a cheque for whatever reason.” “Given the prevalence of electronic payment methods, it is reasonable that GST refunds should be paid by Inland Revenue electronically (either to the taxpayer’s account or its authorised agent). The benefits of such payments are identified in the discussion document. However, as acknowledged in the document, it is important Inland Revenue continues to ensure that “an exemption to this rule would be available if the taxpayer expresses hardship or direct crediting is not 30 “The majority of \[our\] members support this proposal. We note that if submitting the GST return electronically, there should also be the ability for the taxpayer to attach further information to assist with the processing of the return and to pre-empt the IRD information requests for information (rather than having to post this information separately).” “While \[we are\] not averse to the idea of having to file GST information electronically over a certain threshold, it is difficult to make a call as to what that threshold should be given need for further information. For instance, since two-thirds of all GST-registered persons already file in this way, a threshold of say $50,000 or $75,000 might in reality make little difference to the numbers filing electronically, as at that level, the vast majority do so anyway.” “Yes.” “Turnover of 300k per year.” 31 OTHER CONCERNS Data and integrity issues There was a submission that the modernisation of the PAYE system needs to be able to address situations where no PAYE information is held about a taxpayer, for example, where the employer has not made the required deductions, or where the deductions have been made, but not passed on to Inland Revenue. An example was given of a new migrant who realised his employer was not deducting PAYE but didn’t know what to do as he did not want to lose his job or employer provided accommodation. A further example given was of a client who was dismissed without notice by his employer. His employer would not sign a declaration for Work and Income confirming his previous employment as he had been paid under the table. Compliance costs & document scope There was concerned with the short term compliance costs that will be imposed on businesses by these proposals. The submitter also submitted that the discussion document is not clear on what information will be sourced from accounting and payroll software, and cautioned that these proposals should not allow Inland Revenue unfettered access to data. Non-digital services Another common message was that some form of non-digital services must remain for those unable to use digital services. CHAPTER 8 3232
PAYE Reporting Released November 2016 Introduction The Government is modernising New Zealand’s tax system to make it simpler and more certain for New Zealanders. Improving the administration of PAYE is an integral part of this reform. Employing staff can add significant compliance costs to a business or not-for-profit organisation. The Government wants to do something about this. Increasingly employers are using payroll software to help them run their organisations. The proposals below would further integrate tax obligations, such as providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue, into employers’ own systems and processes. Meeting tax obligations would become part of the process of paying employees rather than a separate and additional activity. The proposals would make it easier to get an employee’s pay right and to quickly address issues, such as using the wrong tax code. The result would be lower compliance costs for employers and improved accuracy of deductions for employees. The proposed changes are likely to be included in a tax bill for consideration by Parliament in 2017. 1 Summary • Employers and payroll intermediaries 1 would no longer be required to file an employer monthly schedule; instead they would file PAYE information 2 on a payday basis from 1 April 2019. • Employers using payroll software would be able to file their information directly from their payroll system. • Employers would not be required to use payroll software but would have to file their PAYE information on a payday basis. • The smallest employers would still be able to file their PAYE information on paper if they choose to do so. The threshold for electronic filing of PAYE information would reduce from $100,000 a year of PAYE and Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) deductions to $50,000 a year. • The Government is not proposing to change the dates by which PAYE and related deductions have to be paid to Inland Revenue. However employers will be able to make these payments on payday if they choose to. • To improve the workability of the rules minor changes would be made from 1 April 2018 to the PAYE rules for holiday pay paid in advance and to align when rate changes come into effect. • The payroll subsidy, which subsidises employers to outsource their PAYE obligations to listed payroll intermediaries, would cease from 1 April 2018. 1 References to employers should be read as including payroll intermediaries 2 Terms in italics are included in the Glossary at the end of this document. 2 What is the purpose of these measures? The proposals are part of modernising New Zealand’s tax administration system and will use business/payroll systems to reduce compliance and administrative costs, for instance: • Filing directly from payroll software will streamline the process of providing PAYE information. Research into SME compliance costs indicates that similar reforms in GST have already contributed to a reduction in compliance costs of more than 20%. 3 • It should be possible for a new employee to fill in a single online form when they join an organisation. The payroll system could then be used to send relevant parts of the information to Inland Revenue without that information having to be obtained and entered separately. • It is acknowledged that there may be software costs and costs to change processes, but the goal is to reduce the extent to which Inland Revenue imposes separate or additional requirements on employers. Obtaining PAYE information on a payday basis will enable Inland Revenue to identify problems more quickly, for example when an employee is using two M tax codes. This will improve the accuracy of deductions and reduce the likelihood that employees will miss out on entitlements or incur debt. Payday PAYE information could also provide opportunities for government agencies to better match social assistance entitlements with periods of need, for example through shorter periods of assessment. 3 Better for Customers: SME’s compliance costs in 2016 - Inland Revenue 3 Payday filing of PAYE information Employers currently report PAYE information about their employees to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis regardless of how frequently they pay their staff. Inland Revenue’s systems and processes are being redeveloped to take advantage of modern digital technology. Under the proposed changes, the PAYE information-filing process will be integrated into the payroll software that many employers use to pay employees. Employers would then file their PAYE information each payday directly from payroll software. Employers above the electronic filing threshold, all payroll intermediaries and employers using payroll software would be required to file their PAYE information by the second working day after payday. The due date for PAYE information from other employers would be seven working days after payday. Under the proposed changes, employers would be able to file their PAYE information each payday from 1 April 2018 and would be required to do so from 1 April 2019. Example 1 Awhina manages the payroll for a firm with six employees. The firm has a high turnover of staff and frequently employs temporary staff. The firm uses payroll software to calculate the fortnightly pay for its employees. Current process: At present the payroll software Awhina uses builds up the employer monthly schedule each payday. At the end of the month she has a reminder scheduled in her diary to download the file, log into myIR and use ir-file to upload and file the information with Inland Revenue. New process: Once the payroll has been finalised each fortnight the payroll system would prompt Awhina to file the PAYE information the system has generated. She will use the payroll system to send the information directly to Inland Revenue. Awhina will file the PAYE information for the pay period as part of completing that pay run without leaving the payroll system. Awhina’s firm pays its employees by direct credit, the instructions are sent to the bank for the distribution of payment to employees on Wednesday. The due date for the firm’s PAYE information is Friday. Example 2 Graeme is the administration officer for a small firm with 12 employees; the firm is large enough to be required to file its PAYE information electronically. Graeme uses the calculators on the Inland Revenue site to work out the weekly PAYE and other deductions for staff before he finalises their pay and sends the instructions to the bank. Current process: Graeme keeps weekly printouts of PAYE and other deductions and relies on memory to add them up and file them by the 20 th of the following month. Once he has added up the totals for each employee Graeme logs into myIR and in ir-File he types the monthly totals into the online form and sends it to Inland Revenue. New process: Once Graeme has finished using the online calculator to calculate the PAYE and other deductions for the weekly pay he will be prompted to send the information to Inland Revenue. He will still need to log into Inland Revenue’s myIR to send the information but the process will be easy to use and similar to online banking. Graeme files the PAYE information each week as part of the process of paying staff. Graeme sends the instructions to the bank for the distribution of payments on Thursday and the due date for the firm’s PAYE information is the following Monday. 4 Reduction in the electronic filing threshold The electronic filing threshold for PAYE is currently $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. Employers who withhold this amount of PAYE and ESCT for a year or more, and all payroll intermediaries, have to file their PAYE information electronically. This can currently only be done through Inland Revenue’s secure website. Under the proposals, this threshold will reduce to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. As an indication, an employer with fewer than ten full-time staff on the minimum wage or four on the average wage would be below this reduced threshold. The proposals would make it possible to file PAYE information electronically from payroll software or through Inland Revenue’s secure online service. Example 4 Di manages the payroll team at a large manufacturing business which runs two different payrolls; a monthly payroll for senior executives, and a weekly payroll for employees in manufacturing, sales, design and administration. Current process: Both payrolls run through the same payroll system and produce separate schedules each month. The staff member responsible for filing employer monthly schedules downloads the completed monthly schedules from the payroll system and uploads them again, sending them at the same time to Inland Revenue using myIR and ir-file. New process: The payroll software prepares a PAYE information report each time it runs and sending the information to Inland Revenue has become part of the responsibilities of the staff that finalise each payroll. The due date for the PAYE information from each payroll is the second working day after the bank distributes the payments. Example 3 Mary runs a small café business with four part-time employees who are paid using online banking each week. Although she uses internet banking she completes a paper employer monthly schedule. She thinks her business is too small to invest in payroll software and didn’t like using my-IR and ir-File when she tried it some years ago. Current process: Mary works out the PAYE and other deductions using the tax tables and a wage book. She uses an alert on her phone to remember to calculate the monthly totals and file the information by the 20 th of the following month. Once she has added up the totals for each employee she completes the employer monthly schedule and posts it to Inland Revenue. New process: Some of Mary’s peers have invested in payroll software and are encouraging her to register for a free trial. However, if she wishes, Mary can continue to use a paper form and post it to Inland Revenue. She will however have to complete the form each payday and post it so that it arrives at Inland Revenue within seven working days. Mary sends the instructions to her bank for payment to her employees on Tuesday so she needs to post the paper PAYE information form so that it arrives with Inland Revenue on or before the Thursday of the following week. If Mary has heard that Inland Revenue’s online services have improved she could decide to try electronic filing again. After all internet banking isn’t hard and she knows she can go back to using paper if it isn’t as straightforward as expected. 5 Exemption for employers above the electronic filing threshold but unable to access digital services The proposals would allow employers who are above the electronic filing threshold but who cannot access digital services to apply for an exemption from filing their PAYE information electronically by the second working day after payday. If an exemption is granted these employers will be able to file their PAYE information on paper and it will not be due until seven working days after payday. It is envisaged that this exemption could be used by employers in locations where suitable internet services are not available and by employers who don’t use computers. Improving the processes for setting up new employees At present when an employee starts a new job they are generally required to fill in two paper forms for Inland Revenue. The forms include a substantial amount of repetition and often overlap with the information the employer collects for their own purposes. The KiwiSaver enrolment form also requires an employee’s contact details. In future it is intended that software could be used to gather the information required from new employees, and details such as a person’s name and IRD number will not need to be repeated. New employees would be required to provide their date of birth to their employer, who would provide this information to Inland Revenue to help verify the employee’s identity. In addition, all new employees, not just those eligible for enrolment in KiwiSaver, would be required to provide their contact details to Inland Revenue via their employer. Inland Revenue will encourage employers to send “new employee” information to Inland Revenue before the new employee is first paid, but this would not be a requirement. New employee information could be sent direct from the payroll system or through Inland Revenue’s improved e-services. Sending employee details before a new employee is first paid will enable Inland Revenue to automatically check the IRD number, proposed tax code and other deductions, and communicate back in near-real time if changes are necessary. For employers still using paper it is intended that the two Inland Revenue forms for new staff, the IR 330 and the KS2, will be combined into one. Example Awhina’s payroll provider has made an integrated employee information screen available for new employees. The online form includes fields for the employee’s tax code, IRD number, date of birth and contact details, and other information required by the employer. The screen identifies which information will be sent to Inland Revenue. New process: Once the information relevant to Inland Revenue is completed Awhina generally uses the payroll system to send that information to Inland Revenue before the new employee is first paid. She has found that getting their details right from the start saves time in the long run. However if the employee doesn’t complete the electronic form until the last minute she simply includes the new employee information with the payday submission of PAYE information and deals with any subsequent issues as they arise. 6 Adjustment and error correction Making adjustments to or correcting errors in PAYE information after it has been filed, is currently a largely manual process. The proposed requirement to submit PAYE information more frequently means this process will need to be more effective. Inland Revenue is using feedback from consultation to develop requirements for simpler processes which will reduce compliance costs and work for employers. Once proposals are developed wider feedback will be sought before requirements are finalised. Options include: • Defining the circumstances in which employers may correct errors in a subsequent return. • The payroll system automatically generating a schedule of adjustments as a by-product of the employer updating its own records. • Employers accessing their filed information through Inland Revenue’s secure online services and updating the lodged information. Modernising the PAYE rules To improve the workability of the PAYE rules the Government is proposing to make some changes affecting the calculation of PAYE and related deductions and contributions, with effect from 1 April 2018. Changes are proposed to the tax treatment of salary or wages paid in advance and to the application of legislated rate changes. Tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance The proposals will give employers the option to treat holiday pay paid in advance as a lump sum as if it was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates, rather than as an extra pay. If additional payments are subsequently made for a pay period to which the leave relates, employers will have to calculate PAYE based on all earnings for that period, less the PAYE already collected. This will apply to pay periods partially taken as leave and partially worked. While this new option is more precise, it could increase compliance costs for employers not using payroll software. Therefore, it will not be mandatory and employers will be able to continue to use the existing extra pay method. For consistency, salary or wages paid in advance will be treated similarly. Example After its peak season Awhina’s firm closes for three weeks in mid-February and employees are required to take leave. Current process: Employees in Awhina’s firm are paid their holiday pay in advance. Awhina calculates the holiday pay as an extra pay and because of the high earnings before the leave period employees may be overtaxed. If so they would need to file a tax return or seek a personal tax summary at the end of the year to obtain a refund. New option: Awhina can use her payroll software to calculate the PAYE for the holiday pay as if it were paid in the future periods when the employees are on holiday. When employees return to work their first pay will be for the part of the pay period they have actually worked (they were paid in advance for the part spent on annual leave). The software will calculate PAYE for this pay taking into account total earnings for the period and the PAYE already deducted. This approach eliminates the possibility of over deduction of PAYE. 7 Application of legislated rate changes Under the proposals the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied will be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products (such as KiwiSaver contributions and student loan deductions). The rates and thresholds to be applied would be those in force on the date the payment is made. Aligning the rules will simplify the transitional process for employers when a legislated rate or threshold change occurs. Payroll subsidy As part of this package of proposals the payroll subsidy will cease from 1 April 2018. Currently the Government subsidises the cost of eligible employers engaging a listed PAYE intermediary to meet the PAYE obligations on behalf of the employer. The subsidy is paid at the rate of $2 per employee, per pay run, for a maximum of five employees. Because the subsidy incentivises only one model of payroll service the payroll subsidy may distort employers’ choices between a range of different types of payroll products and services. In future these services will include significantly improved electronic services from Inland Revenue which will enable employers who do not use payroll software to calculate PAYE and other deductions and provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue. Due dates for payment of PAYE and related deductions From 1 April 2018 employers will have the option of paying their PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue on payday however they will not be required to do so. Employers with more than $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT deductions will continue to be required to pay their PAYE and other deductions twice a month, by the 5th and 20th. All other employers will continue to be required pay their PAYE and other deductions by the 20th of the following month. Legislation The proposed legislative changes will be included in the next omnibus taxation bill, which is expected to be introduced into Parliament early next year. 8 PAYE Questions and Answers 9 Small employers who do not use payroll software Q Is Government insisting that all employers use payroll software? A No, the Government is not insisting that employers use software. Other options for calculating PAYE information will still be available and the smallest employers and those without access to internet services or computers will not be required to send the information to Inland Revenue electronically. The use of accounting software to file GST has contributed to a more than 20% reduction in compliance costs recorded in the latest survey of small businesses. In the light of these results employers might want to reconsider whether or not investing in software, or using Inland Revenue’s electronic services, is worthwhile. Small Businesses Q Won’t payday filing increase compliance costs for small businesses that don’t use software? A This is unlikely. The information required is the same. The difference is when it is provided to Inland Revenue. The changes are largely about making better use of modern digital systems and evidence from GST research suggests significant compliance cost gains for small businesses from investing in software. Employers who choose not to use software already work out the PAYE information for each payday. They need it to pay their staff. Logging onto to Inland Revenue’s website or completing a paper form each payday at the end of the payroll process could be easier than putting the information aside only to come back to it at the end of the month, add it up with the other paydays in the month and then send it to Inland Revenue. Auto transmission Q Doesn’t filing automatically from software raise the risk that information will be accidentally transmitted before it is finalised or approved? A This will be no more of a risk than it is today. Nothing is going to be sent to Inland Revenue automatically. Direct from software means information will be sent much more seamlessly from within the payroll system, but the operator will know they have logged onto Inland Revenue’s system and will know that they are sending the information. More errors Q If information is sent more quickly, won’t there be more errors and adjustments? A Feedback from employers suggests the current processes are inefficient. With payday reporting it will be even more important to ensure that there are easy ways for employers to correct errors and make adjustments. An objective for those with payroll software is to automate the process. 10 Compliance costs Q Previously most employers only had one PAYE date to worry about each month, the 20 th of the following month. Now with payday reporting and payment by the 20 th don’t they have more to worry about? A Employers have always had to worry about getting things done for payday. What these proposed changes mean is that sending information to Inland Revenue can become part of that payday routine. Employers will have the option of paying Inland Revenue then too, but the Government understands that many might prefer to hold onto the deductions until the payment dates required in the current legislation. What incentives will Government offer to get employers onto the new systems Q What support and incentives will Government be offering to encourage take up of the new systems? A The best incentive is that it should be simpler for everyone concerned. There will be lots of communication and Inland Revenue will target support for customers who might have most difficulty. Will Inland Revenue provide free payroll software Q Will Inland Revenue be providing free payroll software? A No, payroll software does much more than provide information for tax purposes and it is not the Government’s intention to have Inland Revenue provide payroll software when existing providers make products and services available at a variety of price points. For employers with very simple payrolls, the PAYE calculators will still exist on Inland Revenue’s website and the website will be improved so that filing without using payroll software will be easier and more intuitive. Costs to upgrade Q Will Government subsidise the cost to upgrade payroll software? A No, the Government is not proposing to subsidise costs. Employers pay for upgraded software either through a subscription or contract fee or by paying for an upgraded version. The changes the Government is proposing will require software to be upgraded but these changes are often bundled together with upgrades the provider is making for other reasons. Employers who choose to file electronically through the Inland Revenue website will not face additional costs. 11 Dates Q Will there be enough time for employers and software developers to be ready before the new system goes live? A Enough time has been allowed for an orderly introduction. Inland Revenue will be ready to accept PAYE information on a payday basis from 1 April 2018 but under the proposals employers won’t be required by law to provide it until 1 April 2019. Support for the proposals Q Did the Government receive universal support for payday filing of PAYE information in response to the consultation document? A The response was mixed. Many employers using payroll software were supportive or supportive with some caveats, such as automated error correction. On the other hand many small employers were uncomfortable with the prospect of being required to change their existing processes and were opposed to being required to invest in payroll software – which will not be required. However, as feedback from new the GST filing insights shows, moving to digital systems should reduce compliance costs. Avoiding software problems Q There are recent examples of where Government-run software changes have caused problems. How can we be confident that this won’t happen again? A This is entirely different as Government is not proposing to build payroll software and there are no significant changes to how PAYE and other deductions are calculated and paid. The changes are largely about how and when information is provided to Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue will work closely with payroll providers to ensure success. Much of the information the Government wants to receive on a payday basis is already held by employers, but rather than being aggregated it is to be transmitted each payday. Penalties and interest Q Will payday filing increase employers’ exposure to late filing penalties? A Some submitters expressed that concern, but this is not intended. By integrating the filing of information with paying employees it is less likely that employers will forget or overlook their filing obligation. The late filing penalty will remain a monthly penalty so the maximum late filing penalty an employer could be subject to remains $250 a month. 12 Glossary PAYE information The information employers are required to provide to Inland Revenue when they make payments of PAYE income, including the information on the employer monthly schedule and the KiwiSaver 1 form. Payday basis “Payday” means the day on which an employer makes a payment of PAYE income to an employee. Instead of being aggregated across a month PAYE information will be provided each payday. The due date for PAYE information from employers above the electronic filing threshold, from payroll intermediaries and for those using payroll software, will be the second working day after payday. The due date for employers below the electronic filing threshold who do not use payroll software and for those who have an exemption from the requirement to file electronically will be seven working days after payday. PAYE and related deductions PAYE, including ACC earners levy and where relevant, student loan deductions, KiwiSaver contributions and child support payments. Electronic filing threshold The electronic filing threshold for PAYE is currently $100,000 a year of PAYE and employers superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). Employers who withhold this amount of PAYE and ESCT a year or more have to file their PAYE information electronically. This can currently only be done through Inland Revenue’s secure online service. The announcements include the reduction of this threshold to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. In future it will be possible to file PAYE information directly from payroll software or through Inland Revenue’s secure website.
