Taxation (Support for Children in Hardship) Act 2015
====================================================

Taxation (Support for Children in Hardship) Act 2015 helps children in very low income families including increasing to the base rate of the in-work tax credit.

As part of Budget 2015, the Government announced changes to help provide financial relief for children in very low income families. These changes were introduced into Parliament in the Support for Children in Hardship Bill. At the Committee of the whole house stage on 10 November 2015 the aspects relating to Revenue Acts were divided out to form the Taxation (Support for Children in Hardship) Bill. The Support for Children in Hardship Bill had also provided for a $25 per week payment to families in receipt of a main benefit under the Social Security Act, among other changes (see the Social Security Amendment Act (No 2) 2015).

The Taxation (Support for Children in Hardship) Bill was passed and granted Royal assent in December 2015. The new legislation, the Taxation (Support for Children in Hardship) Act 2015, amends the Income Tax Act 2007 to provide for an increase to the base rate of the in-work tax credit. The increase is targeted at low income working families with dependent children. It is part of a wider Budget 2015 package to provide support for families with children in hardship and to encourage families into paid work.

The new Act also increases the abatement rate for Working for Families tax credits (WfFTC) to target the increase in assistance, and the other WfFTC at low income working households. Consequential changes have been made to the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011, which sets out a timetable for future changes to the WfFTC abatement regime.

**CHANGES TO IN-WORK TAX CREDIT AND THE FAMILY CREDIT ABATEMENT RATE**

_Sections MD 10(3)(a), MD 13(3)(a) (i) and (ii) of the Income Tax Act_ 2007

The two main changes in the new Act amend sections MD 10(3)(a) and MD 13(3)(a) (i) and (ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to increase the base rate of the in-work tax credit by $12.50 a week and to increase the family credit abatement rate by 1.25%.

### Background

The in-work tax credit can be claimed by working families with dependent children as long as they are not receiving a main benefit (or Student Allowance) and are normally working either 20 hours a week or more, in the case of a sole parent, or 30 hours a week or more in total for a couple.

The base rate of the in-work tax credit is $60 per week ($3,120 per annum) for eligible working families.

The abatement rate for WfFTC, referred to as the family credit abatement rate, is 21.25 cents in the dollar. It applies when a WfFTC recipient’s family scheme income is more than $36,350 a year.

### Key features

Amendments have been made to section MD 10(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to increase the in-work tax credit base rate by $12.50 per week to $72.50 per week ($3,770 per annum). The eligibility criteria for the in-work tax credit remain the same and there is no change to the additional rate payable for families with four or more children ($780 per annum per additional child).

The increase in the in-work tax credit base rate provides some additional assistance to low-income working families not in receipt of a main benefit. The increase in the base rate helps ensure there continues to be a reasonable gap between income people can receive on a main benefit and income low and middle income families can receive from paid work.

Amendments have also been made to sections MD 13(3)(a) (i) and (ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to increase the family credit abatement rate from 21.25 cents per dollar to 22.5 cents per dollar. The increase applies to both sole parents and couples.

The increase in the abatement rate for WfFTCs aims to ensure that the $12.50 per week increase in the in-work tax credit, and the other WfFTCs, are targeted at the lowest income families likely to be experiencing hardship.

### Application dates

The increase in the in-work tax credit rate and the family credit abatement rate come into force on 1 April 2016, this means they apply for the 2016-17 and later tax years. These changes are timed to occur when the main benefit rate for families increases by $25 a week, and the minimum family tax credit (a work-related payment for very low income families) also increases by $14 a week.

### Combined impact of main changes

The combined impact of the increase in the in-work tax credit rate and the increase in the family credit abatement rate will depend on whether the family is eligible for the in-work tax credit and the level of their family scheme income. In general, those who are eligible for WfFTC and have income under $36,350 will receive an increase of $12.50 per week of work. Families with family scheme income over $36,350 and less than $88,000 will receive a smaller increase per week worked, and those with family scheme income over $88,000 will likely see a decrease in WfFTC paid. For families who do not qualify for the in-work tax credit, the increased abatement rate will reduce the amount of WfFTC they receive if their family scheme income is above $36,350.

**CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES TO THE TAXATION (ANNUAL RATES AND BUDGET MATTERS) ACT 2011**

_Sections 2(3), (4) and (5), 5, 14B of the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011_

Sections 2(3), (4) and (5), and 5 of the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011 have been amended to ensure the Budget 2011 scheduled changes to the WfFTC abatement regime are updated to include the increase to the abatement rate on 1 April 2016.

A new section 14B in the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011 has been created to ensure each time the abatement threshold is reduced as per the Budget 2011 planned changes, the schedule the Commissioner uses to estimate the amount of WfFTC to pay recipients during the year is updated.

### Background

Budget 2011 included changes to WfFTC to ensure the scheme is financially sustainable over time, with proportionally more assistance going to the most vulnerable families. The two main changes were to progressively lower the abatement-free threshold, and progressively increase the family credit abatement rate. The first small phased increase to the abatement rate and reduction to the threshold was made in 2012. Three other similar phased changes were planned to occur alongside increases to the family tax credit rate. The family tax credit rate increases when accumulated inflation reaches 5% since the prior increase. The rate change is made by Order in Council under MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The Act brings the second planned adjustment to the family credit abatement rate forward to 1 April 2016, but does not bring forward the reduction in the abatement-free threshold. As a consequence, the planned changes outlined in the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011 have been updated.

### Key features

Amendments have been made to sections 2(3), (4) and (5), and 5 of the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011 to ensure the Budget 2011 scheduled changes are updated to include the increase to the abatement rate on 1 April 2016.

The table below shows the previous and planned increases to the abatement rate and reductions to the threshold in the new Act.

|     | Previous (threshold and abatement rate) |     | Planned (threshold and abatement rate) |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 April 2015 | $36,350 | 21.25% | $36,350 | 21.25% |
| 1 April 2016 | $36,350 | 21.25% | $36,350 | 22.5% |
| Next Order in Council | $35,900 | 22.5% | $35,900 | 23.75% |
| Subsequent Order in Council | $35,450 | 23.75% | $35,450 | 25% |
| Last Order in Council | $35,000 | 25% | $35,000 | 25% |

The Act changes the timing of the phased changes, but does not change the ultimate proposal of a family credit abatement rate of 25% and abatement threshold of $35,000.

Amendments have also been made to introduce a new section 14B in the Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011, which changes the income bands in Schedule 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to reflect each planned reduction to the abatement threshold. This ensures that the Commissioner is able to correctly perform the calculation that estimates the amount of WfFTC to pay recipients as instalments during the year.

### Application date

The consequential changes came into force on 10 December 2015 (the day after the date of Royal assent) but do not apply until after 2016 when the family tax credit rate is increased by Order in Council.

Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011
===========================================================

2011 Act improves the tax administration system, abolishes gift duty, improves the tax disputes process, clarifies the tax pooling rules and more.

The Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 23 November 2010. It received its first reading on 7 December 2010, its second reading on 14 July 2011 and the third reading on 16 August 2011.

The new legislation brings into effect improvements to the tax administration system, abolishes gift duty, makes improvements to the tax disputes process and clarifies the tax pooling rules. It also reduces tax for non-residents investing through New Zealand portfolio investment entities.

Several changes to the bill were made by Supplementary Order Papers Nos 220, 254 and 263 following the bill's introduction, mainly to deal with tax issues arising from the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011.

The resulting Act received Royal assent on 29 August 2011.

The new Act amends the Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001,

Taxing multinationals in New Zealand
====================================

**03 July 2017**

Multinational companies in New Zealand are a major contributor to our tax base, paying more than $6 billion a year, which is almost 55% of the total corporate tax base.

But multinationals also present a unique set of challenges. Operating as they do in different tax jurisdictions around the world, it can be a complex matter to determine if a given company is paying the tax here that it should be.

Inland Revenue must thoroughly scrutinise company structures and supply chains to determine the amount of business activity (and the value of the activity) that is actually taking place in New Zealand - and on that basis, understand whether or not a company is meeting its obligations here.

One basic rule is always the same - taxes are levied on a company’s profits (what’s left after expenses are deducted) and not on the total revenue it turns over. Also, income tax does not apply to companies that access the New Zealand market solely via the internet, while basing their physical operations in another country.

There has been a lot of publicity given to the matter of multinational companies minimising their tax obligations in New Zealand and in other countries. Technology companies in particular have been in the media spotlight. Inland Revenue is often asked why they aren’t paying more tax, especially considering many of their products are so popular here. It’s a fair question but often, most of their business activities, are actually taking place outside New Zealand. The ability of a country to tax non-residents on business income depends largely on the extent of their presence in that country.

**An example**

Think of it like this: Gary’s Gadgets International sells a popular mobile device that New Zealanders have been buying in their droves. The company has a head office in Europe and its manufacturing base in South-East Asia. In New Zealand, Gary’s Gadgets (NZ) Ltd is a small sales operation run out of an office in New Plymouth, employing five people. It services a network of independent retailers in New Zealand that sell Gary’s devices to consumers here.

So in thinking about how Gary’s Gadgets is taxed in New Zealand, Inland Revenue is likely to determine that most of the company’s business activity and value add, is offshore so that’s where most of its tax will be paid.

Tax that Gary’s pays in New Zealand will be determined by the much smaller level of business activity actually taking place in New Zealand – that is, the Gary’s Gadgets (NZ) Ltd five-person sales operation. We shouldn’t forget, of course, that the retailers selling Gary’s devices will pay GST on those sales and income tax on their own profit margins.

**Inter-company transactions**

The sale of gadgets from the South-East Asian operation to the New Zealand distributor constitutes an inter-company transaction and this is where what’s called “transfer pricing” comes into play. Income tax needs to be paid when companies sell goods, services and other intangibles to their own subsidiaries.

Companies operating in New Zealand are invited to consult with Inland Revenue on the price for these transactions so the right amount of tax can be paid on these transfers. In our example, Gary’s Gadgets could have simplified matters by requesting an advance pricing agreement when it was transferring goods to its distributor in New Zealand to on-sell its devices. Advance pricing agreements represent a more cooperative approach to compliance where transfer prices are dealt with upfront.  Demand for these agreements has been increasing by the year as multinationals choose certainty at the start rather than ‘a knock on the door’ later.

**With a little help from our friends**

Taxing multinationals is increasingly underpinned by much more international cooperation. More and better data, supported by sharper analytics, is being exchanged between tax authorities under a variety of international instruments.

New Zealand is an active participant in the OECD’s work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and is strengthening laws in conjunction with other jurisdictions to make sure multinationals are paying the right amount of tax in all jurisdictions, not just New Zealand. We recognise that global problems require global solutions.

Taxpayer challenges Commissioner's power to enforce a guarantee
===============================================================

2005 case note - Court held that the power to receive a guarantee also included the power to collect on it - securities, debt, judicial review.

Case

Michael John Peterson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Judicial Review)

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Applicant gave the Commissioner a guarantee in respect of his company's tax debt. The company went into liquidation with the debt outstanding and Commissioner called on the applicant to honour the guarantee. The review proceedings were commenced on the grounds that Commissioner had no power to recover monies other than tax and that the guarantee fell outside the legislation. The Court held that the power to receive a guarantee also included the power to collect on it.

### Facts

The applicant was the director of a company which, after the loss of some lucrative agencies, found itself with large debt and tax arrears. The company negotiated an instalment arrangement with the department but fell behind with its payments.

In an attempt to avoid liquidation of the company, the director sought to re-negotiate another instalment arrangement. The department agreed to withdraw liquidation proceedings only if the director provided a personal guarantee in respect of the company's tax debt. At that stage the debt amounted to $76,223.20 and the applicant provided the guarantee in the form of an executed deed for that sum. Four months later the company was placed in liquidation by resolution of its shareholders. The guarantee was sought in reliance upon section 7A Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).

The department made demand for the amount outstanding under the guarantee and when it was not forthcoming, commenced proceedings in the District Court to recover the amount. The applicant then commenced these proceedings for judicial review alleging the Commissioner had acted _ultra vires_ in seeking to collect the debt.

### Decision

The applicant submitted that recovery under a guarantee is damages (relying upon the decision of the House of Lords in _Moschi v Lep Air Services Limited_ \[1972\] All ER 393) and that the Commissioner does not have the power to seek damages under the Inland Revenue Acts. He submitted also that it follows that section 7A is ineffective when it comes to the enforcement of securities as they are not taxes.

The Commissioner argued that it was irrelevant whether the security was owing as a debt or in damages as the language and intent of section 7A was clear, unambiguous and consistent with the Commissioner's section 6A duty to collect the highest net revenue over time. He also argued that, if it were necessary to determine the matter, the deed characterised the sum as debt rather than damages in _Moshi_ terms.

His Honour Justice Lang noted that their Lordships in the _Moshi_ case considered that there were two types of guarantee: the first where a guarantor undertook to assume the principal debtor's liability in the case of that person's default; and the second where the guarantor assures the creditor that the principal debtor will perform its liabilities. In this latter case the default of the debtor places the guarantor in breach of his or her contract. Thus the creditor can sue the guarantor for damages. The applicant argued that the deed in question fell into that category. His Honour said:

> "In the circumstances of this case, however, I have concluded that it does not matter whether the Commissioner's claim is characterised as one for damages or for the recovery of a debt. The real issue in either case is whether the Commissioner has the power to enforce the guarantee by instituting proceedings..."

Having reviewed both sections 6 and 7A Justice Lang said that "If the Commissioner was entitled to accept Mr Peterson's guarantee, it would seem logical that he must also be entitled to enforce it."

> "It needs to be remembered, however, that the purpose of most, if not all, securities is to secure the performance of an obligation. It does not matter whether the obligation is primarily that of the principal debtor or a guarantor who provides the security. The importance and value of the security flows from the fact that it provides the recipient with security for the performance of the obligation, regardless of the identity of the person having the primary responsibility for performing that obligation."

His Honour also said that the wording of the section was "sufficiently wide to enable the Commissioner to take security in any situation where that may be necessary to secure the performance of a taxpayer's obligations."

Justice Lang also confirmed that money collected under a guarantee or other security is collected in respect of a tax obligation in one form or other. He referred by way of analogy to the Commissioner's right to enforce other securities such as mortgages or charges. "The fruits of any judgment would then be applied in satisfaction of the tax obligation..."

He concluded:

> "I consider that the meaning of the legislation is plain. Once it has been established that the Commissioner has validly accepted a security in terms of section 7A(1)(a), it must follow that he is also entitled under section 7A(1)(e) to enforce or realise that security in any way that is open to him."

Taxpayer did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand
===============================================================

2014 case note – High Court found that Taxpayer did not have a permanent place of abode in NZ – Diamond, resident in New Zealand.

Case

Michael William Diamond v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

This was an appeal by Mr Diamond against the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") finding that he had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand and therefore was a resident in New Zealand for tax purposes for the years in dispute. The High Court on appeal found for the taxpayer and determined that he was not a resident.

### Impact of decision

This decision is the most recent authority dealing with the issues of residency and permanent place of abode. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") has appealed the decision. The Commissioner's view on the correct application of the permanent place of abode test is as set out in IS 14/01.

The Commissioner notes that the Court made some _obiter_ comments about the operation of the day-count rules in s OE1.  The Commissioner's view on the operation of those rules is as set out in IS 14/01.

### Facts

Mr Diamond ("the appellant") is a former New Zealand soldier who worked as a security contractor in Papua New Guinea and Iraq during the tax years in question (the tax years ending 31 March 2004 to 2007 inclusive). During those years, the appellant did not pay income tax on his foreign earnings.

The Commissioner assessed the disputant as a New Zealand resident under s OE 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 ("ITAs") on the basis that he had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The appellant challenged this assessment, submitting he had been (and remained) a non-resident from the date he left New Zealand (July 2003).

In 2013, the TRA held that the appellant had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand under s OE 1(1) of the ITAs and therefore was a resident in New Zealand for tax purposes for the tax years ending 31 March 2004 to 31 March 2007. The TRA also found that the appellant had adopted an unacceptable tax position. The appellant appealed that decision to the High Court.

### Decision

Clifford J stated that the TRA's approach to the issue relied on a two-stage test drawn from _Case Q55_ (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313:

*   firstly, whether the appellant had an available dwelling in New Zealand in the relevant tax years; and
*   secondly, a consideration of the appellant's other connections with New Zealand.

However, Clifford J considered _Case Q55_ to be authority only for the proposition that a person's permanent place of abode in New Zealand will not cease to have that character merely because that dwelling is rented out whilst the person is outside New Zealand. Clifford J considered _Case Q55_ proceeded from the factual matrix of that case, in that:

*   the taxpayer and his wife had lived in the dwelling prior to their departure;
*   their absence was always intended to be temporary;
*   the taxpayer and his wife had always intended to return to New Zealand and to resume residing in their home here after their absence; and
*   they retained a wide range of connections with New Zealand during their absence.

It was in that context that Judge Barber found in _Case Q55_ that despite the dwelling not being available while the taxpayer was overseas (because it was rented out), it nonetheless remained the taxpayer's permanent place of abode. Clifford J held that _Case Q55_ is not authority for the approach taken by the Commissioner or the TRA.

Clifford J then considered whether there was any other basis upon which the property might be considered the appellant's permanent place of abode in New Zealand. In doing so, his Honour looked to determine the correct interpretation of s OE 1(1) of the ITAs.

First, Clifford J considered the ordinary meaning of the words _permanent, abode, place, in_, and then the phrase as a whole; and found that the ordinary meaning of "to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand" is "to have a home in New Zealand". Given that the appellant had never lived at the property, and only rented it out to others, Clifford J found that the Property is not, in the ordinary sense of the meaning of those words, a permanent place of abode the appellant has in New Zealand.

Clifford J then proceeded to examine the purpose behind the provision, and in doing so considered the section's legislative history. He noted the "permanent place of abode" test had replaced the previous "home" test. However, he could not identify any alteration in meaning which would support the Commissioner's approach.

At \[75\] Clifford J acknowledged that the appellant did have other, and ongoing, personal connections with New Zealand. However, he considered that in the absence of the property having any of the characteristics of a permanent place of abode, those connections did not alter his conclusion.

The Court allowed the appeal, concluding there is no basis for the proposition that the appellant had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand so as to make him resident for tax purposes.

On the issue of penalties, Clifford J stated at \[76\] that due to the outcome he did not need to consider whether the appellant had adopted an unacceptable tax position, but noted that had it been necessary, he would have found in the appellant's favour.

Taxpayer entitled to discontinue a test case
============================================

2010 case note - confirms that test case challenges can be discontinued, and latter year challenges are not determined by decisions covering earlier years.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Telstra NZ Holdings Limited

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer's challenge in respect of its 2003-05 tax years was designated as a test case by the Commissioner. Shortly before trial the taxpayer discontinued its challenge, and then commenced new challenge proceedings in respect of later tax years (albeit in respect of the same alleged tax avoidance arrangement). The Commissioner applied to have the discontinuance of the first challenge set aside on the grounds that it was an abuse of process. The Court dismissed the Commissioner's application, holding that the taxpayer was entitled to take the steps they did.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that challenges designated as test cases are able to be discontinued and that challenges in respect of latter years are not determined by a decision in respect of earlier years.

### Facts

This is an interlocutory decision relating to Telstra's part in the Optional Convertible Notes (OCN) litigation. The OCN litigation involves challenges to assessments issued by the Commissioner on the grounds that OCN arrangements entered into by a number of taxpayers constituted tax avoidance.

Telstra's challenge of the assessments to its 2003-05 years was designated as a test case in the OCN litigation along with another OCN case. Other OCN challenges were stayed pending the outcome of the test cases.

Telstra's challenge was due to be heard by the High Court in Auckland from 26 October 2010. The proceedings were well advanced, and almost ready for trial, when Telstra discontinued its challenge proceedings on 3 September 2010.

On 5 October 2010 Telstra filed a second challenge to its OCN assessments, this time in respect of the 2006-08 years.

The Commissioner applied to set aside Telstra's discontinuance of the first challenge on the grounds that it was an abuse of process in circumstances where:

1.  Telstra's first challenge was a test case for other litigants, and Telstra had not objected to it being designated as such
2.  the proceedings were substantially ready for trial, and briefs of evidence had been exchanged
3.  Telstra continues to litigate the later years of the same arrangement in its second challenge.

The Commissioner also sought, in the alternative, an order for increased or indemnity costs, on the grounds that Telstra's conduct in discontinuing at the last minute had put the Commissioner to unnecessary expense.

### Decision

#### _Discontinuance_

His Honour found on the facts that there was no abuse of process by Telstra in this instance; its decision to discontinue was a commercial decision to not incur the costs of trial. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that Telstra discontinued in order to gain an improper advantage in the OCN litigation.

Further, the Commissioner was not prejudiced by the discontinuance. The Commissioner saved the costs of a trial, and will be able to use a substantial part of the evidence in defending the next OCN challenge.

His Honour noted that the discontinuance had inconvenienced the Commissioner, but said this was not sufficient to set aside the discontinuance, and that the test case regime "does not abrogate the right of a designated taxpayer to discontinue its tax challenge proceedings". His Honour went on to note that, while the second challenge raised exactly the same questions of fact and law as the first, the second challenge is a separate challenge in respect of different income years and "\[a\] previous decision, relating to a different year of income, does not determine the tax liability of a taxpayer in respect of later years of income".

#### _Costs_

His Honour held that Telstra is not liable for increased or indemnity costs as its discontinuance was not unreasonable.

Taxpayer fails in abuse of process claim
========================================

2007 case note – claim of incorrect advice given by IR officer not proven - judicial review, abuse of process, due process.

Case

Sandra Hineato Anderson v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer claimed that the Commissioner has assessed her as being liable for shortfall penalties for tax evasion due to the fact that an Inland Revenue officer had given her incorrect advice as to how to complete ten GST returns and a business cessation form. The Court found that no such advice was given and the claim of abuse of process had not been made out. Furthermore, the allegation that the Commissioner failed to follow due process in investigating his own role in relation to the completion of the GST forms and business cessation form had not been proved.

### Facts

The plaintiff taxpayer was the sole director and shareholder of a company that was registered for GST purposes. The company owned two residential properties. Following communications between an Inland Revenue Department ("IRD") employee, the taxpayer and the taxpayer's tax agent regarding outstanding GST returns for the company, the taxpayer met with an IRD employee.

At that meeting the ten outstanding GST returns were completed as "nil" returns and a _Business cessation (IR315)_ form were completed and handed to the IRD employee. The date for cessation of the business entered onto the IR315 was some eighteen months prior to the meeting and the two properties owned by the business were not listed as assets.The Company subsequently sold both properties and did not return the GST on the sales.

The Company was audited and the taxpayer was asked why the properties had not been included on the IR315 and why GST from the sale of the properties had not been included in the GST returns. The taxpayer said she had been told to backdate the company's trading cessation date by the IRD employee and could only "plead ignorance".

The Commissioner issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") to the taxpayer, including a shortfall penalty for tax evasion in respect of incorrectly completing the GST returns as nil returns and for incorrect completion of the business cessation form. The NOPA was sent to both the taxpayer and her tax agent. A Notice of Response ("NOR") was received out of the statutory response period.

### Decision

The Court dismissed the application for Judicial Review.

The Court made findings of fact in favour of the Commissioner to the effect that the IRD employee had not told the taxpayer how to complete the IR315 and that the taxpayer was the only person who had knowledge of the status of the (sale of) the properties. He also noted other evidence to the effect that the taxpayer had been aware of the obligation to return the GST from the sales of the properties.

The Court held that there was nothing said or done by the IRD employee that could be characterised as an abuse of process or unfairness.

The Court held further that the NOPA detailed the investigation undertaken by the Commissioner and noted that the allegation that the Commissioner had failedto follow due process in investigating his own role in relation to the completion of the GST form and the IR315 was not made out on the facts.

The Court held in the alternative, if it was incorrect in its conclusions and there was some apparent basis for intervention, that the circumstances of the case did not involve "exceptional circumstances" as required for judicial review in tax cases.

Taxpayer fails in attempt to re-litigate claim
==============================================

2010 case note - reaffirms that an application for a review of a judgment of an Associate Judge by a High Court Judge will need to be based on sound merits.

Case

Clarence John Faloon and Ors v CIR

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The taxpayer had a claim in the High Court struck out due to having previously failed in the Court on the same issue. An attempt to have the strike-out reviewed failed.

### Impact of decision

The decision is a reminder of the need to follow court rules and guidelines. It reaffirms that an application for a review of a judgment of an Associate Judge by a High Court Judge will need to be based on sound merits. Absent these merits, the Court will not lightly allow matters to be revisited under the guise of procedural mechanisms.

### Facts

Mr Faloon's father was the director of two companies, Trade Lines Limited and Central Equipment Company Limited, which are in liquidation.

Mr Faloon claimed that there is compensation owing on assets which were once owned by the companies. The compensation relates to a pipe diversion of a stream by the Palmerston North City Council and the taking of land by the Crown for airport extensions. He also claimed that he should be compensated for loss of patent rights which were owned by one of the companies.

On 29 April 2010, at the High Court in Rotorua, Associate Judge Christiansen found against Mr Faloon and struck out his claim against the Commissioner. The claim related to attempts of Mr Faloon to have the Commissioner assess income to a trust he had established. The income was allegedly from compensation he claimed was due to the trust but it related to the land owned by the companies. Compensation had already been received by the companies which have since been liquidated.

The claim was struck out because Mr Faloon had previously been unsuccessful when litigating the same issue against the Commissioner.

Mr Faloon applied on 3 May 2010 for an "Interlocutory application for orders to set aside the judgment delivered on 29 April 2010 which does not comply with the High Court Rules". On 6 May 2010, he made an "Amended Interlocutory Application by three Plaintiffs under rule 2.3 to review all the orders or decisions made by His Honour Associate Judge Christiansen".

Mr Faloon did not comply with Rule 2.3(2) of the High Court Rules which specified that an application for review of the decision of an Associate Judge must be **filed and served** within five working days of the decision being given.

### Decision

Justice Woodhouse firstly considered the 3 May application. He concluded that the matter was at an end principally because the issue had been dealt with by Associate Judge Christiansen. In addition he was satisfied that the application did not raise any issue distinct from an issue that might be raised on an application for review of, or appeal against, Associate Judge Christiansen's decision (paragraphs \[5\] and \[6\]).

It was noted that service did not take place until 28 May 2010. Justice Woodhouse said an extension of time may be granted if "the delay was not extensive, there was an adequate explanation for the delay, there is no material prejudice to the other party and there is merit in the application".

Justice Woodhouse then found that "there was no adequate explanation for the delay". He also noted that there was "no merit in the application". Furthermore, he saw the decision of Associate Judge Christiansen as a "careful judgment providing compelling reason for the judgment to be struck out" (paragraph \[11\]).

Justice Woodhouse considered that Mr Faloon was attempting to re-litigate matters which have been before the High Court and Court of Appeal in different forms over a number of years and accordingly His Honour did not allow an extension of time.

The matter is no longer a live issue before the court, costs of $750 were awarded to the Commissioner.

Taxpayer found to have honestly relied on Inland Revenue forms
==============================================================

2013 case note - Court concluded that taxpayer honestly relied on the IR330 forms when he stopped deducting withholding tax.

Case

Lim v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979

### Summary

The Court concluded that Mr Lim honestly relied on the IR330 forms when he stopped deducting withholding tax.

### Facts

The disputant, Chye Heng Lim ("Mr Lim"), operated a partnership ("the partnership") with a Ms Sia running a painting and decorating business. On 31 March 2005, the partnership business was taken over by K L Decorators Limited ("the company"). The company was owned by Mr Lim and his wife, Foong Ling Lim ("Mrs Lim").

The business involved entering into contracts to paint houses. The work would then be completed by subcontractors who either supplied labour only or labour as well as materials. The majority of subcontractors were labour and materials subcontractors.

The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 ("the regulations") specified that "payments for work done or services done under contracts or arrangements which are wholly or substantially for the supply of labour …" were subject to withholding tax.

In March 2000, Inland Revenue issued a tax declaration form being an IR330 form ("the 2000 IR330") which listed the categories of persons in respect of whom withholding payments must be deducted including "labour only contracts in the building industry".

Mrs Lim took primary responsibility for the tax affairs of the partnership and company although she had access to independent tax agents.

For the years ending 31 March 2001 and 2002, the partnership complied with the regulations and paid the full amount of withholding tax owing. In 2003, the partnership stopped deducting withholding payments from all of its subcontractors and only deducted a portion of the amount owing to Inland Revenue. The partnership and later company failed to make deductions for the 2004-2007 tax years. The company started making deductions again in 2008.

In January 2003, Inland Revenue issued another IR330 form which was materially identical to the 2000 IR330.

In January 2006, Inland Revenue issued another IR330 form. The new form said that "contracts wholly or substantially for labour only in the building industry" were to be subject to withholding tax.

In 2006, the Commissioner began an audit of the partnership's tax affairs. During this audit, two records relate to the alleged reliance on the IR330:

1.  In notes of an interview in October 2007 between Inland Revenue and the Lims, Mrs Lim mentioned an IR330 and also stated that if the subcontractors provided their own materials she did not have to deduct withholding tax.
2.  A note of a meeting with a tax advisor recording "no w/h tax from subbies. IR330 believes not just labour".

Mr Lim signed agreed adjustments in 8 April 2009 for the tax in dispute. He then began to negotiate with Inland Revenue to settle the debt for a lesser sum. During these debt proceedings, both his local MP and his barrister wrote to the Commissioner explaining that they had relied on the 2000 IR330.

On 21 July 2011 Inland Revenue issued a bankruptcy notice against Mr Lim.

Mr Lim commenced court proceedings against the Commissioner. These proceedings initially contained seven causes of action however, both parties agreed to limit the issue to a question of fact. The parties agreed that if the Court was satisfied Mr Lim relied honestly on the IR330's when he decided not to deduct withholding tax, the Commissioner would set aside the outstanding debt and penalty payments.

### Decision

Collins J found that the Lims did act honestly when they relied on the IR330s for the following reasons:

1.  While Mr and Mrs Lim had given various accounts about relying on the IR330s, this did not undermine their credibility as, considering the amount of time that had passed, it was understandable why there were some inconsistencies. Contemporaneous evidence also supported their claim.
2.  Mr and Mrs Lim raised their reliance on the IR330s as early as October 2007 undermining any suggestion that any reliance was a recent invention.
3.  It is logically more likely that the Lims did rely on the IR330s by interpreting the forms in a way which was objectively logical, especially considering they did not have a sophisticated knowledge of New Zealand tax law. They also changed their business practice when they received clear and competent advice about the significance of their error.

Although Collins J considered that there was an advantage to the Lims in not deducting withholding tax, he did not consider this enough to outweigh the other factors. His Honour concluded that Mr Lim honestly relied on the IR330 forms when he stopped deducting withholding tax.

The issue of costs was reserved.

Do you disagree with an assessment we've made?

Or would you like to make a change to your tax return?

Please tell us.

If you haven’t been able to reach agreement with us, you need to follow the disputes process.

Don't worry. It's not complicated. Most people can do the paperwork themselves.

Though we do recommend you contact a professional tax advisor if you need help, or your dispute is complex.

To get the disputes process rolling, you need to send us a Notice of proposed adjustment within the time limit shown on the form.

If we agree with your Notice of proposed adjustment, we'll issue a new assessment.

If we disagree, we'll send you a Notice of response, setting out the reasons for our decision.

If you agree with our Notice of response, the disputes process ends here.

If you disagree, please tell us – in writing – within two months.

In Step 4, we get together to discuss the dispute in person, or over the phone.

We'll offer to provide an independent facilitator. This person will be a senior Inland Revenue staff member with no previous involvement in the dispute.

If we reach an agreement at the conference, we'll issue a new assessment.

If we don't agree, you have a choice. You can move to Step 5, or ask us for agreement to go straight to Step 9, the final step in the disputes process.

At Step 5, we'll ask you to complete a Statement of position.

Please send us your completed Statement of position within two months.

We'll respond with our own Statement of position.

If no agreement is reached, we move to Step 8.

Our independent experts in our Disputes Review Unit will take a fresh look at the case and make a decision about your dispute. This costs you nothing.

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in your favour, we'll issue a new assessment.

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in our favour, you may decide to take your case to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court.

One final point. Please keep to the time limits. This is important. Under the law, if you miss a deadline, you may have to accept our decision.

All time limits are clearly shown on the forms you need to fill out.

Taxpayer loses procedural point
===============================

2007 case note – calculation of statutory time frame begins on receipt of points of objection notice by Litigation Management Unit, not wider IR.

Case

Decision 11/2007

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998

### Summary

The calculation of the time frame for filing a case stated with the TRA commences when a points of objection notice is received by the Director Litigation Management Unit and not by its receipt by the wider Inland Revenue Department.

### Facts

These proceedings were instituted by the Case Stated procedure on 20 May 2002.

In these proceedings the objector has claimed that the Commissioner failed to file a Case Stated within the statutory time period.

A points of notice ("PON") was posted by the Objector on 15 February 2002, addressed to _"Senior Appeals Officer" Inland Revenue Dept, P O Box 2198, Wellington_. The objector took it that items posted in the normal course of business deemed to have been delivered the day following posting. The Objector therefore took it that it would have been received on Monday 18 February 2002.

The Objector claimed that 63 days had elapsed between the date of receipt by the Inland Revenue Department ("IRD") on 18 February and the filing date on 21 May 2002 therefore, according to the objector the Case Stated was filed three days late. The Commissioner filed an application for an extension of time (to protect its position) for a further working day. The Objector opposed this application, on the grounds that the letter and PON were addressed in the manner required and therefore deemed to have been received by the Respondent on 18February 2002. The Objector also made reference to the Tax Administration Act ("TAA") and the need to treat an Objector fairly and impartially and to take account ss.4, 5 and 6 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

The PON which was posted by the Objector on 15February 2002 was not received by the Litigation Management Unit until 1 March 2002. It appeared to have been received by another part of IRD (Processing Centre in Upper Hutt) on 20 February 2002. The Commissioner filed the Case Stated on 21 May 2002 which was well within the 60 day time frame. Counsel for the Commissioner argued that service of the PON must be on the Commissioner by personally delivering the document to the Director, Litigation Management, Freyberg Building, Aitken Street, Wellington.

### Decision

Regulation 23(a) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 requires an objector to serve the Commissioner with the PON, by personally delivering the document to the _Director, Litigation Management, P O Box 2198, Wellington_. The Objector chose not to personally deliver or courier the PON but instead chose to post it. It did not reach Litigation Management until 1 March 2002 and at law, service of the PON was not achieved by the Objector until 1 March 2002 and therefore the 60-day period for the respondent to file a case stated commenced from that date and expired on 29May 2002. The Case Stated was filed on 21 May 2002 and so was well within the time.

Judge Barber relied on Regulation 23 in this ruling. He noted that s 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s 27 of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 could not help the Objector in any substantive way. Section 6 of the TAA requires the IRD to protect the integrity of the tax system, including, _inter alia_, to be fair, impartial and administer according to law.

The application for an order to allow the objection was refused on the above grounds.

The Judge stated that if receipt by the Processing Centre at Upper Hutt was determinative (in this case it's not), so that the Commissioner would have filed the case stated one day or so late, the application for an extension of time pursuant to reg.25 (2) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 on the basis that he was satisfied there were exceptional circumstances for the Commissioner's failure to file the case in time would have been granted.

Taxpayer must issue NOPA to "Default" assessment
================================================

2005 case note - to dispute a 'default' assessment a taxpayer must issue a NOPA and file the missing return within the two month response period.

Case

Donald Eugene Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

To dispute a "default" assessment a taxpayer must issue a NOPA and file the missing return within the two month response period.

### Facts

The taxpayer failed to file tax returns for the 2000 and 2001 years. On 8 April 2002, the Commissioner issued "default assessments" under section 106 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). A notice of claim challenging the default assessments was filed by the taxpayer on 15 July 2002 in the TRA. To bring proceedings under section 138B of the TAA the taxpayer also filed an application under section 138D of the TAA to commence proceedings outside the response period. On 31 July 2002 the taxpayer filed nil income tax returns for the 2000 and 2001 years. Doubting it was necessary to give the TRA jurisdiction to hear the challenge the Taxpayer also filed a "without prejudice" Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA"). The NOPA contained a request under s 89K of the TAA effectively requesting that the Commissioner accept the NOPA even though it was filed out of time. The Commissioner declined the request on 23 September 2002 and issued a conditional Notice of Response ("NOR") on 30 September 2002 advising the NOPA was rejected as being out of time as well as invalid and the tax assessed in the assessment made on 8 April 2002 was owed.

On 16 September 2002 in the TRA the Commissioner filed a Notice of Defence and an application to strike out the taxpayer's Notice of Claim. In February and March 2003 the Commissioner's strike-out application was heard by the TRA. The TRA declined the application on 19 May 2003. The present judicial review proceedings were then commenced in the High Court by the Commissioner.

### Decision

After discussing the three possible interpretations put forward, the Court accepted the interpretation put forward by the Commissioner. That is:

> "
> 
> 1.  A default assessment under section 106 is not to be treated differently from any other kind of assessment for the purposes of Part 4A and Part 8A. Accordingly, there is no basis to construe section 89D as displacing the normal requirement for a taxpayer who wishes to contest an assessment to do so by way of a NOPA and this must be done within the applicable response period: section 89D(5). That is a prerequisite to the entitlement to challenge an assessment by commencing proceedings in the TRA for the purposes of section 138B(3).
> 2.  The only difference in the process for challenging a default assessment from the process which applies to other assessments is the requirement in section 89D(2) that the taxpayer must furnish a tax return for the assessment period. However, that provision does not provide for the tax return to be the method of disputing the default assessment. Rather, it is a requirement which must be met before the taxpayer may issue a NOPA under section 89D(1). That is why section 89D(1) is expressed to be subject to section 89D(2).
> 3.  If a taxpayer wishing to challenge a default assessment has not issued a NOPA in respect of the default assessment under section 89D(1) within the applicable response period in accordance with section 89D(5), which the taxpayer cannot do until he or she has furnished a return of income for the assessment period under section 89D(2), then that taxpayer will not have met the requirements of section 138B(3) and will not therefore be entitled to challenge the default assessment by commencing proceedings in the TRA.
> 4.  If a taxpayer has commenced proceedings in the TRA without complying with section 138B(3), in the circumstances of the present case, the Commissioner may apply to have the challenge commenced by the taxpayer struck out under section 138H and the TRA should strike the proceedings out because of the failure to comply with section 138B.
> 
> "

The Court also agreed that section 89D(1) of the TAA is expressed in permissive terms ("may") because there is no obligation on a taxpayer to challenge a "default" assessment. However, once the taxpayer decides to assert his or her entitlement to challenge the assessment, then he or she must do so in accordance with the process outlined in Part IVA.

Taxpayer only able to challenge whether Commissioner's opinion that return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading was honestly held
=================================================================================================================================

2015 case note – taxpayer's partially successful challenge in relation to 'insurance payments' - time bar, fraudulent or wilfully misleading, honestly held opinion.

Case

TRA010/14 \[2015\] NZTRA 09

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxpayers filed returns claiming deductions for payments described as being insurance payments to a captive insurance company. They subsequently accepted that they were not entitled to the deductions and sought to reverse the "insurance payments" in later years, not in the years the deductions were claimed. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") formed the opinion that the original returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading and, accordingly, she was not time-barred from reassessing the years when the deductions were claimed. The Commissioner also assessed evasion shortfall penalties. The taxpayers unsuccessfully challenged the time-bar issue but successfully challenged the evasion shortfall penalty.

### Impact

The impacts of the decision are as follows:

1.  A taxpayer cannot challenge the correctness of the Commissioner's opinion formed under s 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") that a return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading and the Hearing Authority may not substitute its own opinion for that of the Commissioner.
2.  A taxpayer may only challenge whether, objectively, the Commissioner honestly held the opinion that the return was fraudulent or wilfully misleading.
3.  Knowledge and intention that the tax returns are wrong, or being reckless as to whether or not the returns are wrong, can be sufficient to meet the fraudulent or wilfully misleading test in s 108(2) of the TAA.

### Facts

The first disputant, Mr AB, is a farmer and businessman. During the relevant period, Mr AB together with his two brothers, held shares in the second disputant, XY Construction Limited ("XYCL"). XYCL was in the business of construction and mining.

The three brothers were also, during the relevant period, in a farming partnership ("XY Partnership").

Sometime in 2004, Mr AB became interested in setting up a self-insurance scheme to provide cover to XY Partnership and XYCL as he was concerned about the increasing cost of insurance they were paying.

Mr AB discussed his proposal with his accountants ("ZK Accountants") who in turn obtained specialist tax advice on the issue.

The tax advice was that, provided the Captive Insurance Company is a genuine general insurance company and in fact can show that it is bearing genuine insurance risk itself, the insurance premium should be deductible. The tax advice also included that the Captive Insurance Company would need to comply with general insurance practices, including the payment of a $500,000 insurance bond to the Insurance Authorities.

An Australian company, CQ Construction Pty Ltd ("CQ Construction"), which was controlled by the brothers, was intended to serve as the Captive Insurance Company.

CQ Construction was not, however, in a position to pay the required $500,000 insurance bond.

It was decided that XY Partnership and XYCL were to immediately start paying premiums by way of promissory notes to the intended Captive Insurance Company (insurance payments) and to register CQ Construction as an insurer once XY Partnership and XYCL were in a position to pay the insurance bond. Mr AB also gave evidence of his intention to change the company name of CQ Construction to CQ Insurers Pty Ltd, although he never got around to doing so.

Between 2004 and 2008, XY Partnership and XYCL claimed deductions in their income tax returns for the insurance payments. ZK Accountants prepared the accounts and tax returns, only questioning whether the promissory notes had been signed but without enquiring into whether the recipient of the promissory notes had in fact been duly registered as an insurer. Evidence was given by the Accountant that she did not believe that issue to be relevant and that she had advised the disputants that they were entitled to the deductions. In hindsight, she accepted that this advice was "possibly incorrect".

For commercial and other reasons, it was ultimately decided in late 2008/early 2009 not to proceed with the registration of CQ Construction as an insurer. ZK accountants advised that the "insurance payments" claimed as deductions would now need to be reversed. This advice was acted upon in the 2008 and 2009 income tax returns.

Following a GST audit in April 2010, it was decided to widen the investigation to include XY Partnership's and XYCL's income tax returns.

The investigator's requests between November 2010 and June 2011 for the disputants to provide information and documents relating to the insurance scheme were not complied with. Eventually in February 2012 the investigator met with the disputants and was told about the intention to set up a self-insurance scheme through an Australian company, but for financial reasons had decided not to proceed as it involved payment of $500,000 to the Federal Government. Mr AB also confirmed that there were no documents relating to the proposed insurance scheme.

Following the meeting, the investigator prepared a memorandum to the departmental officer with the requisite delegate authority to reopen the time-barred income tax assessments under s 108(2)(a) of the TAA on grounds that the returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading and involved an income equalisation scheme.

The Commissioner in later documents considered that the captive insurance arrangements did not amount to such a scheme, but based on other facts set out in the memorandum decided to proceed with opening the time bar and issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment.

The disputants accepted that the deductions were wrongfully made and they were not entitled to them, but challenged the Commissioner's decision under s 108(2)(a) of the TAA to open the time bar for amending the assessments.

### Decision

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") acknowledged that s 108(2)(a) of the TAA requires the Commissioner to do nothing more than form an opinion that a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading. An opinion is not a concluded state of mind and is not formed as part of an adjudicative process or necessarily with full knowledge of the facts.

#### _Ability to challenge the correctness of the Commissioner's opinion_

The disputants argued in reliance on _C of IR v Legarth_ (\[1969\] NZLR 137 (CA)) that the TRA or High Court must form its own view of whether the returns are fraudulent or wilfully misleading.

The TRA did not accept the disputants' line of reasoning which had been considered in _Vinelight Nominees Limited v C of IR_ (HC Auckland CIV 2005-404-2774, 22 July 2005), _Vinelight Nominees Limited v C of IR_ _(No 2)_ ((2005) 22 NZTC 19,519) and confirmed in _Auckland Institute of Studies Limited v C of IR_ (\[2002\] 20 NZTC 17,685).

These cases set out that the TAA provides for two distinct steps as part of the reassessment process. First, the need for the Commissioner to form an opinion, and second, for the Commissioner to reassess. It is only the second part of this process which can be challenged in substance.

It is clear that the taxpayer cannot challenge the correctness of the Commissioner's opinion (that the returns were fraudulent or misleading) and the Hearing Authority (the TRA or High Court) may not substitute its own opinion for that of the Commissioner. A taxpayer may only challenge whether the Commissioner honestly held the opinion and the principal issue in this case is whether on the basis of the information available to her, it was reasonably open to the Commissioner to come to the opinions that she did.

#### _Was it reasonably open to the Commissioner to come to her opinions?_

The TRA discussed the definitions of fraudulent or wilfully misleading and held that having the knowledge and intention that the returns are wrong or being reckless as to whether or not they are wrong is sufficient to meet the "fraudulent or wilfully misleading" test under s 108(2) of the TAA. The Commissioner was required to form an opinion of the disputants' state of mind when filing the returns on the basis of the evidence before her.

The TRA rejected submissions from the disputant that relevant information had been ignored and that due regard had not been had to the fact that the disputants voluntarily reversed the deductions claimed prior to any audit notification.

It was also argued by the disputants that when the Commissioner rejected the notion of the income equalisation scheme, there was no longer any basis on which to contend that the disputants had been fraudulent or wilfully misleading. This argument was rejected by the TRA which held that the Commissioner was entitled to form the view she did on the basis of the remaining facts in the memorandum.

Based on the evidence before the Commissioner, the TRA held that the Commissioner's opinion had been both honest and reasonably open to her.

#### _Shortfall penalties under s 141E of the TAA or s 141C of the TAA_

Under s141E(1)(a) of the TAA, the Commissioner can impose 150% shortfall penalties if the taxpayer evades the assessment or payment of tax.

The TRA held that the required state of mind for an "evasive intent" is a subjective test of whether the taxpayer had knowledge that the act or omission intended was wrong or acted deliberately or recklessly as to whether or not it was wrong. The TRA held that the Commissioner had not discharged the onus of proving that Mr AB on a subjective assessment did have the required evasive intent.

Instead, the TRA was satisfied that the disputants' actions amounted to gross carelessness under s 141C(1) of the TAA and that the shortfall penalty should accordingly be assessed as 40%. The test under this section is an objective one and given what Mr AB had been advised by the tax specialist, he should reasonably have made inquiries to check that the absence of a proper structure being put in place did not prevent the disputants from claiming the deductions.

Taxpayer's attempt to consolidate two separate proceedings fails
================================================================

2011 case note - taxpayer unsuccessfully sought to consolidate two separate proceedings, a tax matter and an attempt to recover funds from a third party.

Case

Yandina Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The taxpayer sought to consolidate (into a single hearing) two separate matters, a tax matter and the taxpayer's attempt to recover funds from a third party. The High Court declined to order the consolidation.

### Impact of decision

Both the earlier joinder application and this consolidation application could have made tax litigation more difficult as, if successful, taxpayers could delay tax cases by adding other parties to the case (or by consolidating separate cases). This result avoids this risk of delay.

### Facts

This was an application by the taxpayer to consolidate two separate trials into a single hearing under High Court Rule 10.12, these being a:

1.  challenge to the tax assessment for the 1997-1998 tax years. The assessments removed deductions and losses attributed to an alleged tax avoidance arrangement entered into by the taxpayers;
2.  claim in equity ("the equity case") against ANZ, Westpac and BNZ ("the Banks"). The case related to an assignment of a right to income by a partnership of the Banks to Yandina (itself in partnership with another entity). Yandina alleged that the Banks had failed to pay it the full amount of income arising under the assignment of the right to income.

For the 1996, 1997 and 1998 tax years the Banks advised Yandina partnership that the total income was $83 million, being the combination of cash and non-cash income. Yandina partnership filed tax returns stating the $83 million as income. The returns included tax losses and deductions, and had the effect of no tax payable.

In 2002, the Commissioner issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment to the Yandina partnership for the 1996 and 1997 tax years. This led to three decisions by the Commissioner on 26 September 2003 for the 1996, 1997 and 1998 tax years. These decisions disallowed the losses and deductions claimed on the basis of a tax avoidance arrangement.

On 23 December 2010, the taxpayer commenced the equity case against the Banks. The taxpayer alleged that the failure of the Banks to pay $72 million of income meant that the taxpayer could not pay its tax liabilities.

The taxpayer alleges that both proceedings (the tax case and the equity case) spring from the same facts and that the same issues arise in both cases. Consequently he claimed that both cases should be heard together. The taxpayer had previously sought to add the Banks to the tax case (called a joinder). However, the attempt to join was rejected by the High Court (CIV 2006-485-1228 HC Wellington, 20 December 2010, McKenzie J).

### Decision

Justice Mallon declined to exercise the discretion at HCR 10.12 to consolidate the two cases.

The Judge identified two principal grounds that the taxpayer had relied upon in its application.

#### _The Banks were potentially affected by the tax case_

1.  The taxpayer argued that the income was assessable to the Banks (who were part of a wider tax avoidance arrangement) and not the taxpayer so the Banks should be heard in the tax case.
2.  The Judge rejected this saying that "it is difficult to see that Yandina could be prevented from raising whatever arguments it seeks to make in respect of the Commissioner's assessments of it, even if they involve the Banks who are not represented at the \[tax\] hearing".
3.  The Judge recognised this as an attempt to achieve the joinder as previously rejected.

#### _The equity case was relevant to the tax case_

1.  The taxpayer argued that success in the equity case meant it could no longer oppose the tax case as it would be entitled to the income assessed to it and should pay the tax.
2.  Again the Judge recognised this had been raised and rejected the joinder application.
3.  The Judge said that "the assessment of tax and recovery of a debt by the taxpayer as against a third party are separate matters. As the Commissioner submits, to allow the two separate matters to be joined in this case has potential ramifications in other cases. Tax assessments in other cases could be challenged and then delayed by the taxpayer's pursuit of another claim."

In addition the Judge considered the possibility of different decisions on common issues. His Honour held that ordering the proceedings to be heard at the same time will not alter the taxpayers' position. The consequence of the tax case for the Banks is irrelevant to the taxpayers' position in its equity claim.

Taxpayer's section 89M(11) application dismissed
================================================

2013 case note – the Tax Administration Act does not allow a taxpayer a right of reply to the CIR's Statement of Position in a taxpayer-initiated dispute.

Case

Faloon v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer applied to the High Court for leave to bring an Originating Application, for more time to reply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") Statement of Position ("SOP") under section 89M(11) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The High Court declined the application. Ronald Young J agreed with the Commissioner's position that there was no right of reply to the Commissioner's SOP in a taxpayer-initiated dispute.

### Impact of decision

This judgment confirms that section 89M(11) of the TAA does not allow a taxpayer a right of reply to the Commissioner's SOP in a taxpayer-initiated dispute.

### Facts

Mr Faloon ("the taxpayer") filed two interlocutory applications. The first was an application for leave to bring an Originating Application (Rule 19.5 High Court Rules ) pursuant to section 89M (11) of the TAA, for more time to reply to the Commissioner's SOP. The second was to set aside the Commissioner's Notice of Opposition and a supporting affidavit.

The taxpayer had filed income tax returns returning income that he believes he is entitled to. The taxpayer is of the view that he is due compensation for land that was compulsorily acquired from a company that his (now-deceased) father was shareholder and director of. The Commissioner reassessed the taxpayer without issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") under 89C(f) of the TAA. The taxpayer then issued a NOPA and commenced the disputes resolution process. The Commissioner responded to the NOPA with a Notice of Response. The taxpayer then issued an SOP, which was followed by the Commissioner's SOP. The taxpayer then applied to the High Court for more time to reply to the Commissioner's SOP.

The taxpayer also applied to have the Commissioner's Notice of Opposition set aside on the basis that it did not comply with rule 5.44 of the High Court Rules (in that it did not include a memorandum setting out the name of the solicitor acting and address for service), and for the affidavit filed in support of the Commissioner's Notice of Opposition to be set aside on the basis that it contained statements that were inadmissible under the Evidence Act 2006.

### Decision

Ronald Young J dismissed the taxpayer's applications. His Honour held that ordinarily, the Originating Application procedure would be suited to a section 89M(11) application. However, section 89M(11) of the TAA did not apply where a taxpayer had initiated the dispute process.

His Honour agreed with the Commissioner's position that there was no right of reply to the Commissioner's SOP in a taxpayer-initiated dispute. His Honour stated it would be "a nonsense" to allow an application under section 89M(11) of the TAA when there was no right of reply to the Commissioner's SOP.

The Court also found that the technical failure of the Commissioner's Notice of Opposition was of no prejudice to the taxpayer and the non-compliance with the High Court Rules was of no lasting concern, therefore the Notice of Opposition should not be set aside. The Court further held that the statements in the Commissioner's supporting affidavit were not inadmissible as hearsay evidence (contrary to the Evidence Act 2006) because they were made in the context of the investigator providing her background knowledge into the taxpayer's affairs rather than being adduced to prove the truth of the statements.

Taxpayer seeks nullification of a company amalgamation
======================================================

2005 case note - taxpayer unsuccessful in application to nullify company amalgamation therefore has 'lost' substantial tax losses - loss of shareholder continuity.

Case

Selectrix Management Limited v The Registrar of Companies and The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Companies Act 1955

### Summary

The taxpayer was unsuccessful in its application to nullify a company amalgamation and as a result has "lost" substantial tax losses.

### Facts

The plaintiff company and Kororia Services Limited (KSL) were companies whose director was Mr Jon Rivers Lamb. In March 1996 the plaintiff had accumulated tax losses available to it in excess of $5.6 million. KSL was not trading and was not otherwise used by Mr Lamb. Mr Lamb was advised by his accountants of an easy way to "get rid of" an unwanted company by amalgamation. Mr Lamb instructed the accountants to go ahead with the intention of dispensing with KSL.

The accountants prepared documentation for the short-form amalgamation of the plaintiff and KSL. Mr Lamb executed the documents as director of both the plaintiff and KSL. These documents were lodged with the Registrar of Companies (first defendant).

On 28 March 1996 the Registrar of Companies issued a Certificate of Amalgamation under section 209F of the Companies Act 1955 (the Act applicable to the companies at the relevant time). As a consequence KSL was deemed to be dissolved and struck off the Companies Registry.

Subsequently, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue investigated the plaintiff's tax affairs. The plaintiff had claimed accrued tax losses based on the accumulated losses. The CIR disallowed the plaintiff's claim for those accrued tax losses on the grounds that the amalgamation of the plaintiff and KSL broke the necessary shareholder continuity.

The plaintiffs sought declarations that:

*   The amalgamation was a nullity and of no legal effect;
*   The Certificate of Amalgamation be withdrawn;
*   KSL be reinstated to the Register of Companies.

### Decision

#### Issue 1

The plaintiff argued that the plaintiff and KSL were not able to use the short-form amalgamation as a matter of law and therefore the amalgamation was a nullity or of no effect.

For the plaintiff to use the short-form amalgamation they needed the companies to be directly or indirectly owned by the same, third company. In the present case the shareholders in the plaintiff were Mr Lamb and Fermata Holdings Limited. In the case of KSL the shareholders were the two Lamb family trusts. The amalgamating companies were not owned by the same company, neither was owned by a company at all.

The plaintiff argued that the long-form amalgamation process should have been followed. That process required certain conditions to be satisfied and that these conditions were not satisfied, therefore the amalgamation was a nullity.

The Judge found:

The amalgamation was effected by the issue of the Certificate of Amalgamation and therefore the issue was whether the Registrar's actions rather than the actions of the company were a nullity.

The Judge also found that the necessary conditions to amalgamate had been met and that the actions of the Registrar in accepting the amalgamation documents were correct, therefore the Registrar's actions were not a nullity. Therefore the issue of the Certificate of Amalgamation was not a nullity.

The Judge concluded that the documents presented to the Registrar did not have defect, such that the Registrar should have been put on enquiry, and that there was no basis for the declaration that the amalgamation was a nullity, void and of no effect as sought by the pleadings.

#### Issue 2

The plaintiff argued that if the amalgamation was not a nullity, the Registrar's decision to issue the amalgamation certificate is in any event amenable to review.

Section 209 F of the Companies Act 1955 states that the Registrar must, after receipt of documents required under section 209E issue a Certificate of Amalgamation. The issue was whether there were documents presented to the Registrar as required by section 209E. If there were then _prima facie_ the Registrar had no discretion and was bound to issue the certificate which completed the process.

The Judge did not accept that the defects in the documentation presented to the Registrar were such as to prevent registration. The Registrar was not required to be satisfied as to the underlying facts behind the documents presented to him or to form a view in respect of them.

In the absence of a defect in the process adopted by the Registrar, the Certificate of Amalgamation once issued by the Registrar is effective. In this case there was nothing illegal or defective in the action of the Registrar in issuing the certificate. _Prima facie_ the issue of the certificate is not amenable to review.

The Judge then considered that in the exercise of the Court's discretion should the decision be set aside on Judicial Review? The Court took many things into consideration including the prejudice to other parties. It was found that the Commissioner would be affected by the decision to set aside the decision, the Judge also pointed out the significant time period of nine years since the effective amalgamation.

The Judge concluded that he did not consider that there was a basis to review the first defendant's decision in the case. The plaintiff's application was dismissed.

The Judge indicated that perhaps the appropriate remedy for the Plaintiff was against its accountants.

Taxpayer successfully opposes Commissioner's application to adduce new evidence
===============================================================================

2006 case note – CIR unsuccessful in attempt to adduce new evidence - evidence exclusion rule.

Case

TRA003/003 Decision Number 7/2006

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner was unsuccessful in his attempt, under section 138G(2) TAA, to adduce new evidence which section 138G(1) excluded.

### Facts

This ruling is about the admission of evidence.

The Commissioner had assessed the Disputant for the income previously accounted for in partnership returns for the period 1996 to 2005. At the time of the dispute and making the resultant assessments, the partner companies of the partnership were thought to have not filed tax returns of their own.

The partner companies filed tax returns after the issue of the Commissioner's Statement of Position to the Disputant. It also was discovered that for the tax years 1998 and 1999 one of the partner companies had filed returns prior to the issue of the Commissioner's Statement of Position.

The Commissioner applied to raise new evidence in challenge proceedings pursuant to sestion 138G(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act).

The grounds on which the Commissioner pleaded in the application were:

*   At the time of delivery of the Commissioner's Statement of Position and Disclosure Notice dated 6 July 2001, the Commissioner could not have, with due diligence, discovered that evidence.
*   Apart from the tax returns, which were lodged with the Inland Revenue Department on 27 March 2001, all returns were filed well after 6 July 2001.
*   Such evidence was relevant to the issues in the challenge proceedings and having regard to the provisions of section 89A of the Act and the conduct of the parties, the admission of this evidence is necessary to avoid injustice to the defendant and the disputant.

A Notice of Opposition was filed by the Disputant on the grounds that:

*   The returns for the 1998 and 1999 years were filed prior to the date of the Commissioner's Statement of Position and so are not new facts and evidence, the Commissioner had these documents and could have discovered them by simply referring to the file;
*   Any details required from the tax returns could be confirmed in the Statement of Agreed Facts;
*   Tax returns of the entities were not relevant to the disputant's assessments;
*   The quantum of the partnership's income could be amended if the Commissioner chose to change his claim because it was different to those returns for those years;
*   There is no nexus between the partnership's returns and the returns and assessments in the challenge proceedings; and
*   The additional years requested do not meet the statutory criteria and are not relevant.

### Decision

Judge Barber accepted there were three essential matters to consider when faced with an application under section 138G(2):

1.  The evidence to be introduced must be evidence of a type described in the Commissioner's Statement of Position;
2.  That the evidence could not have been, with due diligence discovered prior to the issue of the Statement of Position; and
3.  Having regard to section 89A and the parties, that admission is necessary to avoid a manifest injustice.

The Judge agreed with the disputant that for the partner company which filed its 1998 and 1999 returns before the issue of the Commissioner's Statement of Position those returns could not be regarded as new facts and evidence \[para 62\].

The Judge also agreed (though reserved the right to change his mind when the substantive case had commenced) that the material sought to be admitted is so relevant that its exclusion would result in a manifest injustice, though it is possibly seen as helpful and has some relevance for the substantive case \[para 63 to 64\].

The judge noted his wide powers to ensure the assessments are correct \[par 66\]. Another factor that was important was the Disputant's opposition to the adducing of the evidence (even though it benefited the Disputant), suggesting it was not manifestly unjust not to exclude it \[para 64\].

In this instance it was not considered appropriate to admit the evidence under section 138G(2).

Judge Barber went on to discuss the case in general terms and against the background of certain template litigation raising his concerns with both parties' position \[para 71 to 76\]. He expressed dissatisfaction with the current proceedings saying “this matter cries out for a negotiated settlement of a unique problem” \[at para 77\] and inviting the parties to consider a Judicial Settlement Conference prior to the matter proceeding any further \[para 78 to 80\].

Taxpayer unsuccessful in appealing TRA decision on Russell template
===================================================================

2005 case note - taxpayer unsuccessful in appealing decision regarding the Russell template for tax avoidance - res judicata, issue estoppel.

Case

N T H Douglas v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976

### Summary

The taxpayer was unsuccessful in appealing the TRA's decision regarding the Russell template for tax avoidance.

### Facts

This is a Russell template-related matter. It is an appeal from Case T59 and Case V2.

### Decision

The taxpayers were part of the Russell template which has been found to be a tax avoidance arrangement in **Miller** (1998) 18 NZTC 13,961 and **O'Neil** (2001) NZTC 17,051. Despite an attempt to distinguish this arrangement from the template Courtney J found insufficient difference to justify a different treatment of these taxpayers. \[41\]

The Commissioner argued that the case was subject to _res judicata_ through _issue estoppel_ as the Russell template was the same for all issuers and because Mr Russell was the common factor (as agent) for all litigants. The effect of this is to preclude any argument regarding the characterisation of the template. Her Honour concluded that while these litigants were not parties to the earlier cases there was a public interest in preventing case after case advancing the same arguments. Accordingly, emphasis was placed upon the identical nature of the template and Mr Russell's role in it and the earlier litigation to conclude that _res judicata_ did apply. \[42-61\]

Her Honour rejected a submission that the fact the taxpayers did not know the scope of the arrangement was relevant \[62-65\] and one that the earlier decisions were in judicial review and not tax objections meant _res judicata_ could not apply. \[62-70\].

The taxpayers next argued the Commissioner's assessments were unintelligible (submission broken down into five subparts). Her Honour considered whether or not this was the case was a factual inquiry \[76\] but judged objectively the assessments were in fact intelligible and none of the five grounds of unintelligibility advanced by the taxpayers applied. \[76-117\]

In response to the taxpayers' submission that the introduction of a Track C assessment rendered the Track B assessments (the subject of the appeal) incorrect Her Honour concluded that the **BASF** principle (see (1995) 17 NZTC 12,136) would render the Track C assessment invalid to the extent they re-opened any issue being determined as part of Track B. \[118-125\]

Her Honour declined to address an argument regarding the exhaustion of the Commissioner's discretion under section 99(3) as it was not within the ambit of the TRA case and therefore not properly part of the appeal. \[126-127\]

The taxpayers' reiterated unsuccessful submissions regarding a named officer of Inland Revenue giving evidence made in a judicial review (see **Wire Supplies** CP 526/SD99). These were unsuccessful here. \[128-132\]

The taxpayers sought access to legal opinions by two departmental solicitors on the basis the privilege had been waived when these were referred to in internal memos. However, Her Honour considered that the officers preparing the internal memos probably did not consider the prospect of those reports being part of litigation so there was no waiver of the privilege:

> "I do not consider that the reference in a discoverable document to a privileged document is sufficient to amount to a waiver of the privileged document". \[133-151\]

The TRA had observed that a funding charge for interest-free funding by Russell entities to the taxpayers would be an allowable deduction but, for lack of evidence did not allow one. This was not changed on appeal where there was still no evidence more than the "speculative" to justify any such a deduction. \[152-159\] A similar result was given on the issue of apportioning the administrative charge the taxpayers had failed to discharge the burden of proof on them. \[160-174\]

The taxpayers accepted they could not directly challenge the time bar \[175\] but sought to challenge the officer's re-opening the time bar as not evidenced appropriately (the Commissioner relied upon certificates of re-opening). Her Honour was satisfied the certificates were sufficient. \[181\]

Taxpayer unsuccessful in application for order allowing purported objections
============================================================================

2014 case note - application for order allowing purported objections unsuccessful - notice of determination of loss, points of objection notice, validity.

Case

TRA 011/13; \[2014\] NZTRA 01

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994

### Summary

The applicant sought an order from the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") directing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to allow purported late objections. The TRA held that the objections were not made in accordance with the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and declined to make the order sought. The TRA also held that the administrative law arguments raised by the applicant did not alter this conclusion.

### Impact of decision

The case relates to the old objection procedure.

### Facts

The applicant (a car dealer operator until 1993), having ceased trading and having no funds to pay outstanding pay as you earn ("PAYE"), was put into liquidation in September 1994 and the Official Assignee was appointed liquidator.

Having conducted an investigation of the applicant's tax affairs and ascertained discrepancies, the Commissioner wrote to the Official Assignee on 14 August 1995 enclosing a notice of determination of loss ("NODL") for the 1991 to 1994 tax years. Each NODL was addressed to the Official Assignee and included the applicant's IRD number. It was also made clear that any objection was to be made within two months.

On 26 October 1995, the Commissioner wrote another letter (with the applicant's name and IRD number recorded) to the Official Assignee with an NODL for the 1995 tax year attached to it. The time by which any objection was to be filed was not specified on the NODL as the form read "Any objection … must … be delivered … within \[gap\] month from the date of this notice".

The Official Assignee did not give any notice of objection to the Commissioner in accordance with section 126 of the TAA in relation to the NODLs issued for the 1991 to 1995 income tax years.

The applicant's tax returns for the 1991 to 1995 years had been filed by Mr X. In August 1996 the Commissioner wrote informing Mr X that he was not recognised as the applicant's tax agent.

The applicant was struck off in May 1996 and re-registered in July 1997.

On 19 December 1997, the Commissioner sent copies of the NODLs for the 1991 to 1995 years to Mr X as he requested. Having received the copies, Mr X wrote two letters to the Commissioner, one raising concerns over the validity (the validity letter) of the NODLs and the other purporting to give notice of objection to the NODLs (the fresh objection letter). The Commissioner, on 14 January 1998, wrote to Mr X acknowledging receipt of the validity letter and stating that the points raised were not accepted.

On 6 March 1998, Mr X wrote to the Commissioner asking her to clarify her position in respect of the "alleged invalid NODLs". The Commissioner replied on 18 March 1998 stating that the late objection letter would not be considered until a determination was made as to whether Mr X was authorised to file a late objection.

In April 1998, a Points of Objection Notice was served on the Commissioner in relation to the 1991 to 1994 years. The Commissioner did not respond to this Points of Objection Notice and did not state a case to the TRA. No Points of Objection Notice was received in respect of the 1995 year.

The applicant was again put into liquidation in June 1998, and remained in liquidation until it was struck off in May 2005. Mr X was purportedly appointed as receiver of the applicant in May 2005, but as the applicant was struck off, the notice of appointment was returned to Mr X. The applicant was subsequently re-registered in October 2010, and the notice of appointment of receiver was filed shortly afterwards.

In 2010 the Commissioner began an investigation into the applicant's tax affairs. Having been advised by the Commissioner in 2013 that the assessments for the 1991 to 1995 years were final, the applicant filed an application pursuant to regulation 6(4) of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 ("Regulations") for an order directing the Commissioner to allow the purported objections.

### Decision

#### _Validity of NODLs_

In determining the validity of the NODLs, the TRA considered a number of arguments raised by the applicant, such as the applicant's name not being on the NODLs, the NODLs being sent to the Official Assignee, and issues regarding the date for lodgement of the objections.

The TRA did not find the absence of the applicant's name on the NODLs to be an issue affecting their validity, as the NODLs recorded the applicant's IRD number, and were sent under cover of letters recording the name of the applicant and the applicant's IRD number. There was therefore no uncertainty as to the identity of the taxpayer and the subject of each NODL.

The TRA also rejected the applicant's submission that the NODLs ought to have been sent to Mr X, noting that on liquidation the address for service for the applicant became the office of the Official Assignee and that the NODLs were properly given to the Official Assignee. The TRA distinguished the case of _Case U45_ (2000) 19 NZTC 9,397 relied on by the applicant, and referred to _Case R15_ (1994) 16 NZTC 6,087, where the TRA held that from the date of liquidation it was not competent for any person other than the liquidator to lodge an objection to assessments of taxation liability in years prior to the date of commencement of the liquidation.

The TRA then considered the issue regarding the date for lodgement of objections. The TRA noted that no notice of objection was given for the NODLs for the 1991 to 1994 income tax years within the timeframe specified, being two months from the date of the NODL. The NODLs for these years were held to be valid and enforceable.

As to the NODL for the 1995 tax year, the TRA referred to section 126(1) of the TAA where it is intended that a time period will be specified in the NODL. The TRA stated that there is a need for certainty as to the time frame to ensure that a taxpayer's objection rights are not prejudiced and it is not sufficient for the TRA to simply imply a reasonable time period and then fix what that period should be. In the TRA's view the NODL was not properly completed by the Commissioner, and it was therefore invalid and of no legal effect.

#### _Purported late objections_

The TRA considered that the copies of the NODLs sent to Mr X on 19 December 1997 following Mr X's request did not amount to the fresh service of those NODLs and the commencement of a new objection period. The purported late objections were not accepted by the Commissioner as late objections under section 126(2) of the TAA. It was clear from the Commissioner's letter of 18 March 1998 that the fresh objection letter would not be considered as to whether it could be accepted as late objections to the NODLs until the issue of Mr X's authorisation was cleared up.

The TRA concluded that the application could not succeed as the objections were not made in accordance with section 126(1) of the TAA and were not accepted by the Commissioner under section 126(2). However, the TRA went on to address the remaining arguments raised by the applicant.

#### _Case stated_

The applicant argued that the purported objections had to be considered relying on section 127(1) of the TAA, which provides "The Commissioner shall consider all such objections …".

The TRA rejected this argument as the word "such" refers back to objections in accordance with section 126 of the TAA.

The TRA also rejected the applicant's argument that the purported objections were considered and disallowed by the Commissioner in accordance with section 127 of the TAA. The applicant referred to the Commissioner's letter of 14 January 1998 in that regard. The TRA agreed with the Commissioner that the letter was not in response to the purported objections. The TRA noted that under section 134 of the TAA, the Commissioner must consider the objection and reach a decision before the case can go before the TRA, and that there is no time limit imposed in consideration of an objection (relying on _FB Duvall Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,866 (CA), at \[29\]).

The TRA found that as there was no objection to be heard, the Points of Objection Notice relating to the 1991 to 1994 years was of no effect and the Commissioner was not required to state a case to the TRA for those years. As the NODL for the 1995 year was invalid and the Points of Objection Notice did not refer to that year, the Commissioner was never required to state a case in relation to that year.

#### _Vendetta, improper motive, section 6 of the TAA and section 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 ("BORA")_

In relation to the applicant's allegation that the Commissioner's actions were governed by improper motives as part of a vendetta against Mr X, the TRA applied the approach of the Court of Appeal in _Dandelion Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] 1 NZLR 600 (CA). In that case it was held that the TRA's role was one concerned with the correctness of the assessment, and it did not extend to conducting a broad-based judicial review of the process leading up to assessment and disallowance of the objection and subsequent conduct of the proceeding.

The TRA also rejected the applicant's allegation that the Commissioner was in breach of section 6 of the TAA and section 27 of the BORA. The TRA found that the procedures were followed properly and that natural justice did not require the Commissioner to state a case.

Taxpayer wins film investment cases
===================================

2005 case note - taxpayer successful before the Privy Council in arguing the CIR could not apply the anti-avoidance provisions to investment in two film projects.

Case

Peterson v CIR

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976

### Summary

The taxpayer was successful before the Privy Council in arguing that the Commissioner could not apply the anti-avoidance provisions to his investment in two film projects (the investments being made in the 1980s).

### Facts

These were cases taken by the taxpayer in relation to two film investments made in the 1980s. The films were "Lie of the Land" and "Utu". In both cases the Commissioner concluded that the expenses of the films were inflated by means of non-recourse loans and circular funding. This increased the depreciation deduction apparently available to the taxpayer but for which there was no actual liability as the circular funding at already repaid the loans. The Commissioner disallowed the depreciation deduction to the extent of the inflated expenses.

The taxpayer objected and the cases were heard at the TRA. The taxpayer won one and the Commissioner the other. Both TRA decisions were appealed to the High Court where the taxpayer won one again and the Commissioner the other (see (2002) 20 NZTC 17,583 and 17,761). Both decisions were appealed to the Court of Appeal where the Commissioner won both ((2003) 21 NZTC 18,060 and 18,069).

The taxpayer appealed to the Privy Council.

The main issue was the proper application of section 99 ITA 1976 to the taxpayer. The taxpayer argued that there was no tax avoidance by him and as he was not part of the "meeting of minds" necessary for an arrangement under section 99 (the test from _BNZI_ \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450) then section 99 could not be applied to him. Further, it was argued that the taxpayer entered a fixed-price contract and this was the cost to him of the investment regardless of what consequently occurred outside his knowledge.

The Commissioner argued that section 99 could be applied to the taxpayer as there was a tax avoidance arrangement which also met the _BNZI_ test even though the taxpayer was not one of those involved in the necessary "meeting of minds" and he was a "person affected by that arrangement" (per section 99(3)). The Commissioner also placed weight upon the phrase "whether or not any person affected by that arrangement is a party thereto" (at section 99(2)).

### Decision

In a split decision the taxpayer was successful (split 3-2 in the taxpayer's favour).

### Majority decision

The majority accepted the existence of an "arrangement" in this case and considered it was entirely at the CIR's option to identify the whole or any part of a composite scheme as the "arrangement".

The majority did not accept the taxpayer's argument that he needed to be a party or participant to an arrangement to be effected by it:

> \[34\] Their Lordships are satisfied that the "arrangement" which the Commissioner has identified had the purpose or effect of reducing the investors' liability to tax and that, whether or not they were parties to the arrangement or the relevant part or parts of it, they were affected by it. Their Lordships do not consider that the "arrangement" requires a consensus or meeting of minds; the taxpayer need not be a party to "the arrangement" and in their view he need not be privy to its details either. On this point they respectfully prefer the dissenting judgment of Thomas J. in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v BNZ Investments Ltd (supra)_. Moreover the investors did not merely obtain an economic advantage from the "arrangement" (as in that case); they obtained a tax advantage, viz. a depreciation allowance which reduced their liability to pay tax.

This approach was expressly endorsed by the minority judgment as well (at par \[93\]).

However, the "critical question" identified by the majority was whether the tax advantage was obtained by tax avoidance and thus within sec 99 (now sec BG1).

The majority considered that the taxpayers are entitled to depreciate the full acquisition costs regardless of how much the film actually cost to make as the CIR did not challenge the apparent acquisition cost of actual cost of the film plus the non-recourse lending. The focus is on the cost to the person acquiring the asset rather than the person disposing of it and what they did with the purchase price (in this case repay the non recourse lending but not discharge the investors' apparent liability under the loan):

\[42\]....If the Commissioner had shown that the features on which he relied, singly or in combination, had the effect that the investors, while purporting to incur a liability to pay $x+y to acquire the film, had not suffered the economic burden of such expenditure before tax which Parliament intended to qualify them for a depreciation allowance, then he could invoke section 99 to disallow the deduction.

\[43\] This, however, the Commissioner never succeeded in doing. The inflation of the costs of making the film meant that the production company made a secret profit at the investors' expense; but it did not alter the fact that they incurred a liability to pay $x+y to the production company in accordance with the contract to acquire the film. The costs of making the film were incurred by the production company, and these must not be confused with the costs incurred by the investors, which were the relevant costs in respect of which the deduction was claimed. The fact that the production company made a profit of $y at the expense of the investors did not mean that they did not suffer the economic cost of paying it.

The majority then pointed to a factor that may have enabled the Commissioner to be successful: if there had been a finding of fact at the TRA that the lending was un-commercial \[Para 48\]. It was also suggested that had the CIR argued that to the extent of the non‑recourse lending was repaid by the production company, the taxpayer did not purchase a film but paid for the acquisition of a loan. This would not have been deductible as part of the cost of acquiring a film \[Para 49 to 51\].

### The minority

The minority considered that this was a tax avoidance arrangement.

While accepting the "meeting of minds" test found in BNZI the minority recognised:

> \[59\]... But, nonetheless, it is clear from sub-section (2) that the tax advantage vulnerable to being nullified under sub-section (3) may be a tax advantage enjoyed by someone who is not part of that consensus, not "... a party thereto".
> 
> \[89\]... sub-section (2) says, in terms, that the arrangement "shall be absolutely void as against the Commissioner ... whether or not any person affected by the arrangement is a party thereto". The fact that the investors were not parties to the arrangement cannot be enough to allow them to escape section 99. Any other conclusion would involve a judicial rewriting of section 99(2).
> 
> \[92\]... To hold that the apparent ignorance of the investors excuses them from vulnerability to the statutory avoidance measures provided by section 99 would be, in our opinion, to emasculate the section.

The minority focused on (and endorsed) the twin pillars of statutory interpretation: statutory scheme and purpose (as found in the Challenge case). Applying the scheme and purpose approach to the facts of the case the minority concluded:

> \[91\]...The statutory right to depreciate an item of cost and to deduct the amount of the depreciation from assessable income is plainly a tax advantage. Whether it is a tax advantage vulnerable to attack under section 99 depends, in our opinion, on whether it is within the purpose of the statutory regime. We cannot believe that if the cost of acquisition of a film is inflated for no commercial reason other than that of qualifying for a higher tax deduction than would otherwise be available the amount of the inflation could be regarded as the sort of cost that the statutory regime was intended to assist or encourage. In any event, in the present case the amount of each non-recourse loan was not presented to the investors as a premium on the cost of production that they had to pay. It was presented to them on the basis that the amount was needed for the cost of production and that it would qualify for depreciation as part of the cost of production. The non-recourse loan was, in fact, nothing of the sort but was no more than a device to produce a higher capital sum to be depreciated and, thereby, a higher tax deduction. Moreover the amounts represented by the non-recourse loans were not received by the respective production companies as premiums that had to be paid as part of the investors' acquisition costs. They were not recorded in their books as having been received at all.

Taxpayers get a smarter and fairer system
=========================================

**02 May 2019**

One of the biggest IT projects ever undertaken in the state sector has successfully passed its latest hurdle with the transition of more than 19.7 million taxpayer accounts from one Inland Revenue computer system to another.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash is congratulating staff and the external agencies, including banks and ICT companies, who worked on the project known as Business Transformation Release 3.

“We are committed to ensuring our tax system is fair. That also requires us to ensure it is administered fairly through Inland Revenue’s own processes”, Mr Nash says.

“The department had to close its call centre and online presence over the Easter and ANZAC break to enable it to happen. A lot could have gone wrong. But instead, everything appears to have gone right.

“Every single taxpayer account for Income Tax and Working for Families was migrated from the legacy computer system to the new system, known as START. It involved a mind-boggling number of transactions and processes.

“The system went live on Friday and has been tested in the real-world environment over the past few days. For example, this week it processed $33 million in Working for Families payments for 161,000 customers.

“The new system will continue to be tested in the coming weeks and extra staff have been brought in to handle customer questions. It is still early days and there are likely to be bumps along the way. However, IR assures me it has plans in place and will be ready to respond.

“The short-term inconvenience to customers while they get used to the new system is more than offset by the significance of the changes. Every taxpayer affected will now have their account managed in a smarter, fairer and more efficient way.

“Too many people have been paying the wrong secondary tax. IR’s technology will now be smart enough to spot if someone is overpaying tax and help them correct it with a tailored tax code. It will make a big difference for those with more than one job or an irregular income.

“It also allows for automatic tax assessments. From late-May to mid-July, salary and wage earners will find out if they have a refund owing or a bill to pay. About 1.65 million customers will be told they have a refund.

“If this year is anything like 2018, an estimated $860 million will be refunded straight into people’s bank accounts.

“Around 330,000 families receiving Working for Families support will receive more accurate payments during the year. This means they get the assistance when they need it and have less chance of a debt to repay at the end of the year.

“All tax revenue is now administered in the new system, after GST, withholding taxes, fringe benefit taxes and others were migrated in the past two years. Other systems administered by IR, including student loans, KiwiSaver and child support, will be migrated in the next two years.

Mr Nash says the Business Transformation Release 3 project has involved the biggest changes to the tax system in two decades:

*   Two million customers were contacted in advance
*   3,600 staff received special training
*   92,300 tests were completed beforehand
*   19.7 million accounts were migrated to the new system
*   Records of 100 million transactions were migrated
*   8.3 million web account logons were updated
*   More than 1,100 separate tasks were completed to cut-over the systems
*   A core team of 271 people worked over the holiday weekend with support from a further 50 people for distinct processes
*   A  significant volume of pizza and chocolate was consumed by the team involved

Taxpayers' second judicial review successful
============================================

2008 case note - Decision confirms that the CIR whenever possible must follow the directions given by the Court in judicial review proceedings.

Case

Chesterfields Preschools Limited and Ors v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

The Commissioner was found to have failed to apply the orders made in earlier judicial review proceedings and was ordered to comply with the earlier orders.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that the Commissioner whenever possible must follow the directions given by the Court in judicial review proceedings

### Facts

This judicial review was of the Commissioner's application of the taxpayers' earlier judicial review (reported at (2007) 23 NZTC 21,125).

In that decision the Judge ordered:

1.  Reconsider the application for re-registration of Anolbe, treating the application as having been made on 27 March 2000 (on the basis it would have been completed formally had there been an appropriate reaction from the Commissioner's staff on receipt of the letter).
2.  Consider the legitimacy of all the Anolbe GST returns, including those filed on 27 March 2000 and any other unresolved refund claims by other plaintiffs. The time ban provisions shall not apply.
3.  Apply such refunds as are upheld to best fiscal advantage to the plaintiffs.
4.  Make a decision under section 182 of the TAA, as preserved by Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act, section 103, treating the historic correspondence and meetings from and with Mr Hampton as substantive requests for remission, in respect of all the plaintiffs, received before 23 September 1997, and in so doing recognise that Mr Hampton was led to believe that the GST input claims he was lodging would be considered and decisions made upon them and refunds lodged to the best advantage of the plaintiffs.
5.  Make a decision under section 183A, as to remission in respect of the period that has elapsed while this litigation has been proceeding.
6.  The Commissioner may, in the usual way, continue to exercise his general powers under section 6 and 6A of the TAA, without derogating from the benefits that would accrue to the taxpayers by reason of the reconsideration of the foregoing matters.

The Commissioner, in a decision to address the orders outlined above (the Budhia decision), addressed each of these orders in turn and made decisions under each heading. The taxpayers argued the Commissioner had failed to apply the orders and commenced a second judicial review. The Commissioner argued that he had fully complied with the orders made.

### Decision

The Judge considered the Commissioner had failed in every particular to apply his earlier order saying:

> \[90\] The Commissioner's officers were in breach of section 4(6) of the J\[udicature\] A\[mendment\] A\[ct\] by not having regard to the Court's reasons for giving the directions, and erroneously construing those directions. Non-compliance pervaded the analysis and decision making that went to the Commissioner's purported compliance with the directions.  
> ....  
> \[92\] In respect of the December judgment paragraph \[155\] is intended to encapsulate the consequence of a large number of earlier findings but is not itself to be read as capturing all the reasons. To the extent that the IRD officers did use the reasoning in the December judgment, it was selective.
> 
> \[93\] Accordingly, the appropriate relief in this case is to redirect the Commissioner back to the December judgment. That judgment has not been qualified in any way by this judgment. This judgment is to be understood as identifying errors of the Commissioner purporting to carry out the directions of that judgment, and, as part of that exercise, it does contain further elaboration/interpretation of the December judgment. Accordingly, the reasons of this judgment also bind the Commissioner and must be taken into account in giving effect to the directions. The Commissioner is directed to begin again the task of discharging the duties imposed on him by the December judgment.

The Judge awarded costs against the Commissioner. Further submissions are to be made on this point.

Facts | Meka 1. The Taxpayer is an individual who registered for GST because they were starting a new video production business. During the periods in dispute, the Taxpayer returned expenses relating to the cost of various electronic equipment and some accommodation costs and claimed input tax deductions, but did not return any income or output tax, resulting in a refund position. 2. Customer & Compliance Services, Inland Revenue (CCS) argued that the Taxpayer has not been carrying on a taxable activity. CCS considered any activity that was carried on by the Taxpayer was insufficiently continuous or regular to constitute a taxable activity and was merely commencement activity only, which does not itself amount to a taxable activity.

The main issue considered in this dispute was whether the Taxpayer has been carrying on a taxable activity. 4. There was also a preliminary issue on the onus and standard of proof. Decisions | Whakatau 5. The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) decided that the Taxpayer has taken steps towards establishing a taxable activity, but was not yet carrying on a taxable activity, having not yet moved beyond preparatory work. Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Preliminary issue | Take tōmua: Onus and standard of proof 6. The onus of proof in civil proceedings 1 is on the taxpayer, except for shortfall penalties for evasion or similar act, or obstruction. 2 The taxpayer must prove that an assessment is wrong, why it is wrong, and by how much it is wrong. 3 7. The standard of proof in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities. 4 This standard is met if it is proved that a matter is “more likely than not”. 5 TCO applied a similar standard to considering the issue in this dispute, given the Taxpayer’s ability to challenge any subsequent assessments that are made in civil proceedings. Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Taxable activity 8. The issue is whether the Taxpayer has been carrying on a taxable activity. If the Taxpayer has yet to commence a taxable activity, as CCS argued, the Taxpayer is not 1 Challenge proceedings (ie, the proceedings that would follow if this dispute proceeds to the Taxation Review Authority or a court) are civil proceedings. 2 Section 149A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 3 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA); Beckham v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 22,066 (CA). 4 Section 149A(1) of the TAA; Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA); Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,493 (HC); Case X16 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,216; Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028. 5 Miller v Minister of Pensions \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, 374.

Section 20 provides for the deduction of input tax from output tax, but only to the extent the goods or services to which the input tax relates are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. 10. “Taxable supply” is defined in s 2 to mean a supply of goods and services in New Zealand that is charged with tax under s 8. Section 8 imposes GST on supplies of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the registered person. 6 Therefore, to make taxable supplies, a person must be carrying on a taxable activity. 11. There are four requirements that must be satisfied to show there is a taxable activity under s 6(1)(a): ▪ There must be an activity. 7 ▪ The activity must be carried on continuously or regularly by a person. 8 ▪ The activity must involve, or be intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person. 9 ▪ The supply or intended supply must be made for a consideration. 10 6 See Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 at 3,235. 7 Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC) at 11,233, CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA) at 14,078, and Case 14/2016 \[2016\] NZTRA 14, (2016) 27 NZTC 3-036 at \[63\]. 8 CIR v Newman (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA) at 12,100; Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 277 at 278; Premier Automatic Ticket Issues Ltd v FCT (1933) 50 CLR 268 (HCA) at 298; Case 14/2016 at \[67\]-\[68\]; Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC) at 13,185-13,186; Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 at 3,238- 3,239; Allen Yacht Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270 (HC) at 11,274; Case P20 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,136 at 4,147; Tout & Anor v Cook (1991) 13 NZTC 8,053 (HC). 9 Definition of “supply” in s 5(1); Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) at 6,223; Pacific Trawling Ltd v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Fisheries (2005) 22 NZTC 19,204 (HC); Case S77 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,483; Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391; Case N27 at 3,239-3,238; Case 14/2016 at \[69\]. 10 Definition of “consideration” in s 2(1); CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) at 13,193; Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636 (HC); Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA) at \[61\]; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC) at 13,150; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA) at \[18\] and \[30\].

Section 6(2) provides that anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. 13. The case law on the relevance of a beginning of a taxable activity confirms that s 6(2) adds anything done in connection with the beginning of a taxable activity to the taxable activity but does not create one where one would otherwise not exist. Section 6(2) merely adds the commencement activity to the taxable activity. By itself, it cannot amount to a taxable activity. 11 14. TCO concluded that the Taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity, and therefore, was not entitled to the input tax deductions claimed for these reasons: ▪ The Taxpayer has undertaken activities that could constitute an activity for the purposes of the s 6 definition of “taxable activity”. However, it was clear that the Taxpayer has not been carrying on a taxable activity during the periods in dispute. While the Taxpayer has taken steps to establish their video production business, they have yet to achieve that enterprise. The steps taken by the Taxpayer, which included the purchase of set up equipment and producing sample work to demonstrate their skills, were preparatory and had not yet gone beyond the development work for a taxable activity. ▪ While s 6(2) deems the inclusion of commencement (and termination) activity into the course of a taxable activity, the Taxpayer has not yet established any taxable activity. The case law is clear that commencement work can only be added to such an activity, and by itself, cannot amount to a taxable activity. ▪ In terms of the definition in s 6(1), the Taxpayer’s preparatory work in itself was not an activity that involves, or intends to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. In any event, the activity of the Taxpayer has not commenced to the necessary degree to be either continuous or regular to comprise a taxable activity. 15. The Commissioner may cancel a person’s GST registration if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is not carrying on a taxable activity (s 52(5)). The cancellation may be retrospective to the date the person was GST registered if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person did not carry on any taxable activity from that date (s 52(5A)). As the Taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity, the Commissioner is entitled to cancel the Taxpayer’s GST registration from the date of registration. 11 Case 14/2016 at \[72\] and \[96\]; Case P73 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,489 at 4,493 to 4,494.

Taxation laws | Ture tāke All legislative references are to Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) unless otherwise stated. Facts | Meka 1.The Applicant is a New Zealand based company that develops, manufactures and sells a range of products (the Applicant). As a manufacturer, the Applicant is subject to safety legislation and other regulatory requirements from New Zealand and the export markets that it supplies. As part of this framework, the Applicant is sometimes required to have a specific regulatory registration to allow it to manufacture and export products to or for its customers. 2.The Applicant has a number of registratons with an overseas regulator in respect of products it manufactures for a customer (referred to as a commercial supply agreement). The ruling is in respect of these particular registrations. 3.The Applicant incurs expenses to renew these regulatory registrations and implement new regulatory standards. These expenses would include staff labour, product testing (both in-house and third-party external testing), engagement with third party consultants and write-off of trial products (the registration costs). The relevant regulatory registrations are expected to last for a term of five years but may be subject to earlier renewal for a change in the standards or in the product specification. Issues | Take 4.The main issues considered in this ruling were: whether the registration costs are deductible under s DA 1; whether s DA 2(1) applies to deny a deduction for the registration costs. Decisions | Whakatau 5.Based on the specific facts of this ruling application, the Tax Counsel Office (TCO) decided that the registration costs for the particular registrations: TDS 23/09 | 20 June 2023 Page 3 of 6 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] are deductible under s DA 1; and section DA 2(1) does not apply to deny the deduction. Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: General permission (s DA 1) 6.Section DA 1 provides for the general permission for deductibility of expenditure. 7.Section DA 1(1)(a) provides for the deductibility of expenditure that is incurred in deriving assessable income. Section DA 1(1)(b) provides for the deductibility of expenditure incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. The first limb requires a nexus with the deriving of assessable income, and the second a nexus with the carrying on of a business. 8.It is a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the derivation of income, or the carrying on of a business for the purpose of deriving income. The phrase “the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income” is a helpful way both of characterising the factual inquiry that the application of the statutory language requires and of describing the nexus that is the focus of that inquiry. 1 9.TCO considered that the registration costs are incurred undertaking the necessary work to renew the product registrations with the overseas regulator so that the Applicant can continue to sell the products in that overseas market. 10.TCO concluded that the general permission is satisfied, on the condition that the registration costs must have a direct link to the work required to register the products with the overseas regulator. Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Capital limitation (s DA 2(1)) 11.For an amount to be deductible, it must not be caught by any of the exclusions in s DA 2. The relevant exclusion is the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). 1 CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA), NRS Media Holdings v C of IR (2018) 28 NZTC 23-079, Ronpibon Tin NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47.

The relevant principles to be applied are as follows: The best guides for distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure are the general principles stated in Hallstroms 3 and Nchanga 4 . Those cases indicate that it is necessary to consider what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view (Hallstroms). The contrast between the two forms of expenditure corresponds to the distinction between the costs of creating, establishing, acquiring or enlarging the permanent structure of the business (capital), and the costs of using the structure to earn income, or performing the income earning operations (revenue) (Nchanga). The general principles in Hallstroms and Nchanga were adopted by the Privy Council in BP Australia. 5 The Privy Council suggested five indicia that could be considered to determine if an expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. These indicia are guides only and are not determinative. In the end the answer will depend on a close examination of the facts of the particular case and the character of the particular payment. The factors, as summarised by the Court of Appeal in McKenzies 6 , are: othe need or occasion which called for the expenditure; owhether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; owhether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were of an enduring benefit; ohow the payments would be treated under ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and owhether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. In many cases it will not be necessary to look to the BP Australia indicia because the answer will already be clear from an application of the general principles stated in Hallstroms and Nchanga. 2 CIR v Trustpower Ltd \[2015\] NZCA 253 at \[51\]-\[71\], \[74\]-\[76\]. 3 Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA). 4 Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines \[1964\] AC 948 at 960 (PC). 5 BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 224 (PC) 6 CIR v McKenzies (NZ) Ltd \[1988\] 2 NZLR 736 (CA).

See page 1 for details. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 13.In applying the principles in Hallstroms and Nchanga, the primary question to be asked is what the registration costs are calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view – do they relate to the Applicant’s permanent structure or its income earning process? 14.TCO considered that the particular registrations that are the subject of the registration costs allow the Applicant to distribute the products in that particular overseas market for its customer. The registrations only apply to the specified products and last for five years (unless a specification or standard change requires an earlier renewal). This indicates that the true character of the advantage sought is the continued manufacture and export of the customer’s products to derive assessable income from the commercial supply agreement. Having the registrations and keeping those registrations current and up to date with standards is a necessary part of making that supply. 15.Therefore, it was concluded that the registration costs are a cost of performing the income earning operations of the Applicant rather than any acquisition or expansion of the permanent structure of the Applicant’s business. 16.This conclusion is supported by the application of the BP Australia indicia. In particular: The need or occasion that calls for the registration costs is to ensure safety regulations continue to be met so that the Applicant can continue to distribute the products in the overseas market. This suggests the expenditure is operational and will be revenue in nature. The recurrent nature of the registration costs to ensure that the products meet, and continue to meet, safety standards so the products can continue to be exported supports the view that the expenditure is of a revenue nature but is not determinative. The renewal of registrations and the monitoring of changing standards are continuous and no enduring benefit or identifiable asset in the sense used in case law 7 is created by the registration costs. The registration costs are part of the ordinary business of the Applicant, being compliance costs relating to the continued supply of the products in a highly regulated environment. This is a cost of operating the Applicant’s business rather than establishing the business structure. 7 Strick (IT) v Regent Oil Co Ltd \[1966\] AC 295; CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 (CA) at 5,240; Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801.

Subjects | Kaupapa GST: input tax deduction; tax invoice; taxable activity; cancellation of registration. Taxation laws | Ture tāke All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA) unless otherwise stated. Facts | Meka 1. The Taxpayer is a company. It was registered for GST on a payment basis. 2. The Taxpayer claimed input tax deductions for the periods under dispute (disputed periods). 3. Customer & Compliance Services, Inland Revenue (CCS) proposed to reassess the GST assessments of the Taxpayer for the disputed periods, on the basis that the Taxpayer did not provide the required records and documentation to allow for an input tax deduction. CCS also considered that the Taxpayer did not provide sufficient evidence to show that a taxable activity was being carried on. 4. CCS proposed to cancel the Taxpayer's GST registration retrospectively. Issues | Take 5. The main issues considered in this dispute were:  whether the Taxpayer met the requirements to claim input tax deductions in the disputed periods; and  whether the Taxpayer carried on a taxable activity continuously and regularly in accordance with s 6. 6. There was also a preliminary issue on the onus and standard of proof. Decisions | Whakatau 7.

Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Preliminary issue | Take tōmua: Onus and standard of proof 8. The onus of proof in civil proceedings 1 is on the taxpayer, except for shortfall penalties for evasion or similar act, or obstruction. 2 T he taxpayer must prove that an assessment is wrong, why it is wrong, and by how much it is wrong. 3 9. The standard of proof in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities. 4 This standard is met if it is proved that a matter is “more likely than not”. 5 Whether the Taxpayer has discharged the onus of proof is considered in the other issues. Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Input tax deduction requirements 10. The issue is whether the Taxpayer had satisfied the documentation requirements to claim the GST input tax deductions in the disputed periods. 11. The calculation of GST payable by a registered person is set out in s 20. In brief, the input tax that a registered person has paid when acquiring goods and services may be offset against the GST output tax charged on supplies made by the person in the same period (s 20(3)). 12. Requirements for deductibility:  Input tax can only be claimed by a GST registered person. Registration for GST is dependent on a person carrying on a taxable activity. 1 Challenge proceedings (ie, the proceedings that would follow if this dispute proceeds to the TRA or a court) are civil proceedings. 2 Section 149A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 3 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA); Beckham v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 22,066 (CA). 4 Section 149A(1) of the TAA; Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA); Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,493 (HC); Case X16 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,216; Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028. 5 Miller v Minister of Pensions \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, 374.

It is not enough that a payment to a registered person is identified, it must have sufficient connection to the supply of goods and services. 6  The goods or services acquired must have been used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies (s 20(3C)). 7  Tax invoice requirements must be met. Tax invoice requirements 13. Generally, for a person to claim an input tax deduction in respect of a supply, a tax invoice must be provided in accordance with the GSTA, and the person must hold the tax invoice when they furnish the return (s 20(2)(a)). 14. It is not enough that the taxpayer merely shows there was a supply made to them. It must go further and provide sufficient particulars of the supply, generally in a tax invoice. 8 15. The tax invoice must satisfy the requirements for a “tax invoice”. A tax invoice must contain the particulars set out in s 24(3) or in s 24(4) for supplies not exceeding $1,000. 16. A tax invoice is not required for supplies made for a consideration of $50 or less (s 2 4(5)). 9 17. Even if the above requirements for an input tax deduction are satisfied, the Commissioner may determine that no such deduction is available if sufficient records are not kept in accordance with s 75. 18. TCO decided that the Taxpayer was not entitled to the input tax deductions relating to supplies over $50 claimed in the disputed periods because:  the Taxpayer had failed to provide the tax invoices for all the input tax deductions; and  to the extent that the Taxpayer had provided tax invoices, they were issued to another party and were not evidence that the Taxpayer acquired the goods or services. 6 CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at 13,193. 7 Case Z12 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,142; CIR v Trustees in the Mangaheia Trust (2009) 24 NZTC 23,711. 8 Case 1/2012 (2012) 25 NZTC 1,013 at \[147\]. 9 See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 4 (October 1995) at 9 for the Commissioner’s policy on the record keeping requirements for goods or services costing $50 or less.

Whether the Taxpayer was entitled to input tax deductions relating to supplies costing $50 or less was dependent upon whether the Taxpayer was carrying on a taxable activity. Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Taxable activity 20. An input tax deduction can only be made by a GST registered person. Whether a person is liable to register (s 51(1)), and whether they are entitled to voluntarily register (s 51(3)), is dependent on their taxable activity status. 21. Section 52(5) allows the Commissioner to cancel a person’s registration if he is satisfied that the registered person is no longer carrying on a taxable activity. The effective date of cancellation can be retrospective to a date determined by the Commissioner, but not earlier than the last day of the taxable period during which the taxable activity ceased (s 52(5A)). 22. “Taxable activity” is defined in s 6. There are four requirements that must be satisfied to show there is a taxable activity under s 6(1)(a):  There must be an activity. 10  The activity must be carried on continuously or regularly by a person. 11  The activity must involve, or be intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person. 12  The supply or intended supply must be made for a consideration. 13 10 Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC) at 11,233, CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA) at 14,078, and Case 14/2016 \[2016\] NZTRA 14, (2016) 27 NZTC 3-036 at \[63\]. 11 CIR v Newman (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA) at 12,100; Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 277 at 278; Premier Automatic Ticket Issues Ltd v FCT (1933) 50 CLR 268 (HCA) at 298; Case 14/2016 at \[67\]-\[68\]; Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC) at 13,185-13,186; Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 at 3,238- 3,239; Allen Yacht Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270 (HC) at 11,274; Case P20 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,136 at 4,147; Tout & Anor v Cook (1991) 13 NZTC 8,053 (HC). 12 Definition of “supply” in s 5(1); Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) at 6,223; Pacific Trawling Ltd v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Fisheries (2005) 22 NZTC 19,204 (HC); Case S77 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,483; Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391; Case N27 at 3,239-3,238; Case 14/2016 at \[69\]. 13 Definition of “consideration” in s 2(1); CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) at 13,193; Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636 (HC); Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA) at \[61\]; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC) at 13,150; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA) at \[18\] and \[30\].

Based on the evidence presented in this dispute, TCO decided that the Taxpayer did not satisfy the onus of proving that it was carrying on a taxable activity because:  While the intermittent issuing of invoices by the Taxpayer may have suggested the Taxpayer was undertaking an activity, there was insufficient evidence to support an argument that the activity (if any) was carried out by the Taxpayer continuously or regularly.  There were no contracts, correspondence or explanations of the activities undertaken by the Taxpayer to support a view that the Taxpayer was carrying on a taxable activity.  The Taxpayer had not provided sufficient descriptions or explanations of its course of conduct during the disputed periods to support a position that it was carrying on a taxable activity. 24. As the Taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity, CCS was able to cancel the Taxpayer’s GST registration in accordance with sections 52(5) and 52(5A). As such, the Taxpayer was unable to claim an input tax deduction in the disputed periods.

Taxation laws | Ture tāke All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Facts | Meka 1.The dispute concerned the tax treatment of various amounts paid to an individual Taxpayer over several income years. The Taxpayer proposed adjustments in relation to undisclosed dividend income, beneficiary income and other income that CCS had assessed as derived by the Taxpayer. 2.The Taxpayer was in full-time employment and also involved in their family’s business operations. The family’s business was in a group structure involving both company and trust entities. 3.One of the family companies owned and operated a business (the Company). The Company’s leasehold interest in a property was acquired by the local Council for the construction of a road. The Company subsequently transferred amounts to entities associated with the Taxpayer. The Taxpayer also received amounts directly from the Council in relation to the leasehold acquisition. 4.One of the family trusts (the Trust) made regular payments into the Taxpayer’s bank accounts. 5.In addition, there were unexplained cash deposits and payments made to the Taxpayer’s bank accounts and to the Taxpayer’s credit card (unexplained deposits). 6.CCS issued reassessments to the Taxpayer for the years in dispute. 1 As part of the reassessments CCS imposed an evasion shortfall penalty of 150% of the tax shortfall. 2 The pena lty was reduced by 50% for previous behaviour. 3 As noted above at \[1\], the 1 Under s 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 2 Under s 141E of the TAA. 3 Under s 141FB of the TAA.

Taxpayer initiated the dispute by proposing adjustments to the reassessments issued by CCS. Issues | Take 7.The preliminary issues were: The onus and standard of proof. Was the CSOP issued within the two-month response period? 8.The main issues were: Were the assessments issued by CCS (without first issuing a NOPA) valid? Were amounts paid to the Taxpayer in relation to the Company undisclosed dividend income? Were amounts paid to the Taxpayer by the Trust undisclosed beneficiary income? Were the unexplained deposits assessable income to the Taxpayer? Was CCS entitled to amend the Taxpayer’s assessments to increase the amounts outside the four-year time bar period set out in s 108 of the TAA? Was the Taxpayer liable for evasion shortfall penalties in relation to the tax shortfalls? Decisions | Whakatau 9.The Tax Counsel Office decided: The onus was on the Taxpayer to prove that the amounts received were not taxable income. The onus was on CCS to prove that the Taxpayer was liable under s 141E of the TAA for a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act. The standard of proof was the balance of probabilities. The CSOP was validly issued within the 2-month response period. The reassessments issued by CCS were made under s 89C(eb) of the TAA and were not invalid. The amounts received from the Company and the Council were the Taxpayer’s dividend income. For the earlier income years in dispute, the deposits from the Trust were the Taxpayer’s beneficiary income. TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 4 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. For the lat ter income years in dispute, the deposits from the Trust were not the Taxpayer’s beneficiary income. Most of the unexplained deposits were the Taxpayer’s income under ordinary concepts. The time bar in s 108(1) of the TAA did not prevent the Commissioner from making the reassessments because exceptions to the time bar (under s 108(2)) applied in the circumstances. The Taxpayer was liable for evasion shortfall penalties on the tax shortfalls arising due to the Taxpayer not returning the unexplained deposits. The shortfall penalties were correctly reduced by 50% for previous behaviour. However, the Taxpayer was not liable for evasion shortfall penalties on the tax shortfalls from the dividend income, the beneficiary income and most of the unexplained deposits. Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Preliminary Issue 1 | Take tōmua tuatahi: Onus and standard of proof 10.The onus of proof in civil proceedings 4 is on the taxpayer, except for shortfall penalties for evasion or similar act, or obstruction. 5 The taxpayer must prove that an assessment is wrong, why it is wrong, and by how much it is wrong. 6 11.The standard of proof in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities. 7 This standard is met if it is proved that a matter is “more likely than not”. 8 TCO applied a similar standard to considering the issues in this dispute, given the Taxpayer’s ability to challenge any subsequent assessments that are made in civil proceedings. 12.Accordingly, in this dispute: 4 Challenge proceedings (ie, the proceedings that would follow if this dispute proceeds to the Taxation Review Authority or a court) are civil proceedings. 5 Section 149A(2) of the TAA. 6 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA); Beckham v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 22,066 (CA). 7 Section 149A(1) of the TAA; Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA); Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,493 (HC); Case X16 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,216; Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028. 8 Miller v Minister of Pensions \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, 374.

Preliminary Issue 2 | Take tōmua tuarua: Issue of CSOP within the response period 13.The issue was whether the Commissioner’s Statement of Position (CSOP) was issued within the 2-month response period. 9 14.CCS argued that it sent the CSOP by email to the Taxpayer’s Tax Agent within the response period. However, there was a problem with the Tax Agent’s mailbox. 15.The Taxpayer argued that the CSOP was not issued within the response period because they did not become aware of the CSOP until the response period had expired. 16.TCO considered CCS must “issue” the CSOP within the response period under s 89M(6BA) of the TAA. There was no legislative requirement to notify the Taxpayer. TCO considered that the Taxpayer had not satisfied the burden of proof that the CSOP was not issued within the response period. Further, the Taxpayer’s rights to fair and efficient resolution of the dispute had not been prejudiced. 17.TCO noted that it was ultimately for the Courts to conclude whether the CSOP was issued under s 89M(6BA) of the TAA within the 2-month response period. Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Validity of assessments 18.Under Issue 1 in this summary all statutory references are to the TAA unless stated otherwise. 19.The Taxpayer raised a procedural issue regarding CCS’s handling of the audit and dispute. The Taxpayer argued that the assessments made by CCS were not valid as a prior NOPA was not issued. 20.Section 89C(eb) allows CCS to issue an assessment without issuing a NOPA if it has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity. In addition, under s 138E(1)(e)(iv), challenge rights are not conferred to matters 9 Section 89AB of the TAA. TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 6 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. left to the discretion, judgment, opinion, approval, consent, or determination of the Commissioner in s 89C. This would include the Commissioner’s judgment or opinion that the taxpayer was involved in fraudulent activity (in s 89C(eb)). Therefore, the Taxpayer was unable to challenge CCS’s exercise of its discretion under s 89C(eb). 21.TCO considered: Whether CCS had reasonable grounds to believe that the Taxpayer had been involved in fraudulent activity was a matter which s 89C(eb) left to CCS’s judgment or opinion. It was unnecessary to determine if the grounds relied on were reasonable. It was sufficient that CCS believed the grounds were reasonable. CCS had formed a view that the Taxpayer was involved in fraudulent activity by not returning income from multiple sources in their income tax returns. CCS issued reassessments for income tax without first issuing a NOPA based on that belief. 22.Accordingly, TCO concluded that: The reassessments made by CCS under s 89C(eb) were not invalid. Section 138E applied in the current instance, so that the Taxpayer did not have challenge rights in relation to CCS’s decision to invoke s 89C(eb). Therefore, the decision was not a matter which may be put in issue in challenge proceedings and, as such, CCS was not required to establish that they had reasonable grounds to believe that the Taxpayer had been involved in fraudulent activity. Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Undisclosed dividend income 23.The issue was whether the Taxpayer derived dividend income from the Company in the relevant income year. 24.CCS considered that the amounts paid by the Company and the Council were dividends paid to the Taxpayer. CCS considered that the payments were caused by a shareholding relationship because the amounts would not have been paid to the Taxpayer in the absence of the Taxpayer’s association with the shareholders of the Company. TCO noted that the Taxpayer did not dispute this conclusion. 25.The Taxpayer argued that the compulsory acquisition of the Company’s leasehold interest caused the closure of its business and the Company’s shareholders resolved to commence the strike-off process and allow a liquidator to be appointed. The Taxpayer TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 7 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. argued that the transfers were not dividends but distributions of capital reserves in the course of liquidation. Further, the Taxpayer argued that transfers made prior to the shareholder’s resolution were interest free loans. 26.CCS argued that the dividend exclusion for amounts paid on liquidation did not apply as the Taxpayer was not a shareholder of the Company . Further, CCS disputed the veracity of the special resolution of shareholders. 27.Section CD 26 confirms that an amount paid on the liquidation of a company may not be treated as a dividend if the amount: is paid to a shareholder; is paid in relation to a share on the liquidation of the Company; and does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the ordering rule and the available capital distribution amount calculated under s CD 44. 28.After considering the facts and evidence provided by the parties, TCO considered the Taxpayer had not satisfied the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the amounts transferred by the Company were not dividend income. There was no contemporaneous documentation to support the Taxpayer’s submissions that transfers made prior to the shareholders resolution were interest free loans or to support the veracity of the special resolution authorising liquidation. In any event, since the Taxpayer was not a shareholder of the Company, TCO considered the s CD 26 exclusion for capital distributions on liquidation did not apply. 10 29.Accordingly, TCO agreed with the reassessments made by CCS in relation to dividend income in the relevant income year and concluded the Taxpayer’s proposed adjustments should not be made. Issue 3 | Take tuatoru: Undisclosed beneficiary income 30.The issue was whether amounts paid to the Taxpayer by the Trust were undisclosed beneficiary income. 31.The Taxpayer received regular distributions from the Trust. The distributions were not returned in the Taxpayer’s income tax returns. CCS argued the distributions were beneficiary income paid to the Taxpayer. The Taxpayer argued the distributions related 10 However, as noted above at \[24\], the Taxpayer was associated with the shareholders of the Company under s CD 6(1)(a)(ii).

See page 1 for details. to after-tax profits sourced from dividends received by the Trust from two of the family companies. 32.In addition, the Taxpayer argued that certain monthly amounts were distributions to the Taxpayer’s parents and were paid directly to the Taxpayer in their capacity as trustee of the Parents Family Trust. 11 33.CCS argued that the Trust had insufficient prior-year after-tax profits to account for the payments made to the Taxpayer. In the absence of supporting documentation, CCS argued the amounts deposited into the Taxpayer’s personal bank accounts were beneficiary income derived for all the income years in dispute. 34.An amount of income derived in an income year by a trustee of a trust is either beneficiary income or trustee income. 12 “Beneficiary income” is defined in s HC 6 as income derived by a trustee which has either been vested absolutely in interest in a beneficiary in the income year or has been paid to the beneficiary within the income year or the extended period set out in s HC 6(1B). 35.For the purposes of the dispute, TCO divided the income years in dispute in two, and concluded as follows: For the earlier income years in dispute, TCO considered the Taxpayer had not satisfied the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the amounts paid to the Taxpayer were not beneficiary income. In particular, TCO considered there was insufficient evidence to support the Taxpayer’s position that the amounts received from the Trust were either sourced from after tax distributions or distributions of beneficiary income made to the Taxpayer’s parents. As such, TCO considered the amounts received by the Taxpayer in the earlier income years were beneficiary income. For the latter income years in dispute, TCO considered the amounts paid to the Taxpayer were not beneficiary income as the statutory definition contained in s HC 6 was not met. The Trust did not return any income during the latter income years. It followed that the amounts paid to the Taxpayer during the latter income years were not “beneficiary income” as defined in s HC 6. Accordingly, TCO disagreed with the reassessments made by CCS and concluded the Taxpayer’s proposed adjustments for the latter income years should be made. 11 The Taxpayer’s parents resided in a home owned by the Parents Family Trust and paid the household expenses using distributions from the Trust. The Taxpayer claimed that their parents included the distributions as beneficiary income in their respective individual income tax returns. 12 Section HC 5.

Issue 4 | Take tuawhā: Unexplained deposits 36.The issue was whether the unexplained deposits (deposits made to bank accounts owned by the Taxpayer or paid against the Taxpayer’s credit card) were the Taxpayer’s income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1). 37.CCS argued the cash deposits showed the Taxpayer derived income from unexplained sources. Further, CCS argued the deposits were income under ordinary concepts because they were received on a periodic, recurrent and regular basis. 38.The Taxpayer argued that the unexplained deposits were not income under ordinary concepts but non-income amounts received from a number of sources: cash allowances received from their employer; loan repayments relating to monies the Taxpayer lent to friends; loans from the Taxpayer’s parents; casino winnings and the redeposit of unspent cash withdrawals; transfers between bank accounts of associated entities; and bank errors. 39.TCO summarised the relevant case law for unexplained amounts as follows: The taxpayer has the onus of proving that the amounts are not income. 13 The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. 14 The t axpayer can meet the onus of proof if the taxpayer provides specific details of other sources of funds that are capital or non-taxable in nature. 15 The t axpayer is required to do more than simply provide a credible possible alternative explanation for the amounts. The taxpayer must establish that the Commissioner’s assessment is incorrect and by how much it is incorrect. 16 40.TCO considered the Taxpayer had not satisfied the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the unexplained deposits (except as specified below totalling a relatively small amount) were not income received in the income years in dispute. TCO acknowledged that the Taxpayer had provided some explanations that might be 13 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 at 61,283. 14 Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA); Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028; Case X16 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,216. 15 Case L40 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,249. 16 Case S30 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,207.

See page 1 for details. credible for some of the transfers or deposits, but the Taxpayer had not provided sufficient evidence to prove on the balance of probabilities that the deposits were not income of the Taxpayer, particularly in light of evidence provided by CCS. 41.However, TCO considered the Taxpayer had satisfied the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the following amounts were not income under ordinary concepts: deposits that consisted of transfers between the Taxpayer’s bank accounts; a deposit that consisted of a reimbursement of a business cost; and a deposit that was a bank error. 42.Accordingly, TCO concluded: The adjustments proposed by the Taxpayer for the deposits specified above at \[41\]should be made. The remaining adjustments proposed by the Taxpayer with respect to the unexplained deposits should not be made. Issue 5 | Take tuarima: Time bar 43.Under Issue 5 in this summary all statutory references are to the TAA unless stated otherwise. 44.The issue was whether CCS could amend the income tax assessments for the income years in dispute to increase the amounts under s 108(2) of the TAA. Subject to some exceptions, including those in s 108(2) and s 108B, s 108(1) prevents the Commissioner from amending an assessment, to increase the amount assessed or decrease the amount of a net loss, if: the taxpayer has furnished an income tax return, and an assessment has been made, and four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return. 45.However, if an exception applies, the Commissioner may amend an otherwise time- barred assessment. 46.TCO summarised that s 108(2)(b) applies as follows: Income of a particular nature is income that has a basic or inherent feature, quality or character. The source of the income is where it is from. TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 11 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. Income must be mentioned in or with the return of the taxpayer seeking the protection of the time bar. The disclosure of income at some other time, or in another taxpayer’s return, will not suffice. The omission of income does not need to be fraudulent or deliberate. Once it is determined that the time bar exception applies, the Commissioner is not confined to the omitted sums but may amend the whole assessment. 47.TCO considered that: The dividend income and the beneficiary income were distinct categories of income (ie, of a particular nature) that were required to be returned, and they were also types of income derived from particular sources (the Company and the Trust respectively). The unexplained deposits were periodic amounts and relied on by the Taxpayer to meet regular expenses. As such, they were income of a particular nature. The unexplained deposits were also derived from a particular source or sources, even though the source or sources remained unknown. 48.Accordingly, TCO considered that CCS’s opinion that the Taxpayer’s income tax returns did not include income of a particular nature or from a particular source was reasonably open to it on the information available to it. Further, TCO considered the Taxpayer had failed to show that CCS did not honestly hold the opinion or misdirected itself as to the legal basis on which the opinion was to be formed. Therefore, TCO concluded that s 108(2)(b) applied to allow the Commissioner to assess the Taxpayer for the income years in dispute. Issue 6 | Take tuaono: Evasion shortfall penalty 49.Under Issue 6 in this summary all statutory references are to the TAA unless stated otherwise. 50.The issue is whether CCS has discharged its burden of proof that the Taxpayer was liable under s 141E for a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act. 51.Section 141E(a) imposes a shortfall penalty on a taxpayer if the following requirements are satisfied: The taxpayer has taken a tax position. Taking the tax position has resulted in a tax shortfall. The taxpayer has evaded the assessment or payment of tax by the taxpayer or another person under a tax law. TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 12 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. 52.The penalty payable for evasion or similar act is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. 53.TCO summarised the elements of s 141E(1)(a) as follows: The requirement for evasion will be satisfied if the taxpayer knows that their action or omission will breach a tax obligation. There must be some blameworthy act or omission on the part of the taxpayer. The required intent for evasion can be inferred from surrounding circumstances and conduct. Recklessness can amount to evasion. In the context of evasion recklessness involves the conscious taking of risk. Where recklessness is alleged, the Commissioner must prove that: oFacts actually known to the taxpayer were such that they must have put the taxpayer on inquiry that a tax obligation may not be met. oThe taxpayer made a conscious decision to ignore the facts without making further inquiry. Dividend income 54.The Taxpayer did not return dividend income from the Company in the relevant income year. 55.TCO noted that: The receipt from the Council was an unusual or one-off transaction. The Taxpayer had sought specialist advice on the tax treatment of the receipt, including that it could be distributed “tax free” on liquidation. It was not clear if the Taxpayer was aware of the necessary requirements to satisfy the s CD 26 exclusion for shareholder distributions “on liquidation”, in particular that the distribution must be made to the Company’s shareholder and not merely an associated party. While the steps were not executed correctly, CCS had not provided evidence that this was due to recklessness, as opposed to merely a mistake due to a lack of reasonable care or carelessness. 56.Accordingly, TCO concluded that: CCS had not provided sufficient evidence that the Taxpayer knew he was breaching a tax obligation or made a conscious decision to ignore his tax obligations. TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 13 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. CCS had not satisfied the burden of proving evasion in relation to the dividend income. Beneficiary income 57.The Taxpayer did not return beneficiary income from the Trust in the earlier income years. 58.The relevant facts were: The Taxpayer was the sole director of the Trust’s corporate trustee and had full access to the Trust’s bank account (including signing authority). In their capacity as director of the Trust’s corporate trustee, the Taxpayer would have been aware of the contents of the Trust’s income tax returns. The Trust did not allocate beneficiary income to the Taxpayer in its income tax returns. The Trust returned trustee income for these periods and the Taxpayer may have considered that the tax liability on the income had been met by the Trust and that there was no further tax obligation. 59.TCO considered that CCS had not provided sufficient evidence that the Taxpayer knew there was a breach of a tax obligation or made a conscious decision to ignore their tax obligations. Accordingly, TCO concluded that CCS had not satisfied the burden of proving evasion in relation to the tax shortfall of beneficiary income in the earlier income years. Unexplained Deposits 60.The Taxpayer did not return the unexplained deposits as assessable income in the relevant income years. 61.TCO considered the knowledge requirement for evasion would be met if a taxpayer’s knowledge must have put them on inquiry that their tax obligations would not be met, but they chose to proceed in spite of that risk. 62.The unexplained deposits were received by the Taxpayer in his bank accounts over a sustained period of time. The total amount of unexplained deposits received each year were not insubstantial and the Taxpayer relied on them to meet regular expenses. 63.TCO inferred from these circumstances that the Taxpayer knew that the unexplained deposits were income and filed their income tax returns without including them knowing that the returns were incorrect and misleading and in breach of their tax TDS 23/14 | 24 November 2023 Page 14 of 14 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. obligations. The Taxpayer had not shown that they had reasonable grounds for believing otherwise. 64.There is no evidence that the Taxpayer made inquiries to determine whether the unexplained deposits were income or not. 65.TCO considered CCS had satisfied its burden of proving that the Taxpayer evaded the assessment or payment of tax when they took tax positions in relation to the unexplained deposits. Conclusion 66.TCO concluded that: CCS had not satisfied the burden of proving that the Taxpayer evaded the assessment or payment of tax when they took the tax positions with respect to the dividend income and beneficiary income amounts. However, CCS had satisfied the burden of proving evasion in relation to the omitted unexplained deposits. 67.Therefore, the Taxpayer was liable for shortfall penalties for evasion under s 141E only in relation to the unexplained deposits. 68.The resulting outcome was that CCS would need to calculate and reverse the evasion shortfall penalties relating to: the dividend income; the beneficiary income; the amounts that TCO concluded were not income under ordinary concepts. 69.The shortfall penalties were reduced by 50% for previous behaviour.

Subjects | Kaupapa Income tax: Disposal of personal property, income vs capital; tax avoidance Taxation laws | Ture tāke All legislative references are to Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise specified. Facts | Meka 1. This was an application for a private ruling. 2. The non-resident Applicant is in business and proposes it will transfer shares in company A (A) to limited partnership B (B) as a capital contribution (the First Transfer). 3. At the same time the Applicant will transfer a percentage of its interest in B to two limited partnerships ( the LPs) equally as a capital contribution (the Second Transfer). 4. The transfers are to be undertaken due to regulatory requirements of a foreign jurisdiction. 5. The Applicant holds its interests in A for long-term investment. Issues | Take 6. The main issues considered in this ruling were:  Whether the transfer of the interests in A by the Applicant to B gives rise to income.  Whether the transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to the LPs gives rise to income.  Whether the arrangement constitutes tax avoidance under s BG 1. Decisions | Whakatau 7. The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) concluded:  The transfer of the interests in A by the Applicant to B does not give rise to income of the Applicant under ss CA 1, CB 1, CB 3, CB 4 or CB 5. TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 3 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details.  The transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to the LPs gives rise to income to the Applicant under s CB 4 equal to the value of the interests in A on the day of the transfer.  The Applicant is allowed a deduction equal to the value of the interests in A on the day it acquires the interests in B under s DB 23.  The general limitations in ss DA 2(3), DA 2(4), DA 2(5) and DA 2(6) do not apply to deny the deduction.  The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the Applicant disposes of the interests in A under s EA 2(2).  The transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to the LPs does not give rise to “net income” or “net loss” (as calculated under s BC 4) of the Applicant in the year of the transfer.  Section BG 1 does not apply to the arrangement. Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Transfer of interests in A to B Section CA 1(2) – Income under ordinary concepts 8. TCO first considered whether the transfer of the Applicant’s interests in A to B resulted in income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). 9. For an amount to be “income under ordinary concepts”, the amount must be something that “comes in” to a person and is in money or money’s worth. 1 10. If payments have a quality of regularity or recurrence, then they become part of the receipts upon which the recipient may depend for their living expenses. However, that factor would not be enough on its own. Consideration must also be given to the relationship between payer and payee, and to the purpose of the payment. It is the quality of the payment in the hands of the recipient which is important. 2 11. Receipts that are on capital account are not income according to ordinary concepts. 3 1 Tennant v Smith \[1892\] AC 150, CIR v Parson (No. 2) \[1968\] NZLR 574 2 Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 3 Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538 TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 4 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. 12. The Applicant will receive 100% of B’s interests in consideration for the disposal of its interests in A. The interests are money’s worth as they are valuable and can be converted into money if sold. 13. However, this receipt could not be said to have a quality of regularity or recurrence or form part of the receipts that the Applicant would depend on. 14. In addition, if the receipt is capital, then s CA 1(2) will not apply. TCO concluded that the proceeds of A’s interests are capital in nature and not income under s CB 1 ( see below). Therefore, the transfer of A’s interests by the Applicant to B does not give rise to income of the Applicant under s CA 1(2). Section CB 1 15. Under s CB 1(1), an amount derived from a business is income of a person. The term “business” is defined in s YA 1 as including any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit. 16. The mere fact that a business is being carried on does not mean that all amounts derived by the Applicant are income under s CB 1. The essential question in determining whether an amount is income from a business is whether the amount was derived from the current operations of the business, and not merely connected to the fact that the business existed. 4 17. TCO considered the relevant case law and applied the following factors to assist in determining whether an investment is part of the taxpayer’s business or on capital account:  Whether the investment was intended to be held long-term, including the reasons for the original acquisition and the reasons for disposal. In some circumstances, the reason for the sale may support a contention that the shares were otherwise intended to be held long-term. For example, where the investment is sold because of reasons outside the taxpayer’s control; 5 due to unanticipated changes in circumstances; 6 or following an unsolicited offer. 7 4 CIR v City Motor Service Ltd; CIR v Napier Motors Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1010 5 State Insurance Office v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,035 (HC) 6 Rangatira Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1994) NZTC 11,197 (HC), (1995) 17 NZTC 12,182 (CA), (1996) 17 NZTC 12,727 (PC); National Insurance Company of New Zealand v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,489 (HC); (1999) 19 NZTC 15,135 (CA) 7 Waylee Investments Ltd v CIR \[1990\] STC 780 TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 5 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details.  The scale of operations and the volume of similar transactions by the company, including the type of company the shares are held in. The greater the number of share sales and the larger the amounts involved, the more likely it is that the shares will be considered to be held on revenue account with trading being an ordinary incident of the taxpayer’s business. In this regard, investment in sound well performing companies may be considered to support a holding as a capital investment. 8  The degree of involvement of the taxpayer in actively monitoring the investment. Frequent and active monitoring of the portfolio may suggest that the shares are held on revenue account with trading being an ordinary incident of the business.  The degree of separation between the investment in question and other, business, investments of the taxpayer. Although a separate portfolio is not necessary 9 , at a minimum, it must be objectively possible to differentiate between the investments that are asserted to be held on capital account and other trading investments.  The source of the funds used to acquire the investment.  Whether the investments are treated as part of the taxpayer’s business or are available to meet claims of the business.  How the investments are treated for accounting purposes. 18. These factors are not an exhaustive list and anything that indicates one way or the other whether the shares were a part of the taxpayer’s business, in the circumstances, could potentially be relevant. Importantly, not all of the factors will necessarily be relevant to any given situation. 19. After consideration of these factors TCO concluded that the interests that the Applicant held in A were capital in nature because:  The Applicant intends to hold the interests in A long term. There have not been any disposals of shares since the first tranche was acquired before 2010. The Applicant derives significant annual dividend income from the interests in A.  The disposal arises from a one-off event for a foreign countries’ regulatory purposes. There are no similar transactions to compare this disposal against. The Applicant derives no economic gain from the disposal unlike other cases 8 Rangatira Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue n 6 9 State Insurance Office v CIR n 5 TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 6 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. where a certain yield was required, or the disposal gains were used for the general business.  The Applicant has representatives on the board of A through an associate.  The interests in A are treated differently from short term securities for accounting purposes.  It is extremely unlikely that recourse would need to be made to the interests in A to meet claims made against the Applicant in relation to its business obligations (because of more liquid investments available).  Although the interests in A were acquired using general short-term funding, this itself is not determinative, and does not outweigh the capital factors discussed above. In particular, the interests in A are not readily realisable assets, which are available to meet the needs of the Applicant’s business. 20. In line with case law which discusses the difference between merely realising investments compared with realising an investment in the course of a business, TCO considered that the disposal of the interests in A was not a realisation made in the course of a business. The interests in A were long term investments held by the Applicant on capital account in which the Applicant derived dividend income. The disposal of the interests in A was a one-off event and the fact that the Applicant had not disposed of any of A’s shares since the acquisition of the first tranche before 2010 also indicated the receipt was capital in nature. 21. Therefore, the transfer of the interests in A to B did not give rise to income of the Applicant under s CB 1. 22. TCO also considered whether income arose under ss CB 3, CB 4, or CB 5. Section CB 3 23. An amount that a person makes in conducting an undertaking or scheme for the purpose of making a profit is income of the person under s CB 3. TCO concluded that an undertaking or scheme involves a programme of action devised in order to attain some end. The relevant purpose must be formulated at the time the property is acquired. F or s CB 3 to apply, the acquisition and sale must exhibit features that give it the character of a business deal. If a receipt is capital in nature, it will not be income under s CB 3. As it had already been ascertained that the disposal of the interests in A will be on capital account, then no income to the Applicant arises under s CB 3. TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 7 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. Section CB 4 24. Section CB 4 applies where a person disposes of personal property, and that property was acquired for the purpose of disposing of it. “Property” is something that is capable of being owned and being transferred. Shares in a company are capable of being owned and being transferred. “Personal property” in s CB 4 does not include land and the fact that shares are personal property is consistent with s 35 of the Companies Act 1993. 25. The test for determining a taxpayer’s purpose in the context of s CB 4 is subjective, requiring consideration of the taxpayer’s state of mind at the time of acquisition. For s CB 4 to apply, disposal must be the taxpayer’s dominant purpose. The taxpayer’s stated purpose is objectively assessed, and the length of time for which the property is held is of particular importance. 10 26. The Applicant first acquired interests in A before 2010 and has not disposed of any shares since then. The Applicant’s stated intention is to hold the interests in A long term and receive dividend income. The disposal only arises because of foreign jurisdiction regulatory purposes – otherwise the Applicant would continue to own the interests in A directly. 27. Accordingly, TCO considered that the interests in A were not acquired for the purpose of disposal and therefore did not give rise to income of the Applicant under s CB 4. Section CB 5 28. Section CB 5 applies where a person is in the business of dealing in personal property. An amount derived by a person from disposing of personal property is income of the person if their business is dealing in property of that kind. 29. TCO concluded that while the Applicant may undertake some share buying and selling as part of its day-to-day business, and, therefore, could be a share dealer, the interests in A are held on capital account and do not form part of the business of the Applicant. 30. Therefore, the disposal of the interests in A would be outside the ordinary course of that business and do not give rise to income of the Applicant under s CB 5. 10 CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA). TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 8 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. Overall Conclusion 31. TCO concluded that the transfer of the interests in A by the Applicant to B did not give rise to income of the Applicant under ss CA 1(2), CB 1, CB 3, CB 4, or CB 5. Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Transfer of interests from B to the LPs 32. This issue concerned whether the Second Transfer gave rise to income of the Applicant. 33. In deciding this issue, TCO considered the following questions:  Are the LPs tax transparent under the rule in s HG 2?  Does the contribution of the interests in B, give rise to a disposal of the underlying assets held indirectly by the Applicant through B?  What is the nature the underlying assets being disposed of?  Does the income have a source in New Zealand?  Is there a deduction for the cost of property? Tax transparency 34. The tax transparency was relevant because if the LPs are tax transparent, the Applicant is treated as owning the interests in A under s HG 2 in its capacity as a partner of the LPs. 35. The arrangement stated that both B and the LPs will meet the definition of a “partnership” under s YA 1. 36. Therefore, both B and the LPs are tax transparent under s HG 2. Disposal if partnership interest 37. The effect of s HG 2(1) is to treat the partnership as look through, with each partner being treated as holding the property of the partnership in proportion to their partnership share. It followed that where partners transfer their partnership interest to another person, they are treated as disposing of a share of the partnership property to the purchaser. 38. Therefore, if the Applicant disposed of its interests in B to the LPs, it would be treated as disposing of the underlying partnership property under s HG 2, being the interests in A. TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 9 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. Meaning of dispose 39. TCO concluded that the s YA 1 definition of “dispose” did not assist for the Second Transfer, and it was necessary to consider the ordinary meaning of “dispose”. 40. At the most fundamental level a disposition i.e., the action of disposing, involves complete alienation from the disposer of the thing being disposed of. That thing is “got rid of” - being no longer in the control, or possession of the disposer in any capacity. 41. TCO considered that there is a disposal of the interests in A by the Applicant under the Se cond Transfer for the following reasons:  The Applicant is “getting rid of” its interests in B in exchange for limited partnership interests in each of the LPs. It has “disposed” of the interests in B.  The Applicant will cease to be a partner of B. Under s HG 2(1)(b), the Applicant will no longer hold the property of B (being the interests in A) in the capacity as a partner of B. Therefore, the Applicant has disposed of the interests in A.  Each of the LPs, as the new partners of B, will be treated as holding the property of B (being the interests in A) under s HG 2(1)(b).  Concurrently, the Applicant becomes a partner of the LPs, and will be treated as holding the property of the LPs (being the interests in A) under s HG 2(1)(b).  Overall, the Applicant (as a partner of B) will dispose of the interests in A to itself (as a partner of the LPs).  The Applicant does not have the same legal rights in respect of the interests in A after the Second Transfer, because it is no longer a partner of B. It has a different set of legal rights in its capacity as a partner of the LPs – despite it continuing to be treated as holding the same proportion of ownership in A for tax purposes. Can a person hold property in different capacities? 42. The question is whether, under the Act, a disposal could arise from a transfer of partnership property where s HG 2(1) treats the person as holding the property before and after the transfer. That is, the transferor and the transferee are treated as the owner under s HG 2(1). TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 10 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. 43. Under s HG 2(1)(b), partnership property is treated as being held by the partners in proportion to their interest in the partnership for the purpose of determining the partners’ income tax liability “in their capacity as partners” of the partnership. 44. The ordinary words of s HG 2 limit the application of s HG 2 to “their capacity as partners”. Therefore, if the Applicant is a partner of two different partnerships, it owns the interests in A in different capacities under s HG 2, and s HG 2 does not prevent a disposal from one capacity to another. 45. TCO noted that the different capacities approach is consistent with QB 17/09. 11 Although QB 17/09 discusses s HG 2 in the context of a transfer of property from a personal capacity to a partnership capacity, the same principle applies if the person is transferring property from one partnership capacity to another (because in both cases the person is the owner of the property for tax purposes before and after the transfer). 46. Although s HG 2(1) prescribes a look through treatment for partnership property, there is a distinction between a partner’s capacity as a partner of the partnership and their other capacities, be it their personal capacity or, if relevant, their capacity as a partner in another partnership. Conclusion on “disposal” 47. TCO concluded that the Applicant does not have the same legal rights in respect of the interests in A after the Second Transfer, because it is no longer a partner of B. It has a different set of legal rights in its capacity as a partner of the LPs – despite the Applicant remaining the owner of the interests in A for tax purposes. 48. The Applicant (as a partner of B) will dispose the interests in A to itself (as a partner of the LPs) under the Second Transfer. Does s CB 4 apply to the Second Transfer? 49. Section CB 4 applies to personal property acquired for the purpose of disposal. The following factors must be present in order for s CB 4 to apply:  there is an “amount”;  the amount is derived from disposing of “personal property”; and  the person acquired the relevant personal property for the purpose of disposal. 11 QB 17/09 – Is there a full or partial disposal when an asset is contributed to a partnership as a capital contribution \[ 15\] Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 1 (February 2018). TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 11 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. Is there an amount? 50. TCO concluded that the Applicant derived an amount from the Second Transfer based on the following reasoning:  Before the Second Transfer, the LPs did not own any assets, and they had no value.  On the Second Transfer, the Applicant will contribute its interests in B to the LPs.  It followed that the value of the interests in the LPs will equal the interests in B (as the LPs will have no other assets). This was similar to a company issuing shares to a person in consideration for the person transferring assets into the company. The issue price of the shares is equal to the assets contributed.  The value of the interests in B and the interests in the LPs will equal the interests in A, as they are the underlying assets of B and the LPs.  As the interests in A consist of shares, the interests in the LPs are capable to being valued and convertible in money.  The Applicant will receive “money’s worth” (being the increase in value of the interests in the LPs due to the underlying interests in A) in consideration of making the capital contribution to the LPs.  The Applicant will derive “an amount” from disposing of its interests in B equal to the value of the interests in A under s CB 4. Are the interests in B “personal property”? 51. The interests in A consist of shares. The definition of personal property in s CB 4 does not include land. 52. “Property” is something that is capable of being owned and being transferred. 53. Shares in a company are considered to be “property” as they are capable of being owned and being transferred. As shares in a company are clearly not land or interests in land, they should also be considered “personal property”. This is consistent with the legal nature of shares under section 35 the Companies Act 1993. 54. Therefore, the interests in A are “personal property”. Purpose 55. TCO considered that it was clear the Applicant will acquire its interests in B (and the underlying interests in A under s HG 2) for the purpose of disposal. This was because TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 12 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. both the acquisition and the disposal of the partnership interests form part of a restructuring plan that occur concurrently. Under that plan, the Applicant will acquire the partnership interests and immediately contribute the interests into the LPs. The purpose of disposal was inherently evident in the plan. 56. In summary, TCO concluded the contribution of the Applicant’s interests in B to the LPs will give rise to income of the Applicant under s CB 4. The Applicant will derive an amount equal to the value of the interests in A, for the disposal of personal property. The Applicant acquired the partnership interests for the purpose of disposal as it is planning to acquire the interests and immediately contribute them into the LPs. This means the interests in A are also acquired for the purpose of disposal. Source of income 57. It needed to be determined whether the income received by the Applicant is non- residents’ foreign-sourced income as defined in s BD 1(4). If so, it would not constitute assessable income of the Applicant under s BD 1(5). The Applicant is a non-resident, so it needed to be determined whether the income received is foreign-source amount under the source rules in s YD 4. 58. Under s YD 4(12), income derived from the disposal of property in New Zealand has a source in New Zealand. Shares are generally located where the share register is kept. A is a company registered in New Zealand and the share registry is required to be kept in New Zealand. 59. Therefore, TCO concluded that the income under s CB 4 from the Second Transfer will be treated as having a source in New Zealand under s YD 4(12). Deduction for the cost of the interest in B 60. TCO considered whether a deduction arises under s DB 23 (revenue account property) for the Applicant when it disposes of the interests in B and derives s CB 4 income under the Second Transfer. 61. The requirements for a deduction under s DB 23 can be summarised as:  there must be “expenditure incurred”;  as a “cost” for “revenue account property”; and  the exclusions denying a deduction for portfolio investment income and life insurers do not apply. TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 13 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. 62. The disposal of the interests in B and the underlying interests in A meets the definition of “revenue account property” as it produces income under s CB 4. 63. The following is relevant to the concept of “expenditure”:  It can encompass money or money’s worth.  Something is money’s worth when it is convertible into cash directly or indirectly.  It must be something that is “handed over”. 64. Therefore, the amount of expenditure incurred by the Applicant in acquiring the interests in B is the value of the interests in A at the time of the First Transfer. The interests in A comprise shares (which are all convertible into cash so are “money’s worth”). 65. The Applicant will incur the expenditure on the date it transfers the interests in A to B, as that is the date it gives up, or pays away, its direct ownership and acquires a partnership interest in A. Cost 66. "C ost" is that which must be given to acquire something, or the price paid for a thing - the money or money's worth given up by someone to get something but can be considered in its commercial reality. 67. The Applicant has given up its direct ownership of the interests in A to obtain the interests in B. That is, it’s “cost” and its expenditure. Limitations and timing of deduction 68. Section DB 23 overrides the capital and private limitations in s DA 2(1) – (2). None of the other limitations in s DA 2(3) – (6) apply to deny the Applicant a deduction. 69. Under s EA 2 t he deduction for revenue account property is generally allocated to the income year of disposal. None of the exceptions in s EA 2(1) apply, therefore the Applicant is allowed a deduction for the cost of the interests in B in the income year of disposal. Net income or net loss 70. As the First and Second Transfers occur concurrently, the Applicant does not derive net income or net loss under s BC 4 from the Second Transfer, as its income and deduction are the same (being the value of the interests in A on that day). TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 14 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. Conclusion 71. TCO concluded that:  The transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to the LPs gave rise to income of the Applicant under s CB 4, and assessable income of the Applicant under s BD 1(5), equal to the value of the interests in A on the day of the transfer.  The Applicant is allowed a deduction equal to the value of the interests in A on the day it acquires the interests in B under s DB 23.  The general limitations in ss DA 2(3), DA 2(4), DA 2(5) and DA 2(6) do not apply to deny the deduction.  The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the Applicant disposes of the interests in A under s EA 2(2).  The transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to the LPs does not give rise to “net income” or “net loss” (as calculated under s BC 4) of the Applicant in the year of the transfer. Issue 3 | Take tuatoru: Whether s BG 1 applies 72. Section BG 1(1) provides that a “tax avoidance arrangement” is void as against the Commissioner. The approach to s BG 1 was settled by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289, which has been followed in subsequent judicial decisions. 73. TCO’s approach in making this decision is consistent with Interpretation Statement: IS 23/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of the general anti-avoidance provisions sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (3 February 2023) (IS 23/01). IS 23/01 will not be replicated in this TDS but in summary the steps are as follows:  Understanding the legal form of the arrangement. This involves identifying and understanding the steps and transactions that make up the arrangement, the commercial or private purposes of the arrangement and the arrangement’s tax effects.  Determining whether the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. This involves: o Identifying and understanding Parliament’s purpose for the specific provisions that are used or circumvented by the arrangement. TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 15 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. o Understanding the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement as a whole by using the factors identified by the courts. o Considering the implications of the preceding two steps and answering the ultimate question under the Parliamentary contemplation test: Does the arrangement, when viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, make use of or circumvent the specific provisions in a manner consistent with Parliament’s purpose?  If the arrangement does have a tax avoidance purpose or effect, consider the merely incidental test. 74. Taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances (noting that as this is a summary it may not contain all the facts or assumptions relevant to the decision and, therefore, cannot be relied on) the TCO concluded as follows: The arrangement 75. TCO considered that the arrangement for s BG 1 purposes is that:  The Applicant will establish three limited partnerships (B and the 2 LPs) under the law of a foreign jurisdiction.  The Applicant will hold 100% of the limited partnership interests in each of the three limited partnerships upon establishment.  The general partner of the three limited partnerships will be D, an overseas company which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Applicant.  The Applicant will transfer the interests in A to B, as a capital contribution to B.  At the same time, the Applicant will transfer a 50% limited partnership interest in B to each of the LPs, as capital contributions to the LPs. The commercial purposes of the arrangement 76. The Applicant states that the commercial or private purposes of the Arrangement are:  The transactions are to comply with the regulatory requirements of an overseas country.  Under the foreign jurisdiction it is not permitted to control or have a substantial investment in A. Currently, A is a non-permitted investment of the Applicant.  However, the Applicant is permitted to indirectly own non-permitted investments under the Arrangement. TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 16 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. The tax effects of the arrangement 77. TCO considered that the arrangement will give rise to the following tax effects:  The transfer of the interests in A by the Applicant to B, as a capital contribution to B, will be a capital transaction. Any gain on the transfer will be a non-taxable capital gain.  The transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to each of the LPs gives rise to income of the Applicant under s CB 4, and assessable income of the Applicant under s BD 1(5), equal to the value of the interests in A on the day of the transfer.  The Applicant is allowed a deduction equal to the value of the interests in A on the day it acquires the interests in B under s DB 23.  The transfer of the interests in B by the Applicant to each of the LPs will not create net income or net loss under s BC 4. There is no gain to the Applicant because its income and deductions will be the same, as the Second Transfer occurs concurrently with the First Transfer.  For income tax purposes, the Applicant continues to hold the interests in A directly under s HG 2. The only difference after the two transfers is that there will be a step up in the cost base of the interests in A from that previously held by the Applicant. However, this is merely crystallising an unrealised non-taxable capital gain. In other words, no tax advantage is gained from the transfers. Parliamentary contemplation 78. The above tax effects did not cause concerns from a s BG 1 perspective. This is because the legislation is working as intended, and there is no “tax avoidance” (as defined), because there is no avoidance, postponement, or reduction of a liability to tax. 79. Capital receipts are not normally brought into the tax net, unless specific provision is made under the Act (for example, in accordance with the financial arrangements rules or certain land taxing provisions). 80. Over the years, a number of tests have been developed by the courts to assist in distinguishing between income and capital receipts. The well-known metaphor likens TDS 24/09 | 13 May 2024 Page 17 of 17 This summary is provided for information only and is not binding on the Commissioner. See page 1 for details. income to fruit from the tree of capital assets. 12 Where a receipt is from the realisation of a capital asset, then the receipt is unlikely to be an income amount. 13 81. Parliament’s purpose demonstrated throughout the provisions of the Act reflects the above - i.e. that taxpayers are taxed on income but not on capital receipts (subject to statutory changes to the general rule). This is set out most clearly in s CB 1 which states that an amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person, but that this does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. 82. Where income does arise, then as intended by the Act, it is offset by an equal and offsetting deduction being revenue account property that is concurrently disposed of. Conclusion 83. Accordingly, TCO considered the provisions of the Act were being used and had the effect that Parliament intended. The above analysis indicated that Parliament would consider that the Arrangement makes use of the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose for those provisions. Therefore, the Arrangement did not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect. 12 Eisner v Macomber (1919) 252 U.S. 189 13 Californian Copper Syndicate v Harris \[1905\] 5 TC 159.
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Guidelines for publishing technical decision summaries Introduction 1. From mid-2021, certain technical decisions made by the Tax Counsel Office (TCO), Inland Revenue will be published in a summarised form. The published document will be called a technical decision summary or TDS. This document sets out the policy and guidelines concerning the publication of technical decision summaries. Policy and principles 2. Publishing technical decision summaries will make our advice decisions and processes clearer and more transparent and will help taxpayer compliance. Awareness of our approach on technical issues helps taxpayers and their advisors “get it right from the start” and supports the integrity of the tax system. 3. Technical decision summaries are summaries of technical decisions made by the TCO of adjudication decisions (from mid-2021) and private ruling decisions (later in 2021, at the earliest for private ruling applications received on or after 1 January 2022), subject to certain exclusions discussed in paragraph 6 below. 4. Technical decision summaries will be available on our tax technical website. It will be possible to subscribe for notifications of new items. 5. Each TDS will contain an outline of the factual situation and sufficient detail of the legal analysis (including a summary of alternative arguments and case authorities) to help readers understand why the decision was reached. 6. It is intended that most technical decisions will be summarised and published. For a variety of legal and practical reasons, any technical decisions (or separate issues within a technical decision document) with one or more of the following characteristics will not be published: • Where it is not possible to publish the decision in a way that appropriately protects the confidentiality (in terms of both identity and commercially sensitive information) of the relevant taxpayer/customer or another party to the transaction. • Where IR has formally decided that the decision should not be followed in other contexts, or our staff have been formally advised not to apply the decision to other taxpayers pending urgent consideration at a national level. • Where the decision is subject to a formal escalation within IR, and consequently the Commissioner's position may change. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Where it has been decided the decision should be the subject of a public statement that will be publicly consulted (for example as a public ruling, interpretation statement, or question we've been asked) and it is not anticipated that the allocation and preparation of the item and its public release will be unduly delayed. • Where the issue relates to a particular group of taxpayers/customers or industry, and we intend to engage with that group regarding the issue and its interpretation, and arrangements that would apply if our position changes. • Where our Policy group considers the decision to be contrary to the intended tax policy outcomes and intends to consider the matter as a matter of priority and potentially recommend legislative change. • Where the nature and implications of a decision mean that the integrity of the tax system and/or certainty for taxpayers or customers requires the Commissioner to engage with the government, or give careful and detailed consideration regarding its implementation and communication (this exclusion from publication would only be used in exceptional circumstances). • Where the matter has been referred to our Policy group for immediate legislative clarification or rectification, as it could significantly undermine tax system integrity or government revenue, and there is a serious risk of taxpayer/customer uncertainty or exploitation if it became public knowledge. • Where the matter is purely procedural or administrative in nature, not relevant to the technical decision reached, and not likely to be of interest or relevance to taxpayers, customers or advisors. For example, matters concerning the period of a ruling would generally not be published unless it is important to the decision reached. 7. A TDS cannot be relied on by taxpayers, customers or advisors, as it is a summary of an original technical decision (rather than being the decision itself) and is published for information only. To make this clear, a disclaimer will be included on the IR tax technical website and on each published document: Disclaimer – Technical Decision Summary (TDS) This document is a summary of the original technical decision so it may not contain all the facts or assumptions relevant to that decision. This document is made available for information only and is not advice, guidance or a “Commissioner’s official opinion” (as defined in s 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). You cannot rely on this document as setting out the Commissioner’s position more generally or in relation to your own circumstances or tax affairs. It is not binding and provides you with no protection (including from underpaid tax, penalty or interest). For more information refer to the Technical decision summaries guidelines . 8. Technical decision summaries will not be routinely updated or removed by the Commissioner, as they simply document a decision made at a certain point in time. The Commissioner does not expect to routinely respond to any external comments in relation to a TDS, but this will be considered on a case by case basis. 9. Where possible we will publish the TDS within three months of the final technical decision being made (for example, when the adjudication report is sent out or the ruling is finalised). This timeframe allows sufficient time for IR to prepare the TDS 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and for the relevant taxpayer or customer to review the TDS to ensure it does not breach confidentiality or include commercially sensitive information. Preparing a technical decision summary 10. The overall objective is to prepare a summary of the original technical decision document(s) that accurately reflects the Commissioner’s decision and is suitable for publication. Technical decision summaries will include four main sections. • The facts/the arrangement. • The issue(s). • The decision(s). • The reasoning for decision(s). 11. The TDS will contain an outline of the factual situation and sufficient details of the legal analysis (including a summary of alternative arguments and case authorities) to give readers an understanding of the reasons for the technical decision. 12. Creating a TDS involves writing a summary that: • excludes or rewords information that specifically identifies the taxpayer/customer; • excludes or rewords information that may enable the identification of any taxpayer/customer. This includes individual facts that in isolation may not identify a taxpayer/customer but which, when combined with other information, may allow the identification of the taxpayer/customer; • excludes or rewords information that may enable the identification of a third party (other than in very limited situations relating to excepted third parties – see paragraph 22); • excludes or rewords confidential, commercially sensitive or otherwise sensitive information; • excludes or summarises factual detail and additional information, including background/historical information, that is unnecessary or irrelevant to the Commissioner’s decision(s) and/or reasoning; • summarises the analytical reasoning that forms the basis of the decision; and • where relevant, combines analysis from multiple related decisions into a single cohesive document. 13. To arrive at a concise and readable document, the preparer of the summary must decide what information should be excluded or summarised. The summary document must still be an accurate reflection of the underlying technical decision. 14. Generally, the TDS will be prepared by a staff member or team within TCO who was not involved in making the decision. High level governance of the TDS process will sit with TCO’s Public Advice and Guidance function, and the relevant governance committee will be the Public Advice and Guidance Committee. 15. An initial decision concerning whether to withhold any particular technical decision will be made by the person preparing the TDS, who will seek input from the 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Technical Lead, Knowledge and Development, the relevant Group Leader and/or the Chief Tax Counsel as appropriate. 16. The original project team will review the draft TDS to make sure it accurately reflects the decision made and confidentiality will not be breached by publication. Most technical decision summaries will be between 6 and 25 pages in length, with the longest representing the most complex matters. 17. Once the draft TDS has been prepared and reviewed, it will be sent to the taxpayer/customer or their authorised representative for review (for rulings, this will be the agent on the ruling application). The purpose of this review is not to obtain consent for publication, but to ensure the TDS does not breach confidentiality (that is, to ensure that the taxpayer/customer is unable to be identified) or include any commercially sensitive information. The taxpayer/customer will be expected to provide any comments on confidentiality or sensitivity within one month. If you are concerned that the TDS may still allow you to be identified, contact us within a month of the date of the letter enclosing the TDS summary at Technical.Decision.Summaries@ird.govt.nz . If you don’t contact us within the month we will publish the TDS. 18. If any comments are received, the staff member will consider these and amend the TDS to alleviate any confidentiality concerns raised by the taxpayer/customer if required. Any comments or submissions of a technical nature will not be taken into account. Once complete, the TDS is ready for publication. 19. The following diagram summarises the process (once the final technical decision and the decision to publish a TDS has been made): Specific detailed instructions for preparers of a TDS 20. The preparer of a TDS should follow these actions to achieve a concise document that ensures confidentiality: • exclude quotes from disputes documents and correspondence with the taxpayer/agent (unless directly relevant); • exclude any quotes or extracts of submissions (but ensure that all possible arguments considered in making the original decision are covered); 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • exclude full extracts of contracts, constitutions or other legal documents – include extracts from clauses only when they are directly relevant and necessary; • exclude tables (unless directly relevant/necessary). This includes tables of figures, dates, discrepancy analyses, filed tax returns, chronologies etc; • exclude matters that are not at issue or that are already agreed, ie avoid including information merely for completeness; • use bullet points to summarise issues and decisions; • where the original decision was based on extensive case law analysis, only quote directly relevant cases – the remainder can be listed/referenced with a summary of principles if useful; • limit quotes from legislation or other published material to the sections/parts that are directly relevant; • avoid duplicating material, eg executive summaries, introductory/concluding paragraphs; and • exclude ‘administrative’ matters, eg who made the decision, ability to rule analysis, consideration of protocols (such as with Crown Law), unless relevant to the reasoning or to the alternative arguments considered. 21. The preparer of the TDS must do the following: • Exclude or reword information that specifically identifies the taxpayer, including:  names (N.B. When preparing the summary, company names should be replaced with “Company A”, not “A Ltd” (as that could be the name of an actual incorporated company));  addresses;  contact numbers e.g. telephone/email;  incorporation dates;  issue dates for certificates of title and registration of mortgages;  IRD numbers;  birth dates; and  bank account/credit card details. • Exclude or reword information that may lead to the identification of the taxpayer, such as:  extracts from websites;  quotes and extracts of contracts, constitutions and other taxpayer-related entity documents that are not in the public domain;  titles, positions and status, such as director/doctor or (in the case of a company), whether listed on a particular stock exchange;  monetary amounts and currency;  dates of transactions, if significant;  geographic locations; 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\]  jurisdiction-specific legislation or treaties;  specific descriptions of work or business activity or industry involved (if identifying);  names and identifying details (e.g. relationship) of associates;  industry specific terms or details;  types and descriptions of assets, products and projects; and  unusual features of an arrangement e.g. specific performance conditions. • Exclude or reword information that may enable the identification of a third party. For example:  names/identifying details of any counterparty associated with the taxpayer e.g. purchasers, vendors, lenders, borrowers, freighters, retailers, landlords, tenants etc.;  names and any other identifying features of practitioners, legal and accounting firms, IR personnel, and IR groups who provided submissions as part of the technical decision making process;  verbatim quotes of practitioner or IR submissions;  third party verbatim quotes; and  IR information received from third party sources. • Exclude or reword confidential/sensitive information, for example:  commercially sensitive information;  tax advice;  information that is legally privileged or otherwise protected (for example under the Official Information Act 1982);  information relating to other agency or revenue authority investigations;  reference to other IR documents where the same or similar issues have been considered, unless those documents are publicly available; and  IR sensitive information e.g. business tools and thresholds. 22. Despite the above, information that identifies an “excepted third party” may be published. This relates to information about a third party that is in the public domain, where the taxpayer/customer's identity cannot be ascertained by identifying the third party and where removing the information may affect the accuracy of the TDS. Categories of information relating to third parties that may be published include the following: • The names/transactions of public companies where the information has been disclosed in:  a prospectus;  an annual report;  a media release/press conference; or  a report to a stock exchange (for example, information concerning mergers/acquisitions, share buybacks, share splits). 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • The names and products of third parties that provide goods or services to significant numbers of the public, where naming of the third party or their products could not identify the taxpayer. For example:  universities and other places of education;  clubs and associations with large memberships; or  statutory authorities, such as councils and public utilities. • Where the goods or services provided by a third party are advertised to the public, and the client base is potentially large. In this case the transaction or arrangement must be one that is very common and used by, or available to, large numbers of people or organisations. • Information which has been previously published in a publicly available IR document, such as a public ruling, determination, product ruling, media release or revenue alert.

Technical amendments to the partnership rules
=============================================

2009 amendments to the tax rules for partnerships correct technical problems with general partnership legislation, particularly for primary sector partnerships.

_**Sections EB 26B, HG 3, HG 4, HG 5, HG 6(6), HG 7(6), HG 8(6), HG 9, HG 10 and HG 11(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007**_

Several remedial amendments have been made to the tax rules for partnerships to correct several technical problems with the general partnership legislation, particularly for primary sector partnerships.

### Background

The Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008 came into force on 1 April 2008. The legislation updated the tax rules relating to general partnerships, as well as providing for flow-through tax treatment for the new "limited partnership" vehicle created by the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. The amendments were added at the Committee stage of the legislation and apply from the 2008-09 tax year.

### _Application date_

One of the amendments applies for the 2008-09 and later income years. This amendment ensures that the death of one of the spouses in a husband and wife partnership where the other spouse inherits does not give rise to immediate tax consequences for the surviving spouse. This also applies when dissolution relates to the settlement of relationship property.

All other changes apply for the 2009-10 and later income years.

### Detailed analysis

##### _Tax consequences upon the death of a spouse or relationship property settlement_

Section HG 4 has been amended for the 2008-09 and later income years to ensure that the death of one of the spouses in a husband and wife partnership does not give rise to immediate tax consequences when the surviving partner inherits from the deceased. In the absence of these rules, the partnership is treated as being dissolved where the partners are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship, and one partner dies leaving his or her interests to the other partner. Where the surviving partner inherits the deceased partner’s partnership interests there is a tax base rollover in respect of the deceased’s interests. However the partnership cessation rule treats the surviving partner as having disposed of and reacquired his or her partnership interests at market value for tax purposes. The amendment ensures that the rules that apply on the cessation of a partnership will not apply to a two-person partnership when the partners are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship, and one partner dies. A similar exemption has been provided in section HG 4 when the dissolution relates to the settlement of relationship property (for example, in the event of a divorce).

##### _Disposal of partnership interests_

Remedial amendments have been made to the general rollover relief formula. The definition of "gross tax value" in section HG 5(2)(c) has been amended by including assets whose sale or disposal does not have taxation consequences at their market value. Further, the treatment of assets, such as forestry, that have no carrying value for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been clarified.

Section HG 3 has been amended to clarify the rules around the application of the $50,000 exemption in section HG 5 and its relationship with the exemptions in sections HG 6 to HG 10. Section HG 3 clarifies that when HG 5 applies, sections HG 6 to HG 10 cannot apply.

Section HG 4(2) and (3) has also been amended to remove the need to have all partnership disposals treated as being at market value.

##### _Trading stock_

Section HG 6(1) has been amended to clarify that "quantum of turnover" is measured for the immediately preceding partnership income year.

##### _Livestock_

Amended section HG 10 provides that an incoming partner may elect to spread any difference between the price he or she paid for specified livestock that the partnership is valuing at cost when the partnership has breeding livestock.

The details for this spread are contained in new section EB 26B, which times the incoming partner’s valuation adjustment.

Section EB 26B provides that where an incoming partner has elected to spread the difference between the price he or she paid for the specified livestock and the partnership’s cost base carrying value of that livestock, then the spread shall be calculated as follows:

At the end of the income year that the incoming partner acquired the livestock:

*   The partnership will perform its specified livestock cost calculations as if the partnership had not changed.
*   To the extent the partnership is using a cost basis, the incoming partner will also calculate the value of specified livestock based on the price he or she paid.
*   At the end of the next x years, the incoming partner may amortise on a straight line basis the difference between his or her calculation of the cost of livestock and share of the partnership calculation. (NB: x is 4 when the partnership change occurred before 2 July; x is 5 when the partnership change occurred on or after 2 July.)
*   This applies only when the partnership continues to value the relevant specified livestock at cost.

##### _Minor drafting and cross-referencing corrections_

The reference to section HG 4 in section HG 4(4) has been replaced with section HG 5.

References to "small partnerships" in sections HG 5 to HG 9 have been deleted because sections HG 5 to HG 9 are elective under section HG 3(2).

References to "short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services" in section HG 9 have been replaced by "short-term agreements for sale and purchase", to be consistent with the definition in section YA 1.

Sections CB 27B and DO 11B have been consequentially repealed.

##### _Clarification of policy intent of aspects of the new partnership rules_

Further clarification on the policy intent of aspects of the new partnership rules introduced by the Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008 are discussed below.

##### _Variable profit sharing clauses_

Some partnerships contain a "variable profit sharing clause". This allows one partner’s proportionate entitlement to income from the partnership to be different to his or her share in the partnership’s assets.

It is common in professional services firms such as accounting or law firms for each partner’s rights to the profit from the partnership to fluctuate from year to year based on their individual performance, but for each partner’s share of the partnership assets remains the same. For example, 10 partners in a firm each have a share of 10% in the assets of the firm. However, the partnership agreement may provide that their right to income from the partnership is partly dependent on an individual partner’s performance during that year. Therefore, a partner who performs particularly well may be allocated 12% of the partnership’s profits from that year and a partner who performs less well may be allocated 8% of the profits.

The intent of the partnership legislation is to allow a partner’s share in the income to be different from the partner’s share in the assets for tax purposes. The definition of "partnership share" in section YA 1 accordingly refers to the "relevant share that a partner has in the rights and obligations and other property…in a partnership".

Section HG 2(2) does not prevent this outcome. Rather, section HG 2(2) prevents streaming of income, tax credits, rebates, gains, expenditure or loss of the partnership to specific partners.

##### _Non-resident partner’s partnership income_

A question has been raised regarding whether a non-resident partner deriving what would otherwise be treated as foreign-sourced income through a New Zealand partnership would be brought within the New Zealand tax net merely because:

*   the partnership is a New Zealand limited partnership formed and registered in New Zealand; or
*   the general partner is a New Zealand tax resident or has a fixed establishment in New Zealand.

Partnerships, including limited partnerships, are transparent for the purposes of the Income Tax Act by virtue of subpart HG. Therefore, as has always been the case for general partnerships, the relevant question under the residence rules (sections YD 1 to YD 3) for a person who is a partner in a partnership, is whether the individual is New Zealand-resident. Likewise, under the source rules (sections YD 4 to YD 8), the question (when it arises) is whether that person carries on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. The answer to either question would depend on the facts of the particular case.

##### _Definition of a person - income equalisation schemes_

A question has been raised regarding whether partnerships are included for the purposes of the income equalisation scheme in sections EH 3 and EH 37, as those sections refer to a "person".

Under section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, it was clear that a person includes an unincorporated body of persons (which includes a partnership). Given that section 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999 provides the rule that a reference to "person" in legislation includes an unincorporated body, this was removed from section OB 1 as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.

Technical amendments to the portfolio investment entitiy rules
==============================================================

2007 remedial changes to the new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules.

**_Sections CB 4B, CX 44C, CX 44D, DB 43B(2)(a), EG 3, EX 1(1B), HL 2, HL 3, HL 4(2), HL 5B, HL 5C, HL 6, HL 7(3), HL 9, HL 10, HL 11, HL 11b(1)(a), HL 12, HL 13, HL 16(2)(e), HL 20, HL 21, HL 23, HL 24, HL 25, HL 27, HL 31(3)(d), IG 1(2B), KD 1(1)(e)(viii), ME9(4) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections CB 26, CX 55, CX 56, DB 53, HL 2, HL 3, HL 4(2(a), HL 5B, HL 5C, HL 6, HL 7(3), HL 8, HL 9, HL 10, HL 11, HL 12, HL 13, HL 14, HL 17(2), HL 21, HL 22, HL 24, HL 25, HL 26, HL 27, HL 29, HL 33(3)(d), IC 3, MB 1(5), OB 66(2) and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 28B, 31B, 33, 38(1B), 57B and 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

A number of remedial changes have been made to the new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules.

#### Background

New tax rules for collective investment vehicles that meet the definition of a "portfolio investment entity" were enacted by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in December 2006. The rules apply from 1 October 2007.

Portfolio investment entities are not taxable on realised share gains made on New Zealand and certain Australian companies. Portfolio investment entities pay tax on investment income based on the tax rates of their investors (capped at 30% from 1 April 2008). Income earned via a portfolio investment entity generally does not affect investors' entitlements to family assistance, their student loan repayments or child support obligations.

A number of technical issues with the operation of the new rules were identified as they were implemented. Remedial amendments to the rules were made in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill in 2007, during the select committee and committee of the whole House stages.

#### Application dates

Most remedial changes contained in the Income Tax Act 2004 are effective from 1 October 2007. The effect of the new rules combined with the transitional provisions contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ensure that the portfolio investor rate will be 30% from the 2008-09 income year, to be consistent with the reduction in the company tax rate.

The remedial changes contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 are effective from the 2008-09 income year.

#### Detailed analysis

**Re-organisation of sections HL 2 and HL 3**

Sections HL 2 and HL 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 have been replaced. These new provisions are intended to convey more clearly the overall structure and scheme of the portfolio investment entity tax rules.

**Investor requirements**

**Investor requirements for superannuation schemes that are declining in size**

Under the previous rules, problems could arise when superannuation funds that were established before introduction of the portfolio investment entity rules decreased in size. Because the number of investors in the fund can fall, the fund can fall below the investor requirements in sections HL 6 and 9 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. This was a particular problem for existing superannuation funds because their trust deeds may not have sufficient flexibility to reorganise the membership of their funds so that this does not happen.

Superannuation funds that were in existence before the introduction of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 on 17 May 2006 are therefore not required to meet the investor test, provided that no investor (other than the fund's manager or trustee) can control the investment decisions relating to any of the entity's funds. This applies only to superannuation funds that, if they were unit trusts, meet or would have once met paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the definition of "qualifying unit trust".

**Qualifying unit trust safe harbour applies to portfolio investor class**

To qualify as a portfolio investment entity, an entity must generally meet the investor membership requirement in section HL 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 and the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. There are exemptions to these requirements if the entity, if it were a unit trust, would meet the requirements of one or more of paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the "qualifying unit trust"definition. These exemptions are designed to provide widely held savings vehicles with more certainty that they will meet the portfolio investment entity eligibility requirements. These exemptions previously applied if the entity could satisfy the qualifying unit trust definition. The problem with this was that it could result in a portfolio investor class of a qualifying entity gaining portfolio investment entity status even though that particular class is not widely held. This is inconsistent with the policy intent of the rules. Therefore, these exemptions have been amended so that each "portfolio investor class", rather than the entity itself, is required to meet paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the definition of "qualifying unit trust"(if the entity were a unit trust).

**Investors can benefit differently from proceeds of a portfolio investment if difference only due to different tax rates**

For a group of investors to constitute a single "portfolio investor class"each investor must participate equally (in proportion to their percentage holding in the fund) in the underlying investments of the fund. An issue arises where the portfolio investment entity holds financial arrangements that provide investors with capital guarantees. Typically, under these arrangements if investors suffer a capital loss over the investment term the portfolio investment entity exercises the capital guarantee and receives a taxable amount that, after application of investors' portfolio investor rates, is sufficient to compensate each investor for their capital loss.

As investors can have different portfolio investor rates there is an argument that this results in investors potentially having different interests in a portfolio entity investment (the capital guarantee being the portfolio entity investment). In many cases, the financial arrangement that provides the capital guarantee would not be a portfolio entity investment as the arrangement would not generally be entered into with the prospect of deriving a positive return. People who invest in a portfolio investment entity that holds such a capital guarantee should not be prevented from being part of the same portfolio investor class merely because they have different portfolio investor rates.

The definition of "portfolio investor class"in section HL 5B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has therefore been clarified so that investors can benefit differently from the proceeds of a portfolio entity investment in the case of a capital guaranteed investment if that difference results only from the application of different portfolio investor rates over the term of the investment.

**Exception to investor membership requirement if** **Auckland** **Regional Holdings is an investor**

The investor membership requirement in section HL 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to allow a portfolio investor class to qualify if it has fewer than 20 investors if one of the investors is "Auckland Regional Holdings". The reason for providing this exception is that current exceptions apply for similar government-owned entities, such as the Accident Compensation Corporation, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and Earthquake Commission.

**Exception to investor interest size requirement if** **Auckland** **Regional Holdings is an investor**

The investor interest size requirement in section HL 9(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to allow Auckland Regional Holdings to hold an interest in a portfolio investment entity that would otherwise cause the portfolio investment entity to breach the investor interest size requirement. The reason for providing this exception is that current exceptions apply for similar government-owned entities, such as the Accident Compensation Corporation, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and Earthquake Commission.

#### Investment type requirements

**Investment type requirements include land not currently in use**

Section HL 10(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 requires that an entity must use or have available to use 90 percent or more by value of the entity's assets in deriving income from owning an interest in land. This section has been amended to ensure that the provision covers land that is not currently in use, but will be in the future. An example of this is when land is vacant or when property is under construction. This has been done by removing the current income derivation wording. Therefore, the investment type requirement is that 90 percent or more by value of the entity's assets must be qualifying assets.

**Operating expenses for land**

The following amendments have been made:

*   section HL 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to include replacement payments;
*   section HL 10(2)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to include payments from lessees that relate to their interest in land, such as operating expenses; and
*   section HL 10(2)(iv) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that it is clear that the provision only captures proceeds from the disposal of property referred to in section HL 10(1).

**Investments in other portfolio investment entities not taken into account for the entity shareholding investment requirement**

Section HL 10(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that it is clear that investments in PIEs and certain other collective investment vehicles are not considered when applying the shareholding investment requirements in sectionHL10(3).

#### Portfolio listed companies

**Qualifying unit trust requirement removed for portfolio listed companies**

Previously, under section HL 11B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007, an unlisted company must have met the requirements of paragraph (a) of the definition of "qualifying unit trust"in order to be treated as a portfolio listed company. This requirement has been replaced with a requirement in section HL 11B of the 2004 Act and section HL 12 of

the Income Tax Act 2007 that the company has at least 100 shareholders, as this ensures that the company is widely held.

**Taxation of trustee income**

The policy underlying the portfolio investment entity rules is that the maximum tax rate on any investor in a portfolio investment entity should be 30% from 1 April 2008. Previously section CX 44D(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 could result in a trustee investor in a portfolio listed company being taxed at 33% on their imputed income from the portfolio listed company. As this treatment is not consistent with the policy intent, the law has been changed so that New Zealand-resident trustee investors in portfolio listed companies are treated the same as individual New Zealand-resident investors in respect of imputed income from portfolio listed companies and are taxed at 30% from 1 April 2008.

#### Portfolio land companies should be subject to the income type requirement

Portfolio investment entities can own and lease land and buildings to active businesses as long as they are not themselves active businesses. Examples of non-active businesses include listed property trusts that own commercial property.

The income type requirement in section HL 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the majority of the entity's income must be passive income, such as dividends, interest and rent.

Currently, this requirement does not apply to a portfolio land company, which is a subsidiary of a portfolio investment entity. This is contrary to the policy intent of the rules. The definition of "portfolio land company"in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has therefore been amended to ensure that it must meet the requirement in section HL10(2).

#### Superannuation funds: transfer of unvested contributions if vesting schedule is longer than five years

Section HL 16(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 17(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to cater for superannuation schemes that existed on or before 17 May 2006, and where investors' interests have been transferred to a new scheme that came into being after 17 May 2006. Under the amended rules, the new superannuation fund can apply a member's prescribed investor rate to unvested employer contributions regardless of the length of the vesting period. The transfer must be from a superannuation scheme that existed before 17 May 2006 to a new superannuation scheme, and there must be no change in substance to the benefits a member will receive from unvested contributions. If these conditions are met, the income from unvested employer contributions will continue to be taxed as if the transfer had not occurred. This means that income relating to the unvested contributions will continue to be taxed at the portfolio investor's rate.

#### Changing December due date to 15 January

Section HL 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended so that any due date for a return or payment which falls on 31 December is changed to the following 15 January.

#### Tax calculation

**Zero-rated investor deduction should refer to the portfolio tax rate entity's tax year**

Section DB 43B(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section DB 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that zero-rated and certain exiting investors in portfolio investment entities are generally allowed a tax deduction for losses that flow through to them from those portfolio investment entities. Currently, the provision requires investors in "quarterly zero"portfolio tax rate entities (portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL21 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007) to recognise such losses in the investor's income year that includes the end of the portfolio investment entity's portfolio calculation period (usually a quarter). To maintain consistency with other similar provisions in the rules, section DB 43B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section DB 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to provide that the investor has a deduction for the amount of portfolio investor allocated loss in the investor's income year that includes the end of the portfolio investment entity's income year.

**Definition of "portfolio investor rate"**

The definition of "portfolio investor rate"in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that the portfolio investor rate applies to a portfolio allocation period rather than a portfolio calculation period. This will also clarify that if an investor notifies a correction to their portfolio investor rate at any time during the year, the new portfolio investor rate will apply to any amount for which the tax liability has not already been calculated.

Paragraph (b)(ii) has been amended so that the "portfolio investor rate"is the rate that the investor notifies the entity as their prescribed investor rate, and that notification is the latest notification. The "portfolio investor rate"for the investor is the latest notified prescribed investor rate at the time the entity calculates the portfolio entity tax liability for the investor and their income, or calculates a payment under section HL23B of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section HL 25(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 that they intend to be a final payment of the portfolio entity tax liability.

**Option to not use excess foreign tax credits from one portfolio investor class to offset tax from other portfolio investor classes**

The intention of the rules is that portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies should be allowed, but not required, to use excess foreign tax credits received for an investor from one portfolio investor class against the tax liability of that investor from other portfolio investor classes. This flexible approach is appropriate as the sophistication of systems will vary across providers. It was not clear whether section HL 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section HL 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies with the option of not using excess foreign tax credits from one portfolio investor class to offset tax from other portfolio investor classes. Section HL27(10B)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 29(11)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been clarified to provide this flexibility.

**Foreign tax credits**

It is common for people to hold a portfolio of investments via a custodian. These are often referred to as "wrap accounts"and provide investors with the same benefits of direct ownership of the underlying investments. In addition, the custodian will often provide a range of investment services including, in some cases, the deduction of resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends and interest.

The portfolio of investments that the custodian holds for the investor is likely to include interests in managed funds. The portfolio investment entity rules have been designed so that a custodian (referred to in the legislation as a "portfolio investor proxy") can calculate tax on behalf of its investors when someone invests through a custodian into an underlying portfolio investment entity. This is consistent with the current tax treatment for wrap accounts, because the custodian is likely to be deducting RWT for the investor on the investor's non-portfolio investment entity investments.

The rules achieve this treatment by the portfolio investment entity applying a zero percent tax rate to the portfolio investment entity income earned on behalf of the portfolio investor proxy, with the portfolio investment entity income flowing through to the portfolio investor proxy. The portfolio investor proxy is then required to calculate and deduct tax on that income as if the portfolio investor proxy were a portfolio investment entity. Broadly, this means that the portfolio investor proxy can treat the person's separate investments in underlying portfolio investment entities as if they were a single investment in an underlying portfolio investment entity. The person's separate investments in underlying portfolio investment entities, from the perspective of the portfolio investor proxy, are treated as separate portfolio investor classes in the same portfolio investment entity. This approach allows the rules relating to investor exit, use of tax credits and losses to work appropriately.

The problem with the rules as originally enacted was that a portfolio investor proxy's foreign tax credits were restricted to the lesser of the allocated credits or the maximum tax liability on the allocated income. The tax credit rules in section HL 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have therefore been amended so that portfolio investor proxies can use the full amount of foreign tax credits received from portfolio investment entity investments to offset tax on portfolio investment entity income. This aligns the foreign tax credit rules that apply to portfolio investor proxies investing in portfolio investment entities with those applying to portfolio tax rate entities that invest in other portfolio investment entities.

**Portfolio investor proxies can satisfy PIE tax on behalf of investors by directly accessing cash accounts**

Under the rules, portfolio tax rate entities will generally pay tax on behalf of investors by reducing investors' interests in the portfolio investment entity. In contrast, some portfolio investor proxies have been structured to pay portfolio investment entity tax on behalf of investors by directly accessing the cash accounts that investors hold with the portfolio investor proxy. There is no policy reason why a portfolio investor proxy should not be able to satisfy portfolio investment entity tax on behalf of its investors in this way, and section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007, and section HL 31 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and HL 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to explicitly provide for this option.

**Portfolio investor rate that is lower than the prescribed investor rate**

Previously, section CX 44D of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007 could be interpreted so that the portfolio investor allocated income of an investor for the year was not excluded income if the investor had provided the portfolio investment entity at the start of the year with a portfolio investor rate that was lower than their prescribed investor rate. This could result in portfolio investor allocated income being taxed to investors even if the investor had provided their correct rate before the portfolio investment entity performed a final tax calculation for the investor. Therefore, section CX 44D of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended so that portfolio investor allocated income remains excluded income for a year and the portfolio investment entity applies the investor's correct rate when performing a final tax calculation or a calculation under section HL23B of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section HL 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that the entity intends to be final. This ensures that portfolio investor allocated income will continue to be excluded income to the investor if the investor provides to the portfolio investment entity a portfolio investor rate that is lower than their prescribed investor rate and the portfolio investment entity has not subjected that income to a final tax calculation.

**Timing of receipt of tax credits**

Section HL 27(6) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 29(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to ensure that credits for both zero-rated investors and exiting investors are treated as being received in the investor's income year that includes the end of the portfolio investment entity's income year. This ensures that the same timing rules apply to receipt of credits for both zero-rated investors and exiting investors.

**Allocation of credits by portfolio tax rate entities**

Section EG 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 allows portfolio investment entities to recognise amounts for tax purposes at the same time they recognise those amounts for unit pricing and financial reporting purposes. The section has been clarified so that it allocates tax credits to the same period as the income to which the credits relate.

#### Investor expenditure

Section HL 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to ensure that expenditure transferred from an investor under subpart DV is deductible as investor expenditure under section HL 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section HL 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This allows a non-portfolio investment entity superannuation fund that invests in a portfolio tax rate entity to gain the benefit of a deduction for the expenditure at the portfolio tax rate entity level.

#### Exiting investors

**Accommodation of partial withdrawals and switches within the same portfolio investment entity**

Section HL 23B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 now accommodate partial withdrawals and switches between investor classes within the same portfolio investment entity. The previous wording of section HL 23B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 could be interpreted as only applying when an investor reduces their total interest in the portfolio investment entity. The provision has therefore been amended so that it is clear that it applies when an investor switches their investment from one class in the portfolio investment entity to another class in the same portfolio investment entity.

**Exiting investors do not have to return excess tax credits**

Section HL 27(9) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 29(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been repealed to ensure that exiting investors do not have to return excess tax credits.

Under the previous section HL 27(9) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 29(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007, investors in portfolio tax rate entities needed to return any excess New Zealand tax credits in their tax return if they exceeded the investor's share of the portfolio entity tax liability for the portfolio investor exit period. This was contrary to the policy intention that investors in portfolio tax rate entities should have no further tax obligations if they fully exit a fund, and any excess tax credits should be rebated to the entity.

#### Grouping rules

**Portfolio investment entities can be part of a group**

Section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section IC3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended so that the grouping provisions can apply to a group of companies if the only entities in the group are portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio land companies. The grouping rules can apply only when a portfolio tax rate entity parent owns 100 percent of the voting interests in the portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio land companies.

**Portfolio investment entities can be part of a group for GST purposes**

Section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act has been amended to allow portfolio investment entities to be part of a group for GST purposes. Portfolio investment entities can be part of a group for GST purposes if they would have been eligible to be a group for income tax purposes (in the absence of the prohibition on portfolio tax rate entities being part of a group under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004).

**Portfolio investment entity income does not affect family tax credits for exiting investors**

Section KD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section MB 1(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to ensure that portfolio investment entity income will not affect family tax credits for exiting investors who are required to file tax returns for their portfolio investment entity income. This reflects the policy that portfolio investment entity income should not affect family tax credits.

#### Cancellation of shares

Section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that a fund can cancel units at any time up to the end of the relevant period. The current references to "period"in section HL 7(3)(a) have also been made consistent.

#### Exclusion of Australasian share gains

**Anti-avoidance rule**

The Act has introduced new section CX 44C(1)(c) to the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 55(1C) to the Income Tax Act 2007, which provide that the Australasian share gains exclusion does not apply when the gain on the share was guaranteed. This anti-avoidance rule was originally contained in proposed section CX 44C(d) in clause 12 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 as introduced. It was intended that this provision be amended to focus on the time of acquisition of the relevant share, but this provision was inadvertently omitted at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage of the bill. Accordingly, the provision has been reinstated.

**Disposal of certain shares by a portfolio investment entity after declaration of a dividend**

Section CB 4B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CB 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide that when a share is sold between the date a dividend is declared and the date it is paid, an amount representing the unimputed dividend must be included in the portfolio investment entity income calculation. The section has been amended so this applies on a net basis.

**New Zealand** **Superannuation Fund subject to dividend stripping rule**

Under section CX 44C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) has been provided with the exclusion from tax on gains from the disposal of New Zealand and certain Australian shares. This is the same exclusion that portfolio investment entities benefit from. Section CB 4B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CB 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have therefore been amended so that the dividend stripping rule applies to the NZSF, in the same way that it applies to portfolio investment entities.

#### Filing and information requirements

**Resident investors should be required to advise the portfolio tax rate entity of a tax file number**

Section 28B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to require that all New Zealand-resident investors investing in a portfolio tax rate entity provide their tax file number to the entity.

This amendment applies from 1 April 2008.

**Timeframe for providing information to zero-rated portfolio investors**

Section 31B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to specify a timeframe for providing information to zero-rated portfolio investors. A portfolio tax rate entity must now give notice before the end of the one-month period beginning after the period to which the notice relates

**Provision of information - "annual provisional tax"portfolio investment entities with non-standard balance dates**

Section 31B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended so that it caters for "annual provisional tax"portfolio tax rate entities (portfolio investment entities that pay tax under section HL 22 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007) with non-standard balance dates.

**Returns by portfolio tax rate entities and section HL 23B payments**

Section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to require that optional payments of tax made by portfolio tax rate entities under section HL 23B of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section HL 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are made with a tax return.

**Changing December due date to 15 January**

Section 57B(3)(a)(ii) has been amended and new section 57B(3B) introduced so that any due date for a return or payment which falls on 31 December should be changed to the following 15 January. This applies to returns or payments made by an "annual exitor" portfolio tax rate entity (portfolio investment entities that pay tax under section HL 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL24 the Income Tax Act 2007).

This is consistent with a number of provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts that provide that if the due date for a return or payment falls on 31 December, that due date is changed to the following 15 January.

**Assessments for "quarterly zero"and "annual exitor"portfolio tax rate entities**

New section 33(1C) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an assessment for "quarterly zero"and "annual exitor" portfolio tax rate entities which have provided the tax returns required under section 57B.

Section 57B (7) has been inserted to require quarterly zero and annual exitor portfolio tax rate entities that make optional payments in terms of section HL 23B to file a tax return if one was not already being filed for the period.

#### Transitional issues

**Imputation credits earned before entity was a portfolio investment entity**

Section ME 9(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section OB 66(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended. The amendment allows an entity to the end of the income year in which it becomes a portfolio investment entity to pay any further income tax that arose from a debit balance in its imputation credit account at the time it stops being an imputation credit account company and becomes a portfolio investment entity. This ensures that a portfolio investment entity can distribute the benefit of imputation credits to its investors when those imputation credits have arisen from the entity's tax obligations before it became a portfolio investment entity.

**Removal of penalties and interest when provisional tax increased as a result of becoming a portfolio investment entity**

Section HL 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 14 the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to provide relief in situations when an increased provisional tax liability arises due to an entity becoming a portfolio investment entity. Without this amendment, portfolio investment entities with investments in other portfolio investment entities that are zero-rated and exempt from resident withholding tax may incur an increased provisional tax liability. Entities with a standard balance date that elect to become portfolio investment entities on 1 October 2007 would have had their first provisional tax payment due on 7 July 2007, so could not have prevented an underpayment.

This relief applies for provisional tax payments that have already been made for the income year in which the transition occurs, and any provisional payments falling due within the two months of becoming a portfolio investment entity.

**Share lending rules and deemed sale and reacquisition of Australian shares**

Under section HL 12(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007, there is a deemed sale and reacquisition of Australian shares held at the time an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity. This provision ensures that any gain or loss on Australian shares that are held on revenue account by entities becoming portfolio investment entities is realised at the time of entry into the PIE rules. Before this amendment, section HL 12(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 referred to "shares held by the entity". This wording may not have captured shares subject to share lending transactions whereby shares are lent shortly before an entity enters into the portfolio investment entity rules (the earliest date being 1October 2007) and reacquired after that date. The share lending rules could have prevented a tax liability arising for the intending portfolio investment entity. This is because the shares are not held by the intending portfolio investment entity on the transition date and therefore would not have been caught by section HL 12(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The share lending rules themselves would prevent there being a taxable event on the date the shares are lent and the Australasian share trading exclusion for portfolio investment entities in section CX 44C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would still seem to apply when the relevant shares are eventually sold.

Section HL 12(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section HL 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have therefore been amended to ensure that for the purposes of that provision any original share subject to a returning share transfer is treated as being held by the share supplier (that is, the intending portfolio investment entity) and not by the share user. The treatment of any dividend paid on the lent shares will continue unchanged - that is, the dividend will be taxable to the share user under ordinary rules with the replacement payment for dividends being deductible to the share user and taxable to the share supplier.

#### Minor drafting corrections

A number of amendments have been made to correct minor drafting and cross-referencing errors. The key amendments are:

*   Section CX 44D(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 56(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to make it clear that they apply to a dividend from a portfolio tax rate entity or a portfolio listed company that is not a distribution.
*   Section HL 4(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended so that an entity ceases to be eligible to be a portfolio investment entity only if a portfolio investor class of the entity fails to meet a requirement under sections HL 6 or HL 9 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments will ensure consistency with sections HL 6 and HL9 which apply on a portfolio investor class basis. The failure to meet a requirement under section HL 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 is tested on an entity basis as the section HL 10 requirements apply on this basis.
*   The references to "tax year"in section HL7(3)(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 have been replaced with a reference to the entity's "income year".
*   An amendment has been made to section HL 12 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 providing that for the purposes of section NH4(5)(f) the relevant DWP account credit balance is that existing immediately before the entity becomes a portfolio investment entity on 1 October 2007. An entity becoming a portfolio investment entity is not able to receive a refund of DWP it has paid under section NH 4(5) (which allows a refund of DWP when a company ends up with a net loss for an income year). In particular, section NH 4(5)(f) provides that the DWP refund cannot exceed the company's DWP account credit balance at the end of the imputation year - in this case 31 March 2008. In the case of a company which became a portfolio investment entity on 1October 2007, its credit balance will be nil, which will prevent a DWP refund being made. If the company had not become a portfolio investment entity it could have received a refund of DWP.
*   The definition of "portfolio land company" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires that 90 percent of the company's assets must be land assets and that this must be the case for 80 percent of the year. This requirement has been changed so that it will be met if it is for 80 percent or more of the year.
*   Section 57B(1)(b) has been reworded to clarify due dates at the end of the calendar year for certain portfolio investment entities.

#### Drafting consistency with core provisions

The following drafting amendments have been made to ensure that the portfolio investment entity rules interact correctly with the Income Tax Act's core provisions and are consistent with the rewrite of that Act:

*   Sections HL 21 and HL 23 of the 2004 Act have been amended to clarify that the income tax liability of quarterly zero portfolio tax rate entities and annual exitor portfolio tax rate entities is equal to the portfolio entity tax liability for the portfolio calculation periods in the tax year.
*   Section HL 22 of the 2007 Act has been amended to clarify that the income tax liability of annual provisional tax portfolio tax rate entities is equal to the portfolio entity tax liability for the portfolio calculation periods in the tax year.
*   Portfolio investment entity rebates for excess credits and losses have been excluded from the section OB 1 definition of allowable rebates in the 2004 Act.

Technology landscape optimisation
=================================

A team was established early in the transformation to focus on optimising Inland Revenue’s technology landscape, and ensure a stable, simplified and up-to-date landscape was in place when the transformation come to an end. In some cases, this entailed introducing solutions which would be fit for use for years to come, in other cases migrating existing technologies to more sustainable locations.

The programme comprised multiple projects, all working toward the same goal. Project managers were appointed to each separate project, who all reported into 1 programme manager. Much of the work was detailed planning and vendor/supplier management. As the team was operating in a very busy landscape, often with time constraints, it was necessary to have a detailed view of the tasks to be undertaken by vendors and suppliers and ensuring that any dependencies were clear. The programme team (all project managers, co-ordinator, testing, security, communications and change leads) met weekly to ensure there was visibility of all activity at a project level. This was also an opportunity to identify synergies or potential conflicts.

A few of the projects completed include:

*   Corporate telephony replacement- replacement of desk phones, phones in meeting rooms and audio/video conferencing capability with Microsoft Teams.
*   Upgrading IR’s Wi-Fi capability.
*   Print services replacement - introduction of a Cloud-based print solution.
*   Security and network uplifts, as well as identity and access management technology replacement.
*   Migration of IR’s contact centre technology to another data centre.

How we approached change
------------------------

Many of the changes were implemented behind the scenes, with minimal disruption to the business or Inland Revenue customers.

Knowledge of systems infrastructure and security requirements was critical and project managers worked hand-in-hand with technology specialists to plan and deliver outcomes, ensuring other systems and applications were not affected.

In other cases, where technology replacement affected all IR people, a staggered approach was taken to minimise disruption. A soft launch or pilot approach was taken which entailed implementing the technology/solution at 1 office, refining the approach, then deploying to the remaining Inland Revenue offices. This facilitated speedy implementation once the tried and tested approach had been defined.

It’s important to maintain visibility of other change taking place in the organisation at the same time. Due to change fatigue and multiple changes taking place at the same time, the effects of relatively minor changes can be easily underestimated.

Leaders play an important role in leading change so encourage leaders to guide people through the change. Build strong working relationships with leader and network groups to ensure people understand upcoming changes.

Collaborating for success
-------------------------

Working with business stakeholders to identify dependencies and systems connections was very important. With many of the key project stakeholders being from different business segments/departments, having 1 collaboration platform (e.g. Microsoft Teams), where all team members could collaborate and converse proved very useful. Regular connect sessions and continuous engagement was key to the successful delivery of these projects. Some projects were delivered as part of the transformation, while others were happening as part of a regular business process. This made it very important to keep connecting on these initiatives to prevent duplication of effort or causing confusion.

All project documentation was held centrally in a project specific repository, in this case Microsoft Teams. This ensured all project team members had access to the latest copies of documents, specifications etc. It was also important that the document filing system was simple and easy to navigate.

Engagement, communication and information sharing
-------------------------------------------------

Stakeholder engagement was tracked and documented formally. Messaging was simple and only delivered by designated project or business representatives, to ensure it remained consistent.

With many acronyms being used across technology projects, a key learning was that technical terms and language had to be clearly defined to ensure everyone had a common understanding of what they meant. In many cases, a glossary of terms was created.

Not everyone reads information in one place, so we shared our messaging across multiple channels so people were aware of the change, no matter how small.

Template avoidance scheme assessments confirmed
===============================================

2009 case note - Tax avoidance template scheme; repetition of arguments already dealt with by the Courts; CIR's assessments confirmed.

Case

TRA Decision Number 1/2009

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976, section 99

### Summary

Tax avoidance template scheme; repetition of arguments already dealt with by the Courts; Commissioner's assessments confirmed.

### Impact of decision

This matter is largely confined to its own facts although it confirms the Commissioner's view of this particular tax avoidance scheme.

### Facts

This is the final judgment arising from an interim decision delivered on 26 November 2007 (Case Y20 (2008) 23 NZTC 13, 207). As part of the interim decision Barber J reserved leave for the parties to make further submissions and raise any new issues. Further submissions were received and conferences were held prior to the judgment being issued.

The judgment deals with income tax assessments against three groups of taxpayers ("the objectors") covering the 1986 to 1991 income years. This matter arose as the result of reassessments issued to the objectors to counteract a tax advantage obtained by them under a tax avoidance arrangement pursuant to section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("the Act"). Objections were filed in relation to the Commissioners' reassessments.

All issues in this case relate to participation by the objectors in what is well-known as the **Russell Tax Avoidance Templates**. Broadly, during the early 1980s Mr Russell commenced acquiring profitable companies and businesses through agents or nominee companies. The vendors were required to provide 100 percent vendor finance but were given a premium on their share price and an option to repurchase the assets of the business conducted by their company at a later date should they wish to. It was pleaded that the purpose of the option was to give those vendors an assurance that they would not lose their livelihood if the new venture was not as profitable as anticipated.

The operating company became a member of the Russell Group of companies which had associated companies with tax losses available to be carried forward. The template technique involved a management contract whereby a Russell entity provided services to the operating company which then became liable to pay administrative charges and consultancy fees to the Russell entities.

It was accepted by the Commissioner that the objectors were not aware of the Russell business empire and were not aware of the arrangements to utilise tax losses in this group. The vendor objectors never received the income of the subsidiary trading company, which had previously been their company. It was also accepted the objectors entered into these transactions to acquire capital gain on the sale of the business or business entity to the Russell group and to obtain continuing administrative and financial assistance after that.

### Decision

Most of the issues and arguments raised by the objectors subsequent to the interim decision were identical or very similar to issues and arguments which have been conclusively dealt with in either the interim decision itself or in other litigation involving the Russell tax avoidance scheme. Barber J disposed of most of the issues raised by reference to his earlier findings or those of the appellate courts.

**Issue estoppel**  
Barber J noted that this was a repetition/recycling of the arguments by the objectors which had been dealt with over and over again in successive Russell cases. The Privy Counsel and the Court of Appeal had both dealt with this issue in **O'Neil v CIR** (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051 (PC) and **Wire Supplies v CIR** (2007) 23 NZTC 21,404 respectively as did Barber J himself in the interim decision. His Honour agreed with counsel for the Commissioner that repetition of arguments by the objectors is an abuse of process and saw no circumstances for not applying estoppel in the present case.

**Evidential requirements - Peterson v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19, 098 (PC)**  
This issue had already been dealt with in the interim decision and Barber J refused to re-open that issue.

The effect of section 99(4) of the Act This issue had already been dealt with in the interim decision and Barber J refused to re-open that issue.

**Statute bar**  
This issue had already been dealt with in the interim decision and Barber J refused to re-open that issue. Barber J noted that this issue was dealt with by the Privy Council in **O'Neil** and the Court of Appeal in **Wire Supplies** and agreed with counsel for the Commissioner that to allow repetition of these arguments by the objectors would be an abuse of process.

**The standard allowance to each objector company in respect of the consulting fee**  
This issue was substantively dealt with in the interim decision, though certain allowances were made for companies which were previously struck off where there was leave to restore those entities to the companies register.

**Whether the Commissioner had identified the scheme and had shown that it had the purpose or effect of tax avoidance**  
This issue was fully dealt with in the interim decision and in appellate courts and was not re-opened.

**The exhaustion of the Commissioner's discretion issue**  
This issue was dealt with in the interim decision and in **Wire Supplies**. Barber J found that the objectors were simply trying to re-litigate old issues and declined to deal with it.

**Additional taxes**  
Barber J noted this issue was comprehensively dealt with in Wire Supplies and also in Withey v CIR (No 2) (1998) 18 NZTC 13,732. These cases confirmed there was no right of objection in relation to additional taxes and those decisions applied to all of the Russell template objectors.

**Sundry**  
With regard to Consultant Applications, Mr Russell submitted the arrangement differed from the other template cases because it involved the purchase of a business from an Australian owner. Barber J declined to re-open this issue because the purchase of the business from an Australian vendor did not have any material effect on the outcome of the template application.

The objectors in the three groups were unavailable to show that there respective assessments were incorrect or flawed in any way. All assessments were confirmed.

Temporary exemption for transitional residents
==============================================

2006 amendment to the rules for the temporary exemption for transitional residents corrects technical difficulties identified in the original legislation.

##### Sections FC 23, FC 24, KD 3, KD4, NF 1, NF 2, OB 1 and OE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 87(2) and (3) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006

The rules for the temporary exemption for transitional residents have been amended to correct certain technical difficulties identified after the original legislation introducing the exemption had been enacted.

### Background

The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 introduced a tax exemption for transitional residents (see _[Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 18 No. 5](/internet/ird/aboutir/newsletters/tib/previous-volumes/tax-information-bulletin-vol-18.html)
_ June 2006, from page 103). The exemption is available to people coming to live in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 for the first time or after an extended absence. It lasts for four years after migration and covers most types of foreign income.

The legislation has been amended to deal with various technical issues that came to light after enactment. The timing and eligibility rules for the exemption have been changed to avoid a potential mismatch with the tax residence rules for individuals. Facility for a person to elect not to be a transitional resident has been introduced and changes have been made to clarify that resident withholding tax does not have to be deducted from interest and dividends - covered by the exemption.

### Key features

#### Changes to the timing and eligibility rules for the exemption

There are two ways a person can become tax-resident in New Zealand under section OE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004: by acquiring a permanent place of abode here or by being present in the country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. Where the 183-day rule applies, a person becomes tax-resident from the first of those 183 days.

Under the previous legislation, a person qualified for the exemption only after they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Focusing on permanent place of abode was intended to avoid situations where people qualified for the exemption "too soon" - for example, where a temporary visit to New Zealand before actual migration triggered tax residence under the 183-day rule. However, this approach allowed for a potential mismatch between the rules for the exemption and the general tax residence rules: in certain circumstances, a person could become tax-resident in New Zealand without qualifying for the exemption. The timing and eligibility rules for the exemption contained in sections FC 23 and FC 24 of the Income Tax Act 2004 have therefore been amended as follows:

*   To avoid the possibility that a person may become resident for tax purposes without qualifying for the exemption, the eligibility and timing rules for the exemption have been aligned with the general tax-residence rules.
*   To resolve issues associated with people qualifying for the exemption too soon, any backdating under the 183-day residence rule is ignored for the purposes of the eligibility rules and time-limit for the exemption.

#### Opting out of the exemption

In certain circumstances, a person may be better off not receiving the exemption - for example, if they have foreign losses, wish to claim family assistance, or have little or no foreign income and prefer to defer their claim. It was therefore always intended that people should be able to choose whether or not to receive the exemption. The original legislation did not allow people to make this choice. A mechanism has been introduced in section FC 4 to allow taxpayers to opt out of the exemption if they wish.

#### Resident withholding tax

Resident withholding tax is required to be deducted from interest and dividends paid to New Zealand residents. Resident withholding tax applies to "resident withholding income", as defined by sections NF 1 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Under the original legislation, there was nothing that removed foreign-sourced interest and dividends accruing to a transitional resident from this definition. In certain circumstances - such as when an agent received such income on behalf of a transitional resident - this could mean that withholding tax had to be deducted, notwithstanding that there was no underlying liability. To avoid this, the definition of resident withholding income has been amended to exclude income covered by the exemption. In addition, section NF 2 now makes it clear that an agent is normally able to rely on a statement by a client that income is covered by the exemption for the purposes of deciding whether or not to deduct resident withholding tax.

### Application date

The changes apply retrospectively, for the 2005-06 and later income years. Transitional provision has been made to ensure that people are not disadvantaged as a result.

### Detailed analysis

#### Section FC 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004

Section FC 23 sets out the general requirements for being a transitional resident. A number of changes have been made to this section.

The requirement, in paragraph (a), that a person must have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand has been replaced. The requirement now is to be tax-resident in New Zealand.

Paragraph (b) limits the exemption to people who have not lived in New Zealand for at least 10 years (the nonresidence period). This provision has been amended so that the test is now applied by reference to the date a person satisfies the requirements in section OE 1(1) or (2) - that is, the date on which the person obtains a permanent place of abode or their 184th day of presence within a 12- month period, whichever is the earlier. Applying this test by reference to the date on which section OE 1(1) or (2) is satisfied rather than the date from which tax residence begins, ensures that people are not disqualified under the 10-year rule merely because of backdated residence under section OE 1(2). This could happen, for example, if a person returned to live in New Zealand after the required non-residence period, but had visited New Zealand for a holiday a few months before doing so.

There are two limbs to paragraph (b). Sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) are independent tests and a person can satisfy the required non-residence period provided they meet one, both, or a combination of the tests for at least 10 years.

Sub-paragraph (i) focuses on whether a person satisfied the requirements of section OE 1(1) or (2). This avoids the problems associated with backdated residency.

Sub-paragraph (ii) focuses on whether a person was resident in New Zealand. It is possible for a person to be non-resident by virtue of section OE 1(3) even while they satisfy section OE 1(2) (see Public Information Bulletin 180, June 1989). Sub-paragraph (ii) ensures that deemed non-residence under section OE 1(3) can be counted towards the required non-residence period.

Paragraphs (c) and (d) together ensure that a person may only qualify once as a transitional resident. Paragraph (c) requires that a person must not have been a transitional resident before the non-residence period. New paragraph (d) focuses on the period after the non-residence period. It ensures that a person who ceases to be a transitional resident for any reason cannot subsequently satisfy section FC 23, even if they meet the other criteria. The usual application of paragraph (d) will be when a person elects to stop being a transitional resident under section FC 24 (3).

#### Sections FC 24 and KD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004

Section FC 24 has been entirely rewritten. It deals, in particular, with the period of exemption and elections not to receive the exemption.

Subsection (2) provides that the period for which a person is a transitional resident begins on the first day of taxresidence in New Zealand and lasts for up to 48 months from the end of the month in which the person satisfies the requirements in section OE 1(1) or (2). The effect is that the starting point for the exemption is aligned with the start of a person’s tax-residence in New Zealand - including when the period of tax residence has been backdated by virtue of section OE 1(2) - but any backdating is ignored for the purposes of the time limit for the exemption.

Subsections (3) to (7) provide a mechanism whereby a person can elect not to be a transitional resident. The deadline for making an election is set out in subsections (6) and (7). This has been aligned with the deadline for making a return for the relevant tax year (a later deadline applies for 2005-06). Transitional residents and their partners are not eligible to receive family assistance. Accordingly, an application by a transitional resident for a tax credit under subpart KD is deemed by subsections (4) and (5) to be an election not to be a transitional resident by that person and any partner. This deeming provision has retrospective effect. However, subsection (5)(b) allows a person who applies for a subpart KD credit before 1 April 2007 to notify the Commissioner before 1 June 2007 that they do not want that application to be treated as an election not to be a transitional resident. Section KD 4(4B) ensures that a person exercising this right is not liable for a shortfall penalty.

#### Section 87(2) and (3) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 and section OE 1(2b) of the Income Tax Act 2004

As noted earlier, section FC 23(b) has been amended so that the requirement for a 10-year non-residence period is applied by reference to the date a person satisfies the requirements in section OE 1(1) or (2). An equivalent change has been made to the rule that limits the availability of the exemption to people who come to live in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006.

Section 87(2)(a) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 specifies that to qualify for the exemption a person must begin to satisfy the requirements for tax-residence on or after 1 April 2006. Backdated residence under section OE 1(2) would not prevent a person from qualifying for the exemption, provided they had not established a permanent place of abode or been present for more than 183 days in a 12-month period before that date.

Under the previous rules, a person who became taxresident before 1 April 2006 may still have qualified for the exemption, provided they had not acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand before that date. Section 87(2)(b) allows these individuals to continue to qualify, while section 87(3) allows their exemption to be backdated to their first date of tax residence, as for other transitional residents. Section OE 1(2B) of the Income Tax Act 2004 is no longer required and has therefore been repealed, with retrospective effect.

The following examples illustrate how the new timing and eligibility rules for transitional residents are intended to operate in practice.

**Example 1**  
  
Robert visits New Zealand for an interview on 1 February 2006. He relocates here permanently and acquires a permanent place of abode on 1 May 2006. He is subsequently deemed to be tax-resident from 1 February under the 183-day rule. He has never been tax-resident in New Zealand before.  
  
Robert would qualify for the exemption. Although he is treated as tax-resident from 1 February 2006, he does not begin to satisfy the requirements of section OE 1 for being a resident until 1 May. His exemption would run from 1 February 2006 to 31 May 2010.

**Example 2**  
  
Roger first arrives in New Zealand on 1 June 2005. He stays for three months (92 days). He comes back to New Zealand on 1 March 2006 and stays for another three months (92 days). By the time he leaves, on 31 May 2006, he has been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period and is deemed to be tax-resident from 1 June 2005. Roger relocates to New Zealand and establishes a permanent place of abode here on 1 January 2007. He has never been tax-resident in New Zealand before.  
  
Roger would qualify for the exemption. Although he is deemed to be tax-resident from before 1 April 2006, he does not begin to satisfy the requirements of section OE 1 for being a resident until after that date. His exemption would run from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2010.

**Example 3**  
  
Rachael leaves New Zealand and ceases to have a permanent place of abode here on 30 September 2006. She returns on holiday from time to time to visit friends. Each time, she is only present in New Zealand for a couple of weeks a year. Her last holiday here is from 1 to 14 August 2016. On 1 December 2016, Rachael decides to move back to New Zealand to live. She acquires a permanent place of abode on that date. She was last resident on 30 September 2006, just over 10 years ago. On 19 May 2017, when she has been present for 184 days, she is deemed to be tax-resident from 1 August 2016.  
  
Rachael would qualify for the exemption. She began to satisfy the requirements of section OE 1 for being a resident on 1 December 2016 when she reacquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. At that time, she had not been resident in the preceding 10 years. Her exemption would run from 1 August 2016 to 31 December 2020.

#### Sections NF 1 and NF 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004

Section NF 1(2) has been amended, taking interest and dividends covered by the exemption outside the definition of resident withholding income. This clarifies, in particular, that agents receiving such exempt income on behalf of transitional residents are not required by section NF 3 to deduct resident withholding tax. Section NF 2(7B) ensures that agents will normally be able to rely on a notice given by a client that income is exempt.

[Terms of reference](/publications/2020/2020-tax-working-group/other-documents/terms-reference "terms-reference")

23 November 2017 - Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group
========================================================

Terms of reference

Issue date: Thursday, 23 November 2017

Version note: Released by Hon Grant Robertson, Minister of Finance.

Copyright: © Crown Copyright, Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

The Tax Working Group has been established by the Government in order to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system.

The New Zealand tax system has been justifiably commended internationally for being a simple and efficient system. The Government’s starting position is that the guiding principle for the New Zealand tax system – namely, that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible – is sound.

The Working Group will consider what improvements to this framework could improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. In particular, the Working Group will consider the impact on the tax system of the likely economic environment over the next decade.

The Government has the following objectives for the tax system:

*   A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected
*   A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy
*   A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP
*   A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability
*   A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families, and
*   An overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner.

The Working Group should report to the Government on:

*   Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth
*   Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy
*   Whether there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient, and
*   Whether there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts, and individuals.

In examining the points above, the Working Group should consider in particular the following:

*   The economic environment that will apply over the next 5-10 years, taking into account demographic change, and the impact of changes in technology and employment practices, and how these are driving different business models,
*   Whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system.
*   Whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment, and
*   What role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term.

In considering the matters above, the Working Group should have due regard to the overall structure of the tax system to ensure it is fair, balanced and efficient, as well as simple for taxpayers to understand and comply with their tax obligations.

The following are outside the scope of the Working Group’s review:

*   Increasing any income tax rate or the rate of GST
*   Inheritance tax
*   Any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or the land under it, and
*   The adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system (this will be considered as part of a separate review of Working for Families).

In addition, the focus of the Working Group should not be on more technical matters already under review as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme, including:

*   International tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda, and
*   Policy changes as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme.

The Working Group will be able to recommend further reviews be undertaken on specific issues which the group considers it has not been able to explore sufficiently, or that were excluded from its terms of reference but which could benefit from being considered in the context of its recommendations.

The Working Group’s membership will include individual(s) with expertise in Maori community and business environments.

The Working Group will be supported by a secretariat of officials from Treasury and Inland Revenue, and it will be able to seek independent advice and analysis on any matter within the scope of its Terms of Reference. The Working Group will have an independent advisor to analyse the various sources of advice received by the Working Group and help to analyse and distil the information to assist the Working Group’s deliberations. The Working Group will be expected to engage with the public in developing its recommendations.

The Working Group should have its first meeting no later than February 2018, issue an interim report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue no later than September 2018, and issue a final report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue no later than February 2019. These dates may be varied with the consent of the Minister of Finance.

The Accident Compensation Self-Employed Levy Payment Regulations 1979
=====================================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Accident Compensation Self-Employed Levy Payment Regulations 1979 from PIB vol 101 Oct 1979.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 101, October 1979

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

The Accident Compensation Self-Employed Levy Payment Regulations 1979 were recently gazetted and came into force on 1 October 1979. These Regulations abolish start-up levies and cessation adjustments in respect of self-employed earnings from that date. In all other respects the self-employed scheme is unchanged.

In essence, there will now be an annual self-employed levy payment based on leviable earnings derived by a self-employed person during that financial year (year to balance date) which corresponds to their income year for tax purposes. In other words, the annual levy payment will be based on the actual leviable earnings shown in their tax return for the same year.

### Effect of New Regulations

*   The old legislation will continue to operate up to 30 September 1979. This means that:
    *   Any person who commences to be self-employed prior to 1 October 1979 will still be required to pay the start-up levy of $3 per month.
    *   Cessation adjustments will continue to be made in respect of any person who ceases to be self-employed before 1 October 1979.
*   From 1 October 1979:
    *   No start-up levy will be payable. Under the new Regulations any person who commences to be self-employed on or after 1 October 1979 will not be required to pay any Accident Compensation levy until the due date for terminal tax in respect of the first tax return furnished which includes income from self-employment.
    *   No cessation adjustments will be made where a person ceases to be self-employed on or after 1 October 1979.

### General

*   Where a person is self-employed for less than 12 months in any year, the self-employed Accident Compensation levy will be the greater of 1.07 percent of -
    *   the leviable earnings, or
    *   the prescribed amount. The prescribed amount will be determined under existing rules, i.e., $3,600 where the time self-employed during the 12 month period averages 30 or more hours per week, otherwise $1,000.

Te Accounting Income Method The Accounting Income Method
========================================================

**The Accounting Income Method (AIM)** [More information](#)

#### Visual

The title screen with Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake logo and title AIM - ACCOUNTING INCOME METHOD FOR PROVISIONAL TAX are shown.

#### Audio

**Music**

Easy listening style music plays softly in the background for the entire video.

**Narrator**

The Accounting Income Method, or AIM, is an alternative provisional tax option for businesses with turnover of less than 5 million dollars, to calculate provisional tax.

* * *

#### Visual

Less than $5 million is on screen, then circles roll in with logos for the software providers APS, myob, and Xero.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

This video is a case study, which will explain how AIM works and how it might look.

AIM is delivered through accounting software, not by Inland Revenue. So how it actually looks will be designed by your software provider.

* * *

#### Visual

Sally is shown standing in her store Sally’s Swimwear. Swimwear appears hanging on the wall. A circle pops up showing Joanne and then word AIM.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Let’s meet Sally.

She designs and makes a range of swimwear, which are sold mostly online.

Every so often, one of the designs is featured in a fashion magazine, and this provides a big boost.

But if there’s a bad summer, business can suffer.

Sally has a tax agent, Joanne, who helps her with provisional tax.

* * *

#### Visual

A profit and loss (P&L) line graph appears, and highlights the peaks and troughs in Sally’s business. Payments are made when there is a profit, no payment is made when there’s a loss.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Joanne thinks that AIM will work well for Sally’s company because of fluctuating seasonal sales, and the fact that her accounts are pretty up to date.

Last year Sally’s Swimwear used the standard provisional tax option.

This meant that there were three fixed instalments, which were based on the previous years’ results, plus 5 percent.

AIM is different in that it calculates the provisional tax due based on the actual income on a year to date basis.

* * *

#### Visual

A new line graph appears showing profits over time. Cash flow line and AIM payments are projected tracking the same line. A circle with AIM CAPABLE pops up.

A clock appears showing it takes about 30 mins to complete the AIM setup.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

All the work is done through accounting software that is AIM-capable.

Some setup is still required, but the software will guide you through it.

Sally could’ve done this herself, but she was busy, and they agreed that Joanne would do it on her behalf.

Joanne did this at the start of the year, but she can start using AIM anytime during the year.

* * *

#### Visual

Title Mapping Ledger for Statement of Activity (IR 10 Fields) is shown, then the following fields appear under the title.

*   101 Store sales.
*   102 Online sales.
*   103 Market day sales.

Arrows point from each filed to a new filed Gross Income Sales.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

The first step Joanne does, is map individual ledger accounts, so that the software can produce a statement of activity.

The software asks Joanne how it should treat a few adjustments during the year.

These adjustments will help the software to more accurately calculate the provisional tax.

There are some basic settings and the ability to make manual adjustments if needed.

* * *

#### Visual

An Accounting adjustments for AIM screen appears with the following basic settings.

*   Depreciation - Automatically calculate depreciation (YES / NO).
*   Closing inventory – Same as last year (YES / NO).
*   Closing inventory – Perpetual inventory system input (YES / NO).
*   Private expenditure – User input required (YES / NO).
*   Private expenditure – User input required text entry field.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

For example, with depreciation, Sally’s company has an up-to-date asset register that goes through the P&L so Joanne has elected to use that info.

But, if Sally recorded the depreciation separately, she could do a manual entry.

For inventory, Sally doesn’t have a perpetual inventory system, so she’s going to use the information from her P&L.

Again it would also be possible to enter it manually.

* * *

#### Visual

A mobile phone icon comes up in circle, then a new circle splits from that showing Set up a rule. $1500.00 is entered into the Private expenditure – User input required text entry field.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Sally’s using a mobile phone for personal use that’s under the business plan.

Since this is a personal cost, not a business expense, Joanne needs to make a private expenditure adjustment.

Joanne sets up a rule in the software so it automatically codes her portion of the cellphone costs as private expenditure next time.

No adjustment is then required as it would be accounted for correctly, and it makes the next AIM statement even quicker.

* * *

#### Visual

A second Accounting adjustments for AIM screen appears with the following basic settings.

*   Debtors – Include Debtors from ledger? (YES / NO).
*   Creditors – Include Creditors from ledger? (YES / NO).
*   Creditors – User input required text entry field.
*   Losses from prior year? – As assesses – sourced from Inland Revenue text entry field.
*   Provisions – Provision for doubtful debts text entry field.
*   Provisions – Provision for Shareholder salary text entry field.
*   Provisions – Tax paid on Shareholder Salary to Inland Revenue? (YES / NO).
*   $1000 is entered into the Creditors – User input required text entry field.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Sally’s company uses the invoice basis for GST so Joanne will include debtors and creditors in the AIM adjustments.

If you’re using the payments basis, or a hybrid, you can choose to include them if you want.

You will be able to make a manual adjustment if they are not in your ledger.

If she had losses from a previous year, which Inland Revenue confirmed, AIM can take account of them here to reduce the AIM provisional tax payments due.

* * *

#### Visual

A new line graph appears showing profits over time. Cash flow line and AIM payments are projected tracking the same line.

Sally and SALLY’S SWIMWEAR appears in separate circles with dollar signs moving from SALLY’S SWIMWEAR to Sally indicating a shareholder’s salary is being paid.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

AIM requires you to add provisions back.

Joanne is making sure they are set up in the software at the start of the year, so that the provisions are added back automatically.

This will help the provisional tax be accurate throughout the year, rather than just at the end.

Like many small businesses, Sally wants to take a shareholders salary.

AIM can simplify the provisional tax approach to this, however, there are a number of options available.

Sally isn’t sure, and asks Joanne for advice on the best way to handle it.

* * *

#### Visual

The Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake logo appears. The dollar signs then move from SALLY’S SWIMWEAR to the Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake logo indicating a wage with PAYE is being paid

instead of a shareholder salary.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Joanne advises Sally, that if the tax relating to the salary is paid to Inland Revenue by the company, a deduction for the salary can be taken.

This would reduce the tax payable by Sally’s company.

If the company does this as an agent for Sally it may mean that she has no provisional tax liability.

* * *

#### Visual

Less than $5 million appears is shown, this scrolls off screen to the left and is replaced by a circle with AIM inside it.

Mock Accounting calculation for AIM is shown with the following fields.

*   Tax Rate – Individual (YES / NO).
*   Turnover under $5m (YES / NO).
*   Notify Inland Revenue to keep using AIM? (YES / NO).
*   AIM YTD Profit (after adjustments) text entry field with $12,500.00 entered.
*   AIM paid (confirmed with Inland Revenue) text entry filed with $14,000.00 entered.
*   AIM Refund due text entry field with $4,000.00 entered.
*   Instructions – HOLD text entry field with $1,000.00 entered.
*   Instructions – Refund text entry field with $1,000.00 entered.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

If a deduction isn’t taken, any overpayments of tax made by the company can be transferred to reduce Sally’s provisional tax liabilities.

Sally’s company turnover is below 5 million dollars, so she can use AIM.

When her business grows and she goes over that threshold, she can choose to stay in AIM.

Now that it’s set up, Sally doesn’t need to review the adjustments every time there is a payment.

Though Joanne and Sally have the option of keeping an eye on it and tweaking things if needed.

* * *

#### Visual

A Statement of Activity example is shown with the heading IR10 information  
and the following fields.

*   IRD Number.
*   Instalment date.
*   Return Period.
*   Current AIM Payment Calculation.
*   Year to date AIM liability.
*   Gross income from sales and/or services.
*   Opening Stock (incl work in progress).
*   Purchases.
*   Closing stock (incl work in progress).

#### Audio

**Narrator**

During the year, the software calculates the year-to-date profit based on actual cash flows and all the AIM adjustments.

When Sally does her GST, a statement of activity, like the example shown here, will be produced and sent to Inland Revenue by a simple click of a button in her software package.

It’s not a return and it doesn’t result in an assessment.

* * *

#### Visual

The Statement of Activity is filled in when a circle appears over it with AIM in the middle. An icon of a form replaces AIM, a calculator then replaces the form.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

The statement of activity includes AIM adjustments and payment or refund instructions.

It’s used to show Inland Revenue that there is a robust calculation behind the AIM amount.

It will also help improve AIM in the future.

Sally or Joanne can review the information before it’s sent to Inland Revenue.

* * *

#### Visual

A Statement of Activity is shown with the heading IR10 information and the following fields.

*   Accounting Profit 12000.00

Adjustments heading

*   Private expenditure 200.00
*   Trading stock 3000.00
*   Depreciation (300.00)
*   Debtors 500.00
*   Creditors (1000.00)
*   Shareholder salary (8000.00)

Shareholder salary reduces to (3000.00) and Accounting Profit reduces to 7000.00.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

When winter comes later in the year Sally’s business struggles and her statement of activity shows she has overpaid her year-to-date liability.

Sally also found an invoice that she’d forgotten about in the previous period.

This isn’t a problem in AIM and she doesn’t have to re-file.

Sally can put it in now, and the software will adjust her year-to-date position for her next instalment accordingly.

* * *

#### Visual

Three circles with $90,000, $80,000, and $10,000 drop appear.

A simple flowchart is displayed showing the following steps.

1.  Joanne gets the business records.
2.  Joanne completes the business tax return.
3.  The residual income tax is compared to the provisional tax paid.
4.  The remaining balance is left to pay by Sally.

No penalties or interest appears above the Balance to pay (Step 4).

#### Audio

**Narrator**

At the end of the tax year Joanne will prepare the tax return and file it.

Sally’s Swimwear has a residual income tax liability of 90,000 dollars for the year.

It has paid 80,000 dollars through provisional tax.

So there is a balance of 10,000 dollars to pay.

Because this has all gone through AIM, and she’s paid the amounts that the software told her to pay during the year, there are no penalties or use of money interest to pay.

Sally can just pay the outstanding amount on time and in full, and carry on with AIM.

* * *

#### Visual

A circle with AIM appears with a dollar symbol on the left and 3 dollar symbols appear on the right getting smaller, indicating how AIM helps keep bills down over time.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Joanne and Sally will talk about the things they can do differently next year to make sure Sally’s provisional tax is even more accurate.

AIM will improve over time so the gap between what Sally has to pay during the year, and the year-end tax return, gets smaller and smaller.

AIM is available through APS, MYOB and XERO.

Check with your software provider to see if it’s going to be available to you.

The adoption of international financial reporting standards for taxation purposes
=================================================================================

2007 amendments to the Income Tax and Tax Administration Acts incorporate the adoption of IFRS for taxation purposes where appropriate.

**_Sections DB 26, DB 27, EB 6, EB 9, EB 12, EB 19, EB22, ED 1, EW 14 to EW 24, EW 25B, EW 26, EW29, EW 31 and EW 48B of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections DB 34, DB 35, EB 6, EB 9, EB 12, EB 19, EB 22, ED 1, EW 14 to EW 24, EW 25B, EW 26, EW 29, EW31 and EW 46B of the Income Tax Act 2007; section141B(1C) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Some taxpayers adopted international financial reporting standards (IFRS) for financial reporting purposes from 1 January 2005. For certain other taxpayers, the standards became mandatory from 1 January 2007. The Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to incorporate the adoption of IFRS for taxation purposes, where appropriate.

#### Background

Current taxation rules are linked to accounting practice in areas such as the trading stock valuation rules, research and development expenditure rules, and in areas where the courts and tax legislation have relied on generally accepted accounting practice. Tax rules' reliance on accounting practice in these areas is "ambulatory" in principle. To the extent that certain tax rules rely on accounting practice, changes in accounting practice arising from the adoption of IFRS are also brought into effect for tax purposes (in other words, they are automatically reflected in tax law). However, some areas, such as the research and development expenditure and trading stock valuation rules, require legislative amendments to incorporate the specific changes brought about by the adoption of IFRS.

IFRS have introduced significant changes to the methods of accounting for income and expenditure of financial arrangements. In many cases these changes bring financial accounting methods closer in line with existing tax timing rules. The legislative amendments clarify that taxpayers who adopted IFRS methods can rely on the same methods for taxation purposes. They also provide alternative methods that these taxpayers can adopt. Consequently, Determination G30, which provides the transitional rules for IFRS taxpayers, is expected to be withdrawn later thisyear.

#### Key feature

A number of technical changes have been made to the research and development expenditure rules, the trading stock valuation rules and the financial arrangements rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. The Tax Administration Act 1994 has also been amended to provide a legislative relief from the unacceptable tax position penalty in some circumstances. These amendments:

*   update the existing trading stock rules and research and development expenditure rules to reflect changes following the adoption of IFRS;
*   modify the existing financial arrangement timing rules to allow taxpayers to use the method they adopt under IFRS, with alternative spreading methods provided to limit the volatility of income and expenditure calculated for taxation purposes; and
*   provide legislative relief for taxpayers who adopt IFRS before the 2007-08 income year from unacceptable tax position penalties, in some circumstances.

#### Detailed analysis

##### Research and development expenditure

**_Sections DB 26 and DB 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections DB 34 and DB 35 of the Income Tax Act2007_**

The research and development expenditure rules in sections DB 26 and DB 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections DB 34 and DB 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been updated to reflect changes brought about by the adoption of IFRS. The amended rules rely on IFRS accounting standards, instead of the old accounting standards, to determine when research and development expenditure is deductible for taxation purposes.

Under IFRS, the treatment of research and development expenditure is dealt with under the general accounting standards on intangibles (NZ IAS 38). The core standards for capitalisation of development costs under NZ IAS 38 (paragraphs 54 to 67) are substantially the same as the old accounting standards and should be appropriate for taxation purposes. However, some provisions in the old standards (such as paragraphs 2.3 and 5.4 of FRS-13) are no longer applicable and the Acts have been amended accordingly.

**Application dates**

The IFRS-based accounting standards on research and development expenditure must be adopted for taxation purposes from the 2007-08 income year or the first income year for which a person adopts IFRS for financial reporting purposes, whichever is earlier.

##### Trading stock

**_Sections EB 6, EB 9, EB 12, EB 19, EB 22 and ED 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007_**

IFRS have been incorporated into the trading stock valuation rules in sub-part EB and the valuation rule for excepted financial arrangements in section ED 1. The old accounting standards that have been used in these provisions have been replaced with new standards NZIAS 2 and NZ IAS 8, under IFRS.

Section EB 6(1B) has been inserted in the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. This provision allows primary sector producers to continue valuing their trading stock at cost.

**Application dates**

The amended valuation rules for trading stock and excepted financial arrangements apply from the 2007-08 income year or the first income year for which a person adopts IFRS for financial reporting purposes, whichever is earlier.

##### Financial arrangements rules

**_Sections EW 14 to EW 24, EW 25B, EW 26, EW 29, EW31 and EW 48B of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections EW 14 to EW 24, EW 25B, EW 26, EW 29, EW31 and EW 46B of the Income Tax Act 2007_**

The financial arrangement spreading rules have been amended for taxpayers who adopt IFRS for financial reporting purposes (IFRS taxpayers). These taxpayers would generally be required to use IFRS accounting methods for taxation purposes but alternative spreading methods are available in some circumstances. Taxpayers who do not prepare IFRS accounts will continue to apply the current spreading rules for financial arrangements.

A summary of the spreading methods available to taxpayers under the amended financial arrangement rules is presented in Figure 1.

#### Figure 1: New financial arrangement spreading rules

![A summary of the spreading methods available to taxpayers under the amended financial arrangement rules](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/0/6/068b41004ba3775d9eedbf9ef8e4b077/new-financial-arrangement-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214530&hash=A0C0CEBC46720B85137700380B35D5A0)

[Larger version of Figure 1](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/6/461339804ba37646b5bebd9ef8e4b077/new-financial-arrangement-large.jpg "This link will open a new window.")

An amendment to section EW 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 further clarifies that taxpayers can change between one of the pre-IFRS spreading methods and the new spreading methods for IFRS taxpayers when they start or stop preparing IFRS financial statements. IFRS taxpayers can choose to delay using the new spreading methods for taxation purposes until the 2007-08 income year.

**Spreading methods**

IFRS taxpayers are required to use one of the new spreading methods in sections EW 15B to EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15B to EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007. These methods include the IFRS method, alternative methods set out in specific determinations, expected value method, modified fair value method and mandatory non-IFRS methods.

IFRS method

An IFRS taxpayer must use the IFRS method in section EW 15C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act 2007, unless the mandatory non-IFRS methods apply or the taxpayer elects to use the alternative spreading methods. Under the IFRS method, the taxpayer would calculate income and expenditure of a financial arrangement using the IFRS accounting rules.

Different methods are used to calculate income and expenditure of financial arrangements depending on their classification under IFRS. These IFRS accounting methods are accepted for taxation purposes under section EW 15C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, NZ IAS 39 allows income and expenditure of a financial arrangement to be calculated using either the "fair value method" or the "effective interest method" as appropriate.

Furthermore, income and expenditure calculated under the IFRS method would include fees that are "integral" to the financial arrangement. Sections EW 15(1) and EW31(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended accordingly.

Taxpayers who adopt the IFRS method for taxation purposes are expected to make two modifications. First, income and expenditure reported under IFRS in both the income statement and the statement of changes in equity must be included for taxation purposes. Secondly, credit impairment adjustments made to a financial asset under IFRS must be reversed out for taxation purposes. Credit impairments of financial arrangements will only be deductible for taxation purposes in accordance with the bad debt rules in section DB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section DB 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Specific determinations

An IFRS taxpayer can elect to use the alternative methods in the specific determinations listed in section EW 15D of Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2007:

*   Determination G9C - Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach;
*   Determination G14B - Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; and
*   Determination G27 - Swaps.

In addition, the Commissioner may issue further determinations when this is necessary.

These methods are available if the IFRS taxpayer is able to meet the conditions in the relevant determinations and the anti-arbitrage requirement (which is discussed in a separate section below), subject to a specific modification to the election criteria in Determinations G9C and G14B.

_(i) Method in Determinations G9C and G14B_

An IFRS taxpayer that adopts Determinations G9C and/or G14B must comply with the principles in paragraph 4 of these determinations. Broadly, the basic principles under these determinations are:

*   income or expenditure from a financial arrangement is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component;
*   the expected component must be measured at the time a financial arrangement is entered into. The expected component is measured by converting expected payments under the financial arrangement into New Zealand dollars on the basis of forward rates;
*   the net expected New Zealand dollar amount should be spread over the term of the financial arrangement based on the yield to maturity method;
*   the unexpected component must be recognised when it is realised as the difference between the actual New Zealand dollar payments and the expected New Zealand dollar payments.

An IFRS taxpayer has to meet the terms set out in paragraph 3 of Determinations G9C and G14B. However, the election criteria in Determinations G9C and G14B have been relaxed for new companies that begin operation part-way through a year and companies that enter into a transaction that is covered by the determinations part-way through a year. The amendment allows these companies to use Determinations G9C and G14B if an election is made in writing on or before the 63rd day after they enter into the financial arrangement, or a later date allowed by the Commissioner (section EW 15D(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15E(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007). For example, it is envisaged that an election at a later date would be allowed for the 2007-08 income year because the amended legislation was enacted part-way through that income year and taxpayers may not be in a position to make an election within the 63-day period.

_Contracts for differences_

The definition of "forward contract" has been amended for the purpose of section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2007. This is to clarify that "contracts for differences" are forward contracts even though it is not anticipated that the property or services that are the subject of the contracts would be delivered or performed.

This amendment allows "contracts for differences" and other similar contracts to be treated as forward contracts. The example below illustrates how a contract for differences might be dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in Determination G14B.

##### Example: Contracts for differences

_Company A is an energy consumer. It enters into a contract for differences with a strike price of 5 cents per kWh. The contract was entered into with a third party at the prevailing market forward rate for electricity. The contract is set at a volume of 1,000 kWh per month for two years. The counter party to this contract is an energy supplier. Company A chooses to use the expected value method under Determination G14B._

Although the contract is expressed as an agreement to buy and sell electricity, the 1,000 kWh of electricity under the contract will never be delivered. Instead the counter party promises to pay Company A the difference if the market price for electricity is higher than the strike price at the end of the month. Company A promises to pay the counterparty if the market price is lower than the strike price. This ensures that the price Company A would have to pay for its electricity would never be higher (or lower) than 5 cents per kWh for 1,000 kWh per month.

The contract could be seen as a series of forward contracts with settlements at monthly intervals. The expected component of the contract is zero as the strike price for the contract is the prevailing market forward rate for electricity. This means there is nothing to spread under the "expected value" method.

However, the unexpected component must be recognised when payments are made under the contract. In this case, income and expenditure will arise when the contract is settled at the end of each month. Company A would report a gain if the market price for electricity is higher than the strike price at the end of the month, or a loss if the market price is lower than the strike price.

_(ii) Methods in Determination G27_

IFRS taxpayers can elect to use the methods in Determination G27 if they meet the terms set out in paragraph 3 of that determination. Having elected, they must apply the principles and methodology in the determination.

_Methodology in Determination G27_

Determination G27 contains a number of spreading methods for swaps agreements. The main spreading method is the method known as Method C in the determination. This method requires a taxpayer to calculate income and expenditure on a swap by treating each side of the swap as a separate, simultaneous and mutual loan between the taxpayer and the other party of the swap. Income and expenditure on these separate deemed loans should be calculated in accordance with normal financial arrangements rules. Paragraphs 6(4) and 6(7) of Determination G27 outline the rules for calculating income and expenditure on these separate loans. IFRS taxpayers that elect to use this determination must comply with these provisions.

Other spreading methods are also specified in Determination G27. It is anticipated that the status of these spreading methods and the availability of other spreading methods for IFRS taxpayers will be clarified as part of the remedial work discussed at the end of this item.

_(iii) Alternatives to Commissioner's Determination_

IFRS taxpayers can use an alternative method to those set out in Determinations G9C, G14B and G27 or another determination issued by the Commissioner. An alternative method may be used if it:

*   has regard to the purposes of the financial arrangements rules under section EW 1(3);
*   is for a financial arrangement similar to one to which the methods set out in Determinations G9C, G14B and G27 may apply; and
*   results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from those that would have been allocated using one of the methods set out in the determinations.

_Expected value method_

Section EW 15E(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15F of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide an expected value method that IFRS taxpayers can use instead of the IFRS methods. A taxpayer that qualifies and wishes to use the expected value method must elect to use this method by notifying the Commissioner at the time of filing a return of income. The election applies to the taxpayer and all the companies in the taxpayer's group.

IFRS taxpayers can elect to use the expected value method to calculate income and expenditure of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency denominated financial arrangements, if the financial arrangements have been entered into in the ordinary course of the taxpayers' business and the taxpayers are not in the business of dealing in the financial arrangements. In addition, the IFRS taxpayers must satisfy the anti-arbitrage requirement (which is discussed in a separate section below).

*   _Ordinary course of business_  
    The amended legislation does not define the term "ordinary course of business". Facts and circumstances of a taxpayer's business would determine whether a financial arrangement has been entered into in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business. For example, a taxpayer who borrows in a foreign currency, say in US dollars, to fund its subsidiaries in the US would most likely be considered to have entered into the loan as part of its ordinary course of business. A taxpayer who enters into a derivative contract to hedge a particular business risk would also be considered as having entered into the derivative contract in the ordinary course of its business. For example, an energy company may enter into contracts for differences to fix the price of electricity
*   _Business of dealing in the financial arrangement_  
    An IFRS taxpayer cannot apply the expected value method to a financial arrangement if the taxpayer is in the "business of dealing in the financial arrangement". Again, facts and circumstances would determine when a taxpayer is in the business of dealing in the financial arrangement. For example, a company that enters into a financial arrangement to hedge a business risk would most likely not be considered as in the business of dealing in that financial arrangement.  
    On the other hand, a company that buys and sells a financial arrangement regularly for profit would probably be in the business of dealing in that financial arrangement. Nevertheless, it is envisaged that taxpayers may have two portfolios of a type of financial arrangements (say swaps) and only buy and sell regularly for profit from one of those portfolios. These taxpayers are not prevented from using the expected value method to calculate income and expenditure of financial arrangements in the "non-trading" portfolio.
*   _Expected value methodology_  
    The amended legislation defines the expected value method by reference to the methodology in Determinations G9C and G14B. This means the principles that apply in those determinations should be relevant here. Broadly, these principles are:
    
    *   income or expenditure from a financial arrangement is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component;
    *   the expected component must be measured at the time a financial arrangement is entered into and spread over the term of the financial arrangement; and
    *   the unexpected component must be recognised when it is realised as the difference between the actual New Zealand dollar payments and the expected New Zealand dollar payments.
    
    IFRS taxpayers who adopt a method that is consistent with these principles would be considered to have allocated a reasonable amount for each income year of the term of the financial arrangement, having regard to the purposes of the financial arrangements rules under section EW 1(3).  
    The following examples illustrate how the expected value method applies to certain types of futures, options and swaps contracts.
    
    ##### Example 1: Futures contracts
    
    _Company A enters into a futures contract to buy 1 million_ _US__dollars against delivery of_ _New Zealand__dollars. The futures contract has a standard settlement date of_ _31 December 2010__. The contract was entered into on_ _30 April 2008_ _for no consideration. The contract rate is US$0.76 to NZ$1, which is the market forward rate. Company A qualifies and elects to use the expected value method to spread income and expenditure under the futures contract._
    
    At the time Company A becomes a party to the futures contract, the expected New Zealand dollar net amount is zero. Therefore, the futures contract has no expected income or expenditure and there is nothing to spread under the expected value method. Company A will recognise the unexpected income or expenditure from the futures contract when it is realised
    
    **Example 2: Options contracts**
    
    _Company A enters into an options contract to buy 100 units of commodity at $15 per unit. The option is exercisable in two years. Company A paid a premium of $175. The market interest rate is 8% per annum. Company A qualifies and elects to use the expected value method._
    
    Under the expected value approach, the expected gain under the option contract for Company A is equal to the difference between the amount of the premium paid and the forward price of the option. Broadly, the forward price is equal to the spot price on issue plus the cost of carrying to maturity. In the example above, the forward price of the option contract is $204 (being 175 x 1.08 2 ). The $29 difference between the premium paid ($175) and the forward price ($204) is the expected gain of Company A. This expected gain should be spread by Company A under the expected value method over the two-year period. Company A would have income of $14 in the first year resulting from the expected component.
    
    If at the end of year two the spot price of the commodity is $18 per unit, Company A will realise an unexpected gain of $96 (which is the difference between the $300 gain that Company A will derive from exercising the option, less the $204 expected gain). In addition, Company A would have income of $15 from the expected component in the second year. The total of $111 would be income of Company A in the second year. This amount will show up as a result of the base price adjustment:
    
    consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
    ($300 - $175) - 14 + 0 + 0 = $111
    
    **Example 3: Swaps**
    
    _Company A enters into a swaps agreement under which it promises to pay a variable rate of interest in exchange for receiving a fixed rate of interest. The swaps agreement will be settled every six months until 31 December 2010, when the last payment will be made. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2008 at the prevailing market rate for no consideration and the variable rate under the swaps agreement will be re-fixed regularly. Company A qualifies and elects to use the expected value method to spread income and expenditure under the futures contract._
    
    As the swaps agreement has been entered into at the prevailing market rate for no consideration, the expected NZD net amount is zero when Company A enters into the swaps agreement. Therefore, the swaps agreement has no expected income or expenditure and there is nothing to spread under the expected value method. Company A will recognise the unexpected income or expenditure from the swaps agreement when payments are made at the six-monthly interval.
    

Modified fair value method [23](#23)

Section EW 15E(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide another alternative spreading method for IFRS taxpayers. An IFRS taxpayer who qualifies can elect to use this method by notifying the Commissioner at the time of filing a return of income. The election applies to the taxpayer and all the companies in the taxpayer's group.

As with the expected value method, the alternative method in this section is only available for derivative financial instruments and foreign currency denominated financial arrangements that have been entered into in the ordinary course of an IFRS taxpayer's business and the taxpayer is not in the business of dealing in the financial arrangements. In addition, the anti-arbitrage requirement (which is discussed in a separate section below) must be met.

An IFRS taxpayer who elects to use this method must use the IFRS method to calculate income and expenditure of a financial arrangement, but the amount which has been allocated to equity reserves under IFRS can be excluded from tax. For example, income and expenditure of a derivative instrument that is a cashflow hedge may be reported as part of equity reserves in IFRS accounts. This amount would ordinarily be included if a taxpayer relies on the IFRS method for taxation purposes. However, the modified fair value method in section EW 15E(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 would allow this amount to be excluded from tax.

Compulsory non-IFRS methods

Sections EW 15B(3) to (5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15H and EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007 preserve the existing, pre-IFRS spreading methods for some financial arrangements. It is mandatory for IFRS taxpayers to apply these spreading methods instead of the methods they have adopted for financial reporting purposes. These compulsory methods apply to a financial arrangement that includes an excepted financial arrangement, a financial arrangement that is treated partly or wholly as an equity instrument under IFRS, or an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services.

Section EW 15B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15H of the Income Tax Act 2007 list the following determinations that must be applied if the financial arrangement is covered by the determinations:

*   Determination G5C: Mandatory conversion convertible notes;
*   Determination G22: Optional conversion convertible notes denominated in New Zealand dollars convertible at the option of the holder;
*   Determination G22A: Optional convertible notes denominated in New Zealand dollars;
*   Determination G29: Agreements for sale and purchase of property denominated in foreign currency: exchange rate to determine the acquisition price and method for spreading income and expenditure.

An alternative method may be used instead of those set out in the determinations above if it:

*   has regard to the purposes of the financial arrangements rules under section EW 1(3);
*   is for a financial arrangement similar to one to which the methods set out in the determinations above may apply; and
*   results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from those that would have been allocated using one of the methods set out in the determinations.

For financial arrangements that are not covered by the determinations listed above, sections EW 15B(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007 require one of the following spreading methods to be used:

*   the yield to maturity method;
*   Determination G26: Variable rate financial arrangements; or
*   a determination made by the Commissioner under section 90AC(1)(ba) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Again, an alternative method may be used instead of those set out in the determinations above if it:

*   has regard to the purposes of the financial arrangements rules under section EW 1(3);
*   is for a financial arrangement similar to one to which one of the methods above may apply; an
*   results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from those that would have been allocated using one of the above methods.

##### Example: A financial arrangement with an excepted financial arrangement

_An IFRS taxpayer is a party to a financial arrangement that includes an excepted financial arrangement. How should this financial arrangement be treated under the amended financial arrangements rules?_

There are two possible routes for determining the tax treatment of this financial arrangement under the amended rules. If the financial arrangement is covered by determinations G5C, G22, G22A or G29 in section EW 15B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15H of the Income Tax Act 2007, income and expenditure of the financial arrangement must be spread in accordance with the relevant determination. The taxpayer's IFRS treatment may be accepted as an alternative if it produces results that are not materially different from the method in the relevant determination.

If the financial arrangement is not covered by determinations G5C, G22, G22A or G29, then the excepted financial arrangement should be separated from the financial arrangement in accordance with section EW 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007. The taxpayer must apply to the remaining financial arrangement one of the methods in sections EW 15B(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means that the taxpayer would have to use the yield to maturity method, or a method provided in Determination G26: Variable rate financial arrangements, or a method in a determination made by the Commissioner, or an alternative method. Again, the taxpayer's IFRS treatment may be accepted as an alternative if it produces results that are not materially different from the yield to maturity method, the method in Determination G26 or another method in a determination made by the Commissioner, whichever is relevant.

**Example: An agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services**

_An IFRS taxpayer is a party to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property. How should this agreement be treated under the amended financial arrangements rules?_

An agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services in which the settlement is deferred is a financial arrangement if the deferral is more than 93 days (that is, a long-term agreement). This rule has not been amended.

If the long-term agreement is denominated in a foreign currency, income and expenditure on the agreement must be spread using one of the methods under Determination G29. If the agreement is denominated in New Zealand dollars, then it is expected that the yield to maturity method in section EW 15B (5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply.

The taxpayer's IFRS treatment is not, prima facie, an acceptable spreading method under the amended financial arrangements rules. This is because the taxpayer's IFRS treatment does not necessarily recognise the interest element in a long term property agreement. However, the taxpayer's IFRS treatment may be accepted as an alternative in some circumstances if it produces results that are not materially different from Determination G29 or the yield to maturity method, whichever is relevant.

**Example: A financial arrangement treated as equity instrument under IFRS**

_An IFRS taxpayer issues an instrument that is a "financial arrangement" under the financial arrangements rules but the instrument is treated as equity in its IFRS financial reports. Payments made under this instrument are also treated as dividends for financial reporting purposes. How should this financial arrangement be treated under the amended financial arrangement rules?_

If the financial arrangement is covered by determinations G5C, G22, G22A or G29 in section EW 15B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15H of the Income Tax Act 2007, income and expenditure of the financial arrangement must be spread in accordance with the relevant determination. The taxpayer's IFRS treatment may be accepted as an alternative if it produces results that are not materially different from the method in the relevant determination.

If the financial arrangement is not covered by Determinations G5C, G22, G22A or G29, then the taxpayer must apply one of the methods in section EW 15B(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means that the taxpayer would have to use the yield to maturity method, or a method provided in Determination G26: Variable rate financial arrangements, or a method in a determination made by the Commissioner, or an alternative method. The taxpayer's IFRS treatment may be accepted as an alternative method under this provision if it produces results that are not materially different from the yield to maturity method, the method in Determination G26 or a method in a determination made by the Commissioner, whichever is relevant.

**Consistency requirements**

An IFRS taxpayer who elects to use one of the spreading methods under the amended financial arrangements rules must comply with the consistency requirements in section EW 25B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007.

Consistency over time

A change of spreading method is allowed if the IFRS taxpayer has changed its accounting method for financial reporting purposes. For example, an IFRS taxpayer who has been using the IFRS method may wish to change method if the IFRS treatment changes and the taxpayer considers the new method to be inappropriate for taxation purposes. Conversely, an IFRS taxpayer who has been using one of the alternative spreading methods may wish to change method if its accounting treatment changes and the taxpayer considers the new treatment to be appropriate.

The change of method in these circumstances has to occur in the same income year as the change in IFRS accounting treatment. The IFRS taxpayer must also meet the relevant legislative requirements for the new method. These conditions are set out in section EW 25B(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007.

An IFRS taxpayer who does not qualify for a change of method must use the same method over time.

##### Example: Change of method

_An IFRS taxpayer is a party to a foreign currency denominated financial asset which has been classified under IFRS as a "held to maturity" investment. The effective interest method (which is similar to yield to maturity) would apply under IFRS and the taxpayer has decided to use the same method under the financial arrangements rules. When the IFRS classification for this financial asset changes to "available for sale", the IFRS method would become the fair value method. The taxpayer has decided to change method for taxation purposes. Is this allowed?_

Yes. The IFRS taxpayer can change method under these circumstances, as long as the change of method occurs in the same income year as the change in IFRS accounting treatment. The new spreading method could be the method in Determination G9C or the expected value method if the taxpayer can meet the relevant legislative provisions. A change of method adjustment would be required.

If the taxpayer is unable to meet the legislative criteria to use one of these alternative methods, the taxpayer would have to continue using the IFRS method. The income and expenditure recognised under IFRS would be income and expenditure under the IFRS method in section EW 15C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act 2007. This includes any income and expenditure associated with the change of accounting method recognised for financial reporting purposes. No change of method adjustment would be required in this case.

Change of spreading methods

An IFRS taxpayer who changes spreading methods is required to perform either a change of method adjustment under sections EW 26 and EW 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007, or a base price adjustment.

A change of method adjustment is required when IFRS taxpayers change their spreading methods. This adjustment is also required when non-IFRS taxpayers become IFRS taxpayers or vice versa, and have to change their spreading methods. The change of method adjustment would produce income and expenditure for the first income year taxpayers adopt IFRS for taxation purposes.

A base price adjustment is required when IFRS taxpayers change from a fair value method to another spreading method. Section EW 29(13) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 has been inserted to ensure that this is the case. Section EW 48B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 46B of the Income Tax Act 2007 have also been added to deem the IFRS taxpayer who is changing out of the fair value method as having been paid an amount equal to the market value of the financial arrangement on the date of change.

##### Example 1: Forward contract for five years

_Company A is a party to a forward contract with settlement in five years. The fair value of the forward contract is 0 at inception, ($100) at the end of year 1 and $50 at the end of year 2. The forward contract was settled at the end of year 5 with a gain of $100 for Company A._

_Company A uses the IFRS fair value method in the first income year and recognises a loss of $100. Company A meets the criteria for changing method and decides to change out of the fair value method at the end of the second year. Company A elects and is able to use the expected value method as the new spreading method._

Company A is required to perform a base price adjustment in the second income year. The base price adjustment would produce income for the second year of $150, which is calculated as:

consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
($50 - $0) - 0 + 100 + 0 = $150

The expected value of the forward contract will be spread under the expected value method. There is no expected income or expenditure to spread in this example because the forward contract has no value at inception. Therefore, Company A would have no income or expenditure in the third and fourth income years. The expected value method would not be applied retrospectively to the first and second income years because the base price adjustment has already been performed at the end of the second year.

The real base price adjustment would be required at the end of the fifth year, producing income of $50, calculated as:

consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
($100 - $0) - 150 + 100 + 0 = $50

**Example 2: Same example, different fair value pattern**

_What if the fair value of the forward contract is 0 at inception, $50 at the end of year 1, ($100) at the end of year 2 and the forward contract was settled at the end of year 5 with a gain of $100 for Company A?_

If Company A uses the IFRS fair value method in the first income year, it would recognise income of $50. In the second income year, Company A would be required to perform a base price adjustment because of the change of method. The base price adjustment would produce expenditure of $150, which is calculated as:

consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
(-$100 - $0) - 50 + 0 + 0 = ($150)

As the forward contract has no expected component, Company A would have no income or expenditure to spread in the third and fourth income years.

The real base price adjustment would be required at the end of the fifth year, producing income of $200, calculated as:

consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
($100 - $0) - 50 + 150 + 0 = $200

**Example 3: Same example, non-zero expected value at the beginning of contract**

_What if Company A paid $50 to enter into a forward contract with a forward/fair value of $100 at inception, $50 fair value at the end of year 1, ($100) at the end of year 2 and the forward contract was settled at the end of year 5 with a gain of $100 for Company A?_

If Company A uses the IFRS fair value method in the first income year, it would recognise an expenditure of $50 from the decline in the fair value. In the second income year, Company A would be required to perform a base price adjustment because of the change of method. The base price adjustment would produce expenditure for the second year of $100, which is calculated as:

consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
(-$100 - $50) - 0 + 50 + 0 = ($100)

For the purpose of spreading under the new method, Company A would have to calculate the expected component of the forward contract at the inception and spread the expected component based on the yield to maturity method. The expected component in this case is $50 (being the difference between $100 forward value at the inception and the $50 paid by Company A) and has to be spread over the five year period on a yield to maturity basis. This would produce income of $9.8 and $11.3 for the third and fourth income year, respectively.

The real base price adjustment would be required at the end of the fifth year, producing income of $128.9, calculated as:

consideration - income + expenditure + amount remitted  
($100 - $50) - 21.1 + 100 + 0 = $128.9

Consistency across financial arrangements

The same spreading method should be applied consistently across all financial arrangements that are the same or similar, unless different accounting treatments apply under IFRS. For example, investments in debt securities can be classified as "held to maturity" investments or "available for sale" financial assets under IFRS. Different accounting treatments can be applied depending on this classification even if the investments are exactly the same in commercial terms. In this case, different spreading methods would be allowed for taxation purposes.

Different spreading methods can be used for taxation purposes if the accounting treatment can be differentiated in one way or another. For example, swaps can be classified as a fair value hedge or a cashflow hedge under IFRS. Although both types of swaps are measured at fair values, gains and losses on the fair value hedge are reported in the income statement while gains and losses on the cashflow hedge can be reported in equity reserves for accounting purposes. Different tax treatments would be allowed for these swaps.

Anti-arbitrage requirement

Sections EW 15D(1)(d) and EW 15E(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15E(1)(c), EW 15F(1)(c) and EW 15G(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 restrict the use of the specific determinations, the expected value method and the modified fair value method. These methods cannot apply to a financial arrangement that is hedging another financial arrangement if the taxpayer has adopted the IFRS fair value method or another IFRS method that accounts for gains and losses related to the hedged risks to account for the other financial arrangement.

This restriction ensures that IFRS taxpayers use similar spreading methods to account for financial arrangements that are in a hedged relationship. Taxpayers are not allowed to apply IFRS methods which take into account market value movements on one side of the hedge and apply the alternative methods that do not bring in market value movements on the other side of the hedge.

##### Example: Foreign currency loans in a hedge relationship under IFRS

An IFRS taxpayer has a foreign currency denominated _borrowing, which is hedged by a forward currency contract. The forward contract qualifies and is treated as a hedge under IFRS. The taxpayer wishes to use the IFRS treatment to account for the foreign currency denominated borrowing and the expected value method to calculate income and expenditure of the forward currency contract. Is this allowed?_

No. If the taxpayer uses the IFRS method for foreign currency denominated borrowing, the taxpayer is prohibited from using the expected value method to calculate income and expenditure of the forward currency contract. This is because the IFRS treatment for foreign currency denominated borrowing (under NZ IAS 21) would include foreign exchange gains and losses as income and expenditure. The taxpayer must use the IFRS method to calculate income and expenditure on the forward contract. Alternatively, the taxpayer may choose to use the expected value approach for both the foreign currency borrowing and the forward currency contract.

**Example: Floating rate loans in a hedge relationship under IFRS**

_An IFRS taxpayer has a loan that is paying a floating rate of interest. The cashflow on this loan has been hedged by a series of pay-fixed, floating interest rate swaps. The swaps are not fully effective but they qualify and have been treated as a cashflow hedge under IFRS. The floating rate liability is accounted for under IFRS using the effective interest method, which does not account for the gains and losses related to the hedge. The taxpayer wishes to use the IFRS method to account for the floating rate loan and the method in Determination G27 for the swaps. Is this allowed?_

Yes. The anti-arbitrage restriction does not apply in this case because the IFRS method used to account for the floating rate liability is the effective interest method, which does not include gains and losses related to the hedge.[24](#24)

**Treatment of fees**

The treatment of fees has been modified to the extent that an IFRS taxpayer adopts the IFRS method under the amended financial arrangements rules. The IFRS treatment of fees is adopted for taxation purposes when the IFRS method is used. This alignment ensures that taxpayers who adopt IFRS methods for taxation purposes do not need to identify different types of fees that have been included in the IFRS calculation and apply tax rules to them individually.

The existing treatment of fees continues to apply to non-IFRS taxpayers and when IFRS taxpayers use the alternative methods that are not based on an IFRS accounting treatment. "Contingent fees" would be spread over the term of a financial arrangement in these circumstances.

Integral fees and methods based on IFRS

If an IFRS taxpayer uses the effective interest method under IFRS, then "integral" fees would be included as part of the effective yield of a financial arrangement. These "integral fees" would be included as income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules in the same way.

When a financial arrangement is fair valued under IFRS, fees that are integral to the financial arrangement are recognised immediately as income or expenditure. The same treatment is acceptable under the amended financial arrangement rules for a taxpayer who adopts the IFRS fair value method.

Definition of integral fees

"Integral" fees under IFRS include transaction costs, being incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial asset or financial liability. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the entity had not acquired, issued or disposed of the financial instrument. The IFRS rules for determining whether fees are "integral" to a financial arrangement would be accepted for taxation purposes when the IFRS method is used.

**Application dates and transitional rules**

The amended financial arrangements rules apply generally from the 2007-08 income year. Taxpayers who had to adopt IFRS for financial reporting purposes from 1 January 2007 can apply IFRS for taxation purposes concurrently. This alignment ensures that taxpayers do not have to prepare two sets of accounts and that any transitional adjustment can be dealt with at the same time. However, taxpayers who are not early adopters of IFRS are in a position to adopt the new spreading methods for taxation purposes from the 2008-09 income year if they have an early balance date between 1 October and 30 December.

Early adopters of IFRS

The amended financial arrangements rules can apply retrospectively to taxpayers who are early adopters of IFRS and have applied IFRS for taxation purposes from the income year beginning on or after 1 January 2005. This allows early adopters of IFRS to use the IFRS method for financial reporting and taxation purposes concurrently.

Alternatively, these early adopters can continue to apply the pre-IFRS spreading methods for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 income years. The transitional rule in section EZ 50 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EZ 32B of the Income Tax Act 2007 facilitates this by allowing IFRS taxpayers to rely on the methods in sections EW 16, EW 18 and EW 20, despite being unable to use the same method for financial reporting purposes as IFRS may prescribe a different spreading method.

##### Unacceptable tax position penalty

**_Section 141B(1C) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

A legislative relief from an unacceptable tax position penalty is provided for taxpayers who adopt IFRS before the 2007-08 income year. This legislative relief is available for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 income years with respect to an IFRS-related tax position, provided that the taxpayer has adopted an interpretation for tax purposes that is "as likely as not" to represent acceptable accounting practice under IFRS and full disclosures are provided to Inland Revenue.

##### Further developments

A number of issues have arisen after the enactment of the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007. These issues will be addressed by way of remedial amendments, which will be included in the next taxation bill.

The anti-arbitrage requirement in sections EW 15D(1)(d) and EW 15E(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15E(1)(c), EW 15F(1)(c) and EW 15G(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to better reflect the policy intention. IFRS taxpayers should only be restricted from using the spreading methods in these sections if the financial arrangement is a hedge of another financial arrangement that has been accounted for using the IFRS fair value method or another IFRS method that accounts for gains and losses related to the hedged risks.

The compulsory non-IFRS methods in sections EW 15B(3) to (5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15H and EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to cover finance leases that are treated as operating leases under IFRS. It is envisaged that IFRS taxpayers will apply the yield to maturity method or an alternative to the yield to maturity method to these finance leases.

Some IFRS taxpayers are allowed to prepare their financial accounts in a functional currency that is not New Zealand dollars. However, it is not intended that these taxpayers would be allowed, for taxation purposes, to calculate their income and expenditure on financial arrangements in that functional currency. The remedial amendment will clarify that if these taxpayers elect to use the IFRS accounting method, they are required to apply IFRS rules as if New Zealand dollars are their functional currency.

A number of minor remedial amendments will also be proposed to ensure that:

*   Early adopters of IFRS can continue to rely on pre-IFRS financial reporting practices under section EW 21 for the 2006 and 2007 income years.
*   Early adopters of IFRS who adopted the IFRS method in 2006 income year will be allowed to change their choice of method in the 2007 or 2008 income year. These taxpayers have made their choice of spreading method for the 2006 income year before the enactment of the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 and may not have information about the full range of methods available to them. It would be fair to give these taxpayers another, one-off opportunity to elect into the new spreading methods.
*   Determination G9A, Determination G14 and the market valuation method referred to in Determination G27 should not be available to IFRS taxpayers. Instead, IFRS taxpayers should be allowed to use the spreading methods provided in the amended rules.
*   IFRS taxpayers should be allowed to change from the straightline method and the market valuation method when they transition into IFRS-based spreading rules. A change of method adjustment or a base price adjustment would be required.

* * *

**23** This is also referred to as the equity free fair value method under section EW 15E(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

**24** As noted at the end of this section, the legislation will be amended to better reflect this policy intention.
July 2019 CRS - Corporate Trustee Guidance 1 The application of the Common Reporting Standard to corporate trustees within a professional group (and to the trusts that such companies provide services to) Background In broad terms, the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) requires that reporting New Zealand financial institutions: • carry out due diligence to review their financial accounts to identify accounts held (and/or, in certain circumstances, controlled 1 ) by foreign tax residents • collect certain prescribed identity and financial account information about such persons, and • report this information 2 to Inland Revenue for exchange with the jurisdiction of tax residence of the account holder (or controlling person). Inland Revenue has received a number of queries about applying the CRS to corporate trustees operating within a professional group (largely law and accounting firms) to provide trustee and managerial services to trusts who are clients of those professional firms. The queries have focused on the circumstances when corporate trustees (and the trusts they provide services to) will be financial institutions for CRS purposes. There are four types of financial institutions for CRS purposes: • investment entity • depository institution • custodial institution, and • specified insurance company. This guidance will focus on the investment entity type of financial institution, which is the type most likely to be relevant to corporate trustees and trusts. The scheme of the CRS 3 (and the CRS commentary) is clear that corporate trustees and trusts can (depending on the circumstances) be investment entity financial institutions. However, this guidance focuses on the circumstances when this is the case. Definition of "investment entity" for CRS purposes An entity will be an investment entity for CRS purposes if either of the following applies: • The entity primarily conducts as a business (with at least half of its income – 50% or more over the specified period 4 ) for or on behalf of customers one or more of a number of specified investment activities. These specified investment activities include "investing, administering or manging financial assets or money on behalf of other persons", 5 or 1 This will apply if the account holder is a type of entity known as a passive non-financial entity under Section VIII(D)(8) of the CRS. 2 This will be the case if the person is tax resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction or the financial institution otherwise chooses to adopt what is known as the wider approach to reporting (in which case they would report all relevant foreign tax residents they identify). 3 See, for example, sections VIII(B)(1)(e) and VIII(C)(4) of the CRS. 4 The "specified period" is the period covering the preceding 3 reporting periods (ended 31 March). 5 Such as trading in money market instruments (cheques, bills, certificates of deposit, derivatives etc), foreign exchange, exchange, interest rate and index instruments, transferable securities, commodity futures trading, individual and collective portfolio management, or otherwise investing, administering or managing financial assets or money on behalf of other persons. Refer to the definition of "Investment Entity" a) in the CRS for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (AEOI) in the CRS at Section VIII(A)(6). CRS - Corporate Trustee Guidance 2 • The entity: – derives its income "primarily" (at least half of its income – 50% or more over the specified period 6 ) from investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets, and – is managed by another financial institution (other than a managed investment entity). 7 The definition of investment entity also refers to the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations (FATF recommendations), which underpin New Zealand's Anti-Money Laundering regime, and is based on looking at the nature of the activities that the entity performs (ie an activity based focus), as opposed to a narrow focus of what entity within a group of entities may receive the payment for such activities. For example, under the FATF recommendations: • An entity performing individual portfolio management/custodial services for customers would still be a financial institution under the FATF recommendations even if another entity within the group received the remuneration for those services for matters of administrative convenience, and • An entity performing collective portfolio management services for customers would still be a financial institution under the FATF recommendations even if another entity within the group received the remuneration for those services for matters of administrative convenience. Therefore, it is a principle underpinning the definition of investment entity – which needs to be read in accordance with the FATF recommendations – that an entity that would otherwise be a financial institution because of the activities/services that it carries out would not cease to be a financial institution simply if another group entity receives the fees for those services for matters of administrative convenience. We also note that New Zealand introduced the CRS (and the related CRS commentary) into New Zealand law with the purpose of participating in a globally consistent approach to the application of CRS due diligence, reporting, and exchange of information requirements. Similarly, the CRS commentary itself emphasises the importance of jurisdictions interpreting fundamental parts of the CRS consistently, so that there is a consistent and 'level playing field' amongst Participating Jurisdictions. For example, page 16 of the CRS booklet (which includes the CRS and the CRS commentary) states that: "For each section of the Model CAA and the CRS, there is a detailed Commentary that is intended to illustrate or interpret its provisions. The Commentaries are contained in Part III of the Report. Given that implementation will be based on domestic law, it is important to ensure consistency in application across jurisdictions to avoid creating unnecessary costs and complexity for financial institutions in particular those with operations in more than one jurisdiction. For certain limited situations alternatives are provided for in the Commentaries (Emphasis added)." Similarly, page 176 of the CRS commentary states (albeit in relation to a different technical issue) that in adopting domestic guidance: "care should be taken to address any inconsistencies that may arise in a cross border context....so that the guidance does not frustrate the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard (Emphasis added)." The global approach taken by jurisdictions implementing the CRS (known as Participating Jurisdictions) has been to read the reference to "primarily as a business" in the definition of 6 The "specified period" is the period covering the preceding 3 reporting periods (ended 31 March). 7 Refer to definition of "Investment Entity" (b) in the CRS at Section VIII(A)(6). CRS - Corporate Trustee Guidance 3 investment entity (and a conceptually similar reference in the definition of custodial institution) contextually as covering an entity that performs the specified investment activities that are remunerated, irrespective of what entity within the group receives the payment for such services. This is consistent with the FATF recommendations. We have set out a summary of this global approach in the appendix to this guidance. This global approach - focusing on the nature of the activities that the entity performs and the remuneration that is attributable to those activities in determining whether the entity is a financial institution - is further supported by numerous parts of the CRS commentary, 8 which point to the nature of such activities as determining whether or not an entity is a financial institution, and, indeed, the type of financial institution that the entity is (i.e. the difference between an investment entity and a specified insurance company is based on the different types of activities that the entity carries out). The examples set out below outline Inland Revenue's view of the circumstances when corporate trustees (and the trusts they act for) will be investment entity financial institutions for CRS purposes. These examples: • align with the global approach to interpreting the language in the definition of investment entity (and a similar conceptual approach to the definition of custodial institution), and • are consistent with the background context and purpose underpinning the introduction of the CRS in New Zealand. Section 185O and Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) have also been amended to clarify the application of the CRS to a financial institution that is an Investment Entity or Custodial Institution for CRS purposes. These amendments are in line with the above guidance. Examples The following examples provide guidance about the circumstances when corporate trustees within professional groups (and the trusts that they act for) will come within the CRS definition of financial institution. These examples are also subject to review by the OECD, so are potentially subject to change. The nature of a payment in this context (for example, whether it constitutes 'trustee fees' and what those fees relate to) will depend on what the payment is "for". This will require a consideration of the particular facts and will not be based simply on the label that is used to describe the payment. There is also a CRS anti-avoidance provision set out in section 185R of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that could potentially apply to deem a corporate trustee (and the trusts they act for) to be financial institutions if an arrangement is entered into for a person to avoid being a financial institution. If a corporate trustee or trust is a financial institution, they will generally 9 have CRS due diligence and (if they have any reportable accounts) reporting obligations. If such entities are not financial institutions, but hold accounts with financial institutions they will have obligations to assist such other institutions with their CRS due diligence. 8 For example, page 160 (paragraph 11), page 161(paragraphs 13 and 14), page 162 (paragraphs 15-16 and 20), and page 165 (paragraphs 20 and 29). 9 However, a financial institution trust is able to engage a reporting financial institution trustee to carry out CRS due diligence and reporting on its behalf. The trust – in this context – is then known as a "trustee documented trust", which is a type of Non-Reporting financial institution. It is important to note, though, that if the trustee does not comply with such obligations (i.e. due diligence and reporting obligations), these obligations will then revert to the trust. CRS - Corporate Trustee Guidance 4 Further information about these obligations is set out in the following Inland Revenue guidance: • IR CRS Guidance (IR1048) • IR CRS Family Trust Guidance (IR1053) • IR CRS Registration and Reporting User Guide • http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/exchange/crs/crs-registration-reporting/ Example 1 A trust is set up on the advice of a professional firm (for example a law firm or an accounting firm) to their client. That firm's corporate trustee acts as the trustee of the trust. A trust's income is 100% attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets (such as shares and bonds) over the specified period. 10 The corporate trustee acts for the trust (as a business) without itself directly charging any fees. However, its related entity (the firm) charges trustee fees for the corporate trustee's services of investing, administering or managing the trust's assets (i.e. investing, administering or managing financial assets). The firm receives the trustee fees for matters of administrative convenience. The trustee fees are 100% attributable to investing, administering or managing the trust's financial assets. Is the corporate trustee a financial institution? Yes. The trustee fees are primarily attributable (i.e. 50% or more – 100% in this case) to the trustee's services of investing, administering or managing the trust's financial assets and money. Therefore, the trustee is an investment entity financial institution. This is the case even though the firm receives the trustee fees (not the trustee) for matters of administrative convenience. Is the trust a financial institution? Yes. The trust is managed by a financial institution (the corporate trustee). The trust's gross income is also primarily attributable (50% or more – 100% in this case) to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets (such as shares and bonds) over the specified period. Therefore, the trust is an investment entity financial institution. Example 2 The facts are the same as example 1, except that there is no charge for the corporate trustee's services (i.e. no trustee fees). Is the corporate trustee a financial institution? No. There are no trustee fees (i.e. the corporate trustee is not remunerated). Therefore, the corporate trustee can't be a financial institution. Is the trust a financial institution? No. This is because the trust is not managed by a financial institution (i.e. the corporate trustee is not a financial institution). \[Please note, however, that the trust would still be a financial institution if it was managed by some other financial institution\]. 10 The "specified period" is the period covering the preceding 3 reporting periods (ended 31 March). CRS - Corporate Trustee Guidance 5 Example 3 A trust is set up on the advice of a professional firm (for example a law firm or an accounting firm) to their client. That firm's corporate trustee acts as the trustee of the trust. A trust's income is 50% attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets (such as shares and bonds) over the specified period. 11 The other 50% of the trust's income is attributable to rental from an investment property (a non-financial asset) over the specified period. The corporate trustee acts for the trust (as a business) without itself directly charging any fees. However, its related entity (the firm) charges trustee fees for the corporate trustee's services of investing, administering or managing the trust's assets (i.e. investing, administering or managing financial assets) and administering/managing the investment property. The firm receives the trustee fees for matters of administrative convenience. The trustee fees are 50% attributable to investing, administering or managing the trust's financial assets. The other 50% of the trustee fees are attributable to investing, administering, or managing the investment property (a non-financial asset). Is the corporate trustee a financial institution? Yes. The trustee fees are primarily attributable (50%) to the trustee's services of investing, administering or managing the trust's financial assets and money. Therefore, the trustee is an investment entity financial institution. This is the case even though the firm receives the trustee fees (not the trustee) for matters of administrative convenience. Is the trust a financial institution? Yes. The trust is managed by a financial institution (the corporate trustee). The gross income of the trust is also primarily attributable (50%) to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets such as shares and bonds) over the specified period. Therefore, the trust is an investment entity financial institution. Example 4 A trust is set up on the advice of a professional firm (for example a law firm or an accounting firm) to their client. That firm's corporate trustee acts as the trustee of the trust. A trust's income is 50% attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets (such as shares and bonds) over the specified period. 12 The other 50% of the trust's income is attributable to rental from an investment property (a non-financial asset) over the specified period. The trust was set up on the advice of a professional firm (for example a law firm or an accounting firm) to their client and that firm's own corporate trustee is the trustee of the trust. The corporate trustee engages a financial institution provider of discretionary investment management services (a DIMS provider) to manage the trust's financial assets (the shares and bonds). The corporate trustee manages and administers the trust's investment property and carries out general trust administration. The corporate trustee acts for the trust (as a business) without itself directly charging any fees. However, its related entity (the firm) charges trustee fees for the corporate trustee's services of managing and administering the trust's investment property and carrying out general trust administration. The firm receives the trustee fees for matters of administrative convenience. The trustee fees are 90% attributable to managing and administering the trust's investment property (a non- financial asset) and providing general trust administration. 10% of the trustee fees are attributable to managing and administering money (including receipt of rental/paying rates and insurance etc) as an incidental part of providing these services. 11 The "specified period" is the period covering the preceding 3 reporting periods (ended 31 March). 12 The "specified period" is the period covering the preceding 3 reporting periods (ended 31 March). CRS - Corporate Trustee Guidance 6 The DIMS provider is also remunerated (by the trust) for its services of managing the trust's financial assets. Is the corporate trustee a financial institution? No. The trustee fees are primarily attributable (90% in this case) to managing and administering the trust's investment property (a non-financial asset) and providing general trust administration. Therefore, the corporate trustee is not a financial institution. Is the trust a financial institution? Yes. The trust is managed by a financial institution (the DIMS provider). The gross income of the trust is also primarily attributable (i.e. 50% or more – 50% in this case) to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets (such as shares and bonds) over the specified period. Therefore, the trust is an investment entity financial institution. Example 5 A corporate trustee is a trustee of a trust whose only asset is a family home. The trust was set up on the advice of a professional firm (for example a law firm or an accounting firm) to their client and that firm's own corporate trustee is the trustee of the trust. The trust does not derive any income. The corporate trustee acts for the trust (as a business) without itself directly charging any fees. However, its related entity (the firm) charges trustee fees for the corporate trustee's services of general trust administration and activities related to the family home (a non-financial asset). The firm receives the trustee fees for matters of administrative convenience. Is the corporate trustee a financial institution? No. The trustee fees are not primarily attributable (50% or more) to specified financial services (such as managing, investing, or administering financial assets or money). Instead, the trustee fees are for general trust administration and activities related to the family home (a non-financial asset). Therefore, the corporate trustee is not an investment entity financial institution. Is the trust a financial institution? No. The trust does not derive any income. Therefore, it cannot be a financial institution.

Allocation
----------

Applications for rulings will be assigned to relevant business units within Inland Revenue on the basis of the technical issues in each application.

[See our allocation guidelines](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/the-application-process/allocation-guidelines)

Inland Revenue will:

*   do the legal analysis required to consider how the tax laws apply within the agreed time frame.
*   contact you if there are questions or we need more information, and
*   send you a draft ruling or a contrary view.

* * *

Draft ruling
------------

If we agree in principle with the legal arguments and conclusions in your application, we'll send you a draft ruling for comment. The draft ruling will include a detailed description of the facts including any specified conditions we consider are necessary, and set out our conclusions on how the tax laws apply.

* * *

Contrary view
-------------

If we do not consider that we can make the ruling as requested in your application, we'll write to you, setting out our initial contrary views and their legal basis. This could occur if:

*   we do not agree with the legal arguments and conclusions in your ruling application
*   significant changes to your arrangement would be necessary for us to conclude that we can rule as requested
*   we would need to include significant conditions to rule favourably.

* * *

Consultation
------------

Once you receive a draft ruling or contrary view, you'll have the opportunity to provide us with comments. For draft rulings, you can comment on any factual matters, the wording of any specified conditions s, or our conclusions. We'll consider your comments and (if we agree) make any relevant changes to the draft ruling. When you have approved the content of the draft ruling we'll finalise it.

If you receive a letter advising you of a contrary view, you'll have one opportunity to make further arguments or submissions in response to our letter. We'll also offer to meet you to discuss our views, either before or after sending the letter.

We aim to respond to any substantive comments or submissions you make (about either a draft ruling or contrary view) within one month of receiving them.

* * *

Publication of rulings
----------------------

We do not publish private rulings in any form. They are confidential between the applicant(s) and Inland Revenue. If a private ruling raises a topic of general interest, we may subsequently develop and issue a public ruling on that topic without referring to the details of the applicant(s).

We are required by law to publish product rulings two months after the ruling has been made (signed) on our website and in our _Tax Information Bulletin_ (TIB).

If you ask us to, we can publish it before two months have passed. You may have a business reason for doing this, for example, you might want to refer to the product ruling in your advertising material.

* * *

OECD information sharing
------------------------

Under Action 5 of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, OECD and G20 countries, including New Zealand, are required to exchange information about taxpayer-specific rulings issued on cross-border activities. This will cover six categories of rulings as follows:

1.  Taxpayer-specific rulings related to preferential regimes (although New Zealand does not have any preferential regimes).
2.  Cross-border unilateral APAs and any other cross-border unilateral tax rulings covering transfer pricing or the application of transfer pricing principles.
3.  Cross-border rulings providing for a unilateral downward adjustment to the taxpayer’s taxable profits that is not directly reflected in the taxpayer’s financial/commercial accounts.
4.  Permanent establishment rulings, ie rulings concerning the existence or absence of, and/or the attribution of profits to, a permanent establishment by the country giving the ruling.
5.  Related party conduit rulings.
6.  Any other type of ruling that, in the absence of spontaneous information exchange, gives rise to BEPS concerns.

This requirement covers all private and product rulings, APAs and financial arrangement determinations that come within the above criteria. The Commissioner is required to ensure that information regarding the relevant rulings is exchanged within three months of the ruling being issued.  To protect the secrecy of taxpayer information, information will only be shared with countries where New Zealand has a double tax agreement in place, and with parties to the _Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters_. 

* * *

Withdrawing an application
--------------------------

You may withdraw your application for a binding ruling at any time, for any reason, before a ruling is issued, by giving notice in writing. For example, you may want to withdraw your application if you decide not to proceed with the transaction, or if you receive a contrary view from us.

You must pay any fees incurred up to the date we receive your written withdrawal.

If one party withdraws from a joint application for a private or product ruling, we will not treat this as a withdrawal by all the applicants, unless the withdrawal:

*   clearly affects the "product" identified in the application, or
*   results in insufficient information being provided about the application.

* * *

Withdrawing a ruling
--------------------

We can withdraw a product or private ruling at any time if our interpretation of the law alters, or the courts reach a different conclusion about its meaning.

We'll notify the person who a private or product ruling applies to that we have withdrawn it and give them details of what that means. For product rulings we also publish a notice of withdrawal on our website and in the TIB.

### Correcting a ruling

If a private or product ruling has a typographical or minor error that does not change the ruling's meaning, we can correct it without having to withdraw the ruling.

This is an interlocutory application by the disputant for an order to have two questions decided in advance of the substantive trial.

Case

XXX \[2018\] NZTRA 05

Legislative References

District Court Rules 2014 r 10.21

### Summary

This is an interlocutory application by the disputant for an order to have two questions decided in advance of the substantive trial. The application arises by the disputant challenging the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) assessments of income tax and GST on a number of grounds. The Authority held that the disputant did not discharge the burden to show that it is appropriate for either question to be heard in a separate trial.

### Facts

The disputant was the sole director of AB Limited (“the Company”) from 30 September 2004 until it was placed into liquidation on \[X\] December 2009. It was removed from the Companies Register on \[Y\] August 2015.

At the time that the Company went into liquidation, it had a self-assessed GST liability of $3.8 million. The disputant does not seek to challenge those self-assessments.

On 28 March 2014, the Commissioner reassessed the Company’s income tax for the years ended 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 together with certain GST periods. The Company’s total tax liability at that date was assessed at $13,032,717.82 including interest, shortfall penalties, late filing penalties and late payment penalties.

On 31 March 2014, the Commissioner made the disputable decision that the disputant is liable as agent for the income tax and GST liabilities of the Company under s HD 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and s 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 respectively.

### Decision

The application for a separate trial in respect of both Question One and Question Two is dismissed.

_Splitting of the Trial_

The Authority confirmed the assumption that all matters at issue are to be determined in one trial because that would normally be the most expeditious and efficient manner for dealing with a proceeding (_Clear Communications Ltd v Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd_ (1998) 12 PRNZ 333 at 334 and _Turners and Growers Ltd v Zespri Group Ltd_ HC Auckland CIV-2009-404-4392, 5 May 2010 at \[11\]). The burden to displace the presumption rests on the party seeking to split the trial. The burden has been variously described as “not insignificant”, “moderate” and “heavy” (_Haden v Attorney General_ (2011) 22 PRNZ 1 (HC) at \[46\], _KPMG New Zealand v Gemmell_ HC Auckland CIV-2018-404-4288, 27 March 2009 at \[20\] and _Clear Communications_ at 335).

The Authority has a broad discretion in granting an order under r 10.21 of the District Court Rules. The most important questions to be addressed before granting an application for a split trial are as follows (_Haden v Attorney General_ at \[50\]):

*   Will there be difficult demarcation questions between those issues to be addressed at the first trial and those left for the second?
*   Will the separate question bring the proceedings to an end?
*   What potential time saving does the separate question offer?
*   How will appeals be dealt with?
*   Are there any other practical considerations tending one way or another?

_Question One_

The Authority used the questions as a framework for its consideration and held that:

Question One could be determined as a discreet issue, however the determination of this Question would not bring the proceedings to an end and will only settle the scope of the evidence to be given at the substantive hearing which will affect the length and cost of the trial;

The time required to hear the additional evidence and submissions is estimated at only 4 days, and if Question One is held in the disputant’s favour, there will be no time saved in the substantive trial. Rather, further lead time and cost will have been added in relation to the separate trial.

No right of appeal exists from an Authorities decision on an interlocutory application. Therefore, there would be no right of appeal from the Authority’s decision on either Question One or Question Two. It would be necessary for the substantive hearing to be completed before any appeal can be filed in the High Court. This will cause difficulties including further discovery being required, duplication of time by counsel, witnesses needing to be recalled, and availability of the Authority. The possibility of an appeal is a significant consideration which the Authority held that the facts tend strongly against the granting of this application.

On Question One the Authority held that the disputant did not discharged the burden of showing that it is appropriate to direct that a separate trial be held.

_Question Two_

The same difficulties addressed above in Question One also applied to Question Two and the burden was not discharged.

The Authority finds no taxable activity and upholds the Commissioner's reassessments
====================================================================================

Decision of the Taxation Review Authority dismissing the disputant's claim and confirming the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's assessments.

Case

TRA 018/12 \[2016\] NZTRA 03

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") dismissing the disputant's claim and confirming the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") assessments. The Authority found that the disputant was not carrying on a taxable activity. The Authority also found that even if the disputant was carrying on a taxable activity, he was not entitled to input tax credits as he had failed to produce the required documentary evidence.

### Impact

This case upholds the current position of the law. In order to claim input tax deductions, a taxpayer must be carrying on a taxable activity.

### Facts

The disputant challenged reassessments made by the Commissioner denying input tax deductions claimed by him for goods and services tax ("GST") purposes.

The Commissioner deregistered the disputant and denied the deductions on the basis that the disputant was not conducting a taxable activity in the GST periods in dispute.

The Commissioner contended that even if the disputant was found to be carrying on a taxable activity, the disputant had not provided sufficient evidence to show he acquired goods and services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.

The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties for gross carelessness for each of the periods in dispute.

### Decision

The Authority dismissed the disputant's claim and confirmed the Commissioner's assessment.

#### _Issue 1: Taxable activity_

The disputant gave evidence that he was engaged in a number of taxable activities (set out below).

The Authority was not satisfied on the evidence provided that any of the alleged activities fell within the definition of "taxable activity" for the below reasons.

_1\. Acting as a tax agent_

The Authority found that while the disputant asserted he acted for many clients, he only produced six invoices for two clients.He did not provide any bank statements showing payment of any of these invoices nor did he provide any other supporting documentation of the work being performed.

Furthermore, the Authority found that even if it were to accept the disputant acted as a tax agent, it was performed on a spasmodic basis at best. Judge Sinclair was not satisfied on the evidence that the disputant was "continuously" or "regularly" engaged in providing accounting services to other persons for consideration in any of the GST periods in dispute.

_2\. Holding patent rights as patentee_

The disputant gave evidence that he held patents and that there was an accrual of profits of $290,364.42 for the period up to 31 March 1986. The disputant explained that authority to enforce equities in a patent is conferred by the Patents Act, and that the profits are "equities" he wished to enforce.The disputant saw his taxable activity as being his continual attempt to enforce the equities in the patents.

The Authority found the disputant did not detail what activities he was engaged in during the periods in dispute to enforce the "equities" nor did he produce any supporting documentation. Furthermore, the Authority could not see how any activity to enforce the alleged activities involved, or intended to involve, the supply of services to another person for consideration.

_3\. Devising inventions and patenting them_

The disputant told the Authority that devising inventions was a "continuous process" and that he was working on various inventions during the periods in dispute. However, he did not produce evidence of his design work and time spent on his inventions during any of this time. Accordingly, the Authority was not satisfied that the disputant was engaged in a taxable activity devising inventions and patenting them in any of the GST periods in dispute.

_4\. Supplying services to trusts_

The disputant produced two documents which he told the Authority were invoices issued by him to a trust for work enforcing rights which he asserts are held by the trust.He gave further evidence that he had not been paid.

The Authority, after careful consideration of the disputant's evidence, was not satisfied that the disputant was engaged in activity in the relevant GST periods that involved, or was intended to involve, the supply of services to the trust.

#### _Issue 2: Entitlement to input tax deductions_

In the event that the Authority was wrong in its view that the disputant was not engaged in a taxable activity in any of the disputed periods, the Authority considered whether the disputant was entitled to the input tax deductions he had claimed.

No deduction of input tax is allowed unless a tax invoice is held by the registered person. Registered persons are also required to keep all invoices relating to goods and services supplied by them or to them for a period of at least seven years after the end of the taxable period to which they relate.

The Authority found that the disputant had every opportunity since 2011 to produce the invoices and evidence of payment to enable him to prove his claims to a refund in the GST periods in dispute. He simply failed to do so. On the evidence before it, the Authority was unable to be satisfied that the disputant was entitled to any or all of the input tax deductions claimed by him. His claim failed accordingly.

#### _Issue 3: Shortfall penalties_

A taxpayer can be liable for a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness where the taxpayer has taken an unacceptable tax position. A taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position if, viewed objectively, his tax position fails to meet the standard of being "about as likely as not to be correct".

The Authority found that while the disputant strongly believed that his actions were taxable for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the test is objective, and a belief by the disputant that the position which he took was correct is irrelevant.

The Authority considered that the disputant showed a high level of disregard for the consequences when he filed his GST returns and that his conduct was a flagrant breach of the GST regime. The Authority noted that the disputant was an accountant by profession and held himself out as a tax agent. Furthermore, he had extensive dealings with the Commissioner over many years and he considered himself to have knowledge of GST and other tax matters.

The Authority was satisfied that the disputant's conduct created a high risk of a tax shortfall and that risk would have been recognised by any reasonable person in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Authority found the disputant liable for shortfall penalties for gross carelessness in each of the GST periods in dispute.

The bright-line test
====================

If you sell a [residential property](/api/glossary/item?id={1F912F94-D62C-4C35-899B-1FA9078EE8CA})
 any profit will be taxable if it is sold within a set period of time, the bright-line period, unless an exclusion or rollover relief applies.

This also applies to New Zealand tax residents who buy and sell overseas residential properties. 

Go to the ‘Property tax decision tool’ at the bottom of this page to work out if the property you are selling is taxable under any of the property rules, including the bright-line test.

Bright-line period
------------------

The bright-line period begins with the bright-line start date and ends with the bright-line end date.

For property sold on or after 1 July 2024, the bright-line test looks at whether your bright-line end date for the property is within 2 years of your bright-line start date.

For property sold before 1 July 2024, different timeframes apply.

Bright-line start and end dates
-------------------------------

For a standard purchase of property, the bright-line period starts from the date the property’s title is transferred to you (generally the settlement date).

For a standard sale, the bright-line period ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property.

Different rules apply for other types of purchase (for example off the plan) and for other types of sale or disposal (for example when property is gifted).

Selling residential property after the bright-line period ends
--------------------------------------------------------------

The bright-line test does not apply if you sell a property outside the bright-line period. But other property sale rules will still apply when you:

*   buy property with an intention to sell it
*   have a pattern of buying and selling or building and selling your main home
*   or a person you’re associated with is in the business of property dealing, developing or building and the property was bought for the business.

Situations where the bright-line test does not apply
----------------------------------------------------

Generally, the bright-line test does not apply to a sale of property that has been your main home when your use meets certain criteria. Business premises and farmland are also excluded. 

Full or partial rollover relief is available for certain types of ownership transfers. 

The bright-line test does not apply if you’re the executor or administrator of a deceased estate or you inherited the property.

[Inheriting property](https://www.ird.govt.nz/property/buying-and-selling/situations/inheriting-property)

Property affected by a North Island adverse weather event and sold to a Crown or local authority is not taxable under the bright-line test.

[January and February 2023 weather events](https://www.ird.govt.nz/topics/tax-relief-for-emergency-events/january-and-february-2023-weather-events)

Residential land withholding tax (RLWT)

If you're an [offshore RLWT person](/api/glossary/item?id={6B8D69CE-0CA9-48C0-B870-63F4D73E7E7E})
 and have a sale subject to the bright-line test, a withholding tax will be deducted at the time of the sale unless a valid certificate of exemption is held.

The residential land withholding tax (RLWT) should be deducted at the time of sale by your conveyancer.

[Charities Act 2005](/new-legislation/act-articles/charities-act-2005 "Charities Act 2005")

The Charities Act 2005 - Tax Implications
=========================================

Tax implications of the Charities Act 2005, including changes to the Income Tax Act, Tax Administration Act and Estate and Gift Duties Act.

The new Charities Act enacted in April 2005 established a Charities Commission which came into being on 1 July 2005.  The Commission is required to provide a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations and support and education to the charitable sector.

Several changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 as a result of the passing of the Act. 

The registration of charities is planned to start in late 2006.  The registration system will be called the "Charities Register".  The Commission will communicate with the charitable sector as it moves closer to opening this Charities Register and will support organisations wanting to register.

This article discusses the Charities Commission and the associated tax changes.

#### Background

The Charities Act arose out of concern that the charitable sector needed to be more accountable for, and transparent in, its actions to the donating public, funders and the government.  The government decided to introduce a number of legal requirements intended to ensure a greater degree of transparency and accountability.  The most significant development was the decision to establish a register of charitable organisations.  Another initiative was the requirement that charitable organisations file an annual return. 

The need for changes was first raised in the June 2001 discussion document _Tax and Charities._  The government subsequently set up a working party which recommended establishing a charities commission.  

#### Key features

The definition of "charitable purpose"

The Charities Act does not change the well-established common law definition of "charitable purpose" and, in fact, uses that definition as the basis for determining to whom the Act applies.  Under the common law definition, the four categories of charitable purpose are:

*   the advancement of education;
*   the advancement of religion;
*   the relief of poverty; and
*   benefit to the community.

A charitable entity's purposes must fall into at least one of these categories.  Furthermore, in carrying out this purpose the charitable entity must, with the exception of the relief of poverty, benefit an appreciably significant section of the community (public benefit test).

The Charities Act indicates that a charitable entity will not be disqualified from registering if it also has a secondary or supplementary non-charitable function (such as advocacy) as part of its charitable purpose.  Arguably this is merely a clarification of current law.

##### The role of the Charities Commission

In keeping with the dual objectives of establishing a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations, and providing support and education to the charitable sector, the Commission has been given a varied range of functions, including:

*   promotion of public trust and confidence in the charitable sector;
*   encouragement of the effective use of charitable resources;
*   education of charitable organisations about matters of good governance and management;
*   deciding applications for registration as a charitable entity;
*   monitoring entities to ensure they continue to qualify for registration;
*   collecting and processing annual returns submitted by charitable entities;
*   reporting and making recommendations about charitable sector matters; and
*   stimulating and promoting research about the charitable sector.

#### Benefits associated with registration

Registration with the Commission will be voluntary and will not alter a charity's legal status.  An unregistered charitable entity will still be able to call itself a charity and collect funds from the public.  However, there will be benefits for charitable entities registered by the Commission:

*   **Tax-exempt status**  
    Registration is voluntary.  However, a charitable organisation is required to register to maintain the tax benefits currently available to charities.  These benefits include:  
    *   an exemption from income tax for non-business income derived by charities (section CW 34 of the Income Tax Act 2004);
    *   an exemption for business income derived by or in support of charities (section CW 35 of the Income Tax Act 2004);
    *   rebates for individuals and deductions for companies and Maori authorities for charitable donations; and
    *   exemption from gift duty.Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 and Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 mean that only charities registered with the Commission will be exempt from income tax and gifts made to them will be exempt from gift duty.
*   **Being listed on the Charities Register**  
    Only entities registered with the Commission can call themselves registered charitable entities.  Certain information about each registered entity will be publicly available by searching the Register.  The Register will be at [www.charities.govt.nz](http://www.charities.govt.nz "This link will open a new window.")
     once it is open.
*   **Getting a registration number**  
    The Commission will give registered charitable entities a registration number.  Charitable organisations can display this number on promotional material.  This will tell the public and funding organisations that the charity has met the requirements for registration. 
*   **Information on the charitable sector**  
    By registering, charitable organisations will provide the Commission with information on the charitable sector in New Zealand.  This, in turn, will help the Commission fulfil its education and support function to the sector and public.
*   **Attending the Commission's annual meetings**  
    The Commission will hold annual meetings that can be attended by registered charitable organisations.  The meetings will give charitable organisations an opportunity to have a say in the work of the Commission.

##### Obligations associated with registration

To register, charitable organisations must:

*   submit a copy of their rules;
*   provide information about their current and proposed charitable activities; 
*   register the officers of the organisation;
*   file an annual return within six months of their nominated balance date; and
*   notify the Commission if certain information about their organisation changes.

If a registered charitable entity does not comply with the Act, the Commission has the authority if necessary, to:

*   impose administrative penalties;
*   issue warning notices;
*   publicise instances of non-compliance;
*   undertake further investigations; and
*   deregister charities if necessary.

The Commission will also have the authority to ensure registered charitable organisations are fulfilling their described purpose and complying with the Act.

##### Tax implications

Given the link between registration and tax-exemption, the charities that can register are primarily those that would also qualify for the exemption from income tax for non-business income derived by those organisations, as set out in section CW 34 of the Income Tax Act 2004.  In addition, some entities will be automatically registered.

Correspondingly, sections CW 34 and CW 35 of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to limit their application to entities registered as registered charitable entities.  Likewise, the gift duty exemption on gifts made to charities has been amended to apply only to societies, institutions and trustees of trusts who are registered as charitable entities.  

The secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been relaxed to enable Inland Revenue to share information with the Commission. 

##### Inter-departmental responsibilities

As the agency responsible for the registration of charities, the Charities Commission will determine whether the organisation's purposes are charitable at law.  Inland Revenue will continue to be responsible for ensuring that charitable organisations are eligible for various tax exemptions.  Inland Revenue is working with the Commission using a "one-stop shop" framework to develop a process so that, as a consequence of registration with the Commission, an organisation will be treated as being eligible for the tax exemptions.  Inland Revenue will retain the ability to undertake tax audits to ensure an organisation is charitable and complying with tax legislation.  The Department of Internal Affairs is the department responsible for the Commission.

##### Donee status

This change in classification means the Commission is not required to give effect to government policy but is instead required to have regard to government policy when directed by the responsible minister.  As it was not considered appropriate for the Commission to make decisions that impact on the revenue base, the proposed function of registering all donee organisations remains with Inland Revenue.

Therefore there have been no legislative changes to the provisions that enable individuals to claim rebates, and companies to claim deductions, in relation to their charitable donations.  This means that, in accordance with section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004, responsibility for assessing donee status remains with Inland Revenue for entities operating domestically, and with Parliament for entities with overseas charitable purposes. 

The fact that various functions remain with Inland Revenue does not necessarily mean that an entity will have to apply separately to Inland Revenue for the exemptions when it makes a registration application to the Charities Commission.  An integrated process is being developed so that as a consequence of registration with the Commission an organisation will be eligible for donee status.  Organisations seeking donee status that are not charities will need to deal with Inland Revenue. 

#### Application date

The establishment of the Charities Commission on 1 July 2005, the amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Gift Duties Act 1968 will come into force through an Order in Council.  The Charities Act provides that one or more Orders may be made bringing different provisions into force on different dates.  The registration process is planned to be up and running in 2006.  The tax provisions are likely to apply following the registration process, in the 2007-08 income year.

#### Detailed analysis of tax implications 

##### Register of charitable entities

Section 13 of the Charities Act details the essential requirements that must be met by a charity before it can be registered by the Commission.  Given the intent to have the same test for registration as for the charities' general income tax exemption, the registration test in section 13(1) reflects the current wording in section CW34 (1)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which provides an exemption for non-business income of charities, whether they are trusts, societies or institutions.

Under section 13(1) an entity qualifies for registration as a charitable entity if,

1.  in the case of the trustees of a trust, the trust is of a kind in relation to which an amount of income is derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes; and
2.  in the case of a society or an institution, the society or institution -
    1.  is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes; and 
    2.  is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual.

In addition, section 13(2)(a) and (3) of the Act allows a binding ruling issued under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to be determinative of whether the income of the entity has been derived for charitable purposes in accordance with the Income Tax Act 2004.  This saves a charity that has a binding ruling the compliance costs of having to apply for registration.  But once the ruling ceases to apply the Commission can assess the organisation's status in the same way as that of other applicants.  Under section 13(4) automatic registration ceases if the period for which the ruling applies expires, or if the ruling no longer applies to the entity, or if the repeal or amendment of a taxation law changes the way the taxation law applies in the ruling.

Similarly, section 13(2)(b) of the Charities Act provides that if the income derived by the trustees is deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes, under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, this is sufficient for automatic registration.

Section 14 of the Charities Act enables the Commission to make reasonable assumptions about the future derivation of income by an entity when an entity is newly established and has not yet derived income for charitable purposes.  Also, section 20 of the Act allows for the backdating of registration to enable registration to apply from when a gift is made to establish a trust.

An entity cannot register, however, if under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 it is designated as a terrorist entity or an associated entity, or is convicted of an offence under section 7 of that Act.  

##### Businesses carried on for charitable purposes

The Charities Act does not provide for the separate registration of businesses carried on by, or for, the benefit of charities.  This means that a business that is carried on by a separate legal entity from the charity to which its profits are applied generally cannot register as a charitable entity unless it meets the general charitable purpose tests in the Act in its own right.  Not being registered, however, does not negate the need for the business to observe the requirements in section CW 35 of the Income Tax Act 2004 if its income is to be exempt from income tax. Likewise, a registered charitable entity that derives business income in its own right must also meet the requirements of section CW 35.

##### Income tax exemption limited to registered charitable entities

Both sections CW 34 and 35 of the Income Tax Act 2004 have been amended to limit their application to entities registered as charitable entities (see sections 65 and 66 of the Charities Act.  This means, for example, in the case of a business carried on separately from a charity, that the income of the business must be derived for the benefit of a registered charitable entity.  Charitable income tax exemptions do not apply to council-controlled organisations or local authorities for income derived from council-controlled organisations. 

##### Additional definitions

Section 68 of the Charities Act adds a definition of "registered as a charitable entity" to section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and section 70 of the Charities Act adds a definition of "Charities Commission" to section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 

##### Charitable bequests

Section CW 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides an income tax exemption for income earned by charitable bequests.  Section 66 of the Charities Act amends section CW 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to provide a grace period for entities receiving charitable bequests before they need to register with the Commission.  This provision deals with the situation where, for example, a bequest creates a charitable trust and it takes over a year for the estate to be settled.  In such cases, registration as a charitable entity is not required until the end of the income year following the income year in which the person making the bequest died.  After that time, income will be taxable unless the entity is registered. 

##### Information sharing

Section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 outlines the circumstances when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may disclose information that would otherwise be subject to the tax secrecy provisions.  Section 71 of the Charities Act extends section 81(4) to allow for information to be shared with the Charities Commission provided the person is authorised by the Commission to receive the information and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers that:

*   it is not undesirable to disclose the information; and
*   the information is reasonably necessary to enable the person to carry out their duties as lawfully conferred by the Charities Commission. 

This relaxation of the secrecy provisions will, for example, enable Inland Revenue to pass on to the Commission its list of entities that have sought confirmation of their charitable status over the years, thereby streamlining part of the registration process.  

Conversely, section 30 of the Charities Act enables the Commission to share registry information or documents with Inland Revenue when doing so is for the purpose of assisting the exercise of powers or functions under the Inland Revenue Acts.  This will help to achieve a more integrated approach between registration and qualification for a range of tax exemptions.   

##### Estate and Gift Duties Act

Section 73(1) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 has been amended by section 72 of the Charities Act so that the gift duty exemption applies only to gifts made to societies, institutions and trustees of trusts who are registered as charitable entities.

The Commissioner is correct not to exercise statutory discretion
================================================================

2009 case note - CIR correct not to exercise discretion at section 141KB to remit a short fall penalty.

Case

TRA 017/08 Decision 5/2009

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner was correct not to exercise his discretion at section 141KB to remit a short fall penalty.

### Impact of decision

Limited as section 141KB has since been repealed.

### Facts

The taxpayer partnership sold property as part of its GST activity. This was thought to be zero rated but was in fact subject to GST. The purchaser paid the GST portion. The taxpayers' solicitor sent numerous items of correspondence referring, indirectly, to this. However, the taxpayers failed to account for GST. Although they blamed this on their office manager, it appears the correspondence from their solicitor was not provided by the taxpayers to their office manager.

Upon being contacted by the Department the taxpayers executed an agreed adjustment. The Commissioner took the view that a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position was appropriate. The taxpayer was entitled to a "good behaviour discount". The shortfall penalty was not disputed.

Subsequently the taxpayers asked the Commissioner to exercise his discretion under section 141KB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The Commissioner declined to do so, on the basis that the taxpayers did not satisfy the conditions of that section.

The taxpayers commenced a dispute and ultimately a challenge to the Taxation Review Authority (TRA).

### Decision

The TRA found for the Commissioner saying: (42) I agree with Mr. Wallace that the disputants do not meet the cumulative criteria found at section 141KB (2) of the Act which would allow the Commissioner to consider exercising the discretion found at section141KB(1) of the Act. (43) The Commissioner accepts that there was a "clear mistake or simple oversight" by the disputants within the meaning of section 141KB(2)(1). This pre-condition in the section is not in dispute.

> (44) However, the disputants failed to make a voluntary disclosure of the tax shortfall within the meaning of section 141G(1) of the Act. I understand that the disputants accept that no voluntary disclosure was made, and do not rely upon this ground in section 141 KB (2)(a)(ii). As section 141 KB (2) (a)(ii) contains two alternative criteria, the disputants' failure to satisfy this criterion is not necessarily fatal to the exercise of the discretion in that section. That other criterion is that the tax shortfall is "temporary" under section 141l(3). I consider that the disputants' tax shortfall was not a temporary tax shortfall within the meaning of section 141l of the Act as it was not permanently reversed or corrected before the disputants were first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation on 26 March 2005.
> 
> (47) I agree that the taxpayer fails to meet the element of section 141l(3)(d) that the tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer was first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation.
> 
> (48) Also, I agree with Mr. Wallace (and I explain below) that it is not appropriate in this particular case, that the taxpayer not be liable for the shortfall penalty. Accordingly, the disputants failed to satisfy section 141KB(2)(a)(iii).

(at paragraph \[44\] the last line should refer to 26 May 2005). 

The Judge considered section 141KB (2) (a) (iii) stating in paragraph (66):

*   (66) The Act does not identify what factors should be considered when determining whether or not it is appropriate to remit a shortfall penalty on the taxpayer, but the Act seems to focus upon the circumstances of the case relating to the particular taxpayer for whom remission is to be considered. Here, the disputants were appropriately subject to the shortfall penalty for the following reasons:
    1.  They had the benefit of legal advice in respect of the GST implications of the sale of the property.
    2.  They were sent reporting letters from their lawyers (dated 27 January 2005 and 28 January 2005) regarding the property sale.
    3.  They were sent a final statement from their lawyer showing the deposit of $1,097,864.24 to their bank account and showing a precise break down of that sum. This settlement shows, on even a cursory glance, the payment of $997,375.00 (and a deposit of $97,500.00) being much greater than the agreed sum in the sale and purchase agreement of $975,000.00 (dated 2 February 2005). It was made clear that the GST on the sale had been collected from the purchaser

Barber J then considered whether or not there were grounds for the exercise of sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. He concluded at paragraph \[76\] that:

*   "while it is possible that the overarching role of sections 6 and 6A could be a relevant consideration regarding the application of section141KB (2)(a)(111) when considering if it is appropriate to remit the penalty, on the facts of this case, I find that it is not appropriate to do so. The factors in section 141KB are cumulative. Satisfying section 141KB (2)(a) (111) even with the aid of section 6 and section 6A, will not assist the disputants if, they cannot meet the other criteria for cancellation under section 141KB."

His Honour considered that, given the actual knowledge of the taxpayers and the imputed knowledge from their solicitor, using the section would be against the perceptions of integrity (par \[77\]).

The Commissioner obtains interim charging order and mareva injunction over trust assets
=======================================================================================

2007 case note - CIR obtained an interim mareva injunction and pre-judgment charging orders over assets held by a corporate trustee.

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Joseph Colin Skudder, Willerton Investments Limited, Athena Professional Trustees Limited

Legislative References

Judicature Act 1908

### Summary

The Commissioner obtained an interim mareva injunction and pre-judgment charging orders over assets held by a corporate trustee, which were prima facie beneficially owned by the taxpayer

### Facts

The taxpayer is a successful property developer/speculator and the Commissioner has sued him for in excess of $3.5 million in unpaid tax debt. The substantive proceedings are currently before the Taxation Review Authority.

During the course of an investigation into the taxpayer's tax affairs it was identified that he generally operated behind the veil of trading trusts and/or limited liability companies. The taxpayer maintains full and unfettered control of these entities but does not own any significant assets in his own name. All entities which the taxpayer is associated with have an unsatisfactory compliance history in terms of their return filing and payment obligations. The taxpayer is the director and shareholder of Athena Professional Trustees Limited ("Athena"), a corporate trustee company, and settlor and final beneficiary of the CBD Properties Trust (CBD Trust"). A number of properties owned by Athena were actively being marketed by the taxpayer.

The Commissioner's case was that if those properties were sold before judgment is given against the taxpayer there may be no assets left against which the Commissioner could seek to recover the unpaid tax debt. Effectively, the taxpayer would be judgment proof.

The Commissioner sought a mareva injunction and pre-judgement charging orders over the properties held by Athena.

### Decision

To obtain a pre-judgment charging order the burden of proof rests on the Commissioner to show that the taxpayer is making away with his property with the intent to defeat his creditors. For a mareva injunction all that needs to be shown is there is a real risk the properties are going to be sold with the intention to defeat the Commissioner as a creditor.

The Commissioner relied on evidence of the taxpayer's previous non-compliance with his tax obligations and the tax obligations of entities which he controlled. The Court accepted that previous behaviour was likely to evidence future such conduct and in that regard held:

\[20\] Given the apparent level of revenue being generated by the properties and the fact that no income tax has ever been paid voluntarily it is difficult to resist the inference that the taxpayer has deliberately conducted his affairs over several years so as to avoid meeting tax obligations. It is reasonable to assume that he is likely to continue this pattern when it comes to the sale of the properties in question ie that he will act with the underlying intention of avoiding his tax obligations.

The Court then examined the question of whether or not the orders sought could be given in view of the fact that Athena was the registered proprietor of the properties over which the orders were sought. The Court stated that if a prima facie case could be made out showing beneficial ownership vested in the taxpayer, then the orders sought could be granted.

The Commissioner presented affidavit evidence showing the taxpayer dealt with the properties as if they were his personal property. In addition, the taxpayer was the director and shareholder of Athena, he was the settlor and final beneficiary of the CDB Trust. The Court accepted that the taxpayer via Athena and the CBD Trust had complete control of the assets and it was more likely than not that the taxpayer was the beneficial owner and held:

\[31\] I am therefore satisfied that, at the least, there is an arguable case that the taxpayer is the beneficial owner of the properties. In fact, I think that the position is actually stronger than that and that it is more likely than not that he is the beneficial owner.

In the result the Court was satisfied that the Commissioner had discharged the onus for the Court to grant interim pre-judgement charging orders and mareva injuctions over the properties in question.

The Commissioner's application to strike out disputant's notice of claim
========================================================================

2016 case note - TRA's decision reinforces the importance of serving a Notice of Claim in accordance the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998.

Case

TRA 027/14 \[2015\] NZTRA 19

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) applied to strike out the disputant’s Notice of Claim for non-compliance with s 138B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) and, in the alternative, for want of prosecution. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) held that the proceeding must be treated as having been discontinued as the claim was not effected on the Commissioner. In the alternative, the Authority held that there has been inordinate delay and that the dismissal of the disputant’s claim is justified as the Commissioner will suffer serious prejudice if the disputant was permitted at this stage to pursue his claim.

### Impact

The Authority’s decision reinforces the importance of service of a Notice of Claim on the Commissioner in accordance with regs 8(2) and 13 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 (“the Regulations”).

Also, in dismissing the proceeding for want of prosecution, the Authority considered whether any fault on the Commissioner’s part led to the delay, whether any steps have been taken to gather and preserve evidence, and time and costs incurred by the Commissioner.

### Facts

The Commissioner applied to strike out a Notice of Claim alleged by the disputant to have been filed with the Authority on or about 8 December 2011, for non-compliance with s 138B of the TAA. In the alternative, the Commissioner applied to dismiss the proceeding for want of prosecution.

Evidence was given by the investigator (“Mr Brown”) who was responsible for the disputant’s file, and by the disputant’s accountant (“Mr Jones”).

On 6 December 2011, before the final assessments for the relevant tax years were issued, Mr Jones sent an email to the Authority, which he copied to Mr Brown and to which he attached a letter stating that a notice of claim and a cheque for the filing fee were attached.

On 7 and 8 December 2011, discussions took place to resolve the outstanding issues before final assessments were issued. In an email on 8 December 2011, Mr Jones stated: “I will communicate with Ministry of Justice and try & put a hold on presenting the cheque so mailed yesterday?”.

Mr Jones gave evidence that he did call the Tribunals Unit but he was informed that the cheque and claim had already been processed.

On 21 May 2012, the case manager at the Tribunals Unit sent an email to Mr Jones seeking to confirm whether the matter was going to proceed with the Authority. No reply was ever sent to the case manager.

Deduction notices pursuant to s 157 of the TAA, were issued and funds sufficient to clear the disputant’s tax liabilities were deducted from the disputant’s account.

In December 2014, the proceeding was registered on a without prejudice basis.

### Decision

The Authority held that the proceeding is treated as discontinued pursuant to r 5.68 of the District Court Rules. In the alternative, the Authority dismissed the proceeding for want of prosecution.

**_Was the notice of claim filed in the Authority in accordance with s 138B(2)(c) of the TAA?_**

The Authority considered that it is reasonable to expect that the claim would have been received (at the earliest) on 8 December 2011 and the cheque was banked on this date. The Authority held that the disputant was entitled under s 138B(2) of the TAA to bring challenge proceedings on 8 December 2011, the date on which the notice of claim was filed.

The Authority held that the claim was filed in accordance with s 138B(2)(c) of the TAA and that the events that followed did not alter the fact that the notice of claim was filed with the Authority and that the requisite fee was paid.

**_Was the notice of claim served on the Commissioner?_** 

The Authority referred to regulations 8(2) and 13 of the Regulations which set out the requirements for service of a notice of claim.

The Authority stated that there is no evidence to support Mr Jones’ assertion that “as far as he was concerned” Mr Brown had accepted service of the notice of claim.

The Authority held that the proceeding must therefore be treated as having been discontinued pursuant to r 5.68 of the District Court Rules 2014.

**_In the alternative, has the disputant failed to prosecute the claim?_**

The Authority held that there has been inordinate delay by the disputant as the notice of claim was filed in December 2011 and no progress was made until the matter came to life in September 2014. The Authority did not consider that there was any credible excuse for the delay.

The Authority accepted that the Commissioner did not know the claim had been filed and is now prejudiced in that no steps have been taken to gather and preserve evidence. The Authority also did not consider that this is a case where there has been any fault on the part of the Commissioner which has led to the delay.

Having regard to the interests of justice, the Authority held that the dismissal of the disputant’s claim is justified as the Commissioner will suffer serious prejudice if the disputant was permitted at this stage to pursue his claim.

The Commissioner's discretion to amend assessments - s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994
=============================================================================================

2015 case note – Judge held that 'judicial review must be refused except when the statutory process could never be invoked' – assessments, carry forward losses.

Case

Charter Holdings Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

Charter Holdings Limited ("Charter Holdings") applied to judicially review a decision of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") not to amend her assessment of its tax liability in the 2006 to 2012 tax years ("the Decision") pursuant to s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The Commissioner considered that Charter Holdings should have engaged the statutory disputes and challenge procedure, and that its judicial review was a collateral attack on the validity of her assessments and therefore must be refused.

### Impact

The decision supports the _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner Inland Revenue,_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 ("_Tannadyce_") principle that tax assessments cannot be challenged by way of a judicial review unless the taxpayer's concerns could not practically be addressed via the relevant statutory procedure. Moore J held that "judicial review must be refused except when the statutory process could never be invoked".

### Facts

On 12 December 2012, the Commissioner sent Charter Holdings a final notice advising that its income tax returns were overdue for the eight tax years between 2005 and 2012. Charter Holdings' 2004 return was also outstanding, but not requested.

On 5 March 2013, Mr Padfield, director of Charter Holdings, filed the requested returns recording a loss in 2005 and net profit in the 2006 to 2012 years. Charter Holdings had claimed losses in previous years' returns, none of which were carried forward because of the way Mr Padfield filled in its income tax returns.

Between 17 March 2013 and 31 May 2013, notices of assessment were automatically generated and issued for these returns. These notices showed that Charter Holdings had tax to pay on its profits recorded in its 2006 to 2012 income tax returns.

On 10 April 2013, Charter Holdings sent a letter to the Commissioner setting out that the losses reported in its earlier income tax returns had not been applied to its subsequent profits. Charter Holdings requested that the assessments for the 2006 to 2012 years be amended to take its losses into account.

On 19 July 2013, the Commissioner responded stating that the outstanding 2004 return would need to be filed before the requested amendments could be considered. Charter Holdings filed its 2004 return eight and a half months later but again did not carry forward any losses.

After receiving the 2004 return, the Commissioner asked Charter Holdings to provide further information to substantiate the validity of the losses it wished to carry forward. Mr Padfield provided Charter Holdings' financial statements for these years and requested that the losses be applied to trading in subsequent years.

The Commissioner reviewed Charter Holdings' request and the information provided in support. She was not satisfied as to the legitimacy of the losses and declined to exercise her discretion under s 113.

### Decision

Moore J began by explaining the Statutory Disputes and Challenge Procedure ("SDCP"), as set out in parts 4A and 8A of the TAA. His Honour set out Charter Holdings' compliance history, and the dates by which it would need to have filed a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") to engage in the SDCP. His Honour noted that Charter Holdings had consistently failed to file its income tax returns within statutory timeframes.

Moore J considered that the present case involved the effectiveness of the Ouster Provisions. His Honour explained that the Ouster Provisions generally prevent the Commissioner's assessments from being questioned outside the SDCP.  

Moore J considered the Supreme Court's decision in _Tannadyce_ where the majority held that assessments could not be challenged by way of a judicial review unless the taxpayer's concerns could not practically be addressed through the relevant statutory procedure. Moore J considered that "_Tannadyce_ has established a settled practice that the Court must refuse judicial review except when the statutory process ‘could never be invoked'".

Moore J discussed _Arai Korp Ltd v CIR_ \[2013\] NZHC 958, (2013) 26 NZTC 21,014 ("_Arai Korp_") as an example of an application of the practice set out in _Tannadyce._ In _Arai Korp_,Wylie Jrejected an application to judicially review a decision not to invoke s 113 of the TAA for default income tax assessments. Wylie J observed that the dispute procedure was clearly available to Arai Korp and its real challenge was to the correctness of the default assessments. The accuracy of the tax assessments should have been challenged through the disputes procedure, and if necessary the challenge procedure. Wylie J held that s 113 was not meant to be used as a mechanism to bypass these procedures.

In this proceeding the Commissioner relied on _Arai Korp_ as emphasising the principle that before a taxpayer can engage in the SDCP, it needs to file a tax return and have issued a NOPA within the statutory timeframes. If Arai Korp sought to correct the assessments, it should have used the SDCP regime rather than seek to judicially review the decision under s 113 of the TAA not to amend the assessments. Here the Commissioner submitted that the SDCP was available to Charter Holdings and no proper explanation had been proffered as to why it was not engaged.

Charter Holdings submitted it had no opportunity to make use of the SDCP. Charter Holdings alleged that on 10 April 2013 it made the request to supply corrected new assessments but it was not until 19 July 2013 that the Commissioner responded by which time the NOPA periods for the 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years had expired. However, although the Commissioner's response predated the expiry of the NOPA periods for the 2007 and 2008 tax years, she suggested Charter Holdings take a different course to filing a NOPA, namely to file the 2004 return and seek to have the losses carried forward. By the time the Commissioner responded, declining to re-assess under s 113, the SDCP was no longer available.

Prior to examining the availability of the statutory objection procedure, Moore J emphasised the central importance of complying with statutory time limits in tax administration, referring to _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wilson_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 (CA)_._

Moore J then found that _Arai Korp_ had direct application, and that Charter Holdings had opportunity to engage in the SDCP. His Honour determined that Charter Holdings, through its own defaults, did not take the steps necessary to engage in the statutory process. Charter Holdings was obliged to put itself into a compliant position and engage in the SDCP to seek any necessary adjustments so that its tax position was correct.

Moore J considered that Charter Holdings had ample opportunity to issue NOPAs and that Mr Padfield would have known that a procedure existed for determining disputes over tax liability. Furthermore, the reverse side of every notice of assessment contains a general description of what a taxpayer needs to do to engage in the SDCP if it does not agree with the assessment.

Consequently, Moore J held that "applying the principles of _Tannadyce_, I am not satisfied that this is one of those rare cases where judicial review is not precluded where a hearing authority does not have the ability to consider any challenge on whatever grounds". Furthermore, His Honour set out that "judicial review must be refused except where the statutory process could never be invoked", and that "the statutory process could have been invoked by Charter Holdings". Moore J described Charter Holdings' judicial review application as "a collateral challenge to the Commissioner's assessments".

Moore J dismissed the application for judicial review on the basis that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with or determine matters of tax liability or quantum. His Honour considered that these are properly matters which should have been pursued through the SDCP.

The Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates
==============================================

The Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates lists the general economic depreciation rates and provisional depreciation rates set by the CIR.

The Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates lists the general economic depreciation rates and provisional depreciation rates set by the Commissioner.

The Commissioner sets economic rates (commonly referred to as "general economic rates" because they apply to many taxpayers) in determinations pursuant to section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner also sets provisional rates in determinations pursuant to section 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Commissioner sets provisional rates for items of depreciable property where less information is available about that particular kind of item than is required to set reliably a general economic rate, such as where the item is new technology or new to New Zealand. After a period, the Commissioner reviews the provisional rate and often replaces it with a general economic rate.

Notifications of draft determinations for general economic rates are published for public consultation in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ and on this website in [Public consultation](/internet/ird/public-consultation/public-consultation-index.html)
.

When determinations are finalised, they are published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ and on this website.

General economic rates and provisional rates are also listed in various publications, including the Inland Revenue's [_General Depreciation Rates_ (IR265)](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/businessincometax/ir265-guide-general-depreciation-rates.html)
 and the [Depreciation Rate Finder](/internet/ird/calculators/keyword/depreciation/calculator-depreciation-rate-finder.html)
.

"Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1" ("DEP1") was the first depreciation rate determination the Commissioner issued. DEP1 was issued on 5 April 1993 and published in the Appendices to _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 4, No 9 (May 1993). DEP1 lists kinds of items with their corresponding general economic rates set by the Commissioner. Since DEP1 was issued, the Commissioner has set additional general economic rates and provisional rates for other kinds of items in subsequent determinations.

The Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates has been referred to as "DEP1", and determinations issued after DEP1 have referred to "amending DEP1" by adding further items and rates. However, more correctly in terms of the legislation, the Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates includes not only DEP1, but other subsequent determinations that set general economic rates or provisional rates. Therefore, depreciation rate determinations now state that the Commissioner is "setting rates" rather than "amending DEP1". Consequently the Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates is no longer referred to as "DEP1" and is now referred to as the "Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates". This change does not affect the application of any depreciation rates to items of depreciable property.

The Commissioner’s refusal to accept a NOPA upheld by Taxation Review Authority and proceeding struck-out
=========================================================================================================

2016 case note – CIR's refusal to accept a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) upheld by Taxation Review Authority and proceeding struck-out.

Case

TRA 007/16 \[2016\] NZTRA 12

Legislative References

Sections 89K and 138C Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) can refuse to accept a late Notice of Propose Adjustment (“NOPA”) where the disputant is unable to satisfy the requirement of s89K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”).

### Impact

This decision confirms the circumstances in which the Commissioner may refuse to accept a NOPA under s89K of the TAA.

### Facts

The Commissioner applied, under s89K of the TAA, to strike out proceedings brought by the disputant challenging the Commissioner’s decision to refuse to accept a NOPA claiming a goods and services tax (“GST”) refund.

According to the disputant, the Commissioner, in a letter dated 27 April 2007, promised that $6,121.83, being the amount of the GST refund, would be released “as soon as possible”.

The Commissioner took the position that she made a disputable decision on 18 August 2007 to not make the refund.

The disputant issued a NOPA on 27 September 2011, requesting the refund.

On 21 December 2011 the Commissioner informed the disputant that the NOPA was invalid.

The disputant sought orders that its NOPA be declared valid and that the refund plus interest be made.

### Decision

_Date of disputable decision_

The Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”) agreed that the Commissioner’s letter dated 20 August 2007, declining to pay the refund was a disputable decision.

_Whether the disputant can successfully challenge the Commissioner’s decision under s89K of the TAA_

_Exceptional circumstances_

The TRA found that the disputant made no mention at any stage of any event or reason why he could not issue the NOPA within the required period, and that there is no evidence of any event or circumstance beyond the control of the disputant which would provide a justification for not issuing the NOPA within the required time period.

_Demonstrable intention_

It is for the disputant to show a demonstrable intention to enter into the disputes process and the TRA found that no steps were taken by the disputant to do so. The disputant’s threat to issue legal proceedings was found not to show a demonstrable intention.

_As soon as reasonably practicable_

The TRA found the four years delay in filing the NOPA to be “simply extraordinary” and there was no possible basis on which it could be found that the NOPA was issued “as soon as reasonably practicable”.

The TRA found the disputant unable to meet the requirements of s89K of the TAA and accordingly held that it has no reasonably arguable cause of action. On this basis the Commissioner’s application to strike out the proceedings was granted.

Furthermore, the TRA also granted the Commissioner’s application to strike out on the basis that the proceedings were not issued by the disputant within the statutory time period.

In respect of the disputant’s further grounds of opposition, the TRA held as follows:

_S6 of the TAA and s27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990_ (“_NZBORA”) 1990_

The TRA rejected the disputant’s submission that a strike out application is in breach of s6 of the TAA and s27 of the NZBORA. The TRA held that the Commissioner is entitled to bring a strike out application if she considers that grounds exist for doing so and that the disputant has the right to oppose the application.

_TRA’s power to strike out challenge proceedings_

The TRA held that it does have jurisdiction to hear and determine interlocutory applications, including strike out applications. The TRA stated that Regulation 4 of the District Court Rules applies to interlocutory steps and proceedings in the TRA as if those proceedings were civil proceedings in the District Court, and there is no inconsistency between the District Court Rules and the Regulations.

### Summary

An arrangement was entered into by the taxpayer for the purchase of a mining licence for $45 million for which the taxpayer sought an input tax deduction. The transaction was void under section 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA). The Court found that the effect of the structure supporting the transaction was to produce a GST refund totally disproportionate to the economic burden undertaken by the taxpayer. They found that the end in view was a distortion which very plainly defeated the intent and application of the Act.

### Impact of decision

A well reasoned decision which confirms that where transactions are not a "sham", the Commissioner is still entitled to consider the tax consequences of the transactions under section 76 of the GSTA. The court has confirmed that section 76 is a general anti-avoidance provision and therefore every avoidance issue will need to be assessed objectively on its merits on a case-by-case basis.

### Facts

This case dealt with the treatment by the Commissioner of a GST second-hand goods input claim made by Glenharrow Holdings Limited ("Glenharrow") after Glenharrow purchased a mining licence from Michael Meates for the sum of $45 million.

The mining licence was issued in November 1990 for a period of 10 years. It was purchased in 1996 by Michael Meates for $10,000. Michael Meates did not claim GST on the mining licence and did not use it as part of a GST-registered activity. Michael Meates was approached by Gerard Fahey who wanted to purchase the licence. A valuation of the licence was undertaken by Mark Meates, a cousin of Michael Meates. Mark Meates was not a registered valuer but had studied valuation as part of his MBA. He placed a value on the licence of somewhere between $45 million and $180 million.  
  
Gerald Fahey agreed on behalf of Glenharrow to pay $45 million on the basis there would be vendor finance. A skeleton agreement was recorded between the parties which provided for an $80,000 deposit, with the remaining $44.920 million to be vendor financed. At the time Glenharrow had a share capital of $100. The deposit was obtained from its shareholder Gerald Fahey. When the licence was transferred Glenharrow gave Michael Meates a cheque for the remaining $44.920 million. Michael Meates then gave Glenharrow a cheque for the same amount as an advance by way of loan to Glenharrow. Glenharrow delivered to Michael Meates a general mortgage debenture over all its assets and over its shares. The mortgage was executed by Gerald Fahey but was without personal liability to Gerald Fahey.

The Commissioner refunded GST in relation to the deposit of $80,000 when it was claimed by Glenharrow. However, the application for a refund of $4,991,111 for the balance of $44.920 million was declined.

The statutory consent process for the transfer of the licence from Meates to Glenharrow was not completed until November 1998. By the time the licence expired in November 2000 Glenharrow had mined only 36 tonnes of rock.

**High Court decision:**  
Chisholm J found that the transaction was not a sham and that the principal purpose for the purchase of the licence was for the making of taxable supplies. Notwithstanding that, Chisholm J held that section 76 did not require proof of a subjective intention and was directed at the effect or purpose of the arrangement. He noted that the definition of "tax advantage" in section 76 (4) of the GSTA included an increase in the entitlement of any registered person to a refund of tax. Chisholm J then concluded that if the consideration for the licence was grossly inflated the input tax would also be grossly inflated. He found that the appropriate value for the mining licence was $9.757 million. The Commissioner was ordered to credit Glenharrow with a GST input deduction for the GST on the $9.757 million.

**Court of Appeal:**  
Glenharrow appealed against the High Court finding of avoidance. The appellant claimed there could not be any tax advantage in terms of section 76 as the High Court found they had acquired the licence having paid $45 million for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Glenharrow considered their case analogous to **Peterson v CIR** \[2006\] 3NZLR 433. The Commissioner cross-appealed against the valuation of the tax advantage allowed. He argued that the concept of payment had been met in purely juristic terms, there was no definitive commitment to pay and that the economic burden intended by Parliament had not been suffered by Glenharrow.

The majority of the Court of Appeal found Chisholm J was not wrong to find tax avoidance on the basis of a grossly inflated value. The majority were satisfied that there had been a significant temporal mismatch and that the line had been crossed into tax avoidance. The tax advantage for Glenharrow was seen as an increased entitlement to a refund received without suffering the economic burden intended by the Act. The Court considered the case of **Peterson** was distinguishable due to the factual findings regarding the economic burden suffered and the scope of the inquiry.

### Decision

The appeal from Glenharrow was dismissed. Reasons were delivered by Blanchard J. The Court accepted that before looking at the provisions of section 76, the position in relation to the sale of the licence was that the licence was a second-hand good. The deed of sale provided for a consideration of $45 million in money and the open market value provisions of the Act did not apply to the agreement which was considered to be at "arms length". They then considered the operation of section 76.

The Court confirmed that section 76 assumed that the arrangement under scrutiny was not a sham. The section 76 determination requires an assessment that goes beyond the technical legality of the constituent parts of the arrangement. The onus is on the taxpayer under section 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act ("TAA") to show that the Commissioner could not have been properly satisfied that section 76 applied in the circumstances.

There is a two-stage process before the Commissioner can carry out a section 76 reconstruction. Firstly there must be an **arrangement** entered into between at least two persons. Secondly the Commissioner must be properly satisfied that the arrangement was entered into between the two parties **to defeat the intention or application of the Act or any provision of the Act.** This does not mean that the Commissioner must be satisfied that the parties subjectively had that defeating purpose. A natural reading of section 76, as it stood prior to 2000, was to require the Commissioner to be satisfied that an arrangement had been entered into **so as to** defeat the intent and application of the Act.

The Commissioner was required to ask what the purpose of the arrangement was. This question in turn required examination of the effect of the arrangement. The Court followed the findings in **Newton v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia** \[1958\] AC 450 in relation to the term "purpose or effect" where Lord Denning found that the word purpose did not mean "motive" but rather "the effect which was sought to achieve". **The crucial distinction is that general anti avoidance rules are not aimed at the purpose of the parties but at the purpose of the arrangement**. The Court also followed the findings of the Privy Council in **Ashton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue**, \[1975\] 2NZLR 717, where Viscount Dilhorne confirmed that, "if an arrangement has a particular purpose, then that will be its intended effect".

The Court found that any assessment would principally be a matter of inference from the arrangement and its effect. The intention of the Act would be defeated if an arrangement had been structured to enable the avoidance of output tax, or the obtaining of an input deduction in circumstances where that consequence was outside the purpose and contemplation of the relevant statutory provisions.

The Court examined the history behind the GSTA and the need for avoidance legislation. It determined that GST was a type of "value added tax" intended to be broad based, efficient and neutral. The Court concluded that registered persons producing taxable supplies effectively operated as tax collectors on behalf of the Government and as such were not themselves subject of the GST's economic incidence. By the same token it was recognised that registered persons should not obtain unacceptable windfall gains from the regime. They found that reading the Act as a whole it was clear that the legislature anticipated that for a trader in goods and services there would over time usually be some balancing out or netting off of the GST components of sales and purchases.

The Court recognised that there was potential for registered taxpayers to create distortions at the boundary between themselves and unregistered persons. It said that the same could occur where transactions were between those registered on a payments basis and those registered on an invoice basis. The Court confirmed that the general anti-avoidance provision was available to stop or counteract both these distortions.

The Court concluded that it did not need to form a view on whether or not the price paid for the licence was the market value. However, it did rule that even though there was stone to be extracted while the licence was running the arrangement still had a very artificial element. The Court noted that an objective observer could have said that Glenharrow would never have been able to mine enough stone during the term of the licence to generate sufficient sales to pay for the licence. There was no issue that Glenharrow undertook liability for the $44.920 million funded by vendor finance. However Glenharrow was a shell company with a share capital of just $100. Michael Meates was unregistered and there was no GST impost on the other side of the transaction. The Court found that the effect of the structure was to produce a GST refund totally disproportionate to the economic burden undertaken by Glenharrow. They found that the end in view was a distortion which very plainly defeated the intent and application of the Act.

The creation of a trust gives rise to a gift for gift duty purposes
===================================================================

2009 case note - Deed of gift of money secured by a declaration of trust on a home to secure payment of money in the future is a gift - disposition of property.

Case

Begg, Jackson and Jackson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968

### Summary

A deed of gift of money secured by a declaration of trust on a home to secure payment of the money in the future is a gift under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968.

### Impact of decision

There is no tax implication in this case as each gift was below the exemption level. In the future when the money is actually paid, assuming there is still the same statutory gift duty, there will be no gift duty payable as the money is already gifted.

### Facts

The taxpayers executed a deed for the purpose of making a gift of (or promising to give) a sum of money of $27,000 with gifts in subsequent years of lesser sums to family members. Payment of the gifts was deferred to the future upon sale of the home. A trust was declared on their homes “to the extent of their respective interests from time to time” to secure payment of the gifts.

The High Court held that there were no gifts for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 ("the Act") made under the deed even though there was a valid trust because, on a narrow interpretation of section 2(2) of the Act, the creation of a trust was not sufficient in itself and there must be conveyance of the gift in order to qualify as "disposition of property".

The taxpayers appealed to the Court of Appeal. Three issues were dealt with by the Court of Appeal:

*   In order for an action to amount to a "disposition of property" for the purposes of the Act, must the action come within the general definition of "disposition of property"?
*   Did the creation of the trust give rise to a dutiable gift to the children?
*   Even if the initial gifts were gifts for gift duty purposes, were the later ones?

### Decision

The Court of Appeal granted the appeal.

The legal interpretation of "include" in the definition of "disposition of property" in section 2(2) of the Act is to enlarge or extend the general part of the definition to the specific, subparagraphs of the definition. That the definition in section 2(2) with the specific, subparagraphs is set out differently from the previous 1909 Act is "merely stylistic". An act can amount to a "disposition of property" for the purposes of the Act without coming within the general part of the definition. The creation of a trust is a "disposition of property" within subparagraph (b) of the definition. As there was a valid trust, there was a "disposition of property" and a gift for gift duty purposes.

_Perry v Commissioner of Stamps_ (1913) 32 NZLR 1194 applied as its facts cannot be distinguished from the present appeal. Moreover _Perry_ was correctly decided when it held the creation of the trust gave rise to an immediately dutiable gift. There has not been any issue with _Perry_ as an authority and the Court of Appeal declined to overrule it.

Even though not dealt with by the High Court and the Court of Appeal not even sure it was squarely raised on the pleadings, it was held that each subsequent gift is a creation of a separate trust under the deed and is consequently a separate “disposition of property” under subparagraph (b) of the definition in section 2(2) of the Act.

As the individual gifts were below the gift duty exemption, there was no gift duty payable.

The Crown's legal professional privilege
========================================

2014 case note - the law of solicitor/client privilege applicable to the CIR is the common law and can only be waived by the Attorney-General.

Case

Martinovich v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 1357

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972, High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

A judicial review application was brought by the taxpayer, seeking a report (with relevance to the taxpayer) in relation to which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") claimed solicitor/client privilege.

### Impact of decision

The law of solicitor/client privilege applicable to the Commissioner is the common law. This privilege can only be waived by the Attorney-General.

The Commissioner obtains all legal advice on behalf of the tax system as a whole, pursuant to her duties and responsibilities under sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Facts

A judicial review application was brought by Leanne Martinovich ("the applicant") seeking an order requiring the Commissioner to provide the applicant with a copy of an independent report ("the report") resulting from a review of the applicant's file.

On 14 August 2009, the Commissioner issued a default assessment for $867,758.73 against the applicant for unexplained deposits into her bank account totalling $2,252,360.

On 10 December 2009, the applicant filed a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA"). The applicant advised that the deposits in her bank account were not returnable as income as they were capital amounts raised from the sale of company stock.

In her Notice of Response ("NOR") of 9 February 2010, the Commissioner rejected the applicant's NOPA contending that her assessment was correct. The Commissioner's reasoning was that the applicant had not provided evidence that established on the balance of probabilities that the default assessment was incorrect, the reason why it was incorrect; and by how much it was incorrect.

The applicant's solicitors made requests for documentation under the Official Information Act 1992 and Privacy Act 1993. On 8 February 2011, Mr Jeram, the Inland Revenue investigator of this matter, responded to this request. Some of the documents Mr Jeram provided in response to the request had been redacted due to Inland Revenue's procedures and information containing details of another taxpayer.

The applicant's solicitors wrote to the Commissioner on 25 February 2011. This letter included concerns around the Commissioner's decision to withhold certain information. The letter also requested that a senior officer within Inland Revenue review the way in which the investigation had been conducted.

On 2 March 2011, the investigator responded by letter stating that a review would be conducted and the outcome of the review would be produced in due course.

The Investigations Manager formed the view that a legal review was required by a senior lawyer who could provide legal advice on the Commissioner's next steps, taking into account the relevant law, facts and Inland Revenue's procedures. Accordingly, a senior solicitor within Inland Revenue was approached to complete the review.

Upon completion of the review, senior management offered to meet with the applicant's solicitors to discuss the outcome. The applicant's solicitors were available to meet, but in the interim they requested a copy of the report under the Official Information Act and the Privacy Act. The Commissioner refused to provide the report on the basis of legal privilege.

A complaint was then made to the Ombudsman, without any success. On 3 November 2011, the investigator's team leader wrote to the applicant's solicitor advising that the 2009 default assessment would be withdrawn as a result of information obtained by the Commissioner from third parties.

### Issues and decision

The relevant factors are set out below.

#### _Whether the Commissioner undertook an independent review on behalf of the taxpayer_

The Court found that based on the evidence before it, the independent review was not undertaken on behalf of the taxpayer: there had been an overlap between the applicant's request for a review of her file and the investigator's manager's request for a review from a case management perspective.

The Court also found that the Commissioner acts not on behalf of a taxpayer but on behalf of the tax system as a whole. The Commissioner obtains all legal advice, including the report in this instance, for the purpose of, and in the course of, carrying out her duties and responsibilities under sections 6 and 6A of the TAA.

#### _Whether the report produced as a result of the independent review is subject to solicitor/client privilege in favour of the Commissioner_

The law of solicitor/client privilege applicable to the Commissioner is the common law, being the same law that applies in commerce and to disputes between private persons. The Court found that the common law on solicitor/client privilege should be applied in respect of the Commissioner and that privilege could only be waived by the Attorney-General, to comply with the Cabinet Manual.

The Court found that the report was legally privileged and that the Commissioner was entitled to the benefit of solicitor/client privilege, and had not done anything to waive that privilege.

#### _Whether the applicant had a legitimate expectation to receive a copy of the report produced as a result of the independent review_

The Court noted that the Commissioner had promised the applicant, in her letter of 25 February 2011, "the outcome" of the review. This was not a promise to disclose the content of the review.

The definition of "Tax Agent"
=============================

2007 amendment gives IR a discretion to withhold recognition or remove a person as a tax agent in order to protect the integrity of the tax system.

#### Sections 3, 34B, 37(4B) and 81(4)(lc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994

The amendment gives Inland Revenue a discretion to withhold recognition or remove a person as a tax agent when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system.

#### Background

Before this amendment, provided a person met the limited criteria required, Inland Revenue could not refuse to register a person as a tax agent even if, for example, that person had a long record of non-compliance in their own tax affairs or those of their clients, or they had been convicted of offences involving serious dishonesty.

The amendments will allow Inland Revenue to withhold recognition of, or remove, a person as a tax agent when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system.

#### Key features

New rules governing who can be a tax agent have been introduced. New section 34B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives Inland Revenue a discretion to withhold recognition or remove a person as a tax agent when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system.

Operational guidelines will set out the circumstances in which the discretion might be exercised. It is envisaged that the discretion not to grant, or to remove, tax agent status will be exercised only in a very small number of cases. Potential factors that might be taken into account, while not necessarily definitive, include:

*   whether a person has been found guilty of an offence or breach by the disciplinary body of a professional organisation of which they are a member - for example, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants;
*   whether the person is an undischarged bankrupt or an insolvent entity;
*   whether the person has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Crimes Act 1961) and has been sentenced for that crime within the last seven years;
*   whether the person is prohibited from being a director or promoter of a company, or taken part in the management of a company under sections 382, 383 or 385 of the Companies Act 1993;
*   whether the person has been convicted of an offence under the Tax Administration Act 1994; and
*   the person's compliance history- including both their own tax affairs and their level of compliance as an agent.

Under the amendments, Inland Revenue is required to give a tax agent notice of the intention to revoke the agent's status and give reasons for the intended revocation. The agent will be given a 30-day period (or a shorter period if Inland Revenue is concerned that there is a substantial risk to the revenue and a longer period if it is appropriate in the circumstances) in which to resolve the matters raised in the notice of intended revocation. If the agent does not resolve the matters to the satisfaction of Inland Revenue, the agency status will be revoked and the agent and taxpayers linked to that agent advised accordingly. If, because of a revocation of tax agency status, a taxpayer fails to meet a filing deadline, the legislation allows for an extension to the deadline so that penalties are not imposed.

Entities can be recognised as tax agents along with individuals, provided that the entity supplies Inland Revenue with the names of:

*   each person having the duties of tax manager, chief financial officer, chief executive officer or director if the entity is a body corporate other than a closely held company;
*   each shareholder if the entity is a closely held company;
*   each partner if the entity is a partnership; and
*   each member if the entity is an unincorporated body.

The information is necessary to enable the Commissioner to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that, given the involvement of these individuals, it is consistent with protection of the integrity of the tax system for the entity to have agency status. Individual agents currently recognised by Inland Revenue as tax agents are not required to reapply for their agency status. Entities currently listed will continue to be listed as tax agents provided they supply Inland Revenue with the above information by December 2008. When introduced, the amendment required that Inland Revenue be notified of any changes within three months. This period has been extended to 12 months.

Inland Revenue's secrecy provisions have been amended so that information relevant to a decision to remove a person as an agent can be provided to professional bodies (for example, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants).

#### Application date

The amendment applies from 19 December 2007 (the date of enactment).

The Disputes Review Unit - its role in the dispute resolution process
=====================================================================

Article considers IR's Disputes Review Unit and its role in the dispute resolution process. Adapted from an earlier 2007 article.

_The following item is adapted and updated from an item published in the August 2007 edition of The Chartered Accountants Journal entitled "The Adjudication Unit and its role in the disputes resolution process"._

#### Introduction

The current tax dispute resolution process in New Zealand came into effect on 1 October 1996 and was set out in Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The process was intended to establish procedures to reduce the number of disputes by promoting full disclosure, encourage prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, promote early identification of the issues and improve the accuracy of decisions. As part of this process, the Disputes Review Unit (formerly known as the Adjudication Unit) was formed. Its role was to provide an impartial and objective review of unresolved disputes. It may be useful to explain the operation of the unit within the dispute resolution process and to make some observations regarding the preparation of dispute documents.

#### The dispute resolution process

Part IVA of the TAA sets out the procedure to be followed in the event of a tax dispute concerning an assessment or other disputable decision. Inland Revenue may not amend a taxpayer's assessment before the dispute resolution process is complete, except in limited circumstances (section 89N of the TAA). The dispute resolution process requires that formal documents be issued by both Inland Revenue and the taxpayer covering details of the adjustment in dispute, the relevant facts and evidence involved and the particular propositions of law relied on by each party.

Briefly, a dispute is initiated by the issuing of a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") by one party to another that states and explains the proposed adjustment as compared to the taxpayer's prior tax position. If the recipient disagrees with the NOPA, the recipient (who may be either the Commissioner or the taxpayer) must reject the proposed adjustment by issuing a Notice of Response ("NOR"). Where the Commissioner has issued a NOR in response to a taxpayer initiated NOPA, the taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing to ensure the dispute process continues (section 89H(3)).

Following the rejection of the proposed adjustment, a conference between the parties is usually scheduled (it is not a legislative requirement) to discuss the issues in more depth and potentially resolve the dispute or at least some of the issues. The taxpayer will be offered the opportunity to have a facilitated conference. At a facilitated conference a senior Inland Revenue staff member with no prior inolvement with the dispute will manage the conference between the parties. The facilitator does not make decisions about the issues between the parties. The facilitator will assist the parties reach their own resolution of some or all of the issues between them.

Pursuant to section 89M of the TAA, the Commissioner is required to issue a Disclosure Notice (except where the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision which includes or takes account of the adjustment(s) proposed in the NOPA) at the time or after either the Commissioner or the taxpayer issues the NOPA. Where both parties maintain their position they will be required to issue a Statement of Position ("SOP") setting out their final position on the issues.

In addition, if the initial adjustment has been proposed by the Commissioner, section 89M(8) of the TAA permits the Commissioner to provide additional information in response to any additional matters raised in the taxpayer's SOP. This will usually be called an Addendum to the Commissioner's Statement of Position. It is also noted that section 89M(13) provides that the parties may, at any time, agree to further information being added to either of their SOPs.

There are response periods set out in section 3 of the TAA. These generally require a response within two months of the formal stages during the dispute process discussed above (and four months in relation to a taxpayer wishing to propose an adjustment to any assessment it receives).

Agreement may be reached at any stage in the process, but, if the matter remains unresolved, the Commissioner's practice is that generally all matters will be referred to the Disputes Review Unit for consideration, unless s 89N of the TAA applies. It is noted here that the adjudication process is not legislated for and is an administrative part of the dispute resolution process.

In the event the Disputes Review Unit decides in favour of the taxpayer, Inland Revenue has no right of appeal against the Dispute Review Unit's decision. However, where the Disputes Review Unit has found in favour of Inland Revenue, a taxpayer has further rights in relation to the dispute. If they wish to continue the dispute they can do so by filing a challenge in the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court.

Generally s 89M of the TAA compels the issuing of a Disclosure Notice by Inland Revenue. Section 138G of the TAA provides that where Inland Revenue has issued a Disclosure Notice, both Inland Revenue and the taxpayer may raise during challenge, only the issues and propositions of law that are disclosed in the SOPs. The parties may raise new facts and evidence but not new issues or propositions of law.

    .

#### The Disputes Review Unit

The Disputes Review Unit is part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel based in Wellington and part of Inland Revenue's National Office. The Disputes Review Unit is separate to the audit/investigation function and takes a fresh look at the dispute, providing an independent and impartial decision on the issues. The Disputes Review Unit continues to be responsible for adjudications and adjudication reports, but the new name reflects a slightly broader role and some added oversight and review functions relating to the tax disputes resolution process that are performed internally.

Each dispute is considered by a team of three people who all have professional legal and/or accounting qualifications and have experience in researching and analysing tax issues. The team members have differing levels of seniority and involvement in the consideration of the dispute. The final adjudication decision is made by a manager in the Disputes Review Unit. The adjudication team takes into account the NOPA, NOR, both parties' SOPs and all evidence sent through to the Disputes Review Unit at the time of the referral.

A comprehensive adjudication report is produced and provided to the parties. In addition to providing the adjudication decision and the reasons for that decision, the report also sets out the facts of the dispute, the issues that need to be addressed, the analysis of the legal issues involved, the application of that legal analysis to the facts of the dispute and the conclusions reached on each issue. In some instances, it may also be necessary to resolve disputed facts where the parties have not agreed. These reports can sometimes be lengthy, but it is considered important for them to encapsulate the relevant information in a single document and provide full analysis and reasoning, including the reasons why any particular arguments were not accepted. It is intended that such detail will assist both parties in any decisions as to their next steps in the dispute or future dealings on similar issues.

In addition, a letter is sent to both parties setting out a summary of the report. Any necessary assessments will be made as directed by a manager in the Disputes Review Unit.

The Disputes Review Unit does not perform a mediation or arbitration function. It considers the dispute based on the materials provided and does not conduct further investigation into the matter. Nor does it have any direct communication with either the Inland Revenue officers or the taxpayer involved in the dispute during the course of the adjudication. The Disputes Review Unit operates impartially and independently.

To maintain transparency and independence, the Senior Technical and Liaison Advisor (also part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel) handles any necessary correspondence or other communication between the adjudication team and either of the parties. (For more guidance on communication with the Disputes Review Unit, please see "[Managing communications associated with a dispute](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/1996/managing-communications-associated-with-a-dispute-referred-to-the-disputes-review-unit)
" in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 15, No 12 (December 2003).

There is no charge for the review of the dispute by the Disputes Review Unit.

#### Performance standards and results

Once a dispute is referred to the Disputes Review Unit it is allocated to an adjudication team as soon as is practicable. As the Disputes Review Unit is demand driven, and the length and complexity of projects can vary significantly, it is not always possible to allocate disputes to an adjudication team immediately. However, generally disputes are allocated within about a week.

Once allocated, and a preliminary review of the dispute is completed, the adjudication team will provide both parties with an estimated delivery date for the completed adjudication report. While it is difficult to provide universal timeframes for a completed report, the Disputes Review Unit operates under the timeliness performance standards set out in the annual Performance Delivery and Measurement Document. The timeliness performance standard requires that 90% of adjudication reports are delivered within 3 months of allocation. The time required will depend on the complexity and number of issues and workflows, but the average delivery time for 2015 was 6.15 weeks. Many referrals are completed in 4 to 6 weeks.

The Disputes Review Unit completes approximately 55-80 adjudications every year. Given that there can be many issues involved in a dispute, decisions can be made fully or partly in favour of either party. Over the last few years, on average approximately 80% of the decisions made by the Disputes Review Unit were made predominately in favour of Inland Revenue's position and 20% predominantly in favour of the taxpayer's position.

#### Preparation of dispute documents

Since the dispute resolution process was introduced and there are some observations that can be made regarding the overall quality and content of the relevant dispute documents. While the overall quality of the dispute documents has improved over time, it is suggested that the following should be taken into account by the parties involved in the dispute resolution process:

*   the NOPA must identify the adjustment(s) proposed, provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the other party of the grounds for the proposed adjustment and also state how the law applies to the facts (section 89F of the TAA). In addition, where the taxpayer issues a NOPA, the taxpayer must include copies of the documents that it is aware of at the time the NOPA is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues (section 89F(3)(d) of the TAA);
*   the SOP must also give an outline of the facts, evidence and propositions of law relied upon and outline the issues each party considers will arise with sufficient detail to fairly inform the other party of its position and arguments (section 89M of the TAA);
*   ideally, the facts relevant to the dispute should be set out without incorporating any opinion or analysis;
*   it is advisable that, by SOP stage, the parties support all arguments with relevant authority (such as legislative references, case law and, where relevant, other legal resources);
*   all arguments and issues raised by the other party should be explicitly addressed, including any alternative arguments that have been raised;
*   the contractual and/or legal relationships existing in a transaction should be clearly identified and analysed where the conclusion on the issue may be affected by such relationships;
*   when calculation is necessary to reach the proposed adjustment figure(s), the calculation method/worksheet should be set out clearly. An explanation of the basis of that calculation is also helpful. Wherever possible, it is also helpful to set out gross (before tax) figures when detailing the proposed adjustments;
*   where a party receives a NOPA and wishes to propose an adjustment for the same period(s) in dispute but in relation to a different issue, that party cannot propose an adjustment in the NOR. The party would need to prepare a separate NOPA in respect of that issue. However, any such adjustments can be incorporated into a combined SOP from each party if the timing allows; and
*   the parties should be mindful of the response periods for the dispute resolution process as failure to reply/issue documents within the requisite time will result in deemed acceptance.

The impact of company amalgamations on financial arrangement determinations
===========================================================================

QB (2005) clarifies whether rights/obligations arising to an amalgamating taxpayer under a financial arrangement determination will pass to the amalgamated company.

#### Income Tax Act 2004 and Tax Administration Act 1994

The Commissioner recently issued an Interpretation Statement (IS0081) concerning the impact of company amalgamations on binding rulings.  A taxpayer has now asked whether the rights or obligations arising to an amalgamating taxpayer under a financial arrangement determination (determinations made under section 90, 90AC or 90A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA")) will pass to the amalgamated company on the amalgamation.

Under section 90AB(1) of the TAA, a person who becomes, or who intends to become, a party to a financial arrangement may apply to the Commissioner for a determination to be made under section 90AC(1).  This item is concerned with these taxpayer specific determinations, not with general financial arrangement determinations which the Commissioner may also make under section 90AC(1).  General determinations will apply to all taxpayers within the scope of the determination, irrespective of an amalgamation.

##### Section FE 8

There is nothing in either the TAA or the amalgamation provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("the ITA") which specifically addresses the issue of whether an amalgamated company will succeed to any rights or obligations arising to an amalgamating company under a financial arrangement determination.  However, section FE 8 of the ITA provides as follows:

##### FE 8

Where any amalgamating company ceases to exist on an amalgamation, the amalgamated company must, in accordance with section 209G of the Companies Act 1955 or section 225 of the Companies Act 1993, comply with all obligations of and meet all liabilities of, and be entitled to all rights, powers, and privileges of, the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts with respect to the tax year in which the amalgamation occurs and all preceding tax years.

It may be that there are "rights" arising under a financial arrangement determination.  For example, sections 90(9), 90AD(3) and 90A(9) of the TAA provide that if a person has applied a determination under the relevant section, _"... an assessment made in respect of the person must be in accordance with the determination"_.  However, whilst this may give rise to a "right" in respect of any assessment made by the Commissioner, it is arguable that in the context of self-assessment, it is more an "obligation".  It is also noted that sections 90(2), 90AC(3) and 90A(2) provide that:

##### 90(2)

Any determination made under any of paragraphs (a), (c), (e), (g), (h), and (j) of subsection (1) **shall be binding on persons for the purposes of the old financial arrangements rules**.

...

##### 90AC(3)

A determination made under any of subsection (1)(a), (1)(d), (1)(h), (1)(i), or (1)(j) **is binding on persons who are subject to the financial arrangements rules**.

...

##### 90A(2)

Any determination made under subsection (1)**shall be binding on persons for the purposes of subpart FG of the Income Tax Act 2004**.

\[Emphases added\]

It is considered that this language appears to suggest that (at least in those particular cases) the financial arrangement determination will give rise to an "obligation" rather than a "right".

However, as with any rights arising under a financial arrangement determination, any obligations would be succeeded to by the amalgamated company.  Section FE 8, as well as talking about rights, powers and privileges, states that _"... the amalgamated company must ... comply with all obligations of and meet all liabilities of ... the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts ..."_.  Similarly, section 225(e) of the Companies Act 1993 provides that _"\[t\]he amalgamated company succeeds to all the liabilities and obligations of each of the amalgamating companies"_.

Accordingly, it is considered that the rights or obligations arising to an amalgamating taxpayer under a financial arrangement determination (which would clearly be rights or obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts - namely the TAA) will pass to the amalgamated company on the amalgamation.

It could be argued that in a situation of an amalgamation resulting in the deemed disposal by the amalgamating company and acquisition by the amalgamated company of a financial arrangement (i.e. in the case of a non-qualifying amalgamation), there is effectively a new financial arrangement for tax purposes, which may alter the above conclusion.

However, the TAA provisions (noted above) which provide that financial arrangement determinations will be binding (thus giving rise to an obligation) state that they will be binding:"_on persons for the purposes of the old financial arrangements rules"_ (section 90(2)), _"on persons who are subject to the financial arrangements rules"_ (section 90AC(3)), and _"on persons for the purposes of subpart_ _FG_ _of the Income Tax Act 2004"_ (section 90A(2)).  The obligations under financial arrangement determinations relate to the application of the financial arrangements rules to the persons who are subject to them - i.e. the parties to the financial arrangement.  The fact that there may be a disposal and acquisition of a financial arrangement for tax purposes (i.e. in the case of a non-qualifying amalgamation) does not alter the fact that the parties to the financial arrangement (which the amalgamated company would clearly be) are subject to the obligations (or entitled to any rights) under any financial arrangement determination which relates to the financial arrangement in question.

It is noted that the question of whether it may be argued that section FE 8 _restricts_ the assumption of Inland Revenue Act rights, powers and privileges to those with respect to the income year in which the amalgamation occurs and preceding income years is considered in IS0081 _The Impact of Company Amalgamations on binding rulings_ (_Tax Information Bulletin,_ Vol 17, No.6 (August 2005)).  That Interpretation Statement concludes that section FE 8 does not restrict the assumption of Inland Revenue Actrights, powers and privileges to those with respect to the year of amalgamation and previous years, as opposed to what would otherwise be the position under company law.  This conclusion is equally applicable in terms of the assumption of Inland Revenue Act obligations and liabilities.

##### The principle of "continuance"

In any event, it is considered that the same result arises by virtue of the principle of "continuance", which is discussed in IS0081.  As noted in IS0081, it is considered that the principle of continuance remains applicable for the purposes of the ITA, to the extent that it is not altered by specific provisions in the ITA.  For present purposes, the principle of continuance is not altered in any way by specific provisions in the ITA.

##### Section FE 7(2)

It is also noted that section FE 7(2)(b)(i) of the ITA provides that in the tax year of amalgamation, and subsequent years, the amalgamated company is treated as if it had entered into the financial arrangement on the same date (and for the same consideration) as the amalgamating company.  The effect of this provision is considered to be consistent with the result arising by virtue of the principle of continuance.

It may be argued that section FE 7(2) of the ITA further supports our view that the rights or obligations arising to an amalgamating taxpayer under a financial arrangement determination will pass to the amalgamated company on the amalgamation.

#### CONCLUSION

For the above reasons, it is concluded that the rights or obligations arising to an amalgamating taxpayer under a financial arrangement determination will pass to the amalgamated company on the amalgamation.  This will be the case whether the amalgamation is a qualifying amalgamation or a non-qualifying amalgamation.

Executive Summary One of the government’s objectives is to enable the general public and businesses to access and interact with public services more efficiently and effectively. Achieving this goal is dependent on there being greater information-sharing between government agencies, including Inland Revenue (IR). Previous research suggests that the general public generally holds positive views about information-sharing between government departments, including IR (Lips, M., et al., 2010; Inland Revenue & Litmus, 2011; Inland Revenue & Litmus, 2012; Gregory, V., 2012; Inland Revenue & Research New Zealand, 2013; Bennett, A., 2013). However, as this is a potentially sensitive issue, Inland Revenue commissioned this research to gather the views of owners of small and medium businesses regarding: • Their agreement with Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments • Which government departments Inland Revenue should share information with • Perceived ‘risks’ and ‘unintended consequences’ resulting from Inland Revenue sharing this information wi th other government departments. This study involved qualitative interviews with 21 key informants, and a survey of 573 owners of small and medium businesses. This research was completed between February and May 2013. Key findings There are nine key findings based on the results of the survey. 1. New Zealand businesses’ trust and confidence in Inland Revenue provides context to under stand the extent to which they are in favour or not in favour of the Department sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. The results showed that: • 59 percent of respondents rated themselves a 7-10 on the 11-point re sponse scale (moderate to high trust) (Figure 1, overleaf ) • 8 percent rated themselves a 0-3 (low trust ) • 33 percent of respondents sit between these two extremes. 2. Business owners ’ awareness and knowledge of Inland Revenue’s current information sharing practices is also valuable context. The results show: • 14 percent believed Inland Revenue definitely current ly shares information about individual businesses with other government departments (Figure 2 , overleaf ). • 31 percent believed Inland Revenue probably currently shares information about individual businesses with other government departments. • 19 percent believed Inland Revenue did not share information about businesses with other government departments. • 36 percent “did not know”. 4 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Regarding the type of government department Inland Revenue currently shares information with, the results show: • 65 percent believed sharing happens with Government departments responsible for benefits. • 16 percent believed sharing happens with Government departments responsible for regulating businesses. • 13 percent believed sharing happens with Government departments responsible for goods, services and people coming in and out of the country. • 12 percent believed sharing happens with Government departments responsible for criminal investigations. Figure 1: To what degree do New Zealand businesses have trust and confidence in Inland Revenue? (n=573) Figure 2: Does Inland Revenue currently share information about individual business with other government departments? (n=573) 5 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations 3. Against this background, two of every three New Zealand businesses are in support of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. Specifically: • 18 per cent of all respondents stated they were ‘very’ in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments (Figure 3). • 44 percent of all respondents stated they were ‘somewhat’ in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments • 29 percent were not in favour. Figure 3: Level of support for Information-sharing with other government departments (n=573) 4. Sharing information with government departments responsible for regulating businesses is less favoured than sharing information with other types of government departments. The results showed that • 89 percent were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with government departments responsible for benefits • 83 percent were in favour of sharing information with government departments responsible for criminal investigations. • 80 percent were in favour of sharing with government departments responsible for goods, services and people coming in and out of the country. 5. New Zealand businesses preferred sharing general business information rather than specific director-related information. The results were as follows: • “Name and contact details of businesses” (86 percent) • “Names and contact details of directors” (73 percent) • “Business turnover” (56 percent) • “Tax paid and owed by a business” (57 percent). • “Tax and financial information relating to the directors of the business” (47 percent) • “Tax and financial information of other companies those directors were involved in” (46 percent). • “Tax and financial information relating to individuals that the directors of the business are related to” (33 percent). 6. Five hypothetical information-sharing scenarios were developed by Inland Revenue and presented to all respondents for consideration (Figure 4). The results showed people favoured information sharing regarding four scenarios in particular: • “A new immigrant not reporting a large investment” (82 percent). 6 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations • “Staff being paid below the minimum wage” (82 percent). • “Directors of a company making false statements” (82 percent). • “A taxpayer not declaring income from the use of DOC land” (75 percent). • One scenario was less favoured; “a company that is taking on debt it cannot pay” (63 percent). Figure 4: Information-sharing scenarios with government departments (n=573) 7. Opinions regarding who should oversee or manage Inland Revenue’s information-sharing practices varied as follows: • Inland Revenue should self-regulate (27 percent) • Privacy Commissioner (29 percent) • Minister for Inland Revenue (9 percent) • Courts (6 percent). 8. Respondents believed there were more benefits (55 percent) than risks with information sharing (19 percent) (Figure 5 , overleaf ). • The large majority of respondents believed the benefits would be “assisting with criminal investigations” (83 percent) and “assisting with cases of benefit fraud” (83 percent) (Figure 6, overleaf ). 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Figure 5: More benefits or risks sharing information with other government departments? (n=573) Figure 6: Opinion about the main benefits of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments (prompted) (n=573) Respondents considered the main risk to be that “privacy will be compromised due, in part, to the fact that government departments have a poor record of managing privacy” (42 percent) (Figure 7). To a lesser, but not insignif icant extent, respondents also frequently stated that there was a risk that “too much information/knowledge would lead to an abuse of power” (17 percent) and a risk that there would be “unintended consequences resulting from the sharing of inaccurate information or the poor interpretation of information” (10 percent). 8 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Figure 7: Opinion about the main risks of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments (unprompted) (n=573) 9. Support for Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies is low (Figure 8, overleaf ). Specifically: • 3 percent of all respondents were very in favour • 21 percent were somewhat in favour • 28 percent were not in favour • 45 percent were not at all in favour.

Introduction One of the government’s objectives is to enable the general public and businesses to access and interact with public services more efficiently and effectively. Achieving this goal is dependent on there being greater information-sharing between agencies, including Inland Revenue. Background Previous research suggests that the general public generally holds positive views about information-sharing between government departments, including Inland Revenue 1 . However, as others (e.g. privately-owned New Zealand businesses and business leaders) may see information-sharing as potentially compromising the integrity of the tax system (which might, in turn, impact compliance with the tax system), Inland Revenue commissioned this research to obtain a more complete picture of stakeholder opinion. Purpose and information objectives Against this background, the purpose of the research was to provide an understanding of the opinions and expectations of the owners of privately-owned New Zealand businesses with regard to Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. The research set out to collect answers to three key questions: • To what extent are businesses in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments? o What do they perceive as the benefits of Inland Revenue sharing this information with government agencies? • With which particular government departments do businesses believe Inland Revenue should share information about individual businesses? o What specific type of information could Inland Revenue reasonably share with these government departments? o In which particular situations and circumstances? • What do businesses perceive as the ‘risks’ and ‘unintended consequences’ resulting from Inland Revenue sharing this info rmation with other government departments? o How might these risks manifest themselves in practical terms and customer behaviour (e.g. non- compliant tax behaviour)? Methodology In order to collect the information outlined in the previous section, two discrete , but inter-related stages of research were completed: Stage 1 - Qualitative interviews with key informants Qualitative interviews were conducted with n=21 key informants representing four particular audiences (viz. the o wners and directors of privately-owned businesses, business ‘leaders’, sector/professional business groups , and b usiness ‘service providers’). 1 Based on various research projects commissioned by Inland Revenue. 10 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Completed between 5 February and 7 March 2013, by telephone and on a face-to-face basis , this qualitative interviewing was undertaken to complement the results of the survey (Stage 2) by providing more in-depth information. The qualitative interviewing also helped to inform the design of the questionnaire for the survey. Stage 2 – Survey of owners and managers of privately-owned businesses The interviewing for the survey was conducted with a nationally-re presentative sample of n=573 owners and managers of privately-owned businesses between 17 April and 10 May 2013, after a sample had been randomly selected from Inland Revenue’s administrative databases and this sample had been pre-notified about the survey. The survey effectively provides a baseline of current opinion. Note that the survey was positioned to respondents as a survey aimed at gathering “the opinion of owners and managers of businesses about Inland Revenue sharing information about ‘individual businesses’ with other government departments”. This explanation was considered necessary so that respondents did not presume that the information Inland Revenue proposed to share was aggregated business information. In order to optimise the survey’s response rate, a mixed methodology, based on online and telephone interviewing methods, was used to complete the interviewing. While it is not technically possible to calculate a response rate for those who were approached to complete the interviewing online, the response rate for those completing the survey by telephone is 21 percent, which is typical for this type of survey. The raw survey results have been weighted to account for the fact that a disproportionate number of medium to large businesses responded to the survey, compared with those that were small businesses and those operate d by Self-employed persons 2 . The weighting effectively rebalanced the sample and ensured that the results presented in this report were representative of the survey population in question. Results based on the total weighted sample are subject to a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percent (at the 95 percent confidence level). Higher margins of error apply in the case of sub-sampl es of respondents. 2 The weighting parameters were sourced from Statistics New Zealand. 11 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Section 3. Qualitative interviews with key informant Qualitative interviews were conducted with the o wners and directors of privately-owned businesses and other key informants representing or associated with businesses, in order to identify and understand the range of opinions relating to Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments. Purpose and information objectives Qualitative interviews were completed with n=21 key informants representing each of the following audiences, in order to complement the results of the survey with more in-depth information, while also helping to inform the design of the questionnaire for the survey: • Owners and directors of privately-owned businesses (small to medium, and large). • Business ‘leaders'. • Sector /industry /professional business groups. • Business ‘service providers’. Methodology This qualitative interviewing was conducted between 5 February and 7 March 2013, mostly by telephone, although some Wellington-based respondents were interviewed in person, on a face-to-face basis. Key informants were recruited after Inland Revenue had initially made contact with them, although Research New Zealand also networked amongst its own business contacts to complete interviews with key informants for some audiences. Once a mutually acceptable time had been identified for an interview, an email was sent to respondents to confirm the arrangements for the interview. This email contained an information sheet outlining four hypothetical information sharing scenarios developed by Inland Revenue. These scenarios were used during the interviewing to prompt response. These scenarios and a summary of key informants’ reaction to each scenario are included in Appendix A. All interviewing was conducted by the Researchers responsible for the research , using an Interview Guide (Appendix B) that had been developed with the assistance of Inland Revenue. The average interview lengt h was 30 to 40 minutes. The Interview Guide focused on five main areas of investigation: • In general, are businesses and business leaders in agreement with the concept of information sharing amongst government departments? o How do businesses and busines s lea ders feel about Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments? • Without compromising the integrity of the tax system - what type of information could Inland Revenue reasonably share? o With which particular government departments? o In which particular situations and circumstances? • What risks or unintended consequences do New Zealand businesses and business leaders believe might potentially arise from Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments? o And how might these manifest themselves in practical terms and customer behaviour (e.g. non- compliant tax behaviour). • What controls and limitations, if any, do businesses and business leaders expect to be placed on Inland Revenue with regard to information sharing with other government departments? 12 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations • Is there an expectation that businesses and business leaders will be kept informed or involved with Inland Revenue’s development of information sharing policies and practices? Respondents were invited to give their consent to release a transcript of their interview to Inland Revenue. All but one key informant agreed to give their consent. A process was followed whereby key informants who agreed to give their consent were sent a draft of their transcript and asked to review and approve it. A copy of the approved transcripts can be found in a separate report document (Volume 2). Key findings The key findings are presented in terms of the five areas of investigation outlined above. Are businesses and business leaders in agreement with the concept of information sharing amongst government departments? There is general awareness of the government’s proposal to increase information sharing between government departments in order to improve access and interaction between businesses and the general public with public services. Respondents believe d that one of the main benefits of this would be the implementation of a smarter, more eff icient public sector where the “left arm of government is talking to the right arm”. In other words, increased information sharing would lead to a decrease in the cost of compliance for businesses when interacting with the public sector. One outcome is increased efficiency and effectiveness from the perspective that the left arm of government knows what the right is doing. So you update your information with one agency, and other agencies are notified of it. Another outcome is the criminal or the manipulative aspect that currently occurs because there is no communication between agencies. Individuals have the ability to rort the system at the expense of everyone else. Increased information sharing should enable agencies to close that loop. Sector/industry/professional business group Respondents were also of the opinion that information sharing between government agencies would decrease benefit fraud and other such “double dipping” activities, and that the Police would have a better success rate with criminal investigations involving money laundering and fraud. While there was general awareness, there was no awareness of specific proposals or initiatives. Most respondents were aware of or ‘assumed’ that currently information is being shared between government agencies, including Inland Revenue. However, this level of knowledge was vague. Respondents generally took a guess at the types of agencies that Inland Revenue currently shares information with, based on what they thought were ‘logical’ agencies for Inland Revenue to share with. The government agencies most frequently mentioned were ACC, Customs, Immigration, the Police and WINZ. Most respondents speculated that Inland Revenue would currently share information with these government departments for criminal investigation purposes, and to minimise benefit fraud. I believe it’s just cross-referencing to ensure that those amongst us who seek to rort the system are weeded out. Sector/industry/professional business group Most also assume d that the current level of Inland Revenue’s information sharing is very limited , although they were unable to specify what specific information is actually being shared. Nevertheless, it was assumed that Inland Revenue currently has very strict protocols in this regard. 13 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations There was overall agreement with the concept of information sharing. However, most respondents strongly emphasised that they were only comfortable with Inland Revenue information sharing if it was accompanied by strict regulatory controls with regard to the type of information shared, with which government depa rtments , and in which circumstances. Some respondents reiterated, on a number of occasions during their interview, that there must be a legitimate reason to justify the sharing of information and that this should be on a “need to know” basis (as illustrated in Scenario A), compared with a “nice to know” basis (Scenario C). Without compromising the integrity of the tax system – what type of information could Inland Revenue reasonably share and with which government departments? Respondents did not specifically mention the types of information that Inland Revenue could reasonably share with other government departments. Instead, they tended to discuss the circumstances/reasons for why Inland Revenue would share information with other gove rnment departments. As mentioned above, the circumstance/reason for information sharing drives the extent to which it is considered reasonable for Inland Revenue to share information. Respondents were extremely comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing information if it was for the purpose of investigating a serious crime (e.g. money laundering and tax evasion) or benefit fraud. These situations are about weighing up the advantages versus the disadvantages. Obviously if it is to stop criminal activity, then the pros outweigh the cons, so we should probably allow it. Business ‘leader’ All respondents agreed that for the purpose of a criminal investigation, it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue to share all information relating to the directors of the businesses under investigation, including their associated business interests , so that the investigation was comprehensive and all avenues were fully explored. In the context of a criminal investigation, most were also comfortable with Inland Revenue sharin g information with Australian government agencies, and potentially with Australasia and beyond. However, it was expected that this information sharing would be a “two-way street”. Some respondents felt that this would be acceptable because they assumed that Australian government departments have the same privacy protocols as New Zealand government departments. Outside of a criminal and benefit fraud investigative context, respondents were less comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments. In these other situations, respondents felt that the type and depth of information shared by Inland Revenue should be the absolute minimum required by the receiving department for them to carry out their investigation. In general, t here was a perception that the reasons for information sharing outside of a criminal context were a “ nice to know’ rather than a “ need to know”, as illustrated in Scenario C. Furthermore, there was a general belief that Inland Revenue should not share information if that information could be obtained through alternative means. This became apparent during the discussion relating to Scenario C. Respondents believe d that under no circumstances would it be acceptable for Inland Revenue to share information with private-sector companies. The discussion of Scenario D highlighted this fact, let alone the type of company referred to in this scenario (i.e. debt collecting agencies). The discussion relating to both Scenario B and D also revealed a general discomfort with Inland Revenue sharing information when the reasoning behind it is subjective (e.g. presumed tax evasion), based on a “rating ” or based on “historical information”. With regard to Scenario B, there was a strong expectation that Inland Revenue woul d only share information if the tax evasion was proven beyond doubt, (i.e. “not based on a hunch ”). In fact, some respondents expected there to be a criminal conviction before it would be appropriate for Inland Revenue to share information in this context. 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations What risks or unintended consequences do New Zealand businesses and business leaders believe might potentially arise from Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments? Respondents identified both positive and negative impacts of Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments; however, more negative impacts were identified than positive ones. The negative impacts are summarised as follows: • The potential for privacy breaches and information leaks. Respondents believe d this could occur from either Inland Revenue’s end or from the government department receiving the information. As mentioned earlier, the government department receiving the information from Inland Revenue might not have the same strict privacy protocols that Inland Revenue has. • The information might be used for purposes other than what was originally intended . Additionally, the information might be received by an unintended recipient. • Non-compliance. If people were aware that Inland Revenue was sharing their information, they might be less likely to provide it. • Inland Revenue’s image might be damaged as a result of information sharing, in that people might be more uncertain as to how Inland Revenue was going to use their business/personal information, leading to an overall decrease in trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. I guess the risk would be that if people knew their information was likely to be shared, then they would be less inclined to provide it. So that’s a big one, and it comes down to lack of trust. I guess the other big one for me is the risk of people inadvertently releasing the information, like we experienced last year several times with WINZ and ACC. Sector/industry/professional business group On the other hand, some respondents felt there was the potential for Inland Revenue’s image to improve as a resul t of it sharing information with other government departments. This impact was considered to apply in that people might perceive Inland Revenue as contributing to “keeping people honest”, as there would be less of an opportunity for people to claim multiple benefits that they were not entitled to without being detected. Another positive impact of Inland Revenue sharing information that respondents identified was that, if people were aware of the information sharing between government departments, they migh t be less likely to try and “rort the system”. Furthermore, Inland Revenue’s information would contribute to improving criminal investigations. What controls and limitations, if any, do businesses and business leaders expect to be placed on Inland Revenue with regard to information sharing with other government departments? There was a strong consensus of opinion that controls and limitations needed to be placed on Inland Revenue information sharing practices and especially with regard to: • The circumstance or reason for information sharing. • The types of agencies it is shared with. • The type and extent of information shared. There needs to be rules obviously. Where are the boundaries? If that’s what you’re asking, I would think that there’s got to be some pretty good evidence that there’s something wrong before information is shared. As I said earlier, I’m not a proponent of just sharing it for sharing’s sake. There needs to be a reason. Business ‘service provider’ They’ve got to know that the information they put forward is completely accurate and up to date. Small-medium business owner 15 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations It was generally agreed that, for the purposes of investigating benefit fraud, it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue to share information with other government departments on an on-going basis. However, in other situations , respondents felt that information sharing needed to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Some respondents expected that people would be notified prior to their information being shared (e.g. in relation to Scenario C), although others realised that this might be an expensive exercise and therefore not at all practical. As one would expect, in the context of a criminal investigation, respondents did not believe that the person being investigated should be notified prior to their information being released (e.g. in relation to Scenario A). Most respondents believed that there needed to be an independent regulatory control body, such as Privacy Commissioner, to oversee Inland Revenue’s information sharing practices. While some considered self- regulation was an option, this was generally not respondents’ preferred option. Relatedly, there was an expectation that the agencies with which Inland Revenue shares information would have privacy protocols similar to those of Inland Revenue. Is there an expectation that businesses and business leaders will be kept informed or involved with Inland Revenue’s development of information sharing policies and practices? Respondents had a strong expectation that Inland Revenue would keep them informed about the development of its information sharing policies and practices, and although not necessarily on an individual basis, then certainly through their sector/industry/ professional organisations. Respondents who were ‘business leaders’ and represented sector/ industry/ professional business groups expected to be more directly involved in a consultative manner. 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Section 4. Survey of business owners and managers The survey was conducted with a nationally-representative sample of n=573 owners and managers of privately-owned businesses between 17 April and 10 May 2013. It provides a statistically accurate ‘picture’ of the business community’s current opinions and perceptions relating to Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments. Purpose and information objectives The survey was conducted in order to establish: • Whether the business community was in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments (including with which agencies, in which circumstances/situations, and what information). • Whether the business community considered there were more benefits than risks in Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments (including what were the benefits, risks and unintended consequences of it doing so). In addition, the survey sought to measure: • The business community’s current awareness and level of knowledge of the fact that Inland Revenue currently shares information with other government departments. • Whether the business community was in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies. Methodology A survey questionnaire was developed in collaboration with Inland Revenue, and informed by the results of the qualitative interviewing (Stage 1), to satisfy the information objectives outlined above. This questionnaire was cognitively pre-tested and then piloted, before being finalised. A copy of this questionnaire can be found in Appendix C. Note that the survey was positioned to respondents as a survey aimed at gathering “the opinion of owners and managers of businesses about Inland Revenue sharing information about ‘individual businesses’ with other government departments”. This explanation was considered necessary so that respondents did not presume that the information Inland Revenue proposed to share was aggregated business information. In order to optimise the response rate to the survey, a mixed methodology, based on online and telephone interviewing methods, was used to administer the questionnaire and complete the interviewing. Where Inland Revenue was able to provide a telephone contact number for a prospective respondent, an intermediate step prior to the interviewing commencing, involved checking the telephone number that had been provided against those in the White Pages. Where the telephone contact number was able to be verified, that prospective respondent was approached to complet e the survey by telephone. All telephone interviewing was undertaken from Research New Zealand’s purpose-built, CATI-enabled call centre in downtown Wellington. Respondents with telephone numbers that could not be verified were, in turn, invited to complete the survey online as were those for whom Inland Revenue was not able to provide a telephone contact number in the first instance. All prospective respondents were mailed a pre-notification letter, on Inland Revenue letterhead, advising them that they might be called or inviting them to complete the survey online (a copy of this letter may be found in Appendix D). 17 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations All interviewing was completed between 17 April and 10 May 2013. The average telephone interview length was 17.5 minutes, although for the first phase of telephone interviewing, the average interview length was significantly longer. This required a review of the questionnaire, resulting in some questions being deleted. Following the completion of the interviewing, the responses from the telephone and online interviewing were merged into a master dataset and the raw data weighted . This was necessary in order to account for the fact that a disproportionate number of medium to large businesses responded to the survey, compared with those that were small businesses and those operate by Self-employed persons 3 . The weighting effectively rebalanced the sample and ensured that the results presented in this report were representative of the survey population in question. While it is not technically possib le to calculate a response rate for those who were approached to complete the interviewing online, the response rate for those completing the survey by telephone is 21 percent. This is about normal for this type of survey. Only statistically significant results (at the 95 percent confidence level) are referred to this report. In this regard, results based on the total sample are subject to a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percent (at the 95 percent confidence level. Larger margins of error apply in the case of sub-samples of respondents. Three key variables have been used to analyse the results to this survey: • Trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Based on the distribution of responses to the survey question measuring trust and confidence, respondents have been divided into three groups: those who have moderate to high trust and confidence (gave a rating of 7-10 on the 11-point rating scale used to measure trust and confidence; those who have little or no trust and confidence (gave a rating of 0-3 on the rating scale); and those who were indifferent or gave a neutral response (gave a rating of 4-6 on the 11-point rating scale). • The degree to which respondents were in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. Two groups of respondents have been created: those respondents in favour and those respondents not in favour. • The size of the business, measured in terms of permanent full-time and part-time employees (includi ng the owner). Based on the responses to the survey question measuring business size, respondents have been divided into three groups: Self-employed; Small businesses, up to and including five employees; and Medium to large businesses, six and more employees. Tabulations relating to the first two of these three variables can be found in the body of this report. Tabulations relating to the size of the business can be found in Appendix E, although the statistically significant results relating to this variable are referred to throughout this report. A profile of survey respondents At the commencement of the interview, respondents were asked a number of demographic and other ‘descriptive’ questions in order to identify: • Whether they were a business owner or manager. • Their gender. • The size (measured in terms of permanent full-time and part-time staff) of their business. • The main activity of their business, as well as whether the business operated from one or more sites. Additionally, respondents were asked to rate the extent to which they had ‘trust and confidence’ in Inland Revenue. They were asked to do this using an 11-point scale, where 0 equated with “no trust and confidence” and 10 wi th “full trust and confidence”. 3 The weighting parameters were sourced from Statistics New Zealand. 18 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 1 provides a summary of the results to these questions. The key findings are as follows: • Ownership. Eighty-nine percent of respondents identified themselves as the owner of the business that was selected for the survey. As expected, this was more likely the case amongst businesses operated on a Self-employed basis. Thirty-two percent of respondents identified themselves as the manager, meaning that some owners were also the manager. • Business activity. One-in-five respondents reported the main activity of their business relate d to property and business services (22 percent), while a similar proportion (20 percent) identified agr iculture, forestry and fishing. Twelve percent described retail trade as the main activity of their business and eight percent construction. • Number of sites. Well over two-thirds of respondents (71 percent) stated their business operated from one site. Therefore, 28 percent operated from more than one site and this was more likely the case amongst medium to large businesses. • Number of employees. Almost one-third of respondents described themselves as being Self- employed (29 percent). Most operated small businesses of between two and five employees, including themselves (53 percent). Fourteen percent operated businesses with six or more employees, including themselves. • Trust and confidence. Fifty-nine percent of respondents rated themselves a 7-10 on the 11-point scale used to measure trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, thereby indicating they had moderate to high trust and confidence in the Department. This compares with eight percent who rated themselves 0-3, thereby indicating they had little or no trust and confidence. The balance, 33 percent of respondents, sits between these two extremes.

Awareness of whether Inland Revenue currently shares information with other government departments • Fourteen percent of all respondents stated they definitely knew that Inland Revenue currently shares information about individual businesses with other government departments (Table 2). A further 31 percent were not as certain, but felt that it probably did share this type of information with other government departments. • Therefore, on a combined basis, 45 percent of all respondents had some awareness of the fact that Inland Revenue currently shares information about individual businesses with other government departments. • In comparison, 19 percent stated that Inland Revenue did not share information about businesses with other government departments, while many “did not know” (36 percent). • These results do not differ by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue or size of business.

Knowledge of current Inland Revenue information sharing practices Respondents who were certain or somewhat certain that Inland Revenue currently shared information about individual businesses with other government department were then asked which government departments it shared this information. Table 3 (overleaf) shows that, most frequently, the type of government department these respondents mentioned were those “government departments responsible for benefits” (65 percent). Those government departments responsible for regulating businesses (16 percent), those responsible for good, services and people coming in and out of the country (13 percent) and those responsible for criminal investigations (12 percent) were less likely to be mentioned. Note, also, that six percent of respondents were unable to identify a government department with which Inland Revenue currently shared information despite them believing this to be the case. These results do not differ by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue or size of business. 21 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Respondents who believed that Inland Revenue currently shared information about individual businesses with other government departments were also asked to explain the reasons why (i.e. circumstances, situations) it did this and, what specifically was the type of information it shared with them.

Given the fact that respondents most frequently identified government departments responsible for benefits as the type of government department that Inland Revenue currently shared information with, the reason most frequently mentioned was to “minimise benefit fraud ” (Table 4, previous page). Thirty-three percent gave this reason ahead of all other reasons such as to “ensure people and businesses meet their legal obligations such as to pay tax, pay fines, pay ACC levies, Child Support, etc.” (22 percent) and to “minimise tax avoidance” (19 percent). Note, also, that four percent were unable to provide a reason. The results do not differ by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue or size of business. While “business income and tax-related information” was most frequently mentioned as the type of information Inland Revenue shared with other government agencies (28 percent), given the fact that respondents most frequently identified government departments responsible for benefits as the type of government department that Inland Revenue currently shared information, also frequently mentioned was “employee-related information, such as numbers of, IRD numbers, immigration status” (14 percent) and relatedly, “wages and salaries paid to employees, including tax codes and benefit deductions” (six percent) (Table 5). Note, also, that 11 percent were unable to identify the type of information that Inland Revenue currently shared. 23 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 5: Types of information about individual businesses that Inland Revenue currently shares with other government departments Q12/13.

Level of informedness Finally, respondents who believed that Inland Revenue currently shared information about individual businesses with other government departments were asked, in general, how informed they felt they were about this. Table 7 (overleaf) shows that over one-half of these respondents (55 percent) considered themselves to be “not at all informed”, while another 35 percent were “somewhat informed”. In comparison, six percent considered themselves to be either “informed” or “very informed”. The table also shows that respondents with low trust an d confidence in Inland Revenue were significantly more likely than those with moderate to high trust and confidence to state that they were “not at all informed” (55 percent and 47 percent respectively).

Opinions about Inland Revenue sharing information with other government agencies Support for Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments Hav ing established respondents’ awareness and knowledge of the status quo, they were then asked whether, in principle, they were ‘in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments’. This was measured on a 4-point scale in order to measure the strength of their opinion, with 1 equating to “not at all in favour” and 4 with “very in favour”. Overall, 62 percent of all respondents stated they were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information, whereas 29 percent were not in favour. Another nine percent “did not know” (Table 8). Note, also, that significantly more of those respondents who were in favour were “somewhat in favour” (44 percent) rather than “very in favour” (18 percent). 26 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 8: Extent to which in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments Q16.

The table also shows that, respondents with moderate to high trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, were significantly more likely than those with low trust and confidence to state that they were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information (71 percent and 43 percent respectively). The results do not differ by size of business. Respondents were also asked to provide an explanation for being in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. Table 9 (overleaf) shows the results for both sub-groups , with the key findings being as follows : • Respondents who were in favour of Inland Reve nue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments most frequently stated this was because it would “result in less tax evasion and benefit fraud” (37 percent) and a “more efficient and streamlined government sector” (20 percent), which would relatedly result in “less compliance costs for businesses” (six percent) and “general benefits to customers with improved processes” (two percent). Note that relatively few stated it would “result in less criminal activity” (nine percent). For a government to be able to operate effectively, there needs to be efficient chains of communication. If there are a whole lot of rules about who/what/why should know xyz, is it in the best interests of the country - or just the public service?

However, there would definitely be information that would need to be shared for the welfare of all New Zealanders in general. If people are 'ripping' off the system, etc. Survey respondent in favour of Inland Revenue information sharing • In comparison, respondents who were not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments most frequently stated this was because of “the special position or relationship that Inland Revenue had with businesses which ensured privacy and confidentiality” (54 percent). I have certain obligations under IR and I don't have them to other government departments - it is confidential what I give IRD and that should be treated as such. Survey respondent not in favour of Inland Revenue information sharing Breaches principles of privacy. Many government departments demonstrably incapable of keeping information securely and maintaining privacy. Other government departments should be capable of doing their own work and maintaining only the information necessary for this. Survey respondent not in favour of Inland Revenue information sharing • Some respondents also stated that they were concerned about the “security issues that might arise (because government departments did not have a good track record in this regard)” (12 percent), while others were concerned about the “possible misuse of information” (six percent). Some respondents were also concerned that information should not be shared “without prior consent and that to do so, was unacceptable” (12 percent). I've worked in the UK on projects where agencies with specific powers have come together to work jointly, but ultimately they were sharing their powers in a way that was not foreseen or intended when the individual powers were delegated. Whilst I supported what they were doing, I also think in this day and age it’s really important to protect an individual’s rights. I think the Privacy Act goes too far (i.e. I have a brother in a wheelchair who has needed help and the Privacy Act has simply got in the way of my parents helping him). Survey respondent not in favour of Inland Revenue information sharing These results do not differ by size of business or trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Note that in terms of the latter, the respondents who answered this question were those who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information, regardless of their trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Types of government departments Inland Revenue could share information with Respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments were asked to identify the types of government departments they would be ‘most comfortable’ Inland Revenue doing this with. For the purposes of this question, government departments were categorised into four gener ic groups: • Those responsible for benefits (e.g. ACC and WINZ). • Those responsible for criminal investigations (e.g. the Police and the Serious Fraud Office). • Those responsible for goods, services and people coming in and out of the country (e.g. Customs and Immigration). • Those responsible for regulating businesses (e.g. the Companies Office, the Department of Labour/Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment) 29 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations The response to this question was gathered on a prompted basis (i.e. the generic groups were read to respondents). With this in mind, of government departments they believe Inland Revenue currently shares information about individual businesses. In other words, while there is a natural tendency for respondents to be comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing with government departments responsible for benefits (because they immediately think of the benefit of minimising fraud), they are not adverse to Inland Revenue sharing with other types of government departments for other reasons. Table 10 (overleaf) shows these respondents were most comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with government departments responsible for benefits (89 percent), for criminal investigations (83 percent) and for goods, services and people coming in and out of the country (80 percent). To a somewhat lesser extent, they were also comfortable with Inland revenue sharing information with government departments responsible for regulating businesses (72 percent). These results do not differ by size of business or by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Note that in terms of the latter, the respondents who answered this question were those who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information, regardless of their trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Note that these prompted results differ from the earlier results relating to respondents’ awareness of the types of government departments they believe Inland Revenue currently shares information about individual businesses. In other words, while there is a natural tendency for respondents to be comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing with government departments responsible for benefits (because they immediately think of the benefit of minimising fraud), they are not adverse to Inland Revenue sharing with other types of government departments for other reasons.

For the purposes of this question, the types of information were categorised into two generic groups: • Information relating to the business itself. That is: o Name and contact details. o Income or turnover. o Tax paid/owed. • Information relating to the directors of the business. That is: o Name and contact details of directors. o Their tax and financial details. o The tax and financial details of other companies they are involved with. o The tax and financial information of individuals they are related to. • The response to this question was also gathered on a prompted basis (i.e. the generic groups were read to respondents). With this in mind, • Table 11 (overleaf) shows that these respondents were most comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing the “name and contact details of businesses” (86 percent), including the “names and contact details of directors” (73 percent), but significantly fewer mentioned they would be comfortable sharing more spec ific information including: o “Business turnover” (56 percent) and the “tax paid and owed by a business” (57 percent). o “Tax and financial information relating to the directors of the business” (47 percent) and the “tax and financial information of other companies those directors were involved in” (46 percent). o “Tax and financial information relating to individuals that the directors of the business are related to” (33 percent). Note that the respondents who answered this question were those who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information, regardless of their trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. There are some significant differences in this regard, with respondents with low trust and confidence significantly less likely to state they were comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing information relating to the “tax paid and owed by a business”, the “tax and financial information relating to the directors of the business”, the “tax and financial information of other companies the directors of the business were involved in” and the “tax and financial information relating to individuals that the directors are related to”. These results do not differ by size of business, with the exception of small businesses up to five employees more frequently stating that they were comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing the “tax and financial information of other companies the directors of the business were involved in” (54 percent) and the “tax and financial information relating to individuals that the directors are related to” (41 percent). Note that these prompted results differ from the earlier results relating to respondents’ beliefs about the types of information Inland Revenue currently shares with other government departments; particularly in relation to the extent to which: • Inland Revenue shares information about directors of the businesses. There was hardly any awareness that this might currently be the case, although after prompting, some respondents stated they would be comfortable with this. • Inland Revenue shares information about the employees of the businesses. There was some awareness that this might currently be the case, although after prompting, much fewer respondents stated they would be comfortable with this. This result might be a function of the fact that employee information was not read out to respondents as an information type that might be shared, although respondents were given the option of specifying this if they wanted to. 31 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Response to hypothetical information sharing scenarios To help understand respondents’ opinions about Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government agencies, five hypothetical information-sharing scenarios were developed by Inland Revenue and presented to all respondents for rating, regardless of whether or not they were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. The scenarios were presented to respondents on a random basis, in order to avoid order bias. These scenarios represented a range of different situations as follows: • “Inland Revenue has identified a company that is taking on debt it cannot pay. Inland Revenue wishes to advise the Registrar of Companies so that the directors of the company can be disqualified.” • “Inland Revenue has identified a taxpayer who is earning income from Department of Conservation land, but he has not declared this income. Inland Revenue wishes to advise Conservation about this.” • “A new immigrant has told the department of Immigration that they have made a large investment in New Zealand. However, they have not reported this investment to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue wishes to advise Immigration about this.” • “Inland Revenue has identified a company which is paying staff below the minimum wage. It wishes to advise the Department of Labour about this.” • “Inland Revenue has identified that directors of a company are making false statements in a registered prospectus about the company’s financial position. It wishes to advise the Financial Markets Authority about this.” Table 11: Opinion about the types of information Inland Revenue should share information with other government departments Q19.

Table 12 (overleaf) shows the extent to which respondents were in favour or not in favour of each scenario and presents the results for all respondents, as well as for those with low trust and confidence or those with moderate to high trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. The key findings are as follows: • Over one-half of all respondents were in favour of all the information sharing scenarios, although the degree to which they were in favour differed between scenarios. • Four of the five scenarios were preferred by 75 percent or more of all respondents; namely, “a new immigrant not reporting a large investment” (82 percent) , “staff being paid below the minimum wage” (82 percent), “directors of a company making false statements” (82 percent), and “a tax payer not declaring income from the use of DOC land” (75 percent). • The scenario all respondents were less likely to be in favour of was the scenario about “a company that is taking on debt it cannot pay” (63 percent). The reason for this being less likely to be acceptable was identified during the pre-testing of the survey questionnaire as being the possibility that the information on which this was based might be historical and therefore out-of-date. Thus, the company would be being penalised. This table shows that, respondents with moderate to high trust and confidence in Inland Revenue were significantly more in favour of all five scenarios compared with those who had low trust and confidence in the Department. The most significant differences are in relation to the following scenarios: • “A company that is taking on debt it cannot pay”. Sixty-eight percent of respondents with moderate to high trust and confidence considered this scenario to be acceptable compared with 45 percent of those with low trust and confidence. • “A tax payer not declaring income from the use of DOC land”. Eight y-one percent of respondents with moderate to high trust and confidence considered this scenario to be acceptable compared with 60 percent of those with low trust and confidence. Respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments were also significantly more likely than those who were not in favour to state they were in favour of all the scenarios. For example, 74 percent of these respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments were in favour of the scenario involving “a company that is taking on debt it cannot pay”, compared with 42 percent of respondents not in favour. The results do not differ by size of business, with the exception of medium to large businesses of six or more employees more frequently than other businesses stating that, they were in favour of the scenarios relating to “staff being paid below the minimum wage” (89 percent) and “directors of a company making false statements” (85 percent). Preferences for overseeing or managing Inland Revenue’s information sharing Respondents were also asked to identify who they preferred to oversee or manage Inland Revenue’s information-sharing practices. As Table 13 (page 35) shows, opinion varied, and although about one-quarter of respondents suggested Inland Revenue self-regulate (27 percent), there was no consensus of opinion as far as 33 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations the majority of remaining respondents were concerned, with 29 percent suggesting the Privacy Commissioner, nine percent the Minister for Inland Revenue, seven percent the Ombudsmen and six percent the Courts. The results differ by the extent to which respondents had trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Generally, those with low trust and confidence in Inland Revenue were significantly more likely to suggest Inland Revenue’s information sharing practices be managed by a third party. Respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments, also had different opinions about who should manage Inland Revenue’s information sharing practices compared with those who were not in favour of Inland Revenue information sharing. Specifically, those respondents who were in favour were significantly more likely to suggest self-regulation, whereas those not in favour were more likely to suggest Inland Revenue’s information sharing practices be managed by a third party. The results also differ by size of business, with small businesses up to five employees and those medium-large businesses of six employees or more significantly more likely than businesses operated by Self-employed people to suggest self-regulation.

Benefits and risks associated with Inland Revenue sharing information More benefits than risks? Having established whether respondents were ‘in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments’, and their preferences in terms of the government departments it could reasonably do this with and the type of information it could share, they were asked whether there were more benefits than more risks in Inland Revenue doing this. Table 14 (overleaf) shows the extent to which all respondents believed there were more benefits than risks in Inland Revenue sharing information, as well as for those who were in favour and not in favour of Inland 35 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. The key findings are as follows: • Overall, a little over one-half of all respondents stated there were more benefits (55 percent) than more risks (19 percent) in Inland Revenue sharing information. A further 17 percent of respondents responded by saying “it depended”, while eight percent “did not know”. • As expected, respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments considered there to be more benefits compared with those who were not in favour (76 percent and 18 percent respectively). • In comparison, one-half of respondents not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments stated there were more risks (52 percent and five percent respectively). They were also more likely to say that “it depended”. These results do not differ by size of business, although there are differences in terms of the extent to which respondents had trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. Those with moderate to high trust and confidence were significantly more likely to state there were more benefits than there were risks in Inland Revenue sharing information (67 percent compared with 41 percent of those respondents with low trust and confidence in Inland Revenue).

All respondents were also asked to identify the main benefits in Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. This was initially asked in an open-ended fashion in order to identify how respondents described the benefits. The responses to this open-ended question have been thematically coded to allow for the analysis of the results. Table 15 (overleaf) presents the results of this analysis showing the extent to which each of the major themes was mentioned. 36 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 15: Opinion about the main benefits of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments (unprompted) Q23/24.

Other, more general benefits mentioned, albeit less frequently, included: • “Improved efficiency of the public service” (nine percent). • “Ensuring, via more efficient monitoring, that people and businesses met their legal obligations” (eight percent). • “The creation of a fairer tax system” (eight percent). • “Bette r, more compliance by businesses” (eight percent). • “Improved protection to shareholders, investors and creditors” (seven percent). Note that there was less specific mention of benefits such as “assisting with investigations of businesses to ensure they were working within the law” and “assisting with criminal investigations”, although these are likely be implicit in the other benefits that were mentioned. There are no differences by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue or size of business, although as expected, there are by those respondents who considered there were more benefits compared with those who believed there were more risks. For example, 30 percent of respondents who considered there were more benefits identified “assisting with cases of benefit fraud” as a benefit compared with 16 percent of those who believed there were more risks. Following the open-ended question about benefits, all respondents were read a list of possible benefits and asked to comment on whether they thought each benefit (also) applied. As Table 16 shows, the large majority of respondents agreed that “assisting with criminal investigations” (83 percent) and “assisting with cases of benefit fraud” (83 percent) would be benefits of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments.

As expected, respondents who considered there were more benefits than more risks in Inland Revenue sharing information were significantly more likely than those who considered there were more risks to state that the benefits were, in fact, benefits. Table 16 shows that the biggest differences in opinion were in relation to the following benefits: • “To help businesses compete and operate fairly” (74 percent of respondents who believed there were more ben efits than more risks in Inland Revenue sharing information compared with 13 percent of those who thought there were more risks than benefits). • “To reduce the cost of compliance” (78 percent and 24 percent respectively). • “To assist with investigations of businesses to ensure they are working within the law” (90 percent and 32 percent respectively). • “To help businesses interact with government departments more efficiently” (76 percent and 30 percent respectively). • “To identify businesses that are eligible for government funding” (70 percent and 27 percent respectively). In comparison, there was less difference of opinion in terms of the benefits being, “to assist with criminal investigations” and “to assist with cases of benefit fraud”. However, an important point to note is that a not insignificant percentage of those respondents who considered there were more risks than benefits in Inland Revenue sharing information also considered all the benefits to be actual benefits. Given the relationship between respondents who considered there were more benefits than more risks in Inland Revenue sharing information and those who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information, their more positive results are also reflected in the results for the latter group. The re are some differences by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, with respondents who had no trust and confidence in Inland Revenue significantly less likely to state the following were actual benefits; “to help businesses compete and operate fairly”, “to reduce the cost of compliance”, “to assist with investigations of businesses to ensure they are working within the law”, “to help businesses interact with government departments more efficiently” and “to identify businesses that are eligible for government funding”. There are also some differences by size of business, with medium-large businesses of six or more employees significantly more likely to identify the benefits compared with other businesses. The main risks are perceived to be ... All respondents were also asked to identify the main risks in Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. As for the benefits, this was also initially asked in an open-ended fashion in order to identify how respondents described the risks. The responses to this open-ended question have also been thematically coded to allow for the analysis of the results. Table 17 (overleaf) presents the results of this analysis showing the extent to which each of the major themes was mentioned. This table shows that, most frequently, these respondents considered the main risk to be that “privacy will be compromised due, in part, to the fact that government departments have a poor record of managing privacy” (42 percent). To a lesser, but not insignificant extent, respondents also frequently stated that there was a risk that “too much information/knowledge would lead to an abuse of power” (17 percent) and a risk that there would be “unintended consequences resulting from the sharing of inaccurate information or the poor interpretation of information” (10 percent). 39 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Note that few respondents specifically identified a “loss of trust in Inland Revenue” (one percent) and a “loss of faith in the integrity of the tax system” (one percent) as risks. While there were significant differences in opinions about the main benefits between respondents who considered there were more benefits than more risks in Inland Revenue sharing information and those who considered there were more risks than benefits, there are fewer differences of opinion in relation to the main risks. In fact, the only significant difference was that respondents who considered there were more risks than benefits in Inland Revenue sharing information were significantly more likely than those who considered there were more benefits than more risks to identify the fact that “privacy might be compromised” as a risk (54 percent compared with 41 percent). However, an important point to note is that a not insignificant percentage of those respondents who considered there were more benefits than risks in Inland Revenue sharing information also considered this to be a risk.

Given the relationship between respondents who considered there were more risks than benefits in Inland Revenue sharing information and those who were not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information, their results are also reflected in the results for the latter group. Although there are no differences by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, there are a few differences by size of business. Medium-large businesses of six or more employees were significantly more likely than other businesses to identify “unintended consequences resulting from the sharing of inaccurate information or the poor interpretation of information” (17 percent) as a risk. Following the open-ended question about risks, all respondents were read a list of possible risks and asked to agree or disagree that each was (also) possible. As more tax evasion” (19 percent). Table 18 shows, the results largely reflect the earlier results presented for the open-ended question. In particular, respondents agreed that, if Inland Revenue shared information about individual businesses with other government departments, there was the risk that this would “lead to privacy breaches and data leaks” (69 percent). Over one-half also thought that information sharing might also “lead to businesses withholding information” (53 percent). In comparison, fewer respondents agreed that the following would be risks: • “(Information sharing) would result in a loss of confidence in Inland Revenue” (39 percent). • “(Information sharing) would result in more tax evasion” (19 percent).

As expected, respondents who considered there were more risks than benefits in Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments were significantly more likely than those who considered there were more benefits than risks to agree with the four possible risks. The biggest differences were in relation to the following risks: • “(Information sharing) would result in a loss of confidence in Inland Revenue” (75 percent of respondents who considered there were more risks than benefits in Inland Revenue sharing information compared with 22 percent of respondents who considered there were more benefits). • “(Information sharing) would result in more tax evasion” (35 percent and 12 percent respectively). Those not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with over government departments were also more likely than those in favour to agree with the four possible risks. In fact, note that well over-one half agreed that all the risks were possibilities, with the most extreme being their belief that information sharing would “lead to privacy breaches and data leaks” (92 percent). There are also some differences by trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, with respondents who had moderate to high trust and confidence in Inland Revenue significantly less likely to state the following were risks; “(information sharing) would lead to businesses withholding information”, “(information sharing) would lead to privacy breaches and data leaks” and “(information sharing) would result in a loss of confidence in Inland Revenue”. While there are few differences by size of business, note that medium-large businesses of six or more employees were significantly more likely than other businesses to identify the fact that information sharing would “lead to businesses withholding information” (60 percent) as a risk. 42 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Opinions about Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies Support for Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies Having established the extent to which respondents were in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government agencies, they were asked a similar question in relation to sharing information about individual businesses ‘with companies in the private, non-government sector’. Overall, 24 percent of all respondents were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with private- sector companies, whereas 73 percent were not in favour. Another three percent “did not know” (Table 19). Note, also, that those who were not in favour, were significantly more likely to be “not at all in favour” (45 percent) than “not in fa vour” (28 percent).

These results do not differ by size of business or trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. These results differ significantly from the earlier results presented indicating the percentages of respondents who were in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments. To reiterate, 62 percent of all respondents were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments, whereas 29 percent were not in favour. Table 20 (overleaf) shows there is a weak correlation between those respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies and respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue doing this with other government departments. For example, 29 percent of respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments were also in favour of them sharing information with private-sector companies, whereas this was the case for 14 percent of those who were not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments. However, the large majority of respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with other government departments were significantly not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies (70 percent). 43 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 20: Extent to which in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies (by extent to which in favour or not in favour of information- sharing with other government departments) Q28.

Response to hypothetical information sharing scenarios To help understand respondents’ opinions about Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies, four hypothetical information sharing scenarios were developed by Inland Revenue and presented to all respondents for rating, regardless of whether or not they were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies. The scenarios were presented to respondents on a random basis, in order to avoid order bias. These scenarios represented a range of different situations as follows: • “Inland Revenue has identified a bankrupted taxpayer as not having declared some income to the Official Assignee 4 . It wishes to advise the Official Assignee about this.” • “Inlan d Revenue has identified a company moving money to a related company before being liquated. It wishes to advise the liquidator about this.” • “Inland Revenue has identified a member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants as having made false statements. It wishes to share this information with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants.” • “Inland Revenue wishes to share the fact that a taxpayer owes outstanding tax debt to Inland Revenue with companies that determine credit ratings.” Table 21 (overleaf) shows the extent to which respondents were in favour or not in favour of each scenario and presents the results for all respondents, as well as for those who were in favour and not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies. The key findings are as follows: • Despite the fact that most respondents had earlier stated they were not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies, when a context was placed around this, opinion changed. • Significantly more than one-half of all respondents indicated they were in favour of three of the four scenarios; namely, “a company moving money to a related company before being liquated” (75 percent), “a member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants as having made false statements” (72 4 During the planning stage, Inland Revenue inadvertently developed this scenario for the ‘private sector’ section of the interview. Some respondents may have interpreted the reference to the Official Assignee as being a reference to a private organisation. 44 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations percent), and “a bankrupted taxpayer as not having declared some income to the Official Assignee” (71 percent). • In comparison, a much lower percentage of respondents were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies in relation to a situation where “a taxpayer owes outstanding tax debt to Inland Revenue with companies that determine credit ratings” (49 percent). As one would expect, respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies were significantly more likely than those who were not, to be in favour of each scenario. Table 21 shows that the biggest difference in opinion was in relation to the scenario, “A taxpayer owes outstanding tax debt to Inland Revenue with companies that determine credit ratings” (80 percent of respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies in favour compare d with 40 percent of those who were not in favour). In comparison, although there were differences, there was less difference of opinion in terms of the following scenarios: • “A company moving money to a related company before being liquated” (91 percent of respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies in favour compared with 71 percent of those who were not in favour). • “A member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants as having made false statements” (88 percent and 67 percent respectively). • “A bankrupted taxpayer as not having declared some income to the Official Assignee” (90 percent and 67 percent respectively).

Table 22 also shows that respondents with moderate to high trust and confidence in Inland Revenue were significantly more likely than those with low trust and confidence to be in favour of all of the scenarios. For example, respondents with trust and confidence in Inland Revenue were significantly more comfortable with the scenario relating to “a company moving money to a related company before being liquated” compared with those who were not (78 percent and 48 percent respectively). There are also some differences by business size, with medium to large businesses of six employees or more, significantly more likely to be in favour of all of the scenarios than those businesses operated by Self-employed people. This was particularly the case in terms of two of the scenarios; namely, “a bankrupted taxpayer as not having declared some income to the Official Assignee” and “a member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants as having made false statements” Table 22: Extent to which in favour or not in favour of information-sharing scenarios (private-sector companies) Total Nil/low trust and confidence (0 -3) Neutral trust and confidence (4 -6) Moderate/high trust and confidence (7 -10) Unweighted base = 573 35 174 314 % % % % Inland Revenue has identified a bankrupted taxpayer as not having declared some income to the Official Assignee.

More benefits than risks? Having established whether respondents were in favour or not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies, and the situations in which they were prepared for this to happen, all respondents were asked whether they were of the opinion that there were more benefits than risks in Inland Revenue doing this. Table 23 shows that less than one-quarte r of respondents believed there were more benefits than risks in Inland Revenue sharing information with private-sector companies (24 percent). Significantly more respondents considered there to be more risks than benefits (44 percent), while another 18 percent stated “it depended” and 13 percent “did not know”. As expected, respondents who were in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies considered there to be more benefits compared with those who were not in favour (55 percent and 15 percent respectively). However, 17 percent of these respondents considered there were more risks. In comparison to these respondents, one-half of respondents not in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies stated there were more risks (54 percent and 17 percent respectively). However, 15 percent of these respondents considered there were more benefits. There are no differences by business size, although respondents with moderate to high trust and confidence in Inland Revenue were significantly more likely than those with low trust and confidence to believe there were more benefits than risks. 47 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 23: Opinion about whether there are more benefits than risks with Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with private-sector companies Q30.

Hypothetical information sharing Scenarios - Summary of key informants’ reaction Table 24: Summary of key informants’ reaction to Scenario A Scenario A Positive themes Neutral/negative themes A crime taskforce requests taxpayer info from IR To investigate and stop an international money laundering ring , a taskforce is formed. The New Zealand government agencies represented include the Organised and Financial Crime Agency New Zealand (OFCANZ) NZ Police, the Serious Fraud Office, Customs, MBIE, and IR. The taskforce requests all member agencies to share information they separately hold on the taxpayers and individuals being investigated. The taskforce is investigating a New Zealand taxpayer that sets up and sells companies to others in New Zealand and Australia. IR follows the agreed protocols and provides the taskforce lead with the information it has about the companies and individuals involved. This includes the identity and address data, and the tax and financial details of all the individuals involved in the companies under investigation. The taskforce passes this information to Australian Police who are targeting individuals linked to the ring in Australia. • Completely justifiable because of the criminal nature of the situation. • Agencies involved justifiable , although many query MBIE involvement. • Extent of investigation justifiable (i.e. across multiple business entities and individuals, and jurisdictions). • There is an expectation that these jurisdictions would ethically and legally be comparable to NZ, information sharing would be 2-way, and policies and practices governing information sharing would be at a comparable NZ standard. • Beneficial for IR’s ‘image’ as IR is seen to be helping reduce serious crime. • Provision of information for the purpose of a criminal investigation is outsid e of Inland Revenue’s mandate. IR’s image may be damaged as a result of this. • Would require a law change. • Increased information sharing with the Police creates a conflict of interest as IR currently encourages people to declare income, regardless of how that income is obtained. • If information sharing with the Police were to increase, money obtained illegally may be less likely to be declared, resulting in a decreased tax take. 49 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 25: Summary of key informants’ reaction to Scenario B Scenario B Positive themes Neutral/negative themes IR shares information about the suitability of a company director with the Companies Office IR is aware that certain directors have been engaging in aggressive tax avoidance activities through a number of phoenixing companies. These companies have been liquidated with significant tax debts, without the liquidators appropriately reporting to the Companies Office. The directors have then been able to resume their activities through newly incorporated companies. IR would like to pass on the names and contact details of these offending directors so that the Companies Office can take action in banning them from becoming company directors. • Justifiable if the directors have been convicted of tax evasion because everyone should pay their fair share of tax. • Beneficial for IR’s ‘image’ as they are seen to be helping create a cleaner, more credible business environment. • IR currently has the powers to prosecute directors who engage in tax evasion. • Fine line between aggressive tax avoidance and tax evasion. It is not IR’s role to decide where that line is drawn. • The use of the word ‘avoidance’ suggests that IR is passing on information which is based on judgement/opinion. • Detrimental to IR’s ‘image’ as they are seen to be passing on potentially subjective information. 50 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 26: Summary of key informants’ reaction to Scenario C Scenario C Positive themes Neutral/negative themes Information-sharing to benefit the customer and the government The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) asks Inland Revenue to search its database to identify new businesses with research and development (R&D) expenditure. Inland Revenue finds 2000 businesses and shares their contact details, income details, and amount of R&D expenditure with MBIE. Using this information, and other information it holds, MBIE contacts a smaller group of businesses to offer a discussion on Government grants for which they may qualify. • Justifiable because businesses will benefit from being identified as eligible for R&D funding. • Beneficial for IR’s ‘image’ as IR is seen as helping the business community. • Detrimental to IR’s image as they are seen as providing information for reasons outside of IR’s mandate. • If people are unsure of how the information they provide will be used, they may be less likely to provide it. • There are other ways of obtaining this information without Inland Revenue’s involvement. • Information about R&D funding is readily available and accessible for companies, providing they use their own initiative to find it. • An example of information sharing on a ‘nice to know’ rat her than ‘ need to know’ basis. • Confidentiality issues. Potential for information to be leaked/misused. 51 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Table 27: Summary of key informants’ reaction to Scenario D Scenario D Positive themes Neutral/negative themes IR shares taxpayer info with credit reporting agencies for the purposes of profiling As part of its administration of the tax system, IR has developed a way to score the risk of tax evasion of each taxpayer (individuals and businesses). IR shares the scores for each taxpayer with all the credit reporting agencies and debt collectors operating in New Zealand. The companies combine this information with their own information to develop a profile of the riskiest businesses and to aid their debt collection activities. • Credit reporting agencies need as much information as possible to make informed decisions. • This in turn could help businesses that lend money or hav e hire purchase arrangements. • Sharing of public sector information with the private sector for the private sector’s financial gain. • Difficult to retract or regulate the use of public sector information once it is provided to the private sector. • Provision of potentially damaging information which is subjective. • Lack of trust in credit reporting agencies. • Outside of IR’s mandate. • Detrimental to IR’s ‘image’ as IR is seen as providing information which was provided for tax purposes, to private sector companies for their financial gain. • If people believe their information is going to be provided to credit reporting agencies, they may be less likely to provide it. • Privacy issues. 52 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public The Impact on the Integrity of the Tax System of IR Sharing Information with Other Public Sector Organisations Appendix B. Qualitative interviews with key informants – Interview Guide Research objectives: The overall purpose and objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the expectations of privately-owned New Zealand businesses and business leaders on whether, and to what extent, IR should share information with other agencies, whilst maintaining the ‘integrity of the tax system’. This discussion guide: This discussion guide will be used to focus and direct discussions with key informants. The information obtained from these discussions will provide IR with an in-depth understanding of the expectations of New Zealand businesses and business leaders with regard to the appropriateness of IR information sharing with other agencies and the potential impact they feel this could have on the integrity of the tax system. More specifically, it will provide answers to the following questions: 1. Are businesses and business leaders in agreement with the concept of information sharing amongst government agencies? a. How do businesses and business leaders feel about IR sharing information? 2. Without compromising the integrity of the tax system - what type of information could IR reasonably share? a. With which particular agencies? b. And in which particular situations/circumstances? 3. What risks or unintended consequences do New Zealand businesses and business leaders believe might potentially arise from IR sharing information with other agencies? a. And how might these manifest themselves in practical terms and customer behaviour (e.g. non-compliant tax behaviour). 4. What controls and limitations, if any, do businesses and business leaders expect to be placed on IR with regard to information sharing with other agencies? 5.

Introductory statement read to Respondents: One of the government’s objectives is to enable the general public and businesses to access and interact with public services more efficiently and effectively. A number of proposals and initiatives are underway, some of which rely on information sharing between agencies, including IR. Encourage discussion on the following: • Are they aware of any proposals and initiatives the government has to improve the provision of public services to businesses and the general public? o Which proposals and initiatives are they aware of? o Do they have any general opinions about any of these? o Do they have any specific opinions about IR sharing information about their business with other government agencies? • To what extent are they aware that IR currently shares information with other agencies? o Which agencies does IR currently share information with? o In which situations/circumstances? • What depth of information do they believe IR holds about their business, related businesses and business principals themselves? And is all or part of this information currently available for sharing with other agencies? Stage Two: Specific aspects of Inland Revenue information sharing (15-20 mins) Objective: To gain an understanding of the types of information IR could reasonably share, with which particular agencies, and in which situations or circumstances.

A statement will be read to respondents as they are given a set of cards (on a rotating basis) with the scenarios printed on them 5 : I am now going to show you some cards; each of which has a hypothetical situation which involves IR sharing information with other agencies. These scenarios reflect a range of different situations. This is the first scenario, etc. • Discuss each of the scenarios in a random order in each interview to eliminate the possibility of generating a skewed response due to the order the scenarios are presented. • Determine which of the situations they feel it would be appropriate for IR to share information and which they feel it would not be appropriate.

The imputation rules have been amended to extend the circumstances when tax overpaid before a breach in shareholder continuity can be refunded.
===============================================================================================================================================

2006 amendment clarifies that most companies cannot maintain an imputation credit account if they are treated as not being resident in NZ under a DTA.

##### Section ME 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004

Section ME 1(2)(b) has been amended to clarify that companies (other than Australian imputation credit account companies) cannot maintain an imputation credit account if they are treated as not being resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement.

### Background

Previously, section ME 1(2)(b) provided that a company must not establish and maintain an imputation credit account if it was resident in New Zealand but not subject to tax on all or part of its income under a double tax agreement when it was, for the purposes of that agreement, treated as not being a resident of New Zealand.

There was a risk that the reference to the company being "not subject to tax in respect of all or part of its income under a double tax agreement" could have been interpreted as narrowing the circumstances in which a company was prevented from maintaining an imputation credit account. A company that was treated as being not resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement, but that did not actually have any income that was exempted from tax as a result, may have considered itself outside the scope of section ME 1(2)(b).

### Key features

The amended version of section ME 1(2)(b) puts beyond doubt that this provision applies to all resident companies treated as not being resident under a double tax agreement, irrespective of whether they have income that is exempted from tax as a result. The drafting of this provision is now more closely aligned with that of equivalent provisions elsewhere in the Act.

The meaning of "benefit" for FBT purposes
=========================================

QB (Jan 2006) discusses the meaning of 'benefit' for FBT purposes particularly regarding goods and services provided to an employee.

**Income Tax Act 2004 -section CX 2-fringe benefit**

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2004.

We have been asked whether a benefit would be provided for FBT purposes if:

1.  an employee paid market value for the goods or services provided, and/or
2.  the employer also receives a benefit from the provision of goods or services to an employee. 

These issues are fundamental to the interpretation of the FBT regime, in that they raise the question of what is a "benefit" and, therefore, what can give rise to a "fringe benefit" in terms of the scheme and purpose of the legislation.

**Scheme of the legislation**

FBT is payable by an employer who has provided or granted a fringe benefit:  section ND 1(1).  Under the definition of "fringe benefit" in section CX 2, there is a fringe benefit where:

*   A benefit is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and
*   The benefit arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 8, CX 9, CX 11 to CX 15 or is an "unclassified benefit"; and
*   The benefit is not excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of subpart CX. 

The value of the fringe benefit is determined in accordance with the rules set out in sections ND 1A to ND 1R.  FBT is calculated on the taxable value of a fringe benefit:  section ND 1(2).  In calculating the taxable value, the value of the benefit is reduced by payments made by the employee for receiving the fringe benefit:  section ND 1S. 

Therefore, in order to determine whether an employer has an FBT liability, it is necessary to establish:

*   First, whether a benefit (either one of the specific types of benefit referred to in the legislation or any other benefit) has been provided by the employer to an employee in connection with their employment and none of the specific exclusions from the definition of "fringe benefit" applies.  If so, a "fringe benefit" is "provided";
*   Secondly, the value of the fringe benefit in accordance with specific and detailed rules set out in the legislation;
*   Thirdly, the taxable value of the fringe benefit.  In order to calculate the taxable value of a fringe benefit, amounts paid by an employee for the benefit must be deducted from the value of the fringe benefit determined under the FBT rules.

**Would a benefit be provided if the employee had paid the market value of the benefit?**

For a benefit to be provided, it is not necessary to establish that the employee has received a profit (that is, a surplus above the amount paid by the employee for the benefit).  In terms of the scheme of the FBT regime, a "benefit" means what is received by the employee, without regard to any contribution made by the employee.  However, in order to calculate the taxable value of the fringe benefit provided, amounts paid by the employee for the fringe benefit (other than an employment-related loan) are deducted from the value of the fringe benefit (determined under sections ND 1A to ND 1L).

The taxable value of a fringe benefit is the value of the benefit determined under those provisions:  section ND 1S(1).  The value of the benefit (other than an employment-related loan) provided to an employee is reduced by any amount paid by the employee for receiving the fringe benefit:  section ND 1S(2).  Therefore,  the effect of section ND 1S(2) is that if, the amount paid by the employee for a benefit (other than an employment-related loan) equals the value of the benefit for FBT purposes, the taxable value of the benefit would be nil so that FBT would not be payable in respect of the benefit. 

Some commentators have suggested that a fringe benefit does not arise where an employee has paid market value for the fringe benefit and that the issue of whether a benefit is a gross or net concept is of no practical significance as there will be no FBT liability where an employee pays the market value of the benefit provided by the employer.  However, the Commissioner considers that it is not possible to establish that there is no FBT liability unless the steps outlined above are carried out.  For example, the legislation contains special rules relating to the valuation of the benefit arising from the provision of a car for private use which may not necessarily be the exact market value of the benefit.  The McCaw Task Force (which recommended the introduction of FBT) considered that the value of benefits consisting of the provision of a car for private use should be determined on the basis of a specified formula because of difficulties in determining the value of such benefits on a case-by-case basis:  _Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform_ (April 1982).  The Task Force considered that as a general rule the value to an employee of a fringe benefit consisting of the provision of a car for private use was equal to the amount by which the employee's need to meet private outgoings was reduced: see para 6.A3.  Under the current valuation rules the formula is based on the original cost of the vehicle and on the assumption that vehicles are kept for an average of five years. 

**Is a benefit provided "in connection with" the employment of the employee, where an employee pays market value for the benefit provided?**

In _Smith v FCT_ 87 ATC 4883 it was held that a benefit was "in respect of, or for or in relation to" the employment where there was a connection between the benefit received and the employment.  It was considered that in determining whether there was a connection between the benefit and the employment relationship it was appropriate to consider the reason for the provision of the benefit.  Where the employment is a substantial reason for the provision of the benefit, there would be a relationship between the benefit and the employment.  The phrase "in connection with" also requires a relationship between two things:  _Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings_ (1992) 110 ALR 239; _Strachan v Marriott_ \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272.   The Commissioner considers that a benefit is provided "in connection with" the employment relationship if the employment relationship is the reason for, or at least a substantial reason for, the provision of the benefit. 

Whether a benefit for which market value is paid by an employee is "in connection with" an employment relationship depends on the facts in each case.  If the employer's business does not include the provision of goods or services of the type provided to the employee, it is unlikely that the goods or services would have been provided to the employee if not for the employment relationship.  However, if the goods or services provided to an employee are of a type which the employer customarily makes available to the general public, and the goods and services are provided at the same price and on the same terms as the price and terms available to a member of the general public, it is likely that the goods or services would be provided because the employee has paid for such goods or services, rather than because of the employment relationship. 

**Example**

An employee of a supermarket selects goods off the shelves of the supermarket, queues at the checkout to pay for the goods and pays the shelf price for the goods.  Regardless of whether the checkout operator is aware that the employee is a staff member a benefit would not be provided to the employee "in connection with their employment" as the employee receives the goods on the same terms and conditions as any other customer. 

If by showing a staff card the employee obtained a discount on the goods, a benefit would be provided to the employee "in connection with the employment" as the employee is entitled to purchase goods at a discount only because of the employment relationship. 

A benefit would also be provided to employees "in connection with their employment" if employees were entitled to a rebate where their total purchases exceeded a certain level and such a rebate was not available to the public.

**Would a benefit be provided where the employer also receives a benefit from the provision of goods or services?**

Whether a fringe benefit is provided does not depend on whether employees consider that they have received an advantage or benefit: _Case M9_ (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069.  The definition of "fringe benefit" contains specific exclusions relating to situations where goods or services are provided to an employee for the purpose of performing employment duties: see sections CX 17 and CX 26(1) and the provisos to the definition of "private use or enjoyment" in section OB 1.  An inference can be drawn from these specific exclusions that it was contemplated that a benefit would be provided where both the employer and the employee derive a benefit from the provision of goods or services to the employee.  The specific exclusions relate to:

*   Any benefit, to the extent to which it removes a need that would otherwise exist for the employer to pay the employee an allowance that reimburses the employee for transport costs that would have been incurred both in connection with their employment and for the benefit of the employer in travelling between home and work, such transport costs being attributable to any one or more of the following factors:
*   the day or time of day when the work duties are performed;

*   the need to transport any goods or material for use or disposal in the course of the employee's work;
*   the requirement to fulfil a statutory obligation;
*   a temporary change in the employee's place of work while in the same employment;
*   any other condition of the employee's work;
*   the absence of an adequate public passenger transport service that operates fixed routes and a regular timetable for the employee's place of work (section CX 17);

*   The provision of "distinctive work clothing" (section CX 26(1));
*   The use of a vehicle for emergency calls:  section CX 6(2); definition of "emergency call" in section CX 28.  The use of a vehicle for travel from the employee's home would not be private use where the vehicle is used for an emergency call. 
*   The use of a work-related vehicle (including the use of such a vehicle for private use that is travel to and from the employee's home that is necessary in and is a condition of their employment or other private use where the travel arises in the course of their employment during which the travel arises incidentally to the business use):  section CX 6(2), definition of "work-related vehicle" in section CX 32.

The new KiwiSaver legislation detailed analysis
===============================================

Detailed analysis of the 2007 KiwiSaver legislation covering member tax credits, creditable membership, and the transitional rules covering contributions paid to IR.

#### Member tax credit (sections KJ to KJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections MK1(1) and (3) and MK 2 to MK8 of the Income Tax Act 2007)

A number of changes have been made to the member tax credit rules as enacted by the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007. Section references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise specified.

#### Creditable membership

The requirements that a person must meet to be eligible for the member tax credit are set out in section KJ 2. New section KJ 2(a) introduces the requirement of having a "creditable membership" of KiwiSaver or a complying fund. Accordingly, a new definition of "creditable membership" has been included in section OB 1. The definition provides that when a person joins KiwiSaver or a complying fund, the period of eligibility for the member tax credit begins from the earlier of:

*   the first of the month in which contributions are deducted from an employee's salary or wages; or
*   the first of the month in which a contribution is received by Inland Revenue (a voluntary contribution paid directly to Inland Revenue); or
*   the first of the month in which securities are allotted by a KiwiSaver scheme or a CSF.

**Contributions paid to Inland Revenue - transitional rule**

A transitional rule applied as a result of the legislative requirement that all contributions must be paid to Inland Revenue during the period 1 July to 30 September 2007. This transitional rule treated membership as beginning on the first of the month in which a provider received a valid application for membership from a person if contributions had been received by either Inland Revenue or the provider during the period 1 July to 31 October 2007.

**Amount of member tax credit**

The amount of the member tax credit payable is calculated under the formula in section KJ 3. It has been amended to correct a drafting error and to clarify the calculation of the credit. If a person meets the requirement set out in section KJ 2 for the full member credit year (1 July to 30 June), the amount of the credit is the total amount of contributions received during the year up to a maximum of $1,042.86. If the person does not meet the requirements in section KJ 2, the credit is apportioned on the basis of the number of days the person meets the requirements. Two possible formulas for calculating the credit are provided, with the relevant formula depending on whether the amount contributed by the member is more or less than $1,042.86 divided by365 ($2.857 per day).

_First formula:_

|     |
| --- |
| member credit contributions [**2**](#02) |
| included days [**3**](#03) |

_Second formula:_

|     |
| --- |
| $1,042.86 x included days |
| 365 |

If the amount calculated by the first formula is less than $1,042.86 divided by 365 ($2.857 per day), the amount of the member tax credit is equal to the total amount of that person's contributions for the member credit year

(1 July to 30 June). If the amount calculated under the first formula is equal to or greater than $1,042.86 divided by 365 ($2.857 per day), the amount is calculated by the second formula.

##### Example 1

Tracey is automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver on 15 April 2008 through her employer. Her eligibility for the member tax credit begins on 1 April (deductions made from salary or wages in April), 91 days before the end of the member credit year (30 June 2008). Tracey makes contributions to her KiwiSaver scheme during this 91-day period totalling $500 (approximately $38 a week). As the amount that she has contributed is greater than $1,042.86 divided by365 ($2.857), the amount of her member tax credit is calculated using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| $1,042.86 x 91 (included days) |
| 365 |

Tracey's tax credit entitlement for the 2007-08 member credit year is $260 (13 weeks at $20).

##### Example 2

Mike opts into KiwiSaver through his employer on 26April 2008. The first contributions from his pay will not be deducted until May, so he makes a voluntary contribution to Inland Revenue that is received on 28April 2008. Mike's eligibility for the member tax credit begins on 1 April 2008, 91 days before the end of the member credit year (30 June 2008). Mike makes contributions to his KiwiSaver scheme during this 91-day period totalling $200 (approximately $15.38 a week). As the amount he has contributed is less than $1,042.86 divided by 365 ($2.857), the amount of his member tax credit for the 2007-2008 member credit year is equal to the total amount of his member credit contributions for the member credit year - $200 (approximately $15.38 x 13 weeks).

**Member credit contributions**

A new definition of "member credit contributions" has been introduced and includes amounts received and held by the Commissioner. These are contributions received and held by Inland Revenue but not on-paid to the provider until after the member credit year. These will count as contributions for calculating the member tax credit for that year. Employer contributions, amounts diverted under a mortgage diversion and amounts refunded are excluded for the purposes of calculating the credit.

**Processing claim for credit**

Section KJ 4(2) has been amended to provide that upon receipt of a claim, Inland Revenue has 30 working days to process and pay the claim to the provider. Member tax credits are paid to providers on a first-come basis. There is no longer a pro-rating of the payment between providers if the member has more than one provider.

**Payment of credit**

New subsection KJ 4(3) provides the circumstances in which the Commissioner may make a payment to individual members or to another provider. A final payment may be made to the member or the member's estate for reasons of serious illness, death or when the member's account is closed. Inland Revenue will pay the credit to the member's provider at the time the claim is made. If there is, or will be, a change in provider (a request for transfer), the credit will be paid to the new provider if requested by the first provider.

**Allocating the credit**

Section KJ 5 (3) has been amended to clarify the rules in relation to allocating the member tax credit. The provider must allocate the member tax credit according to the current investment allocation instructions the member has elected or the investment allocation to which the member has been assigned.

**Claiming the credit**

The provider must claim the tax credit in the "form prescribed by the Commissioner". Providers will make a claim after 30 June each member credit year on the basis of the contribution information they hold (and Inland Revenue does not hold) at that date. That will include information such as the amount of contributions received directly by the provider and the amount of contributions subject to a mortgage diversion. Inland Revenue will calculate and pay the credit based on the information received and the contribution information it holds. All contributions for complying funds will, however, need to be received by 30 June to count towards the calculation of the credit in that year as all complying fund contributions are made directly from the employer to the provider. (Inland Revenue does not hold contribution information for complying funds.)

The member tax credit process will require providers to furnish necessary information to Inland Revenue to enable it to calculate the member tax credit. Inland Revenue will calculate the member tax credit on the basis of this information and make supplementary member tax credit payments, where appropriate, when additional information is available in relation to money in the holding account.

Providers retain the ability to make supplementary claims for periods for which they have obtained the information needed to make a claim - either when no claim was previously lodged, or when less than the maximum eligible claim has previously been paid. However, because Inland Revenue will be calculating the entitlement to the member tax credit based on information provided to it and also on the qualifying contributions it holds, KiwiSaver providers may not need to make supplementary claims after the end of the member credit year.

As CSF providers may not always hold the relevant IRD numbers for their members, an amendment enables CSFs that do not have a member's IRD number to supply other information to Inland Revenue to assist it in making the payment. If it is unable to make the payment on the basis of the information provided, Inland Revenue will inform the provider so that the provider can write to the member requesting the necessary information. Section 68C (3)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to clarify that the IRD number need be provided only if known.

**Transfers - information to be provided**

Section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended so that KiwiSaver providers are no longer required to provide information about the amount of the member tax credit received or information about previous claims made by them to a new KiwiSaver provider on transfer. This is because Inland Revenue will hold this information. However, the following details will still need to be provided to another scheme on transfer:

*   the value of qualifying contributions received directly;
*   mortgage diversion arrangements
*   any periods of ineligibility because of residence outside New Zealand; and
*   the date on which a person first became a member of a KiwiSaver scheme.

**Permanent emigration**

Clause 14(2) of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended to provide that when KiwiSaver members permanently emigrate and transfer all of their funds in their KiwiSaver scheme to a foreign superannuation scheme the nominal value of the credit up to the value of their accumulation in the scheme will be repaid to the Crown.

* * *

**2** "Member credit contributions" are the total amount of a person’s member credit contributions for all of the person’s complying superannuation funds and KiwiSaver schemes for the member credit year.

**3** Included days are the number of days in the member credit year on which the person meets the requirements in section KJ 2.

The new KiwiSaver legislation introduction

The legislation giving effect to compulsory employer contributions and the employer tax credit is contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007, which received Royal assent on 19 December 2007, and applies from 1April 2008. The new Act also includes a number of other amendments. The most significant are changes to the member tax credit rules, the establishment of a process to deal with invalid KiwiSaver enrolments, changes to the definition of "salary and wages", changes to the complying fund rules, and regulatory regime changes.

#### Background

The government announced in Budget 2007 a number of changes to KiwiSaver that significantly increase the incentives to join the work-based savings scheme and to continue making regular contributions. The key changes included:

*   A tax credit to members that matches their contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund (CSF)[1](#01)
    , up to a maximum of $20 per week. The legislation giving effect to the member tax credit was enacted in May2007, in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007, and applies to contributions made from 1 July 2007.
*   A compulsory employer contribution when an employee contributes to a KiwiSaver scheme or a CSF that will be phased in over four years, starting at 1 percent from 1 April 2008 and reaching 4percent of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2011. This was legislated for in the Taxation(KiwiSaver) Act 2007.
*   An employer tax credit to reimburse employers for contributions they will be required to make into their employees' KiwiSaver scheme or CSF up to a maximum of $20 a week for each employee. This was also legislated for in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007.

#### Key features

The new rules for KiwiSaver and complying funds involve changes to the KiwiSaver Act 2006, Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994, Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006. The main changes are:

*   New rules for the member tax credit, the main changes being:
    *   the period of membership for the purposes of calculating the member tax credit has been amended to include the period from the date that a contribution is first made or deducted from a person's salary or wages, and a definition of "creditable membership" has been introduced;
    *   contributions received by the Commissioner but not transferred to a provider in the member credit year will count towards the calculation of the credit, and a definition for "member credit contributions" has been introduced; and
    *   the formula for calculating the amount of credit has been clarified.
*   Rules to establish compulsory employer contributions.
*   Rules to establish the employer tax credit.
*   Rules for dealing with "invalid KiwiSaver enrolments".
*   Amendments to the definition of "salary or wages".
*   New rules for minimum employee contributions.
*   A number of changes have been made to the regulatory regime:
    *   the definition of "independent trustee" has been amended to remove the requirement that the trustee be independent from the administration and investment managers of the scheme;
    *   an amendment has been made to section 206 of the KiwiSaver Act to provide that persons are not investment brokers if they merely exercise a function, duty or power under the KiwiSaver Act;
    *   a new section has been introduced to require all KiwiSaver schemes and CSFs to disclose their approach to responsible investment;
    *   section 158 of the KiwiSaver Act has been expanded to enable the KiwiSaver register to include a sub-register of CSFs; and
    *   a new section provides transitional relief for KiwiSaver and CSF providers for any non-compliance with any Act until 31 January 2007.
*   A number of changes have been made with respect to CSFs:
    *   the definition of "complying fund rules" has been amended;
    *   compulsory employer contributions to CSFs must be allocated to the investment profile chosen by members and be fully vested;
    *   the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 has been amended to enable schemes that provide insurance benefits that are linked to superannuation accumulation to reduce those insurance benefits by the amount transferred if members elect to transfer their CSF accumulation to a KiwiSaver scheme; and
    *   to obtain CSF status, a registered superannuation scheme will have to satisfy the requirements for the scheme to be registered before 1 July 2007.

A number of other changes have also been made and are included in this article.

The "PAYE by intermediaries" rules
==================================

The 'PAYE by intermediaries' rules.

_Sections NBB 2(1)(c), 2(4)(b), 4(1), 4(1B), 4(2), 4(3), 4(4)(c), 4(4)(d), 5(1), 5(1B), 5(2B), 6(2) and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004_

_Sections 120OB(1), 141JB(1), 167(2B), 168(4), 169(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

**Introduction**

A number of amendments have been made to the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules to further improve theiroperability. The rules allow accredited intermediaries to largely assume an employer’s obligations under the PAYE rules — to calculate PAYE, pay it to Inland Revenue and file PAYE returns. The amendments to the rules:

*   allow PAYE intermediaries to make payments of net salary and wages directly to employees (from an employer’s account) providedthe associated PAYE is simultaneously transferred, or is transferred before the payment to employees is made, into an intermediary’s trust account;
*   clarify the accreditation requirements for PAYE intermediaries; and
*   require PAYE intermediaries to represent at least ten employers.

**Background**

From 1 April 2004, the new “PAYE by intermediaries” rules allow accredited intermediaries to largely assume an employer’s obligations under the PAYE rules (calculating PAYE, paying it and filing returns). Under the rules, employers’ obligations are limited to paying their employees’ gross salary and wages to the PAYE intermediary and providing basic payroll information.

An amendment has been made to the rules to provide greater flexibility to PAYE intermediaries in how they make payments to employees. Before this change, the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules required employers to deposit the gross salary or wages of employees into a trust account operated by the intermediary. The intermediary was then responsible for disbursing the deposited funds — net pay to employees and PAYE to Inland Revenue. Concerns were raised that this model could result in a number of unnecessary risks and transactions costs being incurred by prospective intermediaries.

To deal with those concerns, the rules have been changed to allow PAYE intermediaries to make payments of net salary and wages directly into employees’ bank accounts (from an employer’s account) provided the associated PAYE is simultaneously transferred, or is transferred before the payment to employees is made, into an intermediary’s trust account. Employers and PAYE intermediaries will, however, still have the option of using the trust account for gross salary and wages, if so desired.

Finally, amendments reduce the risk of the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules being abused by entities registering as intermediaries who do not intend to represent any employers, by requiring PAYE intermediaries to act on behalf of a minimum of ten employers.

**Key features**

Sections NBB 2(1)(c) and 2(4)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 2004 have been amended to clarify that the accreditation requirements in those sections apply to a “director, secretary or statutory officer” when the applicant is a body corporate and, in the case of an unincorporated body, to the members of the unincorporated body.

Section NBB 4(1) of the 1994 and 2004 Acts has been replaced and new section NBB 5(1B) added to give greater flexibility to PAYE intermediaries in how they can make payments to employees. If the gross pay of employees is not transacted through a PAYE intermediary’s trust account, replacement section NBB 4(1)(a) requires employers to make available sufficient funds to a PAYE intermediary to cover both employees’ net salary and wages and the PAYE. New section NBB 5(1B) then requires a PAYE intermediary, when making payments of net salary and wages directly to employees, to transfer the associated PAYE into the trust account simultaneously (or transfer the PAYE before the payment to employees is made).

As a result of the changes to section NBB 4(1), a number of consequential amendments have been made, including the addition of a new section NBB 4(1B), changes to sections NBB 4(2), NBB 4(3), NBB 4(4)(c) and (d), NBB 5(1), NBB 5(2B) and NBB 6(2) and changes to 65 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005) sections 120OB(1), 141JB(1), 167(2B), 168(4) and 169(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The definition of “PAYE intermediary” in section OB 1 has been amended to require PAYE intermediaries to represent at least ten employers.

**Application date**

The amendments are effective from the application date of the “PAYE by intermediaries rules” — pay periods beginning on and after 1 April 2004.

Tax toolbox for tradies
=======================

Are you a self-employed tradie or running a construction business? Or maybe you're someone who helps a tradie keep on top of their books? We know you’re good on the tools. Take your tax as seriously as your trade by using our Tax Toolbox.

Record keeping - are you keeping good business records?

It’s important for you to keep accurate records. Records make it easier to:

*   work out your income and expenses
*   work out your GST if you’re GST registered
*   meet your employer obligations if you have staff
*   confirm your accounts.

Records must be in English or Māori and you need to keep them for at least 7 years.

Expenses - do you know what you can claim for?

Businesses, including self-employed contractors, get taxed on their income minus any business expenses and other claimable deductions. You will need to keep a record of your expenses and income (for example, invoices and receipts).

Watch this helpful video to get an idea of what tradie tools and other expenses can and can’t be claimed.

[Types of business expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses)

Income tax – are you telling us about all the income you earn and paying tax on it?  

Like all working New Zealanders, tradies need to pay tax on all income they earn. Keeping on top of your obligations is important. If you have outstanding returns or debt owing, cut the excuses and nail your income tax now.

Tip: You can make this easier by paying income tax on a cycle to suit your cashflow, rather than waiting until the end of the tax year.

Do you or your business own rental property? We can see if you’re under-declaring rental income. Make sure you declare it in your income tax returns.

#### Have any debt owing?

Don’t dig yourself a hole. Pay now before your debt gets out of control.

Tip: If paying off your debt in one go is too much, you can apply for an instalment arrangement which allows you to pay your debt off over time. An instalment arrangement also helps you avoid further late payment penalties.

GST – is your turnover $60,000 or more a year?

If you're self-employed or in business, once your turnover is $60,000 or more a year you need to register for GST, charge 15% GST on your sales and income, file GST returns and pay it to us. You can claim GST back on your purchases and expenses.

Tip: Make your life easier by working out your GST per dollar earned, then set this money aside in a dedicated bank account on a regular basis. Remember the GST filing frequency you’ve chosen and pay as you file. 

Have outstanding GST returns or debt? Don’t paint over the cracks, get your GST sorted now.

Employer obligations – employing tradies or staff?

If you’re running a construction business and employing people you need to make deductions from employees' pay and send the information to us.

Tip: Consider your payroll cycle and whether it needs to be weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Set aside payroll deductions every pay run so you have PAYE available.

#### Schedular payments

Schedular payments are payments made to independent contractors, with withholding tax deducted. If you're hiring independent contractors you need to deduct withholding tax and pay it to us on behalf of your contractor.

The Taxation (New Due Date for New and Increased Assessments) Commencement Order 2019
=====================================================================================

The Taxation (New Due Date for New and Increased Assessments) Commencement Order 2019 will come into force by 1 April 2019 and sets 8 July 2019 as the date that section 142AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 comes into force for income tax, including Working for Families assessments.

_The Taxation (New Due Date for New and Increased Assessments) Commencement Order 2019_ will come into force by 1 April 2019 and sets **8 July 2019** as the date that section 142AB of the _Tax Administration Act 1994_ comes into force for income tax, including Working for Families assessments.

This new section standardises the due dates for default assessments which are issued by the Commissioner in the absence of a return.

### Current treatment

Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently sets different due dates for payment of an Electronic Default Assessment (EDA) and Non-electronic Default Assessment (NDA). There are also different treatments for any tax payable from a subsequent amendment to that default assessment.

For an EDA:

*   The amount payable from the default assessment is due on the original due date for the tax type and period.  This means that if the EDA is made after the original due date, late payment penalties will be immediately applied, back-dated to the original due date.
*   When the EDA is amended, a new due date will be set that is at least 30 days following the notice advising the taxpayer of the new amount to pay.  Therefore, any late payment penalties applied to the EDA will be reversed, and the taxpayer will not be penalised further unless they do not pay any amount due by the new due date.

For an NDA:

*   The amount payable from the default assessment is due at least 30 days from the notice of assessment.
*   If the assessment is subsequently amended, then the taxpayer is only given a new due date for any amount payable that is greater than the amount previously payable from the NDA.  This new due date will also be at least 30 days after the notice advising the taxpayer of the additional tax to pay.

### New treatment

Section 142AB modifies these rules to align the due date for payment of tax for default assessments, whether these are made manually or electronically.

The amended rules only apply to the default assessment that relates to a tax type that has been migrated to Inland Revenue's new START technology system, and when incremental penalties do not apply to the particular tax type. From April 2019, income tax, which includes Working for Families assessments, meets those criteria.

Section 142AB will apply to set a new due date for certain assessments. Section 142AB will not apply to assessments made in the absence of a return and to which section 106(1) applies. Section 106 deals with the issue of default assessments, both electronic and non-electronic.

Section 142A currently applies to tax types that proposed section 142AB does not apply to. It applies to assessments other than EDAs made in the absence of a return and to which section 106(2) applies (which relates to EDAs only). Section 142AB removes this distinction entirely so that no new due date is set for any default assessment, manual or automatic.

In addition, proposed section 142AB does not set a new due date for an increased assessment from a default assessment. This will mean that any subsequent amendments to a default assessment will be due at the original due date. This change reflects the fact that no return was originally filed and removes a benefit to those who do not file compared with those who do file returns and pay tax on time.

A more detailed description of how section 142AB applies can be found on page 2 of _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 30, No 6 (July 2018).

The taxation of land-related lease payments
===========================================

2014 amendments to address specific revenue risks with land-related lease transfer payments.

#### _Sections CC 1, CC 1B, CC 1C, DB 20B, DB 20C, EE 7, EE 67, EI 4B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Amendments have been made to achieve a more coherent and consistent tax treatment of land-related lease payments. The reforms address specific revenue risks with lease transfer payments (that is, received by an exiting tenant for transferring a lease to an incoming tenant). Certain lease transfer payments, which are substitutable for taxable lease surrender and lease premiums payments, are taxable from 1 April 2015.

These reforms build on amendments made to the Income Tax Act 2007 in 2013 that treat lease inducement and lease surrender payments as deductible to the payer and taxable to the recipient over the lease term.

There are also a number of technical amendments to tax law relating to leases and licences of land to provide consistency and certainty.  

Lease Transfer Payments
-----------------------

_Sections CC 1B and EI 4B of the Income Tax Act 2007_

### Background

Lease transfer payments are generally received by an exiting tenant (assignor) from a new incoming tenant (assignee), for the transfer or assignment of a lease. Prior to this amendment, the payment was typically non-taxable to the exiting tenant for income tax purposes.

The previous non-taxable status of lease transfer payments, in tandem with taxable lease surrender payments,[1](#01)
 could potentially distort commercial decisions upon termination of a tenant's lease. It could be tax advantageous for a tenant to exit a lease by transferring it to a third party for a then tax-free lease transfer payment, rather than surrendering it to a landlord for a taxable lease surrender payment.

From the exiting tenant's perspective, there is no economic difference between surrendering the lease to the landlord and transferring it to a third party. The effect is the same—the tenant exits the lease and receives consideration for it. Treating similar payments differently for income tax purposes distorts business decisions and results in economic inefficiency and unfairness.

### Key features

Section CC 1B has been extended and now includes certain lease transfer payments that are substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments in section CC 1C and taxable lease premiums in section CC 1. This inclusion makes these lease transfer payments taxable to the recipient and tax-deductible to the payer.

In accordance with new section CC 1B, a lease transfer payment is income of the payee, and therefore taxable, in the following situations:

*   The person purchasing the lease is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted; such a payment is substitutable for a lease surrender payment.
*   The amount is sourced from funds provided by the owner of the estate in land from which the estate is granted for the purpose of obtaining the surrender or termination of the land right; the lease transfer payment is substitutable for a lease surrender payment.
*   The vendor of the lease is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted; the lease transfer payment is substitutable for a lease premium.

### Detailed analysis

If a person (the payee) derives an amount in relation to a land right as consideration for the transfer of the land right from the holder of the land right to another person, the amount will be taxable to the payee (new section CC 1B(1)(b)(ii) and (2)). The land right must be a right that is a leasehold estate (other than a lease with permanent right of renewal) or a licence to use land.

The term "leasehold estate" is defined broadly in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate.[2](#02)
 The charging provision, therefore, does not apply to payments for a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land.

Despite this broad charging provision for lease transfer payments in section CC 1B, most lease transfer payments will not be taxable, if the following conditions are satisfied:

*   the payee is the holder of the land right (for example, the exiting tenant);
*   the amount is consideration for the transfer of the land right to the person paying the amount (for example, the incoming tenant);
*   the amount is not sourced from funds provided by the owner of the estate in land from which the estate is granted for the purpose of obtaining the surrender or termination of the land right—an arm's length transaction between a landlord and an incoming tenant would therefore satisfy this condition;
*   the payee and the incoming tenant are not associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted.

Payments derived in situations when the conditions above are not satisfied, will be taxable to the payee. If a lease is transferred as part of a business transfer, consideration for goodwill attaching to the land will be taxable to the payee; however, consideration for business or personal goodwill will not be subject to the charging provision in section CC 1B.

Situations involving lease transfer payments that are covered by new section CC 1B are payments that are substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments in section CC 1C and taxable lease premiums in section CC 1.

There are two situations when lease transfer payments that are substitutable for lease surrender payments will be taxable to the payee. They are:

*   If the person paying the amount (that is, the incoming tenant) is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted.

![Diagram showing relationships in lease transfer payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/8/78fe9cce-a8cb-41d2-8042-7dd44eee4639/image-5-aug-new-leg.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214344&hash=8E38031A2F531F8B20BB4043E660AC63 "Diagram showing relationships in lease transfer payments")

*   If the amount is sourced from funds provided by the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted,[3](#03)
     for the purpose of obtaining the termination of the lease.

![Diagram showing relationships in lease transfer payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/d/ed8206bd-498f-43d5-8de5-0621257f0e65/image-6-aug-new-leg.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214345&hash=4EE1E9CC03D15FE82A13F748FA0A643F "Diagram showing relationships in lease transfer payments")

Another situation when lease transfer payments will be taxable is payments that are substitutable for lease premium payments. In particular, a lease transfer payment will be taxable if the payee (that is, the exiting tenant) is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted.

![Diagram showing relationships in lease transfer payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/c/6cc11d99-7d48-402a-a000-4337e416fc70/image-7-aug-new-leg.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214343&hash=A3D4FE27865D3ABD161986F32B250BF9 "Diagram showing relationships in lease transfer payments")

This would prevent a landlord setting up a lease with a low rent with their associate and, as part of this arrangement, the associated tenant transfers the lease to a non-associated tenant and receives a non-taxable lease transfer payment.

Taxing a lease transfer payment in such situation supplements the existing anti-avoidance provision in section GC 5, which allows the Commissioner to set an adequate level of rent for leases between associates.

The definition of "land provisions" in section YA 1 has been amended so the definition of "associated person" applying in new section CC 1B is the one applicable to land provisions.

If a person receives a lease transfer payment on behalf of another person, the nominee rules in section YB 21 apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person.

An amount that is subject to the existing capital contribution rules is not subject to the charging provision (section CC 1B(5)). A capital contribution continues to be income under section CG 8 and needs to be spread evenly over 10 years unless the payee chooses to reduce the cost base of the depreciable property under section DB 64.

### _Residential exception_

A lease transfer payment will not be income of the payee if the payee is a natural person (individual) and derives the amount as a tenant or licensee of residential premises whose expenditure on the residential premises does not meet the requirements of the general permission,  and is not associated with the owner (section CC 1B(4)). This exclusion is intended to provide a consistent tax treatment with that for lease surrender payments in section CC 1C.

### _Timing of income_

The timing provision in section EI 4B applies to the amount of income under section CC 1B. Under that provision, the allocation of income is affected by when the income is derived in relation to the spreading period.

The exiting tenant (assignor) who receives a lease transfer payment has no remaining period over which to spread the amount of income under section CC 1B. Therefore, the amount of income is allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived.

A remedial amendment has been made to section EI 4B to ensure that if a lease is terminated early, land owners can receive the balance of deductions for a lease inducement payment in the year of termination. For example, if a tax-deductible lease inducement payment of $1,000 was provided by a landlord in relation to a tenancy agreement that was meant to last for 10 years but terminated after two years, the landlord can deduct the remaining $800 in the year of termination. This is consistent with the treatment of a lessee who is taxed on the balance of income from a lease inducement payment if the lease is terminated early.

### Application dates

New section CC 1B applies from 1 April 2015.

The amendment to section EI 4B applies from 1 April 2013.

Perpetually Renewable Leases
----------------------------

_Sections CC 1B, CC 1C, DB 20B, DB 20C and EE 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Amendments exclude perpetually renewable leases from the charging provisions for land-related lease payments in sections CC 1B and CC 1C, as well as the related deduction provisions. An amendment also excludes perpetually renewable leases from being depreciable property.

### Background

Perpetually renewable leases (commonly known as "Glasgow" leases) last for a certain period of time (for example, 7, 10 or 21 years), but are renewable in perpetuity at the option of tenants.

The "right to use land", which includes a lease, is contained in the list of depreciable intangible property in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Usually, a commercial tenant under a lease can claim depreciation deductions for their cost to acquire the lease (that is, a lease premium or lease transfer payment) over its term.

A tenant under a perpetually renewable lease cannot claim depreciation deductions during the term of the lease because these leases have a perpetually renewable lease period. The tenant, however, may have been able to claim a depreciation loss when the perpetually renewable lease was sold for less than its adjusted tax value if the lease met the definition of "depreciable property" in section EE 6, that is, in normal circumstances, the lease might reasonably be expected to decline in value.

### Key features

Previously, the charging provisions for land-related lease payments in sections CC 1B and CC 1C included all leasehold estates, including those with a perpetual right of renewal.

Because perpetually renewable leases are more akin to freehold property than ordinary commercial leases with a finite term, amendments have been made to align their treatment with that of freehold estates. Section CC 1B has been amended to exclude payments made for the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of perpetually renewable leases from being income of the person to whom the payment was made. Section CC 1C has also been amended to exclude payments for the surrender of a perpetually renewable lease from being income of the recipient.

Note that a premium paid on the grant of a perpetually renewable lease continues to be taxable to a landowner under section CC 1.  
  
Sections DB 20B and DB 20C have been amended to exclude a payment for a grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a perpetually renewable lease from being deductible to the person who made such a payment.

Section EE 7 has been amended to exclude a lease of land with a perpetual right of renewal from being depreciable property. Accordingly, depreciation deductions are not available for a perpetually renewable lease. The purpose is to treat a perpetually renewable lease similarly to freehold land under the depreciation rules.

### Application dates

The amendments to sections CC 1B, DB 20B and EE 7 apply from 1 April 2015.

The amendments to sections CC 1C and DB 20C apply from 1 April 2013.

Permanent Easements
-------------------

_Section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

This amendment excludes a payment for a permanent easement (for example, a permanent right of way) from being taxable to a landowner under section CC 1.

### Background

Section CC 1 applies broadly to tax income from land by providing that amounts derived from land by a landowner are taxable even if the amounts are traditionally categorised as capital in nature, for example, a lease premium. Before this amendment, a payment for a permanent easement was taxable to a landowner under section CC 1.

A payment for a permanent easement is generally non-deductible to the payer (the grantee) under the depreciation rules. Generally, a permanent easement does not meet the definition of depreciable property under section EE 6; in particular, in normal circumstances, a permanent easement is not reasonably expected to decline in value.

### Key features

An amendment to section CC 1 excludes a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement from being income of the landowner, by inserting new section CC 1(2C). Accordingly, a payment for a permanent easement is not taxable to the owner of land under section CC 1.[4](#04)
 The purpose of this amendment is to align the tax treatment of a permanent easement with that for freehold land under section CC 1.

The amendment applies only to one-off payments, but not to periodical payments, which are more in the nature of rental. Periodical payments received for permanent easements continue to be taxable under section CC 1.

### Application date

The amendment applies from 1 April 2015.

Consecutive Leases
------------------

_Sections EE 67 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

This amendment treats consecutive leases of land as a single lease for depreciation purposes.

### Background

Consecutive leases are multiple leases for the same parcel of land that are granted to a person or an associated person at the same time, and are linked to take effect immediately after one terminates. Under the previous rules, depreciation deductions on a lease could be accelerated by entering into consecutive leases, including involving associated persons, rather than a single lease.

### Key features

Section EE 67 has been amended to include consecutive leases in the existing definition of "legal life" for a lease and licence to use land. The definition of "legal life" is used to determine the annual depreciation rate for an item of fixed-life intangible property, such as a lease of land, in section EE 33.

If consecutive leases over the same parcel of land are granted to a person or an associated person at the same time, the term of a lease owned by the person also includes the terms of consecutive leases owned by that person or their associate. This has an effect of treating consecutive leases as a single lease.

Example 

On 1 April 2015, A Ltd and its associates, B Ltd and C Ltd, enter into three separate leases for the same parcel of land to take effect immediately after one terminates. The first lease commences on 1 April 2015. Each lease lasts for 10 years.

| Lease | Commencement date | Lease ownership | Term of the lease |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1 April 2015 | A Ltd | 10 years |
| 2   | 1 April 2025 | B Ltd | 10 years |
| 3   | 1 April 2035 | C Ltd | 10 years |

A Ltd, B Ltd and C Ltd are associated and they have entered into consecutive leases for the same parcel of land on the same day. Therefore, under the new rules:

*   A Ltd's interest (owner's interest) in the lease is treated as lasting for 30 years, which includes both B Ltd and C Ltd's interests in the lease.
*   B Ltd's interest (owner's interest) in the lease is treated as lasting for 20 years, which includes C Ltd's interest in the lease.
*   C Ltd's interest (owner's interest) in the lease lasts for 10 years as there is no consecutive lease.

Any genuinely subsequently negotiated leases or licences of land are not counted towards the legal life of a lease. Consecutive leases would need to be acquired by the person or associated person at the same time to be counted towards the legal life of a lease.

This is an anti-avoidance measure preventing the timing of depreciation deductions for the cost of acquiring a lease (a lease premium or lease transfer payment) being accelerated by entering into consecutive leases. If consecutive leases are entered into around the same time (such as one day apart), the general anti-avoidance provision in section BG 1 may apply to counter any transactions that attempt to circumvent this measure contrary to the policy intent.

The definition of "land provisions" in section YA 1 has been amended so that the definition of "associated person" applying in section EE 67 is the one applicable to land provisions.

Also, paragraph (d)(v) of the definition of "lease" in section YA 1 has been amended to remove the Commissioner's discretion to determine consecutive leases for the purposes of personal property lease payments. A similar definition to the one that has been inserted in section EE 67 for depreciation purposes has been adopted to provide certainty and consistency.

### Application date

These amendments apply from 1 April 2015.

Retirement Village Occupation Rights
------------------------------------

_Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The amendment ensures that all occupation right agreements under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are excluded from the financial arrangement rules.

### Background

Leases are excluded from the financial arrangement rules because they are excepted financial arrangements under section EW 5(9). However, retirement village occupation rights that are licences to occupy were previously regarded as financial arrangements because they were not a lease for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules as defined in section YA 1.

Treating certain retirement village occupation rights as financial arrangements was undesirable; if certain retirement village occupation rights were subject to the financial arrangement rules, there could have been tax consequences for a retirement village resident.

### Key features

Paragraph (f) of the "lease" definition in section YA 1 has been amended to include an occupation right agreement as defined in the Retirement Villages Act 2003. Retirement village occupation rights are therefore treated as an excepted financial arrangement in section EW 5(9), and accordingly excluded from the financial arrangement rules.  

This amendment aligns the treatment of retirement village occupation rights, that are licenses to occupy, with leases of land under the financial arrangement rules, and provides certainty that retirement village residents will not be subject to these rules.

### Application date

The amendment applies from 1 April 2015.

* * *

1 Lease surrender payments are taxable under section CC 1C of the Income Tax Act 2007.

2 For income tax purposes, an interest in land has the same meaning as an estate in land.

3 Note that the payment from the landlord to the new tenant for the lease transfer is deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B and taxable to the new tenant under section CC 1B.

4Note that the land provisions in sections CB 6-CB 23B continue to apply to permanent easements.

Ko te tau e tū mai nei The year ahead (2022)
============================================

Moving into 2022-23, we'll continue to play our part in progressing the Government's priorities for accelerating the recovery from COVID-19, improving family and whānau wellbeing and looking at the fairness of the tax system.

The new Cost of Living Payment is aimed at helping an estimated 2.1 million New Zealanders. The payment of $350 is split into 3 monthly payments to be paid in August, September and October 2022.

To get ready for the payments, our people have been tidying up issues or errors in customers' 2022 tax returns and Working for Families assessments as this information is key to determining if people are eligible for the payments. We've also worked to update the bank account details of more than 200,000 customers so the payments reach them easily.

Our people been preparing our technology to handle the payments. They've also been providing information about who is eligible by engaging with community groups and tax agents, and using our websites, social media and phone technology. We've translated information for diverse communities.

Show all

Helping New Zealand to recover from the pandemic

When we designed the COVID-19 support schemes, we anticipated there would be some risk of fraud, abuse or gaming. We've set up an oversight group that is reviewing the integrity of these schemes. We're using our analytics capabilities to identify these customers and we're responding to them in a variety of ways, including targeted campaigns and direct messaging through intermediaries. When we need to, we're also taking enforcement action.

To help all our customers stay on track with their tax obligations, we'll continue to take a straightforward and helpful approach and intervene early if we think customers are at risk of getting into debt.

Growing into our role in the Māori Crown relationship

It's a priority for us to do better as an organisation in meeting our Treaty obligations and services to whānau Māori. We're continuing to roll out Māhutonga, our programme for integrating te ao Māori and te Tiriti o Waitangi into everything we do. In 2022-23, we will progress Mauri Ora Te Whānau, our Māori Customer Strategy, and our people will be learning to be comfortable with te reo and tikanga Māori through our new foundation capability programme.

Supporting the Government's tax and social policy priorities

By the end of 2022, the Government will update its Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. This will set out our future policy focus. We're continuing our research into the tax paid by high-wealth individuals and working on the Tax Principles Bill. We're also contributing to the cross-government review of Working for Families and to work on debt owed by people to government. We'll also be implementing the change to pass-on child support payments to carers.

As the steward of New Zealand's tax system, Inland Revenue is beginning its next regulatory review. This is a 'health check' of the system to help identify any problems that exist such as rules that don't work as they should because they're too complex or easy to misinterpret.

Improving everyday services to customers

It's important for us to keep improving our everyday services so tax and payments are easy to get right and hard to get wrong. We'll continue helping customers to do as much for themselves as possible using digital channels like myIR. At the same time, we'll continue supporting customers who cannot use them.

A key initiative underway is upgrading the technology we use in our contact centres to make it more flexible and cost-effective, and enable a better experience for customers. The technology will mean we can use new ways to understand and interact with our customers.

Supporting he tangata (our people)

Providing our people with a positive, safe, sustainable and inclusive work experience and work place underpins everything we do.

We're reshaping our culture through an initiative called Te Pou o te Tangata. 'Te Pou o te Tangata' means 'personal endeavour', which relates to being sincere in how we act and conduct ourselves with other people. We want to create a single set of descriptors that better reflect who we are as an organisation and that will continue to build on the momentum we generated during our transformation.

We're working with our entire Inland Revenue whānau to do this. We're incorporating te ao Māori concepts of whakawhanaungatanga and manaakitanga to make sure everyone at Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has a voice and those voices are heard.

Playing our part in achieving wider public sector priorities

Inland Revenue is committed to achieving cross-government broader priorities, including becoming more diverse and inclusive, reducing emissions and buying goods and services from a more diverse range of suppliers.

We're committed to operating sustainably and reducing our environmental footprint. We have a set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2025 and 50% by 2030.

Ko te tau kei te heke mai The year ahead
========================================

Our people have worked incredibly hard over the last few years and we'll continue to challenge ourselves to make it as easy as possible for customers to meet their obligations and receive the payments that they are entitled to.

As we move close to completing our transformation, we still have much to do in the year ahead to bring this multi-year change programme to a close and embed new systems, tools and capabilities.

Delivering to our mission - collecting and distributing money
-------------------------------------------------------------

Our core purpose is to collect and distribute money, and we’re proud to have worked throughout the year to provide New Zealand with a world-class revenue system that makes tax and payments simple and certain, easy to get right and hard to get wrong. It’s what we’re all here to do.

We’ll stay focused on helping customers get it right. In this COVID-19 era, this includes intervening early with people who have defaulted on instalment arrangements and helping businesses remain solvent so they can continue trading.

Supporting New Zealand’s recovery from COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------

Inland Revenue will continue to support any new Government initiatives to aid recovery from COVID-19 and remind people about the existing schemes and other relief options.

The Resurgence Support Payment is ready to activate at any time in the future. In fact, it did re-open for businesses impacted by Wellington’s alert level shift in June 2021 and August 2021 for the nation-wide Alert Level 4 lockdown.

Completing transformation and leveraging our capabilities
---------------------------------------------------------

All the transformation changes that affect customers are planned to be completed in 2021, including improvements to child support services and an upgrade to the online services that all customers use, notably myIR.

The child support improvements will ensure customers have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR and be able to do more themselves, such as advising us if their circumstances change. A game changer is that we’re streamlining processes to help ensure carers who receive the payments get them as quickly as possible after the due date.

We’ll be able to better help newly liable parents, particularly those who may have trouble at times meeting their payments. There will be compulsory employer deductions for parents new to paying child support.

We’ll complete final changes in 2022 such as decommissioning all heritage systems to ensure a simple and stable technology environment is in place. We’ll continue to transfer the knowledge from the transformation programme team to our people and the teams who will be responsible for the new systems and processes.

We’ll complete the implementation of the intelligence-led programme of work, which includes the new analytical and knowledge management tools - we’re only just starting to see the value we can drive from our information assets and capabilities.

At the core of our transformation is being able to meet customers’ needs, safeguard the integrity of the revenue system and deliver what we need to. We’re making changes to our Customer and Compliance Services business groups to ensure they’re the right size and right shape for the future.

Growing our skills and maturing as diverse, inclusive organisation
------------------------------------------------------------------

Hundreds of people from across Inland Revenue have helped deliver our transformation. Through it, they’ve gained skills, knowledge and experience that will help us succeed into the future. We’ll keep providing opportunities for our people to grow in their roles and expand their skills to help build a stronger New Zealand public service.

We remain committed to embedding our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, creating an inclusive organisation that reflects all of New Zealand’s diverse communities and is better able to meet the needs of the customers we serve every day.

Delivering the Government’s policy priorities
---------------------------------------------

In July 2021, the Government updated its tax policy work programme. The work programme will focus on areas such as housing affordability, a tax system that reduces income inequality, a sustainable economy and the environment, ensuring international tax settings remain robust for an increasingly digital economy, and social policy.

Budget 2021 provided $5 million for a policy research project on the effective tax rate paid on income by high-wealth individuals. Our aim is to get high-quality evidence for policy advice in relation to the progressivity of the tax system and potential improvements.

You can read more about the tax policy work programme in our Statement of Intent 2021-25.

[Statement of intent](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/statement-of-intent)

Partner in the Māori-Crown relationship
---------------------------------------

Inland Revenue is working to meet our Tiriti o Waitangi commitments as a government agency and partner in the Crown-Māori relationship. Under our Māhutonga approach, our Executive Leadership Team is developing training to help lift their Māori cultural capability. Later in 2021-22, we aim to roll out the Te Arapiki training programme - increasing our people’s capability in te reo Māori and tikanga Māori.

We will release Mauri Ora Te Whānau, which focuses on taking a whānau-centred approach to our work with Māori customers. Its priorities include growing our understanding of, and empathy for, the Māori world view and fostering active partnerships with whānau, hapū and iwi. We will be progressing delivery of whānau-focused services and including the voice of our Māori customers at all levels of Inland Revenue.

A Tax and Social Policy Māori Advisory Panel is being established as a pilot, with the aim of ensuring Inland Revenue's policy advice is informed by a range of Māori perspectives.

Collaborating to improve services for New Zealanders
----------------------------------------------------

In line with the aim of the Public Service Act 2020 for a public service that wraps services around New Zealanders’ needs, we‘ll respond to new opportunities to both lead and support our colleagues across government.

For example, in April 2021 we began a pilot in Ōtautahi Christchurch to improve the experience of families who have child support debt with us and a debt with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). We’re also piloting the provision of on-site support for MSD customers at its offices in Te Moana a Toi the Bay of Plenty.

Thin capitalisation rules for banks
===================================

2005 thin capitalisation rules apply to foreign-owned registered banks operating in NZ and determine the extent of interest deduction as part of calculating income.

**Sections FG 2, FG 3, FG 4, FG 8, FG 8B to FG 8J FH 1 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004**

New thin capitalisation rules apply to foreign-owned registered banks operating in New Zealand. The rules determine the extent to which interest is deductible to the New Zealand business of the foreign-owned bank as part of calculating its New Zealand income for tax purposes. Banks are denied interest deductions if they do not have sufficient equity for tax purposes to support their New Zealand business.

The rules compare the equity of the New Zealand banking business with a legislatively prescribed level of equity based on 4% of the bank's New Zealand risk-weighted exposures. If there is a deficiency in the New Zealand equity compared with the required equity, interest is denied on the shortfall.

### Application date

The thin capitalisation rules for banks apply from 1 July 2005.

### Background

The rules were introduced in response to government concerns that tax paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banking groups appeared insufficient relative to their accounting profits. Of particular concern was the level of debt held by these banking groups in New Zealand compared with their New Zealand-based assets. Two key issues were identified: the first related to the debt funding of a bank's outbound investment given that the income from this investment is generally not subject to full  
New Zealand taxation; and the second related to the extent of debt funding of some banks' New Zealand business.

Under the previous tax rules, foreign-owned banks were subject to the same thin capitalisation provisions as other foreign-owned companies controlled by a single non-resident. However, in practice these rules did not limit their interest deductions for tax purposes. This was primarily because of the on-lending concession in the general thin capitalisation rules.

The banking sector was consulted on the development of the thin capitalisation rules for banks.

### Key features

The amendments introducing the bank thin capitalisation rules are to both the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts, and section references are identical.

*   The new thin capitalisation rules apply to _registered banks_ that are controlled by a single non-resident (sections FG 2(1), FG 3, OB 1).
*   Where the rules apply to a registered bank, that bank must determine its _NZ banking group_ (section FG 8C).
*   The NZ banking group is required to calculate its _NZ net equity_ at least quarterly (sections FG 8E, FG 8G).
*   The NZ banking group must also calculate its _net equity threshold_ at least quarterly (sections FG 8E, FG 8H).
*   Where the NZ net equity of the NZ banking group is less than its net equity threshold, interest will be denied (section FG 8B).
*   The interest denial will be calculated using an interest rate based on average cost of funds (sections FG 3(2)(b), FG 8B).
*   The registered bank will be the _reporting bank_. The reporting bank must make an adjustment for any interest denial in its tax return (sections FG 3, FG 8D).
*   The calculations draw on the accounts prepared by banks for financial and regulatory reporting purposes (sections FG 8F, FG 8I).
*   Temporary changes to the amounts included in NZ net equity or net equity threshold as a result of an arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the new rules will not be taken into account for the purposes of the thin capitalisation calculations (section FG 8J).

### Detailed analysis

The rules apply to foreign-owned registered banks operating in New Zealand. A registered bank is defined in section OB 1 as having the same meaning as in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989.

A registered bank is subject to thin capitalisation rules if it has sufficient non-resident control as set out in section FG 2(1). Under the bank-specific thin capitalisation rules, a registered bank must determine its NZ banking group, calculate the NZ net equity of this group and compare that to the net equity threshold. If NZ net equity of the group is less than the net equity threshold, interest deductions will be denied.

#### Steps to apply the bank thin capitalisation rule

Step 1. Determine the New Zealand banking group.

Step 2. Calculate New Zealand net equity of the New Zealand banking group.

Step 3. Calculate net equity threshold of the New Zealand banking group.

Step 4. Compare New Zealand net equity and net threshold. Interest deductions will be denied if there is a deficiency in New Zealand net equity.

#### Step 1: NZ banking group

A foreign-owned registered bank which is subject to thin capitalisation rules is required to determine its NZ banking group under section FG 8C. This group includes all resident entities operating in New Zealand that would be required to consolidate with the ultimate foreign parent of the registered bank for financial reporting purposes. Fixed establishments (generally branches) operating in New Zealand are included in the consolidated accounts.

If the ultimate foreign parent does not include a New Zealand-resident entity or fixed establishment in its accounting consolidation because that entity or fixed establishment is not material in the context of its worldwide consolidation, that entity or fixed establishment will still be included in the NZ banking group.

Section FG 8C gives the bank the option to exclude its life insurance entities from its NZ banking group. Entities that are part of a life insurance entity's group can also be excluded from the NZ banking group, provided they do not have a main activity of banking, financing or leasing, and they are not holding companies of banking, financing or leasing companies. The excluded entities may include a non-resident person or company (with a fixed establishment in New Zealand) whose main activity is the provision of life insurance.

The election to exclude an entity from the NZ banking group is made at the time of filing the annual tax return. There is no specific form of election, nor a requirement to separately notify Inland Revenue. The act of excluding the entities from the banking calculation is the election. This election may be changed annually.

A taxpayer included in a NZ banking group will not be subject to the general interest apportionment rule in section FG 8 or the interest allocation rules in section FH 1. This is to ensure that there is no doubling up of adjustments resulting from insufficient levels of equity for tax purposes.

Companies that elect to be excluded from the banking group will continue to be subject to the general thin capitalisation rules in section FG 8 and interest allocation rules in section FH 1.

The reporting bank, defined in section FG 8D, is responsible for performing the NZ banking group's thin capitalisation calculation. This will be the registered bank in the group. If there are two or more registered banks in the NZ banking group, the banks must elect a reporting bank by notifying the Commissioner within six months after the end of the tax year. Where no notification is given the Commissioner will choose.

**Example: Entities included in the New Zealand banking group**

In the diagram below the New Zealand entities are all potential members of the NZ banking group. While the ultimate foreign parent is not part of the NZ banking group, it is shown in this diagram because the NZ banking group is determined with reference to the ultimate foreign parent of the registered bank. In this example, the NZ banking group must include the:

*   Ultimate foreign parent branch;
*   New Zealand holding company 1;
*   New Zealand holding company 2;
*   New Zealand registered bank company;
*   Bank subsidiary company; and
*   Leasing company.

New Zealand holding company 3, Life insurance company and Life insurance subsidiary can elect to be excluded. If so, they would not be part of the NZ banking group. The circled area represents the NZ banking group where an election to exclude the life entities has been made. The reporting bank will be the New Zealand-registered bank company

#### Step 2: NZ net equity

The NZ banking group must determine its NZ net equity at least quarterly. NZ net equity is defined in section FG8G. This calculation begins with aggregating the NZ banking group's shareholder and branch equity based on their financial accounts. The aggregation of this equity is done in accordance with accounting rules that apply to consolidations.

Certain subtractions are then made from this aggregated accounting equity. Some of these subtractions follow the prudential deductions required by the Reserve Bank's Capital Adequacy Framework. An example of a prudential deduction is goodwill. Another subtraction for the purposes of the NZ net equity calculation is certain offshore assets of the NZ banking group.

For the tax calculation of the NZ net equity of the NZ banking group there is an exception to the rule that requires the subtraction of goodwill. This concerns certain goodwill relating to non-banking business.

_Aggregated accounting equity (EQV)_

The starting point for NZ net equity of the NZ banking group is the aggregation of the accounting values of shareholders' equity and branch equity included in the financial statements of NZ banking group members. This aggregation is done based on accounting consolidation principles.

The consolidation of the NZ banking group may or may not actually be required for accounting purposes. If there is no requirement to consolidate the NZ banking group for financial reporting purposes, a "notional" accounting consolidation of the NZ banking group for the purposes of the tax rules is needed. This may, for instance, be based on an aggregation of consolidations of sibling groups. This means that where two or more sibling consolidated groups are aggregated, inter-group transactions must be eliminated.

Any amounts considered equity for tax purposes but not for accounting purposes are added to the aggregated accounting amount of shareholders' and branch equity. Equity for accounting purposes that is considered debt for tax purposes is subtracted, as referred to below. Interest-free loans to the NZ banking group from non-resident associates will generally also be included in NZ net equity.

Section FG 8F(1) sets out the criteria to determine accounting values of the relevant items. Generally there is a focus on external financial reports that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The aggregated accounting equity is referred to in the legislation as EQV.

_Subtractions from EQV_

Following the determination of the group's EQV certain subtractions are made from this amount. Sub-sections FG 8G(2) and (3) ensure that items cannot be subtracted from equity more than once.

The following is a summary of the required subtractions. Included in brackets after each item is the reference used in the legislation. The amounts subtracted are, in general, based on the amounts from accounts prepared for financial or regulatory reporting purposes.

*   **Intangible assets (INTG)**: All intangible assets except for:
    *   goodwill that relates to a business that is not banking, financing, leasing, or life insurance. The goodwill must have arisen from an acquisition by the NZ banking group member from a person who is not associated with any NZ banking group member;
    *   films or film rights;
    *   property that is depreciable property for income tax purposes or is expected to become depreciable property.
*   **Capital gain amounts (CGA)**: Capital gain amounts, as defined for income tax purposes, where those gains are made in the 2004-05 and subsequent years as a result of transfers of intangible assets to associated persons outside of the NZ banking group.
*   **Asset revaluation reserves (REV)**
*   **Future tax benefits (TXB)**: Net future tax benefits if they arise from tax losses or from timing or temporary differences that would result in tax losses, if the item that gave rise to the timing or temporary difference would have been deductible in the current year.
*   **Certain prudential deductions (CEFA and NAFA)**: These prudential deductions are defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Capital Adequacy Framework and relate to certain credit enhancements provided by a NZ banking group member, and certain loans made by a NZ banking group member to a connected person who is not a part of the NZ banking group.
*   **Fixed rate shares (FRS)**: Fixed-rate shares, as defined in section LF 2(3), where they are issued by members of the NZ banking group to New Zealand residents. The reason for this subtraction is because fixed rate shares are economically similar to debt in several respects, and they may be used flexibly as a substitute for it. The subtraction from NZ net equity applies to fixed rate shares that have been offered to the public on or after 1 January 2005. Fixed rate shares that have been offered to the public before  
    1 January 2005 are not required to be subtracted from NZ net equity until after 1 January 2010.
*   **Debt for tax purposes (EID)**: This refers to amounts included in EQV which are considered equity for accounting purposes but which give rise to a deduction for tax purposes.
*   **Policyholder liabilities (UPB)**: This applies only to life insurers that are included in the NZ banking group. Where unvested policyholder liabilities have been included as equity for financial reporting purposes, they are not included in EQV under the thin capitalisation rules.
*   **Cross holdings (AEQ and AEQI)**: Cross holdings between members of the NZ banking group and any life insurance entities that have elected to be excluded from the group.
*   **Offshore assets (EOI)**:
    *   Shares in non-resident companies that are held by members of the NZ banking group, or are held by life insurance entities that have elected to be excluded from the group.
    *   Shares in a resident company in circumstances where:
        1.  the NZ banking group member or potential member holds a direct voting interest of 10% or more in that resident company; and
            
        2.  the NZ banking group member or potential member receives a dividend from the resident company that has conduit relief attached to it in the current income year. This ensures that the thin capitalisation rules cannot be avoided by placing shares in offshore companies in a NZ-resident company which is outside the NZ banking group. This will apply only when a NZ banking group member receives the flowed through conduit relief with the dividend from the NZ resident company.

> The following offshore assets are not subtracted from EQV

*   *   interests in foreign investment funds where the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods are used;
    *   shares in companies in grey list countries which are listed on a recognised exchange, and are held on revenue account, and would not be "sufficient interest" if the class of shares were the only class of share issued by the offshore company. Sufficient interest is defined in section LF 1(2) and is, in general, an interest of 10% or greater.

**Example: Offshore assets subtracted from EQV**

In Diagram A, a member of a NZ banking group holds five shareholdings in overseas companies. In Diagram B, the five shareholdings are held by a resident company in which a member holds a direct voting interest of 10% or more and where conduit tax relief is attached to a dividend paid to the member in that year.

![Side by side diagrams A and B showing an example of offshore assets subtracted from EQV, as explained in the notes accompanying the image.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/4/44e528004ba3777ea3cdbf9ef8e4b077/offshore-assets-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214552&hash=58AF790459CA255EB20C24364491B698 "Side by side diagrams A and B showing an example of offshore assets subtracted from EQV, as explained in the notes accompanying the image.")

In both diagrams, shareholdings 1 to 5 fall under EOI because they are offshore shareholdings. At first glance, they would be subtracted from the NZ net equity of the NZ banking group. However, Shareholding 2 represents an interest in a foreign investment fund where the comparative value or deemed rate of return method is used. Shareholding 5 represents an interest in a company which operates in a grey list country, is listed on a recognised exchange, is held on revenue account, and would not be a "sufficient interest" if the class of shares were the only class of share issued by the offshore company. This means that Shareholdings 2 and 5 fall under the exceptions to EOI and are included in the NZ net equity of the NZ banking group.

*   **Notional offshore investment amount (NOIA)**:  
    A notional offshore investment amount is subtracted from EQV. Foreign tax credits claimed by the NZ banking group against their income tax liability are used as a basis to calculate this amount. The notional amount effectively represents the offshore investment that the group would have made to generate the foreign tax credits it received.  
    The NZ banking group can claim up to $5 million of foreign tax credits before it is required to calculate a notional offshore investment amount. This minimum threshold allows for a reasonable level of debt funded offshore investment that would not be subject to the thin capitalisation banking rules, while capturing significant offshore lending that does not result in tax payable in New Zealand.  
      
    The notional offshore investment amount is calculated according to a formula which essentially "grosses up" foreign tax credits in excess of the minimum threshold.

**Example: Notional offshore investment amount calculation**

This calculation of a notional offshore investment amount is based on foreign tax credits of $5,033,000.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Foreign tax credits | $5,033,000 |
| Less minimum allowance | $5,000.000 |
| Excess foreign tax credits | $33,000 |
| Gross up 33% | $100,000 |
| Gross up at interest rate(deemed return rate) to calculate offshore investment | 7%  |
| Notional offshore investment amount | $1,428,571 |

Transitional rules cover foreign tax credits on income after 1 July 2005 to take account of a part year situation. Correspondingly, the minimum threshold applying to foreign tax credits is pro rated for the first year the rules apply.

  
**Regulation-making power**

In situations where it is unclear whether an instrument is debt or equity for the purposes of the NZ net equity calculation, a regulation can be made by Order in Council that clarifies its treatment for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. This uncertainty may arise where a new instrument has some debt characteristics and some equity characteristics, such as where the legal form of an instrument is equity but has some economic characteristics normally associated with debt.

Clarification of the status of the instrument should take into account:

*   the underlying policy reflected in the legislation; and
*   accounting and regulatory concepts of equity.

In a situation where there is uncertainty about whether an instrument is debt or equity for the purposes of NZ net equity, the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue should be contacted. Correspondence should be addressed to:

> The Deputy Commissioner  
> Policy Advice Division  
> Inland Revenue  
> PO Box 2198  
> Wellington  
> New Zealand

Where possible, there will be consultation following the generic tax policy process prior to the introduction of any Order in Council.

#### Step 3: Net equity threshold

Section FG 8H measures the net equity threshold of the NZ banking group in order to compare it to the groups NZ net equity calculated in step 2. The net equity threshold is based on 4% of the NZ banking group's aggregate risk-weighted exposures (RWE).

RWE is a regulatory concept and includes the regulatory values of on and off-balance sheet assets of the NZ banking group adjusted for risk. Under section FG 8F(2), regulatory values are determined by applying the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Capital Adequacy Framework, which sets out the methodology and rates for risk-weighting assets.

The calculation of the total of RWE is reduced by the value of assets (in aggregate referred to as DEQ in the legislation) that are subtracted from shareholder and branch equity for the purposes of determining NZ net equity. The subtraction from RWE uses regulatory values of the relevant assets. The notional offshore investment amount is not deducted from RWE. Because the amount is notional there is no corresponding separately identifiable asset to include in DEQ.

Resident entities and fixed establishments that are members of the NZ banking group that do not currently risk-weight their assets for banking regulation purposes will need to carry out this risk-weighting exercise for the new thin capitalisation calculation.

#### Step 4: Compare NZ net equity and net equity threshold

Section FG 3 requires a reporting bank to calculate its annual total deductions based on the calculation in section FG 8B. Reporting bank is defined in section FG 8D. Under section FG 8B if, for any quarter (or more frequent measurement date that the bank chooses), NZ net equity is less than the net equity threshold based on 4% of RWE, there will need to be an adjustment to the reporting bank's annual total deductions for that measurement period. These adjustments for any measurement period must be included in the reporting bank's tax return for the income year in which the adjustments arise.

**Interest denial calculation**

The adjustment required under section FG 8B, uses an interest rate generally based on average cost of funds. The average cost of funds interest rate is based on the total interest expense of the NZ banking group divided by average quarterly interest-bearing debt for the group over the income year.

The interest expense and total debt amounts are based on financial reporting amounts after aggregation using consolidation principles and, therefore, elimination of intra-group and inter-group transactions. Adjustments are made to exclude equity funding where the amounts count as interest for financial reporting purposes but not for tax purposes, and debt funding where the amounts do not count as interest for financial reporting purposes but is interest for tax purposes. The accounting policies of the group must be consistent with those of the reporting bank.

#### Measurement periods for NZ net equity and net equity threshold

The reporting bank is required to measure the NZ banking group's NZ net equity and net equity threshold at least four times a year. These four measurement dates align with the reporting bank's quarterly reports to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The NZ banking group is  
determined at each measurement date.

If a bank is purchased by another bank, separate calculations must be made for any measurement periods before the acquisition, and then a joint calculation will be made for measurement periods after acquisition. Each bank will return its respective calculation pre-takeover. The joint calculation is made and returned by the bank designated to be the reporting bank for that latter period.

The reporting bank has the option, under section FG 8E, to measure the NZ net equity of the NZ banking group and net equity threshold on a daily or monthly basis, rather than on the standard quarterly basis.

Section FG 8J is an anti-avoidance rule targeting temporary changes in equity, assets or RWE where these results have the effect of defeating the intent and application of these rules (see example over the page).

#### Consequential amendments

A number of consequential amendments have been made. Subsection FG 2(7) has been omitted because its contents were incorporated in amendments to subsection FG 2(1). A series of amendments have been made to sections FG 3, FG 4 and FG 8 to ensure that the bank thin capitalisation rules do not overlap with the general thin capitalisation rules.

Section FH 1 excludes members of the NZ banking group from the subpart FH interest allocation rule as the bank thin capitalisation rules incorporate appropriate interest allocation concepts.

Section FG 8I provides that various values are determined in New Zealand currency and using the appropriate close of trading spot exchange rate.

A number of definitions have been added to section OB 1

#### Transitional arrangements

Transitional rules are available for the first income year, to take account of part-year application of the new rules for some banks. Transitional rules also apply when a foreign-owned company registers as a bank in New Zealand and when a company ceases to operate as a registered bank in New Zealand.

The bank thin capitalisation rules apply from 1 July 2005. For banks with a September financial year this means that the rules have application for part of their 2004-05 income year, specifically in the last quarter of this year. This has implications, in particular, for the notional offshore investment amount calculation.

In the case of part-year application for the 2004-05 income year, the rules allow for the notional offshore investment amount to be based on foreign tax credits that have been claimed against income tax for the part year. The transitional rule in section FG 8G(3) allows for a calculation based only on the credits attributable to the part of the income year in which the new rules apply. The minimum threshold of $5 million has also been adjusted accordingly.

Where there is a change in the bank treated as the reporting bank, a transitional rule also requires calculations to be made for all measurement periods since the last measurement period included by the former reporting bank in its previous income tax return. This is required when the two banks have different balance dates, which would otherwise cause a gap or an overlap.

#### Example: Calculations of NZ net equity, net equity threshold and resulting interest denial

Notwithstanding banks are likely to perform this calculation quarterly, and are required to do so at least quarterly, the following calculation for simplicity reasons shows the calculation inclusive of adjustments such as NOIA that are performed, in general, on an annual basis. Likewise any interest denial is determined using an annual interest rate which is then applied to any quarterly shortfalls. The references to steps in the example are to the steps described above.

Thin capitalisation rules
=========================

2014 changes to the thin capitalisation rules mean the rules will now apply when non-residents who appear to be acting together own 50 percent or more of a company.

#### _Sections GB 51, FE 1 to 4, 14, 16, 18, 25, 27 and 31 D, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Changes have been made to five aspects of the thin capitalisation rules to help strengthen the rules and better protect New Zealand's tax base. The most significant change is that the rules will now apply when non-residents who appear to be acting together own 50 percent or more of a company. Non-residents will be treated as acting together if they hold debt in a company in proportion to their equity, have entered into an arrangement setting out how to fund the company with related-party debt, or act on the instructions of another person (such as a private equity manager) in funding the company with related-party debt.

The rules will now also apply to all trusts that have been majority settled by non-residents, as well as all companies controlled by the trustees of such trusts.

Amendments have also been made to the "110 percent worldwide debt test". This test, in essence, compares the amount of debt in a company's worldwide operations to the debt in the company's New Zealand operations. Debt that originates from shareholders will be excluded when calculating the debt level of a company's worldwide operations.

Increases in asset values following internal company reorganisations will be ignored, unless the increase in asset value would be allowed under generally accepted accounting principles in the absence of the reorganisation, or if the reorganisation is part of the purchase of the company by a third party.

A technical amendment has also been made to ensure that, in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, individuals and trustees will generally be required to exclude their indirect interests in offshore companies if the interest is held through a company they are associated with.

### Background

The thin capitalisation rules form part of New Zealand's international tax rules and are designed to protect our tax base. The rules place limits on how much debt a non-resident can put into their New Zealand investments. This is important as the use of debt is one method that non-residents can use to take profits out of New Zealand, lowering the amount of tax they would otherwise pay.

While the thin capitalisation rules have generally been operating effectively, Inland Revenue became aware of some situations where the rules could usefully be strengthened. The changes made in this Act provide that strengthening.

These changes follow an officials' issues paper, _Review of the thin capitalisation rules_, released in January 2013. At a high level, the changes largely follow what was originally proposed in the issues paper, although it was decided not to proceed with one of the proposed changes (excluding capitalised interest from a company's asset base). Technical and minor policy changes have also been made in response to submitters' concerns raised during three rounds of consultation (the initial issues paper, a subsequent technical paper, _Thin capitalisation review: technical issues_, and Parliament's Select Committee process).

### Key features

*   The inbound thin capitalisation rules will apply when non-residents (or entities subject to the rules) act together when investing in New Zealand. (The previous rules applied only when a single non-resident controlled the investment.)
*   Debt linked to shareholders of group entities or their associates will be excluded from the worldwide group debt test used in the inbound rules.
*   The inbound thin capitalisation rules will apply to all resident trustees if 50 percent or more of settlements made on the trust were made by a non-resident, or a group of non-residents and/or other entities subject to the rules who are acting in concert.
*   The on-lending concession will be extended to cover financial arrangements held by a trust provided certain criteria are met.
*   Increases in asset values will be ignored if they are the result of transactions between associated persons, unless the increase would be allowed by accounting standards in the absence of a transaction.
*   In the outbound thin capitalisation rules, individuals or trustees will be required to exclude their indirect interests in offshore companies if their interest is held through a company they are associated with.

### Application date

The amendments apply from the 2015–16 income year.

Detailed analysis
-----------------

### Companies controlled by shareholders acting together

The thin capitalisation rules apply to companies controlled by shareholders who have the ability to substitute equity with debt. This is clearly evident when a company is controlled by a single non-resident - the controlling non-resident has little constraint on how it can fund the company, and so is free to invest through debt rather than equity. However, the ability to substitute equity with debt is also available to non-residents who are acting together. They are able to coordinate their activities and act in much the same way as a single non-resident.

The rules have been amended so they also apply to companies controlled by a group of shareholders who appear to be acting together. Section FE 2 provides that the thin capitalisation rules apply if a _non-resident owning body_ holds 50 percent or more of a company's ownership interests, or has control of a company by any other means.

As a consequence, section FE 1 has been amended to reflect the broader application of the rules.

#### _Non-resident owning body_

In short, a non-resident owning body is a group of non-residents or entities described in sections FE 2(1)(cc) to (db) (such as trusts settled by non-residents) that have one or more characteristics indicating they are acting together to debt-fund a New Zealand company. These characteristics are having:

*   proportionate levels of debt and equity among the group;
*   an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded with _member-linked funding_ if the company is not _widely held_ (a term defined in section YA 1);
*   _member-linked debt_ in the company in a way recommend by a person (such as a private equity manager), or implemented by a person on behalf of the members.

Arrangements on how to fund the company are only counted as a characteristic of acting together if the arrangement applies to the current income year. That is, shareholders who have agreed how to fund an entity in the event of a specified event that is yet to occur (such as insolvency) are not a _non-resident owning body_ by virtue of that agreement.

#### _The proportionality rule_

Proportionality is a characteristic of acting together as it generally requires a degree of coordination to achieve. More generally, proportionality is also a situation where shareholders are able to substitute debt for equity. This is because, where there is proportionality, the level of debt in a company does not change shareholders' exposure to the risk of holding equity in the company or shareholders' overall return. As debt levels increase, the makeup of the return will change (ie, fewer dividends and higher interest payments) but the sum of interest and dividends will be unchanged.

The new proportionality rule will capture both direct and indirect proportionality, including debt or equity that is routed through a trust (_a linked trustee_, explained below).

Subsection FE 4(a)(i) provides that the rule will apply if the company ultimately owes money to each member of the group and, for each member, the member's debt as a fraction of the total debt the company owes to all members (the _member debt_) is the same as the member's direct or indirect interests in the company as a fraction of direct or indirect ownership interests held by all members in the company.

Subsection FE 4(a)(ii) provides that the rule also applies in relation to a member if the criteria of subsection FE 4(a)(i) would be met if the debt and equity held by the member's _linked trustees_, and the debt held by the member's subsidiaries, were held directly by the member.

A _linked trustee_ is a trust that a person has provided money to, whether through settlement or some other arrangement (such as a financial arrangement). This is to ensure a non-resident cannot avoid being included in a _non-resident owning body_ by holding shares or debt in a New Zealand company through a trust.

Note that as per subsection (2) of the definition of _non-resident owning body_, each type of ownership interest is to be considered in the proportionality rule.[1](#01)

#### _Anti-avoidance provision_

New section GB 51 provides that arrangements are void if they have the effect of defeating the intent of the proportionality rule (to capture groups of non-residents and entities described in section FE 2(1)(cc) to (db) who, in economic substance, have proportionate levels of debt and equity). An example of this type of arrangement would be using a back-to-back loan to make it appear as if there is no proportionality.

#### _Member-linked debt_

The other two characteristics of acting together described above only apply to _member-linked debt_. This is debt that where the member:

*   is a party to the financial arrangement;
*   guarantees or provides security for the arrangement (if the worldwide group is provided by sections FE 3(e) or FE 31D - this is described more in more detail in the section _Worldwide group debt test_); or
*   has entered into a back-to-back arrangement with the person who has provided the funds to the company.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Resident company NZ Co has four non-resident shareholders: Hold Co, 2, 3 and 4. Shareholder 1 owns 100 percent of Hold Co and is therefore an indirect owner of NZ Co.<br><br>Shareholders 1 and 3 have lent money to NZ Co ($33.33 and $16.67, respectively). Shareholder 2 has lent $50 to Trustee, who has on-lent that money to NZ Co. As shareholder 2 has provided money to Trustee, it is a _linked trustee_.<br><br>NZ Co has also borrowed $100 from a New Zealand bank. The bank is not associated with any of NZ Co's shareholders.<br><br>![Diagram showing companies controlled by shareholders acting together](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/0/202f66dc-c3b8-40ad-918e-ea9f4b6af215/new-leg-aug14-image1a.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214340&hash=5C719069FFA98525866A9990BD726008 "Diagram showing companies controlled by shareholders acting together")<br><br>Shareholders 1 (together with its associate Hold Co), 2 and 3 will be members of a non-resident owning body. NZ Co's total member debt is $100 ($33.33 + $50 + $16.67) and the total equity in NZ Co held by the members is 60 percent (20 percent + 30 percent + 10 percent). This means:<br><br>*   Shareholder 1 holds 33.33 percent of the total member debt and 33.33 percent of the total member equity (through its shareholder in Hold Co);<br>*   Shareholder 2 holds 50 percent of the total member debt (through its linked trustee) and 50 percent of the total member equity; and<br>*   Shareholder 3 holds 16.67 percent of the total member debt and 16.67 percent of the total member equity.<br><br>Each shareholder's share of total member debt is equal to their share of total member equity. They therefore have proportionate levels of debt and equity (ratio of 1:0.6 debt to equity).<br><br>The thin capitalisation rules will therefore apply to NZ Co as 60 percent of its shares are held by a non-resident owning body. |     |

#### _Aggregation of ownership interests_

New section FE 2(1)(cb) provides that the total ownership interests of a non-resident owning body should be determined as if the members were associated persons. The purposes of this is that, as per section FE 41, the ownership interests of the owning body will be calculated by aggregating the ownership interests of the body's members, except to the extent the aggregation would result in double counting.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Resident company A Co has five non-resident shareholders: Mr W (married to Mrs W), Mrs W, Mr X, Mr Y and Mr Z. Each holds 20 percent of the issued shares. They all have agreed to lend some of their own money to the company, and therefore form a non-resident owning body.<br><br>Mr W's ownership interest in A Co is 40 percent (as his interests are aggregated with Mrs W under section FE 41). Mrs W's ownership interest is similarly 40 percent. The other shareholders (who are not associated with each other or Mr and Mrs W) have an ownership of 20 percent each.<br><br>The ownership interests are added together, but with 40 percent removed to correct for double counting of Mr and Mrs W's interests.<br><br>The non-resident owning body made up of Mr W, Mrs W, Mr X, Mr Y and Mr Z therefore has 100 percent of the ownership interests in A Co. |     |

#### _New Zealand groups_

Under the new rules, the New Zealand group of a company controlled by a non-resident owning group will be determined much in the same way as a company controlled by a single non-resident.

As with companies controlled by a single non-resident, new section FE 26(2)(bb) will provide the general rule that a New Zealand company is a New Zealand parent company if a non-resident owning body has direct ownership interests of 50 percent or more in the company.

There is an exception to this if one or more of the members operates a branch in New Zealand or has New Zealand-sourced income (other than non-resident passive income). In that case the non-resident owning body itself is the New Zealand parent. This matches the treatment of companies owned by a single non-resident where that non-resident operates a branch or has New Zealand-sourced income (other than non-resident passive income).

A similar amendment has been made to section FE 26(3)(d), which defines the parent of an excess debt entity as the company where the non-resident owning body directly holds 50 percent or more of its ownership interests. Again, there is an exception when one or more members of the non-resident owning body operates a branch in New Zealand or has New Zealand-sourced income (other than non-resident passive income). In this case the parent will be the non-resident owning body.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Non-residents X Co, Y Co and Z Co (who are not associated persons) each own 33 percent of resident company A Co and have proportionate debt and equity. They therefore will form a non-resident owning body.<br><br>A Co has three resident subsidiaries.<br><br>The New Zealand parent for A Co is determined under section FE 26(2)(bb) (a non-resident owning body has direct ownership interests in A Co of 50 percent or more). A Co is therefore the New Zealand parent. A Co's subsidiaries will determine their New Zealand parent (A Co) under section FE 26(3)(d)(ii).<br><br>A Co's New Zealand group will therefore comprise A Co and its three subsidiaries. |     |

#### _Special grouping rule: investments via holding companies_

A special rule will apply if some members of a non-resident owning body invest into New Zealand through a holding company. The grouping rules described above will not be able to identify a New Zealand parent for the top-level operating company in New Zealand (Z Co in the example below).[2](#02)

Accordingly, section FE 26(6) will deem the top-level operating company as the New Zealand parent. A company controlled by the top-level operating company will identify the operating company as its parent under section FE 26(3). Each holding company will also have a New Zealand group that is just the company.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Non-resident Co 1 owns 100 percent of Hold Co 1 and Non-resident Co 2 owns 100 percent of Hold Co 2. Hold Co 1 and Hold Co 2 are therefore subject to the thin capitalisation rules under section FE 2(1)(c).<br><br>The non-residents meet the criteria for being a non-resident owning body. Z Co is therefore also subject to the thin capitalisation rules under section FE 2(1)(cb).<br><br>![Diagram showing how the special grouping rule works](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/8/288a419a-5120-49e2-8b85-73d55eb0f768/new-leg-aug14-image2.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214342&hash=E2D332A282D6B322FE0308505A24CFE5 "Diagram showing how the special grouping rule works")<br><br>Hold Co 1's New Zealand group is Hold Co 1 (as Hold Co does not hold 50 percent or more of Z Co's ownership interests it does not include it in its group under section FE 26). Hold Co 2's New Zealand group is similarly just Hold Co 2.<br><br>Z Co's New Zealand group cannot be determined under section FE 26 other than under subsection (6). Z Co is therefore deemed to be its New Zealand parent. Z Co Sub will identify Z Co as its parent under FE 26(3)(d)(ii). Z Co's New Zealand group will therefore be Z Co and Z Co Sub. |     |

#### _New grouping rules only apply if existing rules do not_

These new grouping rules will only apply if the thin capitalisation rules as they currently stand do not apply - that is, to a company not controlled directly or indirectly by a single non-resident.[3](#03)
 This means the New Zealand parent of a company controlled by a single non-resident will be unaffected by the changes, even if the company is also controlled by a non-resident owning body. Its New Zealand group will, by extension, also be unaffected.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Non-resident companies Z, X and Y own 51, 25 and 24 percent, respectively, of New Zealand-resident company A Co. Companies Z, X and Y have funded A Co with related-party debt as instructed by a private equity manager. Companies Z, X and Y therefore form a non-resident owning body.<br><br>A Co has three resident subsidiaries. Company Z also owns 100 percent of an Australian company.<br><br>Under the current thin capitalisation rules, the New Zealand group of A Co comprises A Co and its three New Zealand subsidiaries. The worldwide group is the New Zealand group, Company Z and the Australian company.<br><br>There will be no change to the New Zealand or worldwide group of A Co as a single non-resident (Company Z) owns 51 percent of its shares - even though a non-resident owning body also holds 50 percent or more of A Co's shares. |     |

#### _Worldwide groups_

New section FE 31D provides that the worldwide group of a company controlled by a non-resident owning body is just its New Zealand group, unless a single non-resident also controls the company. This is because it is not possible to construct a meaningful worldwide group when a company is not controlled by a single person.

### Rules to ensure matching New Zealand groups

Under the thin capitalisation rules it is important that New Zealand groups of different entities match. That is, if Company A includes Company B in its New Zealand group, then Company B should include Company A in its group. It is also important that an entity cannot be included in multiple groups. This is to prevent the double-counting of the entity's debt and assets.

Section FE 3(d) excludes a company from a trust's group if the company does not include the trust in its own group (that is, the trust is not found to be the company's New Zealand parent under section FE 26(4D)). This ensures the two groups are identical.

A separate rule in section FE 14(3B) ensures that an entity cannot include its debt and assets in more than one New Zealand and worldwide group. This might arise, for example, if it were possible to argue there are multiple different _non-resident owning bodies_ that hold 50 percent or more of the ownership interests in a company.

An ordering rule applies in some cases when determining the group an entity's debt and assets should be included in. If the entity is a company that is controlled indirectly or directly by a single non-resident, it must include its debt and assets in the New Zealand group of the single non-resident. Otherwise there is no rule for determining the group the debt and assets should be included in.

### Worldwide group debt test

Whether there is any interest denial under the thin capitalisation rules depends on the result of two tests. One of these tests is known as the "worldwide group debt test" and is designed to ensure that the amount of debt in a New Zealand company is proportionate to the amount of genuine external debt of the ultimate non-resident parent of that New Zealand company.

In some circumstances, however, the debt of the ultimate parent company may also include debt from the parent's shareholders or other owners of the group. In such cases the debt level of the worldwide group does not reflect the level of genuine external debt.

To address this, new section FE 18(3B) provides that, when an excess debt entity (other than an outbound excess debt entity)[4](#04)
 is calculating its worldwide group debt percentage, it must generally exclude debt that is linked to an owner of the worldwide group. There are a few carve-outs to this rule; these are described below.

An "owner" will be a person who has an ownership interest in a member of the group or is a settlor of a trust that is a member of the group.

A financial arrangement will be treated as linked to an owner of the group if the owner, or an associate of the owner (excluding associates who are members of the group):

*   is a party to the financial arrangement (for example, by a loan directly from the owner);
*   has guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the financial agreement _and_ the entity's worldwide group is deemed to be the same as its New Zealand group under sections FE 3(e) or FE 31D (discussed below); and
*   has provided funds or will provide funds, directly or indirectly, to another person who is providing funds under the financial arrangement (such as a back-to-back loan).

#### _Worldwide group is the same as New Zealand group_

When a company is owned by a group of non-residents who meet the definition of a "non-resident owning body" (or by trusts subject to the thin capitalisation rules) there is no true worldwide debt test that can be used to ensure the owners have allocated a fair amount of their worldwide debt to New Zealand. It is therefore important that shareholder-guaranteed loans are counted as "owner-linked". The presence of a shareholder guarantee suggests the New Zealand entity would not be able to commercially support the loan in the absence of the guarantee. This provides an indication that debt that should be allocated elsewhere in the world has been put in New Zealand - since the loan is implicitly being supported by assets outside of New Zealand.

The issue of shareholder-guaranteed debt is less significant in the case of a company controlled by a single non-resident. While shareholder guarantees could nonetheless be used to excessively gear the worldwide group, this concern must be tempered with the fact that the worldwide group debt test can act to ensure that only a reasonable amount of the worldwide group's debt is allocated to New Zealand. Moreover, a New Zealand company may struggle to get information about guarantees provided by shareholders of the ultimate parent company.

On this basis, section FE 18(3B)(b)(ii) applies only in relation to entities with a worldwide group deemed to be the same as their New Zealand group under sections FE 3(d) or FE 31D.

#### _Carve-out for public debt and minor shareholders_

New section FE 18(3B) also includes a carve-out for minor shareholders and publicly traded debt. An owner's financial arrangement will not be excluded from the worldwide group debt test if:

*   the owner has a 5 percent or less _direct_ ownership interest in the group; or
*   the financial arrangement held by the owner is traded on a _recognised exchange_ (if the definition of recognised exchange in section YA 1 was read to include a reference to an exchange for trading financial arrangements).

These carve-outs are designed to reduce compliance. It would be difficult to manipulate a company's debt financing through publicly traded debt where the debt is widely traded. Excluding such debt reduces compliance costs. Limiting the rule to shareholders with a direct ownership interest of 5 percent or more limits the number of shareholders that a company needs to investigate to determine if they hold owner-linked debt.

The 5 percent ownership threshold does not refer to indirect interests or interests held by associates. This is intentional. Otherwise the exemption's purpose as a compliance reduction measure would be defeated. However, it is not intended to provide an opportunity for a non-resident with a significant interest in a company to avoid the application of the owner-linked debt rules by spreading their interests across numerous associated entities.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Three shareholders collectively own New Zealand company NZ Co. As NZ Co is controlled by a non-resident owning body, its worldwide group is the same as its New Zealand group.<br><br>![Diagram showing 3 shareholders who collectively own a New Zealand company](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/7/f71e4dd1-9924-4bb4-9f22-809c543bc0c1/new-leg-aug14-image3.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214341&hash=AE254B668BCAB87F1467E89526A12101 "Diagram showing 3 shareholders who collectively own a New Zealand company")<br><br>The three non-resident shareholders will be treated as "owners" of NZ Co as they each have an ownership interest in NZ Co and are outside of its worldwide group. Any debt they extend to NZ Co will not be treated as debt in NZ Co's worldwide group debt test.<br><br>"Bank", however, will not be treated as an "owner" of NZ Co as it has no ownership interest in NZ Co and is not associated with any of the shareholders. A loan from Bank will therefore be included as debt in NZ Co's worldwide group debt test.<br><br>#### _Effect of shareholders lending to NZ Co_<br><br>The three shareholders decide to lend a total of $500,000 to NZ Co. NZ Co has $800,000 of assets.<br><br>The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co's New Zealand group is ($500,000 ÷ $800,000) = 62.5 percent.<br><br>The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co's worldwide group is ($0 ÷ $800,000) = 0 percent (as the debt from the owners is excluded).<br><br>The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co's New Zealand group exceeds both the 60 percent safe harbour and worldwide group debt test. NZ Co will therefore have income under section CH 9 to cancel out some of its interest deductions.<br><br>#### _Effect of Bank lending to NZ Co_<br><br>Instead of borrowing from its shareholders, NZ Co borrows the $500,000 from Bank. Again, NZ Co has $800,000 of assets.<br><br>The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co's New Zealand group is ($500,000 ÷ $800,000) = 62.5 percent.<br><br>The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co's worldwide group is ($500,000 ÷ $800,000) = 62.5 percent.<br><br>While the debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co's New Zealand group exceeds the 60 percent safe harbour, it does not exceed the worldwide group debt test. The debt percentage of the New Zealand group is less than 110 percent of the debt percentage of the worldwide group. NZ Co will not have any income under section CH 9. |     |

### Extending the thin capitalisation rules to more trusts

Amendments to section FE 2(1)(d) extend the thin capitalisation rules to all types of trusts for tax purposes (complying trusts, non-complying trusts and foreign trusts). The new rules mean a trust is subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the majority of settlements on it come from non-residents or from persons who are subject to the thin capitalisation rules.

A trust will be subject to the rules if 50 percent or more of the settlements are made by:

*   a non-resident or a person associated with the non-resident;[5](#05)
    
*   an entity subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules (that is, an entity to which section FE 2(a) to (cc) and (db) applies); or
*   a group of non-residents or entities subject to the thin capitalisation rules that act in concert.

As with companies, the thin capitalisation rules apply to trusts settled by entities acting in concert. This is important to ensure the rules cannot be easily circumvented through the use of trusts. However, the rules for determining when a group of entities appear to be acting together used for companies (described in the section _non-resident owning body_) cannot be used for trusts. Instead, the rules apply to a trust settled by a group "acting in concert". This is because, for example, it is not sensible to refer to settlements made in proportion to debt extended to a trust because rights to income from a trust generally do not depend on the amount a person has settled on it.

New section FE 2(1)(db) also provides that a trust is subject to the thin capitalisation rules if a person subject to the thin capitalisation rules has the power to appoint or remove a trustee. This is designed as an anti-circumvention measure. It means trusts are subject to the rules if they have been settled by a New Zealand resident and then effective control of the trust is transferred to a non-resident by giving the non-resident power to appoint or remove the trustee.

There is a carve-out from this rule if a person has the power to add or remove a trustee for the purpose of protecting a security interest. This type of security interest is commonly held by banks that have lent to a trust.

Section FE 2(1)(d) and (db) provides that settlements made by the trustee and powers of removal or appointment of the trustee must be ignored when applying the sections. This is to prevent circularity if two trusts make settlements on each other or each has the ability to appoint the other's trustee.

To illustrate, say settlements on Trust A are made by a non-resident and Trust B. Settlements made on Trust B are made by Trust A. It is only possible to determine whether Trust B is subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the settlement it has made on Trust A is ignored. Ignoring the settlement means the sole settlor of Trust A is a non-resident. Trust B is therefore subject to the thin capitalisation rules as it has been settled by a trust that is itself subject to the rules. Once Trust B's status is determined, it is possible to determine that Trust A should also be subject to the rules as it has also been settled by entities that are subject to the rules (a non-resident and Trust B).

#### _Grouping rules for trusts_

Amendments to section FE 3 define the New Zealand group of a trust as the trust and all companies controlled by the trust. Whether a trust controls a company is determined under section FE 27, based on the trust's choice of control threshold under that section.

Similarly, the New Zealand group of a company that is controlled by a trust will be the trust and all other companies controlled by the trust. This is provided by new section FE 26(4D), which defines the New Zealand parent of a company controlled by a trust to be the trust. The other members of the New Zealand group will then be determined under section FE 28.

As with companies controlled by non-resident owning bodies, the worldwide group of a trust will be the same as its New Zealand group. This is provided by section FE 3(1)(d).

### Extension of on-lending concession for trusts

Currently, section FE 13 provides what is commonly referred to as the "on-lending concession". It removes financial arrangements that provide funds to a person from the ambit of the thin capitalisation rules.

Proposed amendments to section FE 13 mean that, for a trust that holds only financial arrangements and property incidental to those financial arrangements, the on-lending concession will apply regardless of whether the arrangement provides funds.

This amendment is designed for securitisation vehicles that hold only financial arrangements which will become subject to the rules because of the changes relating to trusts described above. This carve-out is on the basis that the on-lending concession would apply to most of the trust's debt in any event.

### Exclusion of asset uplift

New sections FE 16(1D) and (1E) provide that increases in a company's New Zealand group assets that arise from the sale or other transfer of assets between a member of the group and a person associated with the group must be ignored. This may or may not be another member of the group.

This change applies only in relation to transfers that occur in or after the 2015–16 income year.

The purpose of this change is to ensure that increases in asset values that are not recognised under generally accepted accounting practice in the consolidated worldwide accounts of a company cannot be recognised in the asset values of the company's New Zealand group.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Parent Co owns two New Zealand subsidiaries, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2.<br><br>![Diagram showing the exclusion of asset uplift](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/b/4/b4813640-6d29-4d53-9521-d06723a63267/new-leg-aug14-image4.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214341&hash=E5047C7E9CD53E35F01C8D1BC2A1F565 "Diagram showing the exclusion of asset uplift")<br><br>NZ Co 1 purchases the shares in NZ Co 2 from Parent Co. NZ Co 1 will not be able to include any increase in asset values resulting from this purchase for thin capitalisation purposes unless that increase would have been allowed under generally accepted accounting practice in the absence of the purchase. |     |

#### _When uplift can be recognised_

Section FE 16(1E) will provide two exemptions to the rule above. These are when:

*   generally accepted accounting practice would allow the increase in asset values in the absence of the transfer; or
*   the transfer is part of a restructure following the purchase of the group by a person not associated with the group and the change in the value of the New Zealand group's assets is a reasonable proportion of the change in the value of the group's total assets.

The intention behind the second exemption is to allow uplifts to be recognised when a third party has, in essence, purchased a group of companies and part of that purchase price relates to the group's intangible property. Following this, the purchaser may restructure the group, in part to spread the value of the intangible property among all its subsidiaries. An increase in the assets of the New Zealand group following such a restructure is allowable, provided the increase is a reasonable considering the increase in the value of the entire group's assets (for example, having regard to the relative size of the New Zealand group).

### Excluding individuals' and trustees' interest in a CFC

New section FE 16(1BA) largely rewrites the previous section FE 16(1B) but with a new provision. Individuals or trustees will be required to exclude certain interests in a controlled foreign company (CFC) or foreign investment fund (FIF) they hold indirectly through an associate that is outside their New Zealand group if the associate is outside their group by virtue of being an excess debt outbound company or included in the group of such a company.

This provision is necessary as section FE 3(2)(a) excludes from the New Zealand group of an individual or trustee who is an outbound investor, all companies that are excess debt outbound companies or included in the group of such a company. Despite this provision, the person or trustee's indirect interests in the CFC or FIF should be still be excluded from their group assets.

1 These are: shares, decision-making rights, the right to receive income and the right to receive the net value of any assets.

2 There would be no issue if one of the holding companies held ownership interests of 50 percent or more of Z Co. The thin capitalisation rules as they were before these amendments would apply.

3 For example, section FE 26(2)(bb) applies only if "none of the other paragraphs apply" and subsection (3)(d)(ii) applies only if subsection (3)(d)(i) does not. Subsection (3)(d)(i) is a paraphrase of previous section FE 26(3)(d).

4 This change applies to the "inbound" thin capitalisation rules, which apply to non-resident investments in New Zealand. The "outbound" thin capitalisation rules, which apply to New Zealand investment abroad, are not affected.

5 Here, an associate will not include a relative that has not made any settlements on the trust. This is to prevent the rules from applying to a trust settled by a New Zealand resident merely because the resident has a non-resident relation.
