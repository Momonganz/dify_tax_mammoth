OFFICE OF MINISTER OF FINANCE WELLINGTON, N.Z. 30 August 1989 STATEMENT BY DAVID CAYGILL Report on the Taxation of Life Insurance and Related Areas Introduction I am pleased to release the second report of the Consultative Committee on Superannuation, Life Insurance and Related Areas. The report discusses and makes recommendations on the taxation of: ­ life offices and related matters; ­ life and disability insurance premiums and claims;­ friendly societies and credit unions; and­ health insurance premiums and claims. These reforms are related to, and are consistent with, the reforms the Government has already put in place concerning the taxation of private superannuation. Taxation of Life Offices The current taxation treatment of life offices is deficient in that only investment income (and not other forms of income) is taxed. In consequence only expenses related to the earning of investment income are deductible. That is an unsatisfactory position from the point of view of both the Government, which fails to collect tax on some of the income derived by life offices, and life offices, which are denied a deduction for expenses for which other taxpayers are allowed a deduction. In particular, at the time the superannuation tax reforms were enacted, life offices argued that the restrictions imposed on the deductibility of their expenses unfairly penalised those who saved for their retirement by investing in a life office. The appropriate taxation treatment for life offices is a highly technical issue which the Consultative Committee's report considers in some detail. In broad terms, the Committee recommends that life offices receive full deductibility for their expenses but be taxed fully on their income. That involves moving life offices on to a tax system which approximates that applying to other types of companies. It is proposed that the new tax regime take effect from the beginning of the tax year starting on 1 April 1990. The Government has agreed to the life office regime proposed in the report subject to further consideration being given by officials to possible adjustments to the definition of underwriting income. The Report considers the position of so-called "income maintenance" policies whereby a person insures against loss of profits or income in the case of death, sickness or disability. The taxation law in this area has been subject to some doubt with premiums sometimes deductible (with benefits assessable) while in other cases premiums are non-deductible and benefits non-assessable. The Committee notes that the latter is more in line with the Government's overall taxation reforms but the Committee considered that moving all policies on to a consistent basis would require consideration of the taxation of general (ie non-life) insurance. In the meantime, the Committee recommends that, for the sake of clarity, current Inland Revenue Department policy in this area should be set out in legislation. The Government has decided that the time and effort required to put the current Inland Revenue interpretation into legislation would be better directed at developing and legislating for an improved regime. The Government has therefore declined this aspect of the Report but agreed that priority be given to consideration of a consistent and more appropriate tax treatment of all insurance premiums and claims. Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Friendly societies and credit unions are currently exempt income tax. The Government announced its intention to remove this exemption in December 1987. The Committee's Report makes detailed recommendations as to how that policy should be implemented. That involves moving such entities on to a normal income tax basis from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. A proposal which has been controversial is the recommendation that the benefit from low interest rate loans provided to the members of friendly societies or credit unions be taxed. The Committee carefully considered this issue and concluded that the taxation of such benefits is justifiable and necessary. However, in recognition of the compliance costs involved for the smaller organisations, the Committee has proposed not to apply such a rule to already existing friendly societies and credit unions with assets under $1 million. Trade unions and working men's clubs are currently exempt income tax under the same provision which exempts friendly societies and credit unions. However, the taxation of those bodies was not within the Committee's terms of reference and no change to their tax exempt status is recommended. The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendations to move friendly societies and credit unions on to a normal income tax basis except for their recommendations in relation to low interest loans. Further discussions will be held with the Credit Union League on this issue. Health Insurance The previous specific income tax provision providing for the deductibility of health insurance premiums was repealed as from December 1987. At the same time premiums paid by employers for the benefit of employees became subject Life and Disability Insurance Premiums and Claims 2 to FBT. It was considered that taxation exemptions were not a very fair or effective means of delivering health care assistance. The Committee considered this issue and submissions seeking the reinstatement of tax concessions. The Committee has endorsed the Government's decisions. Summary of decisions on the Committee's Report In response to the Committee's report the Government has: - agreed to the Committee's recommendations on the tax treatment of life insurance companies for implementation from the income year commencing 1 April 1990, subject to officials giving further consideration to the definition of underwriting income;- agreed to the Committee's recommendations relating to the separation of the life insurance and superannuation business of life insurance companies; - decided not to legislate the current Inland Revenue interpretation of the tax law relating to life and disability insurance premiums and claims; - agreed that priority be given to consideration of a consistent and more appropriate tax treatment of general as well as life and disability insurance premiums and claims; - agreed that the tax exemption of friendly societies and credit unions be removed and that such entities be subject to normal income tax treatment as recommended by the Consultative Committee. It is intended that these changes take effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1990; and - decided to have further discussions with the Credit Union League on the issue of applying FBT to low interest loans made to credit union members. I would like to thank the Committee for the hard work they have put into addressing some very difficult technical issues. I congratulate the Committee on a detailed and comprehensive report which will facilitate the next stage of the process, namely the drafting of legislation. I also thank those who made submissions to the Committee and, in particular, the Life Offices' Association for its input on the life office regime. The Government intends to introduce legislation giving effect to the agreed reforms as soon as possible.

The report was released, along with the Government's decisions, in July 1988. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1989, passed in March of this year, put in place the new Taxed/Taxed/Exempt regime for superannuation. At the same time, the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 liberalised the regulatory regime and provided transitional measures. This second report covers the remaining areas of the Committee's terms of reference. This includes the tax treatment of life insurance companies, friendly societies and credit unions. It also addresses the tax treatment of premiums/contributions to life offices, friendly societies and other health insurers, as well as the treatment of benefits paid by these organisations. These issues were covered in Volume 2 of the Government's Consultative Document on Superannuation and Life Insurance. It should be noted that this report is structured differently from the Consultative Document. In particular, health insurance is covered here in two chapters. Chapter 5 covers the income tax treatment of friendly societies, including those involved in health insurance. The arguments for tax concessions for health insurance generally, together with the tax treatment of premiums and claims in the hands of policyholders, are addressed in Chapter 6. 1.2 Objectives of the Review Life insurance companies are currently subject to a special tax regime which disregards the underwriting activity and focuses only on the investment activity of life offices. Even though the tax base is incomplete, the regime is not necessarily concessional. Indeed the Committee considers that many life offices may have been overtaxed relative to other businesses. The Government decided to review this treatment with the aim of developing a comprehensive base which would tax the investment and underwriting activity of life offices in an even-handed manner. Thus, the tax treatment should neither advantage nor disadvantage life offices or life insurance relative to other organisations and businesses. Friendly societies and credit unions are currently subject to a concessionary regime which effectively exempts them from tax. This confers an advantage on friendly societies and credit unions at the expense of other organisations involved in the same business activities. For example, the tax treatment of friendly societies has probably contributed to the dominance of friendly societies in the health insurance market. The Committee agrees with the Government that, by and large, a business activity should be taxed the same, regardless of the organisational form under which the business is conducted. 1.3 Submissions Received The Committee received 98 submissions on the areas covered in this report. The numbers of submissions received on different issues were as follows: Life insurance 18 Health insurance 11 Friendly societies 22 Credit unions 47 The content of submissions is discussed in the relevant chapters. 1.4 Summary of Main Recommendations The Committee's detailed recommendations are included in the chapters. The following is a summary of the Committee's key recommendations. 1.4.1 Life insurance companies The Committee recommends that: a life insurance be subject to the Committee's Option 2 regime which is modelled on the tax imputation system applying to companies and set out in section 2.4.2 of the report; b the tax rate for the life office base be the company tax rate, currently 33%; c the tax rate for policyholders be 33% based on the current scale of personal effective marginal tax rates; d underwriting income, ie the income earned by a life office in respect of the risk-spreading service it provides, be defined as the sum of mortality profit, a premium loading, and discontinuance profit as set out in section 2.5; e actuarial reserves be calculated, for tax purposes, on a basis determined by the life office's actuary, using interest, mortality, and other assumptions that are:- reasonable in the light of the life office's experience;- consistent with the basis used by the life office's actuary in making recommendations on the level of surplus available for distribution to shareholders and/or policyholders; and - acceptable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; 2 f the deductibility of expenditure incurred by life offices be determined under general tax law; g the current law relating to the tax treatment of capital gains realised by life offices be carried over to the new regime; h there be no difference in tax treatment for proprietary and mutual companies except what is necessary to take into account a proprietary company's distributions to shareholders; i life offices pay FBT on any discounts on interest charged in respect of loans to policyholders; j there be no ability to group tax on the policyholder tax base with the income or losses of other group companies; k premiums, claims, reserves and underwriting income included in the tax base be net of reinsurance where the reinsurer is subject to New Zealand income tax; l by election of the life office and subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, New Zealand branches of non-resident life offices be treated as New Zealand residents for tax purposes; m consideration be given to exempting from tax, overseas sourced investment income derived with respect to overseas operations which is distributed to non-resident policyholders; n the new regime take effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1990; o the new life insurance regime should apply to all business arising from any contract whereby a person offers benefits contingent on the death or survival of a human life. However, where a person offering such contracts fully reinsures all life/death risks with some other company, the business should not be classified as life insurance; and p life offices be allowed to transfer superannuation liabilities and corresponding assets, without a tax penalty, to a separately identifiable superannuation business which would be taxed under the tax regime applying to superannuation. (The Committee's specific recommendations on this issue are discussed in the Chapter 3.) 1.4.2 Life and disability insurance premiums and claims The Committee recommends that: a the tax treatment of all life, disability, and fire and general insurance premiums and claims be reviewed and consideration given to making all such premiums non-deductible and claims non-assessable; 3 b the current treatment of life and disability insurance premiums and claims be retained in the meantime; and c the current Inland Revenue interpretation of the tax law relating to life and disability premiums and claims be translated into legislation. 1.4.3 Friendly societies and sickness, accident and death benefit funds (Note: These recommendations apply to all friendly societies, including those involved in health insurance.) The Committee recommends that: a the medical business of friendly societies be taxed as for other health insurers, ie as for a fire and general insurer. The tax base would then be premiums received plus investment income less claims paid less all investment and management expenses; b the life insurance funds of friendly societies be taxed as for life insurance companies (refer to Chapter 2); c all the funeral, sickness and annuity insurance business of friendly societies be allowed a simplified tax base of investment income less all investment and management expenses, provided that business does not exceed specified limits. Otherwise the life insurance company basis would apply; d general tax law (rather than a specific tax) apply to realised capital gains; e any interest discount on loans to members, as measured by reference to the prescribed FBT interest rate, be subject to FBT, except where the friendly society: - existed and had assets under $lm as at 1/4/89; and - has assets under $lm at all times during the quarter; f the tax rate applying to the income of friendly societies should reflect the effective marginal tax rate of members, at present 33%; and g taxation of the income of all friendly societies apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. With respect to Sickness, Accident and Death benefit trust funds, the Committee recommends that: a the tax base be premiums received plus investment income (including net realised capital gains) less claims paid less all investment and management expenses; 4 b the tax applies from the income year commencing 1st April 1990; c the tax rate should reflect the effective marginal tax rate of members, at present 33%; and d no concessions apply for provisional tax payments. 1.4.4 Health insurance premiums and claims The Committee: a recommends that health insurance, with the exception of premiums for income replacement policies that are currently deductible, should be paid for by individuals out of their after-tax income; b endorses the removal of the previous FBT exemption for employer-paid health insurance premiums; and c recommends that the benefits from health insurance policies, with the exception of currently taxable benefits designed to replace income, should be tax free to the insured. 1.4.5 Credit unions The Committee recommends that: a credit unions be subject to the tax treatment applying to co-operatives with an option to account for all income as if it had been derived from dealings with members, thus avoiding the need for an imputation credit account; b general tax law (rather than a specific tax) apply to realised capital gains; c any interest discount on loans to members, as measured by reference to the prescribed FBT interest rate, be subject to FBT, except where the credit union: - existed and had assets under $lm as at 1/4/89; and - has assets under $lm at all times during the quarter; d the tax rate applying to the income of credit unions should be the company tax rate, presently 33%; and e taxation of the income of all credit unions apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. 5 CHAPTER 2 - THE TAX TREATMENT OF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES 2.1 Introduction In the current financial services market, there is a continuing blurring of the dividing lines which used to delineate sharply the activities of banks, life offices and other financial organisations. In this environment, the continuation of a special tax structure for any one particular form of business entity may of itself either penalise or encourage the development of that type of entity. Life insurance is subject to a special tax regime. The review of the taxation of life insurance is thus part of the Government's programme of tax reform. Accordingly, the Government produced a Consultative Document in March 1988 setting out a proposal for a new, comprehensive tax base for life insurance. This chapter reviews that proposal, considers the comments made in submissions and sets out the Committee's recommendations. Other issues relating to life insurance, namely the separation of the life insurance and superannuation business of life offices and the treatment of premiums and claims in the hands of policyholders, are discussed in chapters 3 and 4. The Committee considered four main options for taxing life insurance companies. The first two originated from the Consultative Document and are discussed in the next section. A further two options were developed by the Committee - these are discussed in section 2.4. Definition of Terms It is helpful first to define some variables to be used to describe and discuss the options. C = claims paid during the year including cash bonuses V0 = actuarial reserve at the beginning of the year V1 = actuarial reserve at the end of the year I = investment income E = total revenue expenses (including investment expenses) EI = investment expenses P = premiums received during the year U = gross underwriting income F = financial intermediation fee charged by the life office T = net investment income transferred to proprietors or retained as capital c = company tax rate p = tax rate based on personal tax rates. 6 2.2 Options Proposed in the Consultative Document a CD Option 1 (CD's preferred option) This is the option set out in Chapter 2 of the Consultative Document. It involved the following tax bases and rates. For proprietors: Tax base = U + F - E + EI + T; tax rate = c. For policyholders: Tax base = I - EI - F - T; tax rate = p. The CD proposed that underwriting income, U, be calculated as: U = P - C, and that a special withholding tax be applied to premiums as they were received by the life office. It was acknowledged that this approach resulted in the savings component of premiums being taxed but with an offsetting deduction when claims were paid out. However, the approach had the attraction of avoiding the need to base the tax payable on changes in actuarial reserves, which were dependent on forecasts of future events including future deaths, investment returns and expenses. The CD also argued that the approach would not create any significant problems provided tax rates remained fairly constant over time and life offices were able to carry losses back into earlier years. b CD Option 2 This option was set out in Chapter 3 of the Consultative Document and involved improving on the existing system without departing from its basic structure. Thus the life office would continue to be taxed only as a proxy for policyholders and the tax basis would remain as investment income less investment expenditure. However some minor amendments were proposed to clarify some aspects of existing legislation. 2.3 Submissions Received In comparison with the 225 submissions received on superannuation, the submissions on life insurance were modest in number, but not in technical content. A total of 18 submissions were received: Life Offices 11 Trade and Professional Associations 3 Actuaries and Consultants 4 7 We met initially with the following: AMP Society Life Offices Association National Mutual N.Z. Society of Actuaries and continued the consultative process with the Life Offices Association (as the body representing the life insurance industry) and the N.Z. Society of Actuaries. The submissions to the Committee agreed that: (a) life offices should be taxed on a basis which replicates that of other taxpayers; and (b) life offices should pay tax as a proxy for the policyholders in respect of the net income distributed to policyholders. The life offices also regarded section 204 of the Income Tax Act - which sets out part of the regime for life offices - as being in need of substantial revision. Comments Made on CD Option 1 With respect to the CD's Option 1, the majority of submissions argued against the use of two separate bases. It was suggested that the difference between the tax rates to apply to the two tax bases would be small enough to permit the bases to be amalgamated, leading to an overall tax base of: I - E + U Other arguments advanced against the use of two separate bases included: - that the apportionment of the various items would be difficult; - that investment income retained as capital can be used for the benefit of policyholders as well as shareholders; and - that some part of the underwriting income may be distributed to policyholders. The submissions were strongly opposed to the suggested method of calculating underwriting income, ie U = P - C. The reasons advanced related mainly to the timing difference between the assessability of premiums and the deductibility of associated claims. It was argued that this timing difference: - is not in accord with Statements of Standard Accounting Practice No 1 and No 9; - is against normal tax rules; - requires life offices partially to fund benefits out of future tax deductions, effectively making the Inland Revenue Department the principal reinsurer of life business; 8 - would lead to problems if tax rates change; - would inhibit new entrants to the life insurance industry; - would encourage aggressive tax planning; and - would enable Government to compulsorily "borrow" from life offices. Some submissions argued that underwriting income should instead be calculated as: U = q1S - C or q2(S - V0) - ∑ ( C i - V0i) claims where q1 = mortality factors from the NZ Life Tables published by the Department of Statistics q2 = mortality factors used in the calculation of V0 S = sum of the amounts payable on death under current policies. Others considered that the operations of the life insurance industry are based on the use of actuarial methods and reserves and that a life office tax regime which does not recognise this would likely be inequitable. The Committee's Views The Committee rejected the proposal put forward in submissions to amalgamate the two bases to give a total base of I - E + U. Amalgamation would allow losses incurred by the life office to be offset against income distributed to policyholders and vice versa. Where a company makes a tax loss, its shareholders are not able to use that loss to reduce their tax liability on income from other sources. Although companies are sometimes able to utilise losses by grouping with other taxpaying companies, allowing an offset with policyholder income in the life insurance regime would give life offices and their policyholders an advantage over other taxpayers. The Committee also rejected the alternative formulations of underwriting income as: U = q1S - C or q2 ( S - V0 ) - ∑ (Ci - V0i). claims We felt that, while the proposed formulations provided a reasonably accurate method of calculating the profits/losses arising from mortality, they made an inadequate allowance for income arising from management fees and no allowance for profits from other areas, eg profits made on surrenders. The Committee considered that the CD's preferred option had three significant advantages. First, it provided a comprehensive tax base which would allow life offices to come within the imputation system for shareholder taxation. Second, it avoided the need for actuarial calculations and was therefore simple. Third, it 9 effectively limited scope for manipulation. However, against these advantages, the Committee agreed with submissions that the taxation of the savings element of premiums with an offsetting deduction for claims would create problems. In particular, the Committee considered that the proposal would result in an inappropriate tax treatment for companies with changing levels of business, ie companies that were growing or contracting. For example, a company that was growing would generally face a higher initial tax bill relative to a company with a constant level of business. The Committee was also concerned that the proposed method was too heavily reliant on tax rates remaining constant over time. This seemed to be an unrealistic assumption given the long time periods involved with life insurance and recent experience with respect to tax rates. Finally, it was considered that the CD was correct in suggesting that the transition from the existing regime to the proposed one would be very difficult. The Committee felt that these drawbacks were significant and that other alternatives should be examined. With regard to the use of actuarial reserves, the Committee: - notes that the Income Tax Act contains examples of the use of judgemental bases to determine the taxable profit of a taxpayer; - notes that actuarial estimates conform with commercially acceptable practice and are prepared by professionally qualified experienced individuals. The Committee regarded the CD's Option 2 as a fail-back option, to be used only in the event that alternative, more comprehensive, tax bases proved unworkable. We have concluded that workable, comprehensive options are available and that these are to be preferred even though they are somewhat more complex than the current basis. The Committee has concluded that the existing life insurance taxation regime as set out in section 204 of the Income Tax Act 1976 is deficient in a number of respects. Any replacement regime should seek to place life offices in a broadly equivalent tax position to other taxpaying entities operating in similar businesses. Generally, we see this as replicating for life offices the taxation regime applying to companies in the insurance and financial sector. Nevertheless, rules specific to life offices are necessary to take into account aspects of life insurance which do not frequently arise elsewhere. First, holders of participating life policies stand, in many respects, in a position similar to equity owners of companies while in other respects being customers of the life office. Secondly, the liabilities assumed by life offices (and thus also their asset portfolio) tend to be especially long-term. 10 These principles have led us to the view that the proxy system under which life offices are taxed on behalf of policyholders (rather than policyholders being individually taxed on income derived on their behalf) should be retained. However, we have concluded that, in order to apply normal tax rules to life offices, the rules set down in section 204 of the Act would require considerable amendment. 2.4 Further Options Considered by the Committee 2.4.1 The Committee's Option 1 The first option developed by the Committee is based on the CD Option 1, but brings actuarial reserves into the formulation of the two tax bases to try to overcome the timing problems inherent in the CD option. The tax bases under this option are as follows. For proprietors: Tax base = P + I - E - C - (Vl-V0) - policyholder tax; tax rate = c; For policyholders: Tax base = \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/(1 - p); tax rate = p. The Committee's proposed definition of underwriting income is given in section 2.5 below and the basis of calculation of actuarial reserves for tax purposes is discussed in section 2.6. The Committee considers that the current top personal tax rate of 33% is the appropriate rate to reflect the effective marginal tax rate of individuals investing in life insurance. Data from the 1987/88 Household Income and Expenditure Survey indicates that 57% of expenditure on life insurance is incurred by individuals with a tax rate of 33% or higher. The 33% rate is also consistent with the rate applying to Category 2 and 3 superannuation schemes as well as trusts in general. The proprietors' tax base makes all income assessable, including premiums, but provides a deduction for income distributed to policyholders, including the tax paid on their behalf, and additions to the actuarial or prudential reserves. The base would be taxed at the company rate and the life office would be able to distribute tax credits to its shareholders in the same way as other companies. It would not, however, be able to use tax losses to offset policyholder tax. The policyholder tax base measures the investment income distributed to policyholders by the life office. Since the life office pays tax as a proxy for individual policyholders, the income distributed to them in claims and additions to the actuarial reserve is net of tax. This means that, if the 11 policyholder tax rate is 33%, then for each $67 distributed to policyholders, $33 must be paid by the life office in policyholder tax. To achieve this result the policyholder tax base includes division by a gross-up factor of 1 - p. In calculating the investment returns to policyholders, underwriting income is subtracted from premiums. This ensures that policyholders are not allowed a deduction for the private cost of taking out life cover (just as they are not allowed tax deductions for the purchase of other goods and services for private consumption). At the same time, policyholders will not be assessed on any component of claims that relates to the risk spreading function of the life office. Assuming for the moment that both tax bases are positive, and setting c and p equal to 33%, the total tax payable by the life office will be: Total tax = 0.33(I + U - E) (1) If either tax base is negative, the tax liability will be greater than this expression (for fixed I, U and E), but this additional tax will be offset in future years as losses are carried forward. As an alternative to carrying losses forward, the life office could try to prevent a tax loss on the policyholder side by increasing the transfer to reserves in that year. A loss on the life office side could be offset in the current year by grouping with another company that had a suitably large tax bill. In most cases then, the tax liability under Option 1 would be as set out at (1) above. An example of how the tax liability of a life office would be calculated under Option 1 is given below. 12 Example Suppose I = 100 C = 60 E = 40P = 110 U = 20 c = 0.33 V1 - V0 = 80 P = 0.33 Policyholders' Base: \[60 + 80 - (110 - 20) \]/0.67 = 74.63 Tax on Policyholders' Base:0.33 x 74.63 = 24.63 Life Office Base: 110 + 100 - 40 - 60 - 80 - 24.63 =5.37 Tax on Life Office Base: 0.33 x 5.37 = 1.77 Total Tax Payable: 1.77 + 24.63 = 26.40 Since both bases are positive in this example, the tax liability can also be expressed as follows: Total Tax Payable = 0.33(I + U - E) = 0.33(100 + 20 - 40) = 26.40 2.4.2 The Committee's Option 2 General approach The Committee's second option adopts an approach which is analogous to the tax imputation system applying to companies. Under the imputation system, a company is taxed as a proxy for its shareholders. The company is then able to attach tax credits to its distributions to shareholders. Shareholders are taxed on the distributions inclusive of the tax credits, but are able to use the tax credits to reduce their personal tax liability. Under the Committee's Option 2, both the shareholders and the policyholders are treated like the shareholders of ordinary companies. Thus, the first tier of life office tax involves levying the company tax on profits attributable to shareholders as well as investment income attributable to policyholders. Life office shareholders are then able to receive tax credits in respect of distributions made to them by the life office - exactly like the shareholders of other companies. A similar process occurs with respect to policyholders. During the income year the life office will distribute some of its income to its actuarial reserves for policyholders and some will be distributed directly to policyholders in claims. Since individual policyholders are not taxed on income distributed to them, the policyholder tax must be deducted by the life office before the income is distributed. If the policyholder tax rate is 33%, then for each $67 distributed to policyholders, $33 must be paid by the life office in policyholder tax. However, the life office will have paid tax at 33% on the life office tax base and some or all of this can be used to offset policyholder tax. Tables which illustrate the approach are set out in Appendix 2.1. The tax bases Under the Committee's second option, the tax bases are as follows, where underwriting income, U, is defined in section 2.5 below, and the definition of actuarial reserves, V0 and V1, is given in section 2.6. 13 For the life office: Tax base = I + U - E; tax rate = c. For policyholders: Tax base = \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/(l - p); tax rate = p. The life office base is modelled on the company income tax base. It includes both sources of life office income, ie investment income and underwriting income, with all expenses being deductible. As for other companies, unrealised capital gains are not included as assessable income. Shareholders would be treated like shareholders of other companies. The life office would be able to distribute tax credits with dividends and taxable bonus issues and these would be used by New Zealand resident individual shareholders to offset their personal tax liabilities. The policyholder base is identical to that in the Committee's Option 1. It includes the investment income attributed to policyholders and eventually paid out in claims. As in Option 1, the net income is grossed-up by dividing by the factor (1 - p) and the tax rate p is applied. However, unlike Option 1, the life office can distribute tax credits to policyholders thus offsetting the policyholder liability. Assuming that the life office uses its tax credits to offset as much of the policyholder liability as possible, the total tax payable under Option 2 will be the greater of the tax calculated on the life office base and the tax calculated on the policyholder base. It should be noted that even though unrealised gains are not included in the life office base, such gains may be reflected in distributions to shareholders and/or policyholders. Any distributions of unrealised gains will be taxable either as part of the policyholder tax base, or in the hands of shareholders. An example of how tax would be calculated under Option 2 is given below. 14 Example Suppose I = 100 C =60 E = 40P = 110 U = 20c = 0.33 Vl - V0 = 80 P = 0.33 Life Office Base: 100 + 20 - 40 = 80 Tax on Life Office Base: 0.33 x 80 = 26.40 Policyholders' Base: \[60 + 80 - (110 - 20)\]/0.67 = 74.63 Tax on Policyholders' Base: 0.33 x 74.63 = 24.63 Total Tax Payable: 26.40 In this example, the life office has used 24.63 of tax credits to offset the policyholder tax liability. In fact the life office might hold back some of these credits for distribution to shareholders. It would then pay tax in excess of 26.40. 2.5 Definition of Underwriting Income, U The Committee is using the term "underwriting income" to mean the income earned by the life office in respect of the risk-spreading service it performs for policyholders. It includes three elements: - mortality profit (M) which arises when the deaths experience of the office during the year is more favourable than expected; - a premium loading (PL) to pay for the risk-spreading service and generate a profit; and - discontinuance profits (D ) made on policies discontinued during the year. The Committee proposes to define these three elements as set out below. Note that "year" refers to a company's accounting year. Mortality profit: M = ∑ qi(Si - V0i) - ∑ (Si - V0i) all deaths policies during year Premium loading: PL = 0.2 ∑ q i(Si' - V0i) all policies Discontinuance profit: D = ∑ (V0i + Pi - SVi) surrenders and lapses during year where qi = probability of death claim under policy i during the year V0 i = amount in actuarial reserve for policy i at the beginning of the year 15 Pi = premiums paid on policy i during the year SVi = amount paid on termination of policy i, prior to deduction of any debts, loans or advances against the security of the policy and, for life insurance: Si = Si' = amount payable on death under policy i at the beginning of the year, prior to deduction of any debts, loans or advances against the security of the policy for annuities: S i = 0 Si' = life expectancy of annuitant x annual amount of the annuity The factor 0.2 in the definition of the premium loading has been determined by reference to published Tables of Mortality, reinsurance premium rates and life office temporary insurance premium rates. It is necessarily an approximation, but has been accepted in discussions with representatives of the life offices. In the definition of discontinuance profit (D), "surrenders and lapses" includes all policies which terminated during the year except where the termination was caused by the death of the life insured, or the survival of the life insured to the end of the term of the policy. Adding the three elements of underwriting income and simplifying gives, for life insurance:U = 1.2 ∑ qi(Si - V0i) - ∑ (Si - V0i) + ∑ (V0i + Pi - SVi) all deaths surrenders policies during and lapses year during year and for annuities: U = ∑ V 0 i - ∑ q i V 0 i + 0 . 2 ∑ q i ( S i ' - V 0 i ) deaths all all during policies policies year + ∑ (V0i + P i - SVi) surrenders and lapses during year The Committee proposes that the mortality factors, qi, in the definition, be the same as those used to calculate the actuarial reserves, V0 and Vl. 16 2.6 Basis of Calculation of Actuarial Reserves The Committee considered five alternative methods for calculating actuarial reserves for tax purposes. a Basis used to calculate premiums The Committee considered that, under Committee Option 1, actuarial reserves calculated on this basis would produce a tax base which closely approximated the profit actually being made by the office, and that the scope to manipulate reserves to minimise tax would be limited. However, it was stated to us that the basis of calculation of premiums of old policies would not currently be known to many life offices. The Committee therefore rejected this option. b Surrender values Under this option the actuarial reserve, for tax purposes, would contain only the surrender values of policies in force. This option was considered because it may be argued that, prior to making a claim, a policyholder's income from a policy is simply any increase in surrender value. However, the Committee rejected this argument. We considered that policyholder income was accruing over the term of the policy and that this would not be adequately reflected in changes in the surrender value. The Committee also felt that this option might encourage life offices to alter their practices in relation to the setting of surrender values. Tax-induced behaviour of this sort is inefficient; it also erodes the tax base. c Published return required under the Life Insurance Act Under this option life offices would calculate their actuarial reserves, for tax purposes, using the same assumptions as were used in the return required under the Life Insurance Act. This return is made to the Justice Department at least once every three years, published, and is forwarded by the Justice Department to the Government Actuary for comment. An actuary nominated by the company would be required to certify that this basis had indeed been used, and to list the assumptions. The Committee felt that this option had the advantage of using existing procedures and being based on published material. However, it was considered that this method could allow significant scope for manipulation. It seemed likely that the incentive to minimise tax would lead life offices to change the basis of calculation of reserves for the purposes of the published return. The Inland Revenue Department would then have difficulty challenging such calculations since the life office could readily argue that the reserves were indeed consistent with the reserves prepared for the purposes of the return to the Justice Department. The Committee felt that it was essential for Inland Revenue to be able to challenge the 17 basis on which tax returns are prepared. Accordingly, this option was rejected. d Statutory basis Under this option, the financial and demographic factors to be used in the calculation of the actuarial reserves, and the method of calculation of the actuarial reserves, would be specified in the Act. The Committee rejected this option for the following reasons: - the Committee considered that one set of financial and demographic factors would not be appropriate for all life offices; and that such parameters would need to be kept under review so that they did not become out of date; - the Committee felt that this option could inhibit the development of new life insurance products and thus tend to restrict competition between life offices; - the Committtee felt that such a basis might come to be regarded as setting a minimum solvency standard for life offices, thereby inhibiting the distribution of profits to policyholders and shareholders, thus restricting competition between life offices and other financial institutions. e Basis determined by the life office and acceptable to the Commissioner After considering the four options set out above, the Committee concluded that the best method of calculating reserves for tax purposes was the method actually used by the life office to give a realistic assessment of the life office's financial position. Any other method would either be too inflexible to deal adequately with a wide range of products and life office clientele, or allow an unacceptable degree of manipulation. Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the reserves should be calculated on a basis determined by the life office's actuary, using interest, mortality, and other assumptions that are: - reasonable in the light of the life office's experience; - consistent with the basis used by the life office's actuary in making recommendations on the level of surplus available for distribution to shareholders and/or policyholders; and - acceptable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In addition, the Committee proposes that: in the first year of operation of the new regime, V0 and Vl must be calculated using the same assumptions; and 18 - the initial and final reserves, V0 and VI, in respect of each policy should be non-negative and no less than the surrender value of that policy at the beginning and end of the year respectively. The requirement that V0 and Vl be positive would limit the ability of a life office to claim a double deduction for expenses such as commission fees. That is because such expenses are likely to be the main reason for reserves being negative. Finally, the Committee proposes that the life office's actuary be required to sign the tax return stating the assumptions used in the preparation of the return and certifying that the calculations and assumptions meet these criteria (except for acceptability to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue). 2.7 Scope for Manipulation The Committee is concerned that the life insurance tax base should not put in place incentives for life offices to alter their business practices. In particular, it should not encourage life offices to act imprudently in order to minimise tax. Nor should the tax basis open up avoidance opportunities which would allow the tax base to be eroded. The potential for manipulation of the tax bases put forward as Options 1 and 2 above will come principally from the calculation of actuarial reserves. This scope will be limited by the requirement that the final reserve, Vl, for a particular policy in a particular year will become the initial reserve, V0, in the following year. It is also proposed that both V0 and Vl must be non-negative for each policy in each year. However, the method the Committee has proposed for calculating reserves will not eliminate the possibility of manipulation. It is therefore important to consider how the behaviour of life offices and the amount of tax revenue raised would be affected if life offices were to calculate reserves in a tax-effective way. This is done in Appendix 2.2. The analysis shows that, while Option 1 would appear to raise more revenue in some cases, this relies on the assumption that life offices cannot utilise tax losses in the year they arise. In fact, it seems likely that losses could often be utilised with the result that the revenue collected under Option 1 would be lower than under Option 2. The Committee considers that under Option 1, the proprietors' tax base could be made to be negative. This could arise from the life offices' current practice of distributing unrealised gains to claimants, thus inflating "C" with no corresponding increase in "I". The proprietors' tax loss could then be used, for example by grouping with another company, to offset the tax on unrealised gains distributed to policyholders. 19 The Committee concludes that Option 2 offers less scope for manipulation than Option 1. Option 2 could therefore be expected to have less influence on business practices. 2.8 Treatment of Unrealised Capital Gains The Committee has consulted the Life Office's Association on the two new options that we have considered. The main policy issue raised by the Association was the appropriate definition of "policyholder distributions". Under both options, "policyholder distributions" are effectively defined in terms of policy claims plus any increase over the year in the life office's actuarial reserve, less premiums. As the Association pointed out, those deemed distributions could be funded in part from "unrealised capital gains". The Association stated its opposition to this aspect on the following grounds: a it would impose an "unrealised capital gains tax" which would be contrary to accepted income tax principles; b other entities are not faced with this form of tax impost; and c the analogy with distributions is inaccurate in that companies would not normally make distributions from this source. If they were to do so, that could be effected by way of non-taxable bonus issues which would not incur a tax liability. The Committee regarded this issue as being of considerable importance and therefore carefully re-considered the Option 2 proposal in the light of the Association's concerns. As noted above, our concern is to put forward a life office taxation regime which is compatible with the regimes applying to other entities but which meets the particular circumstances of life insurance. The Committee's approach therefore needs to be justified on the grounds that it appropriately taxes distributions along the same lines as distributions made from other entities. Having considered this issue again, the Committee remains of the view that the approach can be justified on that basis. Although it would tax capital gains, realised or unrealised, on distribution, those are the taxation rules which also generally apply to ordinary companies. Whether a distribution from any particular source is or is not prudent is a matter which should be determined by shareholders subject to company law requirements. We have concluded that an increase in an office's actuarial reserves is the closest possible approximation to normal corporate distributions. The closest analogy is to a taxable bonus issue. A company making a taxable bonus issue transfers income to shareholder capital. That is then taxable to shareholders as a deemed distribution with possible offsetting imputation credits. 20 The increased shareholder capital is then distributable in cash, subject to certain restrictions, tax-free. Similarly, under Options 1 and 2, an increase in a life office's actuarial reserves would be deemed a distribution which would be taxable. Under Option 2 the tax on the distribution could be offset by any available imputation credits. The amount in reserves would then be distributable to policyholders effectively tax-free. Non-taxable bonus issues, on the other hand, are not analogous. For taxation purposes, a non-taxable bonus issue does not increase shareholder capital and thus does not increase the amount which a company can distribute to shareholders free of tax. A second reason for defining policyholder distributions in terms of an increase in a life office's reserves is the long-term nature of life office business and the adoption of the proxy basis for the taxation of life offices. Those aspects allow a life office to provide returns to policyholders on the basis of any accrued increase in the value of investment assets while meeting claims (payable to policyholders tax-free) from other cash sources. Thus, if policyholder deemed distributions excluded any aspect of accrued investment gains, the tax on such gains could be indefinitely deferred even though they could still give rise to cash distributions to policyholders. That would not produce a position whereby life offices were subject to a taxation regime compatible with the regime faced by similar entities. 2.9 Proposed Basis of Taxation for Life Insurance Companies The Committee recommends that life offices be subject to the Committee's Option 2 regime which integrates the proxy and normal company imputation systems. That would result in life offices being taxed first on their own account. The tax base would be full income of the life office (not just investment income as at present). The aim is to replicate the type of tax regime which applies to the income of other entities such as general insurance companies. That means there would be no specific restrictions on expense deductibility over and above those imposed under ordinary taxation law. The recommended regime would impose a second level of tax on life offices. That is aimed at reflecting the integration of the proxy and imputation systems. Life offices would be taxed on distributions made to policyholders in the same manner that equity holders of normal companies are taxed on dividend distributions which they receive. As is the case with dividends, life offices would be able to offset this second level of tax by imputation credits to the extent to which tax has already been paid at the first level. We appreciate that the regime we are proposing may produce some competitive difficulties for life offices with respect to some products which have a significant investment component and a far less significant insurance element. That reflects the fact that 21 the proposed life insurance regime is designed to accommodate the requirements of taxing pure life insurance. After much investigation, we have concluded that no system perfectly accommodates all forms of pure life insurance and investment. 2.9.1 Deductible expenditure The Committee's proposed tax base incorporates underwriting as well as investment income. Accordingly, there is no reason to restrict deductible expenditure to investment related expenses. The Committee proposes that, in relation to the deductibility of expenditure, life offices be subject to general tax law. 2.9.2 Capital gains At present, life offices are taxed on all realised capital gains under a specific provision in section 204 of the Act. The Committee considered the case for removing the specific provision for taxing life offices on realised capital gains and instead applying general tax law. In the Committee's view, this would not change the effect of the law but simply bring the legislation relating to life offices into line with that applying to other industries involved in investment, eg banks and other insurers. However, since the Government has signalled its intention to include a wider range of capital gains in the tax base, the Committee considered it would be inappropriate to remove the current section 204 provision. Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the current law relating to the tax treatment of capital gains realised by life offices be carried over to the new regime. 2.9.3 Dividends received by life offices Under the present tax regime for life offices, dividends are taxable to the life office as part of investment income. Life offices are, however, able to receive tax credits from the companies in which they hold shares to reduce the tax due in respect of the dividends. Under the regime the Committee is proposing, the treatment of dividends in the hands of life offices can be more closely aligned with the treatment applying to other companies and their shareholders. As for other companies, the section 63 intercorporate dividend exemption will apply and so investment income, I, in the life office tax base will not include dividend income. However, to the extent that such dividends are distributed to policyholders, they will be reflected in the policyholder tax base and taxed accordingly. Any credits attached to dividends received by the life office will be available to be passed on to life office 22 shareholders or to offset policyholder tax. 2.9.4 Proprietary and mutual companies In general, the income tax system should try to avoid influencing the institutional form in which businesses are conducted. As noted in the Consultative Document, life offices are usually of one of two types: proprietary companies or mutual companies. A proprietary company is owned by ordinary shareholders who, as a class, are separate from policyholders. A mutual company, on the other hand, is, in effect, owned by policyholders. Both types of company are active in the New Zealand life insurance market. They operate their businesses along similar lines. The only perceivable differences are in internal organisation (directors of mutual companies are elected by policyholders whereas directors of proprietary companies are elected by shareholders), and in some aspects of internal financial arrangements (with proprietary companies, but not mutuals, shareholders have equity capital at risk whereas mutuals only have policyholder capital at risk). Even the last difference is often more apparent than real. That is because a policyholder's return on premia payments is more often determined by the type of policy held (participating or non-participating) than by the structural organisation of the life office itself. The differences that do exist between proprietary and mutual offices are, in our view, insufficient to justify any difference in taxation treatment beyond what is made necessary by the different ownership structures. Thus, under the proposed taxation regime, profit distributions to policyholders will be taxed in the hands of the life office as part of the policyholder tax base (irrespective of whether the office is a mutual or proprietary), but distributions to shareholders of a proprietary company will be subject to tax as dividends with imputation credits (where available) in the same manner as any ordinary company distribution to shareholders. This neutral treatment of mutual and proprietary companies was supported in the submissions we received. In particular, submissions objected to the proposals in the Consultative Document that mutual companies be subject to special tax treatment to prevent them from offering policies with low premiums so as to reduce their tax while providing benefits to policyholders. Under the taxation regime for life insurance we have proposed, such a measure would not be necessary. Any discount on premiums would be reflected as an addition to the policyholder base and taxed accordingly. 2.9.5 Low interest loans to policyholders Under the tax base that the Committee has proposed, life offices may seek to provide tax-free benefits to policyholders in the form of low interest loans. The government has proposed that a company 23 providing such loans to shareholders should be subject to FBT on the extent to which the interest rate on loans to shareholders is less than the prescribed rate for FBT purposes. This recognises the fact that such loans are an alternative means of distributing corporate income to shareholders. The Committee proposes that the same regime apply to low interest loans made by life offices to their policyholders. 2.9.6 Grouping provisions and loss carry forwards The Consultative Document noted that the application of section 191 of the Income Tax Act (which allows the loss of one company in a group of companies to be utilised against the losses in another member of the group subject to meeting certain ownership requirements) with respect to life companies should be reconsidered if life offices were to continue to be taxed as a proxy for policyholders. The submissions we received opposed any change which would restrict the ability of a life office to group its income with other companies which met the normal statutory requirements. Under our proposed taxation regime for life insurance, the concerns expressed in the Consultative Document and in submissions can both be met. Where a life office does meet the requirements of section 191 of the Act it should be able to group income and losses with the life office tax base. That is because the life office tax base is comparable with the ordinary corporate tax base. The policyholder tax base, on the other hand, is a proxy for tax on distributed income. Companies cannot group the income or losses of shareholders with the income of other companies. The same should apply to life offices. Thus, there should be no ability to group tax on the policyholder tax base with the income or losses of other group companies. The Consultative Document proposed that a life office be able to carry forward losses under section 188 irrespective of share ownership changes. However, under our proposed taxation regime, tax at the life office and policyholder bases should be accounted for separately. Past losses from one base should not be able to be used to offset income from the other. The continuity of share ownership requirements in section 188 should apply to the carryforward of losses with respect to the life office base but, for the reasons given in the Consultative Document, not with respect to the policyholder base. This raises a transitional issue with respect to any losses which a life office already has available to carry forward when the new regime comes into place. Should those be available to be carried forward and, if so, against which base? We consider that they should be able to be carried forward and should be carried forward against the policyholder base. That is because the existing tax regime aims to tax life offices purely as a proxy for policyholders. It therefore seems appropriate to allow past losses to be offset against tax to be paid as a proxy for 24 policyholders. 2.9.7 Reinsurance Life reinsurance companies should be taxed on the same basis as insurance companies. That is the case at present and should remain under the revised taxation regime. A life re-insurance company would therefore be subject to tax at both the life office and the policyholder (the reinsuree) tax base. With respect to the reinsuree, P, C, V1, V0 and U in the policyholder tax base should be net of re-insurance but only if the reinsurance is with a company subject to tax in New Zealand. Where tax has been paid at the reinsurance company level on distributions, the method proposed above would avoid a second tax impost on the proceeds of reinsurance policies. 2.9.8 International Aspects The Consultative Document raised a number of issues with respect to possible international implications of the review of life insurance. At paragraph 2.16 of Volume 2 it reached the view that consideration should be given to deeming the New Zealand business related life funds of non-resident life offices to be New Zealand resident companies. That was stated to be for two reasons: a to preserve the tax-free nature of benefits from such life funds in the hands of the beneficiary; and b to allow non-resident life funds to be able to utilise imputation credits on the dividends which they receive on behalf of policyholders. With respect to benefits provided by a life office, the legislation enacted will, from 1 April 1990, exempt from taxation annuities paid by a life office which is subject to New Zealand taxation irrespective of whether or not the office is resident in New Zealand (section 61(59)). With respect to imputation credits, current legislation allows non-resident life insurers to utilise imputation credits. A life office, whether or not resident in New Zealand, is taxed on dividends under section 204 which is in Part IV of the Income Tax Act. Under section 394ZC, total assessable dividend income under Part IV includes any imputation credits attached to dividends. Under sec 394ZE, where assessable dividend income includes imputation credits, a taxpayer is entitled to a tax credit equal to the imputation credits. Thus, since a non-resident life office is taxed on dividends under Part IV of the Act, it is entitled to utilise imputation credits attached to those dividends. The position of lump sum benefits received from a life office (resident or non-resident) remains unchanged. Such benefits are in general tax-free. Therefore, the reasons advanced in the Consultative Document for taxing non-resident life offices as New Zealand residents with 25 respect to their New Zealand business do not now apply. However, the existing approach to life office imputation does allow non-resident life offices to repatriate profits to head offices without a New Zealand tax impost which is not the case with other non-resident entities. Moreover, we have recommended changes to the manner in which dividends are to be treated in the hands of a life office. We have recommended that life offices be able to benefit from the section 63 inter-corporate dividend exemption along the same lines as other companies. That exemption does not apply to non-resident corporates receiving dividends. Nevertheless, since the ultimate beneficiaries of the dividends received by a non-resident life office with respect to its New Zealand business will generally be New Zealand policyholders (for whom tax will be paid on distribution as part of the policyholder base), we consider that the section 63 exemption should still apply to non-resident life offices with respect to their New Zealand life insurance business. For this to apply it would still be necessary to treat the New Zealand branches of non-resident life offices as New Zealand residents. That should be by election of the life office subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Any funds, other than investments relating to New Zealand business, flowing between such a branch and the life office's overseas operations should be treated as a transaction with a non-resident entity and should be taxed as if such funds were a dividend, payments under a reinsurance contract, or expenses, as is appropriate. The Consultative Document also raised the issue of the taxation of income derived by New Zealand resident life offices with respect to life insurance carried on outside of New Zealand. At paragraphs 2.16 and 3.10 of Volume 2 it was stated that this should be considered in the context of international taxation reforms. As an ordinary income tax principle, investment income derived from New Zealand should be subject to tax in all cases. New Zealand resident life offices should be subject to tax in full on income derived from overseas operations as is the case for other New Zealand residents. However, under the current life office tax regime, life offices are distinguishable from most other taxpayers in that they pay tax on behalf of policyholders rather than in their own right. It was therefore submitted that the taxation of overseas life insurance activity would place New Zealand resident companies at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis overseas offices in foreign markets since it would result in investment income derived from offshore which is ultimately attributable to non-resident policyholders being subject to New Zealand tax. Moreover, New Zealand resident general insurers are not normally taxed on their income from overseas operations. Consideration should be given to exempting from tax overseas sourced investment income derived with respect to overseas operations which is distributed to non-resident policyholders. In 26 our view, such income does not have a sufficient connection with New Zealand so as to make it appropriately subject to New Zealand tax. On the other hand, New Zealand sourced investment income should always be subject to New Zealand tax and there is no justifiable reason for not taxing the underwriting income derived by New Zealand resident life offices from their overseas operations. The most feasible means of achieving the suggested tax result would appear to be to deem the overseas branch to be a non-resident entity with underwriting and New Zealand sourced investment income being included in the New Zealand company's life office tax base as CFC income. 2.9.9 Implementation date The Committee proposes that the new regime apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. 2.10 Coverage and Transitional Measures The Committee is aware of the close association between life insurance and superannuation and the consequent need to ensure that the tax regimes for these types of business are compatible. Superannuation schemes which offer amounts payable on death and pensions payable on survival, and bear the associated life/death risk, are essentially involved in the same business as life offices. To the extent that the activities are the same, superannuation schemes should be taxed in the same way as life offices. Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the new life insurance regime should apply to all business arising from any contract whereby a person offers benefits contingent on the death or survival of a human life. However, we propose that where a person offering such contracts fully reinsures all life/death risks with some other company, the business should not be classified as life insurance. The effect of our proposal is to include all superannuation pension business under the life insurance tax regime unless the scheme off-loads all of the life/death risk by, for example, purchasing annuities from life offices. This should ensure that the tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance is consistent and avoid creating incentives for companies to conduct their life insurance business as superannuation or vice versa. This suggests that life offices should be allowed to transfer assets, without a tax penalty, to a separately identifiable superannuation business which would be taxed under the tax regime applying to superannuation. The Committee's recommendations on these issues are discussed in the next chapter. 27 Recommendations The Committee recommends that: a life insurance be subject to the Committee's Option 2 regime which is modelled on the tax imputation system applying to companies and set out in section 2.4.2 above; b the tax rate for the life office base be the company tax rate, currently 33%; c the tax rate for policyholders be 33% based on the current scale of personal effective marginal tax rates; d underwriting income, ie the income earned by a life office in respect of the risk-spreading service it provides, be defined as the sum of mortality profit, a premium loading, and discontinuance profit as set out in section 2.5; e actuarial reserves be calculated, for tax purposes, on a basis determined by the life office's actuary, using interest, mortality, and other assumptions that are: - reasonable in the light of the life office's experience; - consistent with the basis used by the life office's actuary in making recommendations on the level of surplus available for distribution to shareholders and/or policyholders; and - acceptable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; f the deductibility of expenditure incurred by life offices be determined under general tax law; g the current law relating to the tax treatment of capital gains realised by life offices be carried over to the new regime; h there be no difference in tax treatment for proprietary and mutual companies except what is necessary to take into account a proprietary company's distributions to shareholders; i life offices pay FBT on any discounts on interest charged in respect of loans to policyholders; j there be no ability to group tax on the policyholder tax base with the income or losses of other group companies; k premiums, claims, reserves and underwriting income included in the tax base be net of reinsurance where the reinsurer is subject to New Zealand income tax; l by election of the life office and subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, New Zealand branches of 28 non-resident life offices be treated as New Zealand residents for tax purposes; m consideration be given to exempting from tax, overseas sourced investment income derived with respect to overseas operations which is distributed to non-resident policyholders; n the new regime take effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1990; o the new life insurance regime should apply to all business arising from any contract whereby a person offers benefits contingent on the death or survival of a human life. However, where a person offering such contracts fully reinsures all life/death risks with some other company, the business should not be classified as life insurance; and p life offices be allowed to transfer superannuation liabilities and corresponding assets, without a tax penalty, to a separately identifiable superannuation business which would be taxed under the tax regime applying to superannuation. (The Committee's specific recommendations on this issue are discussed in the next chapter.) 29 APPENDIX 2.1 - COMMITTEE'S OPTION 2 (IMPUTATION MODEL) This appendix illustrates how the company imputation tax model is applied to life offices under the Committee's Option 2. The first table uses the example of a bank to illustrate the normal company imputation system in conjunction with the tax treatment of the bank's depositors and shareholders. For simplicity it has been assumed that the shareholders and depositors are subject to a marginal tax rate of 33%. The second table illustrates the proposed life office treatment, where the shareholders are again assumed to face a marginal tax rate of 33%. 30 Table 1 - Tax Treatment of a Bank Company Taxable income 100 Company tax @33% 33 Net dividends 67 Depositors Interest 1,000 Personal tax @33% 330 Net income 670 Shareholders a Tax return Taxable dividend 100 Personal tax @33% 33 Less tax credits -33 Tax to pay 0 b Income Net dividends 67 Less tax to pay 0 Net income 67 Total tax paid Bank - for shareholders 33 Shareholders 0 Depositors 330 Total 363 31 Table 2 - Proposed Tax Treatment of Life Offices Company Life Office Tax Base Taxable income1,100 Company tax @ 3 3 % 3 6 3 Life Office as Proxy for Policyholders a Tax return Taxable income 1,000 Personal tax @33% 330 Less tax credits -330 Tax to pay 0 b Policyholder Income Net income 670 Shareholders a Tax return Taxable dividend 100 Personal tax @33% 33 Less tax credits -33 Tax to pay 0 b Income Net dividends 67 Less tax to pay 0 Net income 67 Total tax paid Life Office - for shareholders 33 - for policyholders 330 Shareholders 0 Policyholders 0 Total 363 APPENDIX 2.2 - SCOPE FOR MANIPULATION The Committee is concerned to ensure that the life insurance tax base offers minimum scope for manipulation by the life office. In particular, it should not put in place incentives for life offices to alter business practices or to act imprudently in order to minimise tax. Given that the potential for manipulation of the two bases put forward by the Committee will come principally from the expression Vl-V0, it is helpful to consider how the total tax liability of the life office varies as the change in actuarial reserves varies. Expressing the tax as a function of Vl-V0 gives the following results which are shown in graph form below. The tax rates to be applied to the life office and the policyholder tax bases are both set at 33%. Option 1 Total Tax = 0.33(I + U - E) - .33\[C + (Vl-V0 ) - (P—U)\] if \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/0.67 <= 0; ie, if (Vl-V0) <= P - C - U; = 0.33(I + U - E) if 0 <= \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/0.67 <= I + U - E; ie, if P - C - U <= (Vl-V0) <= P - C - U + 0.67(I + U - E); = 0.33\[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/0.67 if \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/0.67 >= I + U - E ie, if (Vl-V0) >= P - C - U + 0.67(I + U - E) The formulae and graph show that additions to the actuarial reserve below a certain level (Vl-V0 = P - C - U) mean that policyholder tax becomes nil and life office tax increases. This has the same effect as an excess retention tax on the life office in relation to its policyholders. When distributions to the policyholders become large enough to make the proprietors' tax base zero, additional distributions to the reserves will increase the tax above I + U - E. However, this will only occur if the life office is unable to utilise its tax loss. In this case, the additional tax paid may be offset in future years as the tax loss is utilised. The Committee's first option therefore appears to provide an incentive to pay tax on the basis: 32 I + U - E by keeping the change in reserves within certain limits. If it was not possible to keep the change in reserves below the upper limit: P - C - U + 0.67 (I + U - E), then companies would have an incentive to group with taxpaying companies so that the tax loss on the proprietors' base could be utilised. There will also be some scope for manipulation of underwriting income, U. To minimise tax, life offices would tend to wish to maximise V0 and minimise the q i. However, the Committee proposes that each life office use the mortality factors it used to calculate reserves. It would then be more difficult to understate the (or overstate V0). Option 2 Assuming that life office tax credits are applied to achieve the maximum possible offset of policyholder tax, the total tax payable by the life office under Option 2 will be the greater of life office tax and policyholder tax. Where life office tax exceeds policyholder tax, the life office will be able to fully offset policyholder tax and have "spare" tax credits which can be distributed to shareholders. Expressing the total tax liability as a function of (Vl-V0) gives the following results which are also shown in graph form below. Total Tax = 0.33(I - E + U) if \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/0.67 <= I + U - E ie, if (Vl-V0) <= P - C - U + 0.67(I + U - E); = 0.33\[C + (Vl-V0) - P + U\]/0.67 if \[C + (Vl-V0) - (P-U)\]/0.67 >= I + U - E ie, if P - C - U + 0.67(I + U - E) <= (Vl-V0). Under Option 2 the only incentive in relation to (Vl-V0) is to keep the increase/decrease in reserves below: P - C - U + 0.67(I + U - E). The scope for manipulation of U will be the same as under Option 1 and is not considered a significant problem. 33 CO OJ U1 CHAPTER 3 - THE SEPARATION OF THE LIFE INSURANCE AND SUPERANNUATION BUSINESS OF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES 3.1 Introduction As discussed in the previous chapter (section 2.10), the Committee proposes that the new life insurance regime should apply to all business arising from any contract whereby a person offers benefits contingent on the death or survival of a human life. However, we propose that where a person offering such contracts fully reinsures all life/death risks with some other company, the business should not be classified as life insurance. The Committee considers that, provided the service being offered is essentially the same, superannuation offered by a life office should be subject to the same tax regime as registered superannuation funds. To facilitate this, the Committee proposes that life offices be allowed to transfer assets, without a tax penalty, to a separately identifiable superannuation business which would be taxed under the tax regime applying to superannuation. The issue of how best to separate the life insurance and superannuation business of life offices has arisen on previous occasions as life offices have sought to benefit from the special tax concessions that used to apply to superannuation. The history of the issue and the Committee's proposals are discussed below. 3.2 History Following representations by the Life Offices Association, the Government announced in the 1983 Budget its intention to amend the Life Insurance Act to enable a life office to establish one or more funds for its superannuation business. A Joint Working Party of officials from Justice, Inland Revenue and Treasury met on several occasions with representatives of the LOA. Three alternative approaches to separation were considered in depth: (a) separate Statutory Funds (b) separate superannuation entities (c) sub-accounts within the existing Life Assurance Fund. Initial discussions indicated that Option (a) would provide the best solution, and the Budget announcement was framed accordingly. 36 However, detailed investigations showed that the implementation of Option (a) would require widespread legislative changes; and that a corresponding regime was not operating entirely satisfactorily in Australia. Further consideration led the Joint Working Party to favour Option (b), because the separation would be clear-cut and complete, and because the rules for inter-company dealings were already in place; while the LOA preferred Option (c). The discussions between the Joint Working Party and the LOA were extended to include a fourth option - part of a life office's superannuation business to be treated in the same manner as private superannuation under trustee accounting requirements. However, no agreement was reached on a permanent long-term solution. The essential nature of the principal problem was to achieve equitable tax treatment. At that time, this was a matter of identifying the investment income generated in respect of the assets held by the life office for its superannuation business. A subsidiary problem, which is no longer relevant, was to have the same investment ratio requirements for life office superannuation funds as for private superannuation funds. 3.3 The Current Position The solution which was arrived at is embodied in Section 204 of the Income Tax Act. In brief, the total net investment income of a life office is apportioned between "superannuation category 1" business and "all other business" in accordance with the value placed by the life office on its liabilities for those classes of business. This solution is not regarded as satisfactory by either Inland Revenue or the life offices. The areas of concern relate to both "what should be assessable investment income" and "what should be tax deductible expenses". 3.4 Submissions and Subsequent Events The submissions made by various life offices raised this issue again, and a preference for separate accounting was re-iterated. Subsequently, the Taxation Reform Bill (No 5) was published. Inter alia, this provided for (a) full deductibility of expenses according to normal income tax rules, for superannuation funds not operated by life offices; (b) no change in the nature of the expense deductibility permitted to life offices for their superannuation business. 37 Also, with the agreement of the Minister, the Committee provided the LOA with a draft of the life office tax basis which the Committee recommends to the Minister, in order to reduce uncertainty in relation to expectations arising from the No 5 Tax Bill. The Committee understands that, in the submissions to the Select Committee on the No 5 Tax Bill, the life offices made a strong plea that they be put in a neutral competitive environment with regard to their superannuation business. 3.5 The LOA Position The LOA has advised the Committee that, to fulfil the "level-playing field" concept espoused by Government, the LOA regards it as essential that life offices be permitted to separate their "life insurance" and "superannuation" business on a permanent basis. The LOA takes the view that this separation is being forced on life offices by Government's changes in the operation of the financial sector. The LOA has indicated its willingness to move its position from "separate accounting" to a "separate entity" concept provided that certain safeguards are met. The LOA argues that such a change should not result in the payment of either tax on capital gains or stamp duties when assets are transferred to the entity which will undertake the life office's liabilities under its superannuation business. The LOA states that there should be a time period of 12-18 months during which such separation can take place on these terms at each life office's option. The LOA also wish that the separate entity can operate a pooled investment fund and pay tax on a proxy basis. 3.6 Reasons for Separation The close association between "life insurance" and "superannuation" is part of the historical development of the life insurance industry. The Committee notes that it is a legislative requirement that a life office maintains one "fund" for both types of business (Life Insurance Act 1908, Section 15). The Committee agrees that the separation of these two classes of business would better enable Government to pursue its initiatives in the superannuation area. In addition, a life insurance policy could then be regarded as just another form of investment (such as equities, debenture stock etc.) available to the trustees of a registered superannuation scheme, thus simplifying the development of future taxation policy. Accordingly, the Committee accepts that there are good reasons for separating the "life insurance" and "superannuation" business of life offices. 38 3.7 Method of Separation The Committee considers that "separate accounting" would not provide a satisfactory long-term solution. The practical difficulties experienced overseas would most probably be experienced in New Zealand under any similar regime. The Committee therefore favours the "separate entity" concept. The following possibilities were considered: a Unit trust This structure would permit the pooling of funds for investment. Income could be distributed to individual superannuation schemes in the form of taxable dividends which would carry imputation credits. That would provide an income to offset a superannuation scheme's deductible expenses incurred outside the Unit Trust. However, this structure would not allow for tax to be paid on a proxy basis - the tax basis is that for a company, and not that for a private superannuation scheme. This would create a transition problem, because the corporate tax rate is 33%, and a tax rate of 25% applies to the Category 1 funds of superannuation schemes. In addition, a neutral competitive environment would cease to exist if, at some future date, the corporate and superannuation tax rates were to diverge after having converged. b Qualifying trust This structure would permit the pooling of funds but not the payment of tax on a proxy basis. Also, it would be difficult to establish such a vehicle without bringing it into the income tax definition of unit trust. c Company This alternative suffers from the same disadvantages as a Unit Trust. d Group investment fund This structure may be established by a trustee company pursuant to the Trustee Companies Act 1967. This structure would permit the pooling of funds for investment and the payment of a tax on a proxy basis. However, because of the limited number of trustee companies and the difficulty of establishing new trustee companies, this type of vehicle would not be generally available to all life offices. 39 e Superannuation scheme The LOA takes the view that the problems previously noted for other structures would disappear if a registered superannuation scheme were able to have other registered superannuation schemes as members: "Pooled funds, tax basis and variations in tax rates would all be taken care of". The Committee notes that Regulation 10(3) (c) of the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983 permits a superannuation scheme which is approved and classified under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976 to invest in another approved and classified superannuation scheme. This type of investment would not be prohibited by the "prudent person" approach of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. The LOA's wishes can be put into effect if the Superannuation Scheme's Act 1989 Section 2 definitions for "Beneficiary", "Member" and "Superannuation scheme" are subject to a slight alteration to permit registered superannuation schemes to become members of a registered superannuation scheme. The Committee notes that this approach would enable anyone, including a life office, to enjoy this regime for operating superannuation schemes. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that this approach be adopted. 3.8 Separation - Voluntary or Compulsory? The Committee considers that each life office should decide whether it wishes to set up a separate vehicle to transact superannuation business (defined as superannuation schemes approved and classified, or registered, by the Government Actuary). If such an entity is created, the life office can then invite superannuation scheme trustees who are its clients to transfer their scheme from the life office to the entity. This decision can be regarded in the same manner as any investment decision to be made by the trustees. The Committee is as opposed to giving life offices the authority to make such a transfer without the trustees written agreement as it would be to legislation which compels life offices to transfer their superannuation business to a separate entity. Once such a transfer is made, it should be irreversible - except to the extent that trustees should continue to have the option of discontinuing the contract and placing their business elsewhere (which could include a replacement contract with any life office). 40 3.9 Separation - Cost In general, normal tax rules should apply to expenses incurred by a life office in the creation of a separate entity. However, the Committee notes that the creation of a separate vehicle to look after the life office's existing superannuation business would require a transfer of assets to support the transferred liabilities. This raises questions of: (a) tax and duty liability on the transferred assets (b) equity between policyholders who remain in the life office and those who transfer to the new superannuation vehicle. 3.10 Tax and Duty Liability The transfer of assets to the new entity could give rise to an income tax liability. In addition, such a transfer can give rise to stamp duty liability. The Committee is concerned that such transfers of assets should not be unnecessarily inhibited by taxation considerations. Therefore it seems appropriate to the Committee that a transfer of assets to a new entity should not give rise to any stamp duty or income tax provided that the transfer is made within a reasonably short period of time - prior to 1 April 1991, say. We do not consider that that would reduce Government revenue since if the tax imposts remain, no transfers would take place and no Government revenue would result. The Committee further considers that, upon the expiry of the time frame for the separation of a life office's "life insurance" and "superannuation" business, all superannuation business which is not transferred out of the life office should be treated as life insurance business for the purpose of taxing the life office. 3.11 Equity in Asset Transfer This question was considered in detail by the Joint Working Party and the LOA in 1983-84. Whilst a set of guidelines was not defined, there appeared to be general agreement on the following three principles: (a) initial separation basis to be actuarially determined and subject to Government Actuary overview; (b) identification of assets would need to be justified on the basis of actuarial soundness and life 41 insurance/superannuation equity; (c) any sale of assets between life insurance/superannuation which occurred after the initial separation would be subject to normal commercial practice and involve liability for stamp duty and income tax. There also appeared to be general agreement on the following methodology: 1 identify all assets relating to (i) market-valued life insurance business (ii) market-valued superannuation business (iii) capital guaranteed superannuation business 2 apportion the balance of the assets between life insurance and superannuation in proportion to the actuarial liabilities. This separation would be based on market values. The Committee is in agreement with those principles and that methodology. Whilst the point does not appear to have been considered by the Joint Working Party or the LOA, the Committee notes that some problems may arise in connection with a large property investment, for example. In such an instance, it may be necessary for the Government Actuary, Inland Revenue, and life office to agree on a percentage apportionment of the investment between the life office and the superannuation entity. Recommendations The Committee recommends that: a life offices not be inhibited from transferring their superannuation business to a separate entity; b the separate entity be a registered superannuation scheme; c the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 be amended to permit a registered superannuation scheme to be a member of another registered superannuation scheme; d the transfer of assets to the new entity (i) should be free of stamp duty (ii) should not give rise to income tax liability (iii) should be in accordance with the principles and methodology stated in section 3.11 42 (iv) should be completed by 1 April 1991 if recommendations d(i) and d(ii) are to apply; e any superannuation business remaining in a life office after 31 March 1991 should be regarded as life insurance business for the purpose of taxing the life office. 43 CHAPTER 4 - THE TAX TREATMENT OF LIFE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS 4.1 Introduction This chapter considers the income tax treatment of life and disability insurance premiums and claims in the hands of policyholders. It covers "keyperson" policies taken out by employers in respect of key employees, as well as policies taken out by individuals for their own benefit (or the benefit of their families). Disability policies are considered alongside life policies because disability policies often contain a life insurance element. The chapter proceeds by considering the present tax treatment of premiums and claims in the hands of policyholders and looking at the link between life and disability policies. It then discusses the theoretically correct method of treating insurance premiums and claims, of all kinds, in the hands of policyholders. Next, the chapter considers whether making a change to the present tax treatment of life and disability premiums and claims would create any boundary problems with other types of insurance. Finally, it addresses any problems that may arise in the transition to a new tax treatment of life and disability policies, and makes recommendations. 4.2 Problems with the Present Treatment 4.2.1 The present treatment Under the present system, life and disability insurance policies are treated differently depending on a variety of factors, including who owns the policy, who benefits from the policy, the form of the benefits, and the essential nature of the insurance contract (eg insurance versus savings). Term life insurance and disability policies taken out by employers in respect of key employees (for the employer's benefit) are subject to an Exempt/Taxed/Taxed regime. Premiums are deductible, any investment income earned by the insurance company from investing the premiums is assessable, and claims are assessable. Policies of disability insurance taken out by individuals to provide a replacement income are subject to the same treatment. Most other life and disability insurance policies are subject to a Taxed/Taxed/Exempt regime. Premiums are non-deductible (or deductible and subject to FBT), investment income earned by the insurance company is assessable, and the claims are tax-exempt. The Committee's understanding of the present treatment of life and disability premiums and claims is set out in more detail in 44 the Appendix. 4.2.2 The link between life and disability insurance Disability policies are similar in nature to pure life insurance. Both are taken out to provide financial security, either for the individual, the individual's family, or for the individual's employer, in the face of possible events which curtail income-earning activity. Premiums are therefore incurred to provide compensation in the event of the loss of a capital asset, namely an individual's human capital. Life insurance policies generally provide insurance against premature death, while disability policies insure against disablement. Disability policies usually pay pensions as against the lump sums paid under life insurance. However, the form of the payment should be irrelevant for tax purposes. 4.2.3 Problems with the present treatment The first problem with the present system is that it seems to lack a consistent basis. The law is somewhat unclear and this has caused difficulty for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Another problem arises from the potentially inconsistent treatment of life and disability policies taken out by individuals. Since disability policies may be written so as to contain a life insurance element, these policies could possibly be used to avoid the non-deductibility of life policy premiums. For those policies subject to an Exempt/Taxed/Taxed regime, the justification for deductibility of premiums has been that the expenditure is incurred in order to earn assessable income. Since it is generally not necessary to take out life or disability insurance to earn current income (although a partnership deed will sometimes require this to be done, for example), the assessable income in question is generally the claim paid on death or disability. However, since it is not at all certain that such income will ever be received by the taxpayer, the link with assessable income in these cases is tenuous. With respect to term life and disablement insurance policies taken out for the benefit of employers, it may be argued that these policies are similar in nature to general insurance against, say, damage of business premises. Premiums for the latter are currently deductible and it may therefore be suggested that term life and disability insurance premiums should be deductible on the same basis. However, the analysis in the next section suggests that the tax treatment of general insurance may itself be inappropriate. 45 4.3 How Should Insurance Premiums and Claims be Taxed in the Hands of Policyholders? 4.3.1 The theory Determining the theoretically correct tax treatment of insurance premiums (of all kinds) is complicated by two factors. Firstly, some types of insurance, namely life and disability insurance, may be taken out by an employer for the benefit of that employer or for the benefit of an employee. Employees may also take out life or disability cover themselves. Individuals may take out a life policy for "family protection" purposes, but subsequently assign it to a bank, for example, as security for a loan to be used for business purposes. The difficulty here is the recurrent problem of drawing a line between business and private expenditure. Secondly, the premium itself is composed of four different elements which, in theory, should be considered separately for tax purposes. The elements are as follows: a underwriting fee: this is incurred by the policyholder to pay the insurance company to undertake the risk spreading function; b expected loss: this is paid to the insurance company and pooled with amounts paid by other policyholders to be redistributed to those suffering the insured loss; c financial intermediation fee: this is incurred to pay for any investment services provided by the insurance company; d savings deposit: the amount to be invested by the insurance company and returned to the policyholder with earnings. The appropriate tax treatment of each of these elements is discussed and then summarised in table form below. i Underwriting fee When a business takes out fire insurance, for example, it is deciding to buy a risk-spreading service instead of undertaking that risk itself. This appears to be similar to the decision to purchase other goods and services used in the business rather than to manufacture or to provide them within the firm. The cost of purchasing this service should therefore be deductible to the insured and assessable to the insurer where the insurance covers a business-related risk. In line with the general principle that non-business expenditure is non-deductible, underwriting fees paid in respect of non-business risks should be non-deductible. 46 An individual who insures against the loss of the individual's own human capital, eg by taking out a disability policy, could be argued to be insuring a business whose assets consist of the individual's human capital. It may therefore be argued that an individual should be able to deduct the underwriting fee. The problem with this argument is that the risk of death or disablement does not arise as a result of being in business, although the level of the risk will vary with the nature of the business (eg top-dressing pilot versus bank clerk). It follows that the underwriting fee should not be deductible to individuals in the circumstances described. ii Expected loss When businesses or individuals take out insurance (of any kind) they are using the insurance company to establish a reserve to meet some of the future contingencies of the policyholders as a group. Other taxpayers achieve the same objective in different ways. For example, producer co-operatives establish reserves for the purpose of stabilising members' incomes. Such reserves are not tax-deductible because they do not represent a reduction in income earned in the year the payment to the reserve is made. Rather, payments to the reserve represent current income that is being set aside or saved to be used at a later date. When claims are paid out to policyholders who have suffered a loss, there is a transfer of wealth amongst the group of policyholders who have contributed to the reserve. No income is generated by this process. Accordingly, the Committee considers that the expected loss element of the premium should be paid from after-tax income and that claims met from this source should not be assessable. This applies irrespective of who benefits from the policy (ie an individual; an individual's family, business partners or creditors; or an employer) and whether the policy covers business or non-business risks. iii Financial intermediation fee Since this is incurred to earn assessable interest income, it should be deductible to both businesses and individuals. iv Savings deposit Consistent with the normal income tax treatment of savings, this element of the premium should not be deductible to businesses or to individuals. Since the earnings on the savings deposit will have been taxed to the insurance company (which is the intention of the present tax regimes for insurance), the savings deposit plus earnings should be non-assessable when returned to policyholders as claims. The following table summarises the Committee's conclusions on the theoretically correct treatment of the different components of insurance policy premiums and claims. For completeness, the 47 third column shows how the element of the premium should be treated in the hands of the insurance company. 48 Tax treatment of insurance premiums and claims a Premiums treatment in treatment in policyholder's hands hands of the insurance co Private Business- Element(non-business)related of premiumriskrisk Underwriting fee non-deductdeductibleassessable Expected loss Financial non-deduct non-deductnon-assess intermediation feedeductible deductibleassessable Savings depositnon-deduct non-deductnon-assess b Claims Element of claim Expected loss Savings plus non-assessnon-assessnon-deduct earningsnon-assessnon-assessnon-deduct The table indicates that the correct treatment of premiums is not clear-cut. This is because some components of the premium should be deductible while others should be non-deductible. However, in the Committee's view, it would be impractical to attempt to differentiate between these elements for tax purposes. The treatment of premiums and claims for policies covering private and business risks are discussed further below. 4.3.2 Policies covering private risks In respect of premiums paid to cover private or non-business risks, a fairly strong case can be made for non-deductibility. This is the current treatment of all policies covering private risks except disablement policies providing replacement income. The Committee considers that such premiums should, in theory, be non-deductible. Claims would of course become non-assessable. 4.3.3 Policies covering business-related risks In respect of premiums paid to cover business-related risks, a case could be made for either a Taxed/Taxed/Exempt or an Exempt/Taxed/Taxed treatment. Three options for dealing with these policies are set out below. a Premiums deductible, claims assessable Under this option both the expected loss and the savings elements of premiums would be deductible. Thus we would have an Exempt/Taxed/Taxed regime for savings set aside to meet future contingencies where this was done through an insurance company. This would run counter to standard income tax treatment. On the positive side, the underwriting and financial intermediation fees would be appropriately treated. b Premiums non-deductible, claims non-assessable This option would give the correct treatment of the expected loss and any savings deposit element of premiums. It would, however, involve a penal treatment of underwriting and intermediation fees which should, in theory, be deductible. c X% of the premium deductible, claims non-assessable This option is intended to approximate the theoretically correct treatment by allowing a deduction for the proportion of the premium charged for underwriting and financial intermediation services. The proportion would probably be fairly small. The same method could potentially be used in the formulation of underwriting income for inclusion in the tax base of life insurance companies. The main difficulty with this option is that the proportion of the premium made up by underwriting and financial intermediation fees will differ amongst policies. The proportion chosen would therefore be somewhat arbitrary. On the other hand, if the same proportion was used in the insurance company's tax base, the use of an approximation would not appear to create any gaps in the tax base, nor would the resulting treatment overtax these activities. 4.3.4 The Committee's view The Committee's view is that the preferred treatment of policies covering business-related risks is to make premiums non-deductible and claims non-assessable. This treatment would have the advantage of being consistent with the Committee's preferred treatment of policies covering private risks. It would therefore provide a uniform treatment of all policies and avoid the need for Inland Revenue to make judgements as to whether the exact nature of particular policies is term life, savings life or disability replacement income. 49 4.4 Boundary Problems The issue here is whether changes should be made to the treatment of life and disability premiums and claims without making similar changes for other types of insurance. Inconsistent treatments of different types of insurance could create incentives to rearrange insurance contracts to be more tax-effective. Given that life and disability policies cover the loss of human capital, as opposed to other types of capital asset, it would be possible to identify such policies and apply a separate tax treatment. However, a potential problem arises in respect of loss of profits policies which may cover the risk of losses of human or non-human capital. The premiums for loss of profits policies are currently deductible under section 104(a) and the income from such policies is taxable under section 65. If premiums for disability and life policies were made non-deductible in isolation, businesses would have an incentive to switch to loss of profits policies in order to be able to deduct the premiums. 4.5 Transitional Problems Switching to a Taxed/Taxed/Exempt regime for disability insurance policies which are currently subject to an Exempt/Taxed/Taxed regime would give rise to windfall losses for those insurance companies carrying such policies on their books. This is because the payments would become tax-free and it would therefore suddenly be relatively more attractive for policyholders to become disabled, and stay disabled for a longer period of time as there would be a financial disincentive to return to work. That is not to say that individuals would deliberately seek to become and to remain disabled. Rather, the Committee considers that there would be an increase in claims payments relating to disabilities that are difficult to verify (eg back problems). Two factors mitigate these concerns. Firstly, insurance companies already have to deal with the moral hazard problems of insurance, ie they have mechanisms for investigating the validity of claims. Secondly, tax changes invariably impose windfall gains and losses on taxpayers. However, this is not generally used to argue against a proposed change. Rather it may be an argument for some transitional arrangements to assist in the adjustment process. The Committee notes that the recent change to the tax treatment of annuities was accompanied by legislation permitting life offices to adjust annuity contracts. A similar approach could be taken in the case of disability policies. 4.6 Conclusion The Committee considers that the best approach would be to make all life and disability premiums non-deductible and claims non-assessable. However, this treatment would not be consistent 50 with that currently applying to fire and general insurance. In particular, the treatment would not be consistent with the treatment of loss of profits insurance policies. Moving all life and disability policies to a Taxed/Taxed/Exempt regime could therefore create incentives for insurance contracts to be rearranged. Some existing contracts would also be disrupted. In the light of these problems, the Committee's view is that the present regime for life and disability premiums and claims should remain in place until the tax treatment of fire and general insurance is reviewed by the Government. In the meantime, the Committee considers that it would be useful to legislate the current treatment. Recommendations The Committee recommends that: a the tax treatment of all life, disability, and fire and general insurance premiums and claims be reviewed and consideration given to making all such premiums non-deductible and claims non-assessable; b the current treatment of life and disability insurance premiums and claims be retained in the meantime; and c the current Inland Revenue interpretation of the tax law relating to life and disability premiums and claims be translated into legislation. 51 APPENDIX - PRESENT TAX TREATMENT OF LIFE AND DISABILITY PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS As noted in section 4.2.3 above, the present tax treatment of life and disability premiums and benefits is somewhat unclear. To remove the present uncertainty, the Committee proposes that the current tax law relating to life and disability premiums and claims be clarified, in general by translating into legislation current Inland Revenue Department policy. The Committee's understanding of that policy is set out below. 1 Life Insurance Purchased by an Employer - Benefits for Employees Premiums are deductible to employers as part of employee remuneration. Premiums are included as "expenditure on account" and assessable to an employee if the employee has an indefeasible right to benefits otherwise than on death, or if the policy has a cash surrender right. Otherwise, premiums are subject to FBT. Benefits paid under such policies are non-assessable. 2 Life Insurance On Lives of Employees Purchased by an Employer - Benefits for Employer The Inland Revenue Department's Public Information Bulletin 106 states that a deduction is allowed where the policy is a term policy on the life of an employee. Benefits are then assessable. If the policy is an endowment or whole-of-life policy on the life of a "key" employee taken out for the purpose of protection of profits, premiums are non-deductible and benefits are assessed to the extent to which they exceed premium payments. 3 Life Insurance Purchased by an Individual There are no deductions for premiums paid on such policies and benefits are not assessable. 4 Income Maintenance Policies Purchased by an Individual The Committee understands that a deduction is available for premiums (under sec 104) if benefits are assessable. Since most benefits under such policies are calculated on the basis of loss of profits or earnings they do not qualify for the income tax exemption under section 61(40). Accordingly, most benefits are assessable under section 65(2) (1) or (j). Therefore, in general, premiums are deductible and benefits are assessable. 5 Income Maintenance Policies Purchased by an Employer - Benefit to Employee Premiums on such policies are deductible to the employer as employee remuneration. Premiums are assessable to the employee if the employee can convert the policy to cash. Otherwise, the premiums should be subject to FBT. Benefits are assessable if 52 calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. 6 Income Maintenance Policy Purchased by an Employer - Benefit to Employer The Inland Revenue Department's Public Information Bulletin 106 states that a deduction is allowed where the policy insures the continued availability of an employee. Benefits are then assessable. A deduction is not otherwise available. 53 CHAPTER 5 - THE TAX TREATMENT OF FRIENDLY SOCIETIES 5.1 Introduction Friendly societies are mutual associations set up to provide financial and other assistance to members and their families in times of need, principally sickness, old age and death. Their operations are based on insurance principles and mutual sharing of risk, with benefits being paid from funds accumulated from the contributions of members. However the traditional friendly society provides more than just financial assistance. The regular meetings of members are occasions for social as well as business activity. The strength of the fraternal organisation must be appreciated to have a complete understanding of the nature of the traditional friendly societies. While these fraternal activities are undoubtedly of benefit to members and others, it is the financial aspects of friendly societies upon which one must focus in determining an appropriate tax basis. Friendly societies are currently exempted from income tax by Section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act. The removal of this special tax concession applying to friendly societies was first announced in the Government's Economic Statement of 17 December 1987. This announcement was followed by the release of Volume 2 of the Government's Consultative Document (CD) which set out options for taxing friendly societies in Chapter 6. The discussion and recommendations in this chapter relate to the income tax treatment of all friendly societies including those involved in health insurance. Members of health insurance friendly societies have also benefited from a concessional treatment of premiums which is discussed in the next chapter. That chapter also canvasses the arguments for and against tax incentives for health insurance generally. 5.2 Options Proposed in the Consultative Document The CD discussed the following three alternatives for taxing the insurance and investment activities of friendly societies. a Option 1 - Tax as non-mutuals This approach would apply the same regime to friendly societies as applies to fire and general insurers. The tax basis would be premiums received, plus investment income, less claims paid and less expenses. The CD noted that this tax treatment has the drawback that there would be the incentive for friendly societies to set premium and interest rates on loans to members in a way that minimised taxable profit. Thus commercial decisions would tend to be distorted by the tax system. With the ability to minimise tax in this way, friendly societies would have a competitive advantage 54 over other non-mutual organisations. For these reasons the CD recommended that if this option were adopted, it would be desirable to maintain at least some of the existing regulatory controls. Comment The difficulty with the "fire and general" income basis of option 1 is that in respect to long-term business such as funeral benefits, the net income in a given year, without allowance for accruing liabilities, is not a true measure of profit. Some of that income must be set aside for future claims. For small friendly societies the cost of actuarially adjusting income would be prohibitive. We accept the comment in the CD that there is scope for a mutual organisation to reduce tax by providing benefits at lower than the market rate, thereby eroding the tax base. This is discussed further below. b Option 2 - Market related income tax treatment This option aimed to prevent a tax advantage arising from the opportunity to return profits to members in the form of reduced premiums for a given level of benefits, or by charging reduced rates of interest on loans to members. The CD suggested applying an objective benchmark market price for services offered, against which the effective discount being offered by the friendly society would be calculated. The discount would then be added to the assessable income of the friendly society. A similar concept already exists in section 22(3) of the Income Tax Act. There is also a provision in respect of concessionary loans to members of superannuation schemes (section 232A of the Act). The CD noted that this option would result in a non-concessionary tax regime and thus allow for the relaxation of regulatory controls. Comment The CD discussed a difficulty with option 2 in that given the dominance of friendly societies in health insurance business, the information to assess the market price for those services offered by friendly societies is likely to be thin. Difficulties will also arise in establishing the objective benchmark prices, as prices charged by non-mutual companies will vary. With the exception of concessional loans to members (dealt with under paragraph 5.4.6) the Committee does not believe the application of a market related income tax treatment to be practical. In practice we believe there is little other difference between the premiums charged by mutuals and non-mutuals. Although with the introduction of a tax regime there is the potential for 55 minimising tax by reducing premiums to members, any prudent insurer will continue to focus on the risk element rather than tax considerations. c Option 3 - Taxation of net investment income The final CD option is to tax friendly societies on investment income net of investment expenses. This approach is to treat friendly societies essentially as investment or savings vehicles. The approach capitalises on the incentive for friendly societies to maximise returns from the investment of funds. The CD noted that this option would not achieve a non- concessionary tax regime unless the option 2 discount on interest charged to members was included in assessable income, or a certain proportion of funds was required to be invested with non-members. Comment Although this option is similar to the present tax base for life offices, in view of the new proposals for the taxation of life offices the Committee believes option 3 would unfairly penalise friendly societies by allowing a deduction for investment expenses only rather than full expenses. We also perceive a problem for societies in distinguishing general overheads between investment business and other business. We consider that any requirement to invest funds with non-members would unreasonably interfere with the operations of friendly societies and would be ineffective unless all funds were invested at arms-length. 5.3 Submissions Received The Committee received a total of 22 submissions relating to friendly societies: New Zealand Council of Friendly Societies 1 medical care societies 2 traditional friendly societies 9 actuaries and consultants 2 UFS Dispensaries 1 other 7 We met with representatives from the New Zealand Council of Friendly Societies, Manchester Unity Friendly Society and Southern Cross. (Submissions relating particularly to concessions for health insurance are discussed in the next chapter.) Some of the recommendations made in the submissions have been accepted by the Committee and are discussed in later paragraphs. Other matters raised deserve some comment at this stage. 56 Several of the submissions argued that the voluntary unpaid work carried out by many officers of friendly societies should be recognised and allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. They objected to the taxing of the results of voluntary efforts. However the Committee was not sympathetic to this argument. If that work was in fact paid, rather than voluntary, then tax would accrue on the payments in the hands of those officers. While it is admirable that officers donate the after-tax value of their efforts, it does not seem reasonable for the friendly society to expect a tax deduction for services obtained at no cost to the society. Several submissions also requested continued tax exemption to recognise the social role of friendly societies in assisting members in need, but the Committee was not persuaded by the argument. Many other people and organisations fulfil a similar role without special tax or other assistance. The mutuality principle was also discussed in a number of submissions. It was argued that friendly societies are groups of individuals effectively trading with themselves, that it is impossible to make a profit with oneself, and that they should therefore not be liable to tax. This argument was not accepted by the Committee. Friendly societies are little different from mutual life assurance companies in this respect. This aspect is discussed further in Chapter 7 on credit unions. Two submissions sought tax at 50 percent of the "normal" rate if the present restrictive controls embodied in the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act are not relaxed. We understand that the Act is currently being reviewed to place friendly societies (and credit unions) as much as possible in a neutral competitive position with other organisations with minimal restrictions and advantages. 5.4 Proposed Basis of Taxation for Friendly Societies The business of friendly societies has counterparts in other organisational forms. For example, health insurance is written by industrial and provident societies and insurance companies as well as friendly societies. Again life insurance and annuities are provided by both life insurance companies and friendly societies. It is therefore important that the tax regime for any particular business activity is the same or essentially similar regardless of the organisational form under which the business is operated. Otherwise not only might tax revenue be lost but business will be distorted towards that organisational form with the lowest tax burden. Essentially therefore the aim is to tax friendly societies on the component parts of their business as for other businesses in those areas. For example the health insurance business of a friendly society should be taxed as for any other health insurer and the life assurance business of a friendly society should be taxed as for a life office. 57 There is another aim for an appropriate tax basis for friendly societies and this, to a certain extent, acts contrary to the first aim. Friendly societies are frequently administered by voluntary and non-professional people, particularly in the smaller societies. This argues for simplicity in the definition of the tax base. Also the level of business operations in many societies is so low that a reasonable basis for say a life office might involve compliance costs which would cripple a small friendly society. If the tax basis is modified to meet the requirements of simplicity and minimum compliance cost, there will need to be limits on the application of the modified basis. 5.4.1 Medical business The medical business of friendly societies should be taxed on the same basis as proposed for other health insurers i.e. as for a fire and general insurer. The concept is that the business is short-term in nature and the profits of such medical business are essentially total premiums received, plus investment income (including net realised investment gains), less claims paid and all investment and management expenses. Management expenses will include the costs of acquiring new business. 5.4.2 Other insurance business Other insurance business conducted by friendly societies tends to be either of a savings nature or of a long-term insurance nature, requiring the establishment of reserves to meet future claims. In this sense they are similar to the operation of a life office. Accordingly the tax rules for life offices should apply to this business (refer to Chapter 2 of this report). However we accept that the complexities of such a tax regime, if applied to all the non-medical insurance business of friendly societies, would involve excessive compliance costs, particularly as the potential tax revenue is not great. The level of many friendly society operations is low and the cost of annual actuarial valuation of all funds would be prohibitive. The Committee feels that the business insured through the life assurance funds of friendly societies should be capable of annual valuation without excessive cost. This is already carried out by some of the major societies and contemplated by others and would be desirable from the point of view of timely bonus declaration, rather than the five-yearly valuations of the past. The Committee therefore recommends that those life assurance funds pay tax as for a life insurance company. Societies commonly operate funds insuring sickness, annuity and funeral benefits. The funeral funds usually provide benefits at very low levels, essentially to cover, or pay part of, the costs of a funeral. They are usually based on standard tables of contributions and benefits and differ from the flexibility offered through the life assurance funds. Provided these other 58 death/funeral benefits (i.e. other than benefits insured through the life assurance funds) do not exceed $5,000 (including bonuses) and sickness and annuity benefits do not exceed $600 (including bonuses) per annum, in respect of any member, we consider that an option should be available for friendly societies to return income for tax purposes on a simplified basis for those funds viz. investment income (including net realised investment gains) less all investment and management expenses. Any amounts above these limits would need to be insured through the life assurance fund. Otherwise the whole of the insurance business of the society would be liable to tax as for life insurance companies. The limits are designed to avoid the scope for other insurers to reduce their tax liabilities by setting up as a friendly society. For this reason it would also be necessary to require that any annuity business written after 31 March 1990 is insured through the life assurance fund. Friendly societies frequently operate a number of other funds (e.g. benevolent funds, surplus funds covering distributions of past surplus allocated to individual member's accounts). These other insurance/savings funds could reasonably fall within the above simplified tax option. The Committee accordingly recommends that the above simplified tax basis may be used for all the insurance and savings-type activities of friendly societies, other than medical and life assurance, provided they do not exceed the above limits. The option for the simplified tax basis of investment income less all expenses does provide a concession by allowing all management expenses as a tax deduction, as the expenses will include costs relating to insurance underwriting business, rather than only investment expenses. In view of the advantages arising from ease of compliance, the restrictions of societies adopting the simplified option, and the small loss of tax revenue, the Committee believes that the concession is justified. 5.4.3 Other business If the current review of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act empowers friendly societies to undertake business other than medical, sickness, funeral and life assurance then such other business should be taxed as for business of that type carried out by other organisations. 5.4.4 Deductible expenditure As mentioned earlier, an important part of the activities of many friendly societies revolves around the fraternal or social aspects. The costs associated with these social activities should be met from taxed income. 59 We therefore recommend that allowable expenses for tax purposes should include only those expenses incurred in gaining investment income and in acquiring and administering the financial business of friendly societies. The costs relating to social activities should be disallowed. Despite the submissions which refer to extensive voluntary work by officers, the administration expenses of friendly societies appear to be very high. In 1987, administration expenses of the traditional friendly societies totalled over $7 million (including expenses relating to fraternal activities) and compared with total financial benefits of $5.8 million (sickness, death and annuity benefits) provided by those societies. 5.4.5 Capital gains The Committee considers that friendly societies can be regarded as similar in nature to the banking and general insurance industries, which are taxed on net realised capital gains in accordance with general law (rather than by a specific tax on capital gains). Given the investment activities of friendly societies, this approach will mean that in most instances tax will be payable on realised capital gains. 5.4.6 Low interest loans to members In the Committee's view, the relationship between a friendly society and its members is similar to that between a company and its shareholders. The Government has proposed that a company providing low interest loans to shareholders should be subject to FBT on the extent to which the interest rate on loans to shareholders is less than the prescribed rate for FBT purposes. This recognises the fact that such loans are an alternative means of distributing corporate income to shareholders. We can see no justification for a general exemption from this rule with respect to friendly societies. Where members receive loans on non-commercial terms relating to interest ("non-commercial" terms of interest being less than the rate as determined for fringe benefit tax purposes), the Committee recommends that the discount on interest actually charged to members should be subject to FBT. This treatment will not preclude friendly societies from charging low rates of interest on loans to members, but it will prevent a tax advantage from doing so. The calculation of the interest discount shall be determined, not on an individual loan by loan basis, but rather by determining the average yield on all non-commercial loans to members. This calculation will be done on a quarterly basis as follows. A loan will be included as "non-commercial" in a quarter if the interest charged over the quarter is less than the FBT rate applied to the amount of the loan. Interest at the prescribed 60 quarterly rate for FBT purposes will be calculated on the average of each quarter's opening and closing total non-commercial loans to members. The total interest charged during the quarter in respect of those loans will then be subtracted. FBT, currently at the rate of 49%, will be charged quarterly on the discount so determined. The Committee recognises that the above recommendation might significantly change the way in which some small friendly societies have operated, without the prospect of substantial tax revenue, and accordingly recommends that the smaller friendly societies be exempt from the requirement to pay FBT on low interest loans to members. The Committee proposes that a friendly society be exempt from this requirement in each quarter where: - the organisation existed and had assets under $lm as at 1/4/89; and - the organisation has assets under $lm at all times during the quarter. Our proposal would exempt the small friendly societies presently in existence. Currently, only about 15 friendly societies have assets over $lm. All new friendly societies would have to pay FBT on interest discounts irrespective of the organisation's size. 5.4.7 Tax rate In general, submissions argued that a concessional rate of tax should apply to friendly societies. It was contended that a lower tax rate is justified in order to equate the tax rate for friendly societies with the lower tax rates applying to the incomes of most members. Many submissions also pointed to the income that arose through the voluntary work of members in the organisation of friendly societies. Several suggested the tax rate for friendly societies should be 50% of the company rate. Some comment on these matters has already been made in paragraph 5.3. The Committee did not accept the arguments for a concessional rate of tax. We concluded that the friendly society tax rate needs to be set having regard to the marginal tax rates of friendly society members and that a 33% tax rate is appropriate under the current tax structure. When considering the personal tax rate structure regard has to be had to effective tax rates, not just the nominal tax rates set out in the First Schedule of the Income Tax Act. Effective tax rates include the national superannuitant surcharge and the abatement of various income support measures, such as the low income rebate and family support. The Committee is also of the opinion that the tax rate for friendly societies should be the same as that for life insurance policy holders. To apply a lower tax rate for friendly societies might encourage other organisations to set up as 61 friendly societies in order to reduce their tax liabilities. 5.4.8 Implementation date The Consultative Document proposed that friendly societies be subject to tax as from 1st April, 1989. The Minister of Finance has since announced that the new tax regime for friendly societies will not apply before the income year commencing 1st April, 1990. The Committee considers that the application of the new tax provisions from the income year commencing 1st April, 1990 is appropriate to enable friendly societies to establish the necessary accounting procedures. This means that for any balance dates falling between 1 October 1990 and 30 September 1991 tax would be payable on business conducted over the full year ending on that date. Valuations of assets will be required as at the commencement of that first tax year for determining capital gains. Recommendations The Committee recommends that: a the medical business of friendly societies be taxed as for other health insurers, ie as for a fire and general insurer. The tax base would then be premiums received plus investment income less claims paid less all investment and management expenses; b the life insurance funds of friendly societies be taxed as for life insurance companies (refer to Chapter 2); c all the funeral, sickness and annuity insurance business of friendly societies be allowed a simplified tax base of investment income less all investment and management expenses, provided that business does not exceed specified limits. Otherwise the life insurance company basis would apply; d general tax law (rather than a specific tax) apply to realised capital gains; e any interest discount on loans to members, as measured by reference to the prescribed FBT interest rate, be subject to FBT, except where the friendly society: - existed and had assets under $lm as at 1/4/89; and - has assets under $lm at all times during the quarter; f the tax rate applying to the income of friendly societies should reflect the effective marginal tax rate of members, at present 33%; and g taxation of the income of all friendly societies apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. 62 5.5 Tax Treatment of Other Structures 5.5.1 Sickness, accident and death benefit trust funds The above funds are at present exempted from income tax by Section 61(41) of the Income Tax Act. The Consultative Document proposed that as a transitional measure those funds be taxed on a net investment income basis, including net income from realised investments, as from 1 April 1988 at the rate of 25%. Further, the Consultative Document suggested transitional measures for the payment of provisional tax. The Consultative Document noted that the treatment of such funds from the 1989/90 tax year would be reviewed when the tax regime for friendly societies was determined. No legislation with regard to these changes has yet been passed. Recommendations The Committee recommends that: a the tax base for sickness, accident and death benefit trust funds be premiums received plus investment income (including net realised capital gains) less claims paid less all investment and management expenses; b the tax applies from the income year commencing 1st April 1990; c the tax rate should reflect the effective marginal tax rate of members, at present 33%; and d no concessions apply for provisional tax payments. 5.5.2 Other societies registered under Part II of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act Section 11(1) of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act makes provisions for differing types of societies. Section 11(1)(a) provides for the friendly societies upon which the discussion in paragraph 3 has been based. Section 11(1)(b) allows registration of benevolent societies which provide benefits similar to friendly societies but with a lesser degree of security. Long term costing of the affordability of benefits is not carried out but nevertheless significant reserves are usually built up for future claims. In practice their operations are more in the nature of fire and general insurance. Benevolent societies are therefore essentially very similar to sickness, accident and death benefit trust funds and the same tax treatment should apply. Section 11(1)(d) provides for specially authorised societies. 63 The only two societies registered under the subsection provide fidelity insurance for officers of friendly societies. As these activities are in the nature of fire and general insurance the Committee considers that the tax basis should again follow that for sickness, accident and death benefit trust funds. 5.5.3 Trade unions and working mens clubs Our terms of reference did not appear to include these organisations. The Committee sees no reason why they should not be taxed on their income. By virtue of the definition of friendly society in the Income Tax Act, these organisations are exempted from income tax for business carried on within their membership circle by Section 61(23) of the Act. A total repeal of Section 61(23) would bring the income of these organisations to tax. The Committee also noted that trade associations and employer organisations are already taxed. On the other hand, the Committee is aware that few trade unions expected that their tax position would be considered as part of the present review. Accordingly, only a few submissions were received from these groups. 5.5.4 United Friendly Society (UFS) dispensaries UFS Dispensaries are pharmacies owned by groups of friendly societies whose members received discounted goods and services. As the Consultative Document notes, their registration as friendly societies has been found to be inappropriate (and illegal under the FSCU Act) and an amendment to the Pharmacy Act is being prepared to enable UFS Dispensaries to register under that Act. They would then automatically be subject to company tax on all their business. At present they pay tax only on a portion of their business, broadly being the proportion of business conducted with non-members. 64 CHAPTER 6 - THE TAX TREATMENT OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS 6.1 Introduction The Consultative Document (CD) noted that while some general insurance companies and industrial and provident societies offer health insurance, this type of cover is primarily provided by friendly societies. The largest insurer is the Southern Cross Medical Care Society, which has a current membership of over 1 million. Other organisations offering medical insurance include New Zealand Medicare Society, Aetna Health Corporation Limited, Medic Aid Fund Society, Health Care Fund of the Druids Friendly Society, and Union Medical Benefits Society Limited. Total expenditure on health insurance in 1987 would have been approximately $100 million. The CD noted that in New Zealand health insurance involves the partial or full cover of private hospital and practitioner expenses in return for an annual premium. Benefits may also be provided in the form of income support payments, funeral benefits or through the waiving of premiums. In addition to the major insurers, many other friendly societies provide health insurance on a smaller scale. The tax treatment of friendly societies was considered in Chapter 5 above. The recommendations made in that chapter apply to all friendly societies, including those involved in health insurance. This chapter focuses on the tax treatment of health insurance contributions/premiums paid to friendly societies and other health insurers and the benefits received from these organisations. It also canvasses the arguments made in the CD and submissions concerning tax concessions for health insurance. 6.2 The Previous Treatment 6.2.1 Premiums/contributions paid by the individual The exemption for an individual taxpayer for health insurance premiums was tied into the exemption for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions. Under section 59 of the Income Tax Act taxpayers were able to claim an exemption for premiums or contributions to funds providing benefits in the event of sickness, accident or death up to a maximum of $1,200 per year where the taxpayer was also a member of a subsidised superannuation scheme and $1,400 per year for other taxpayers. Payments that have been claimable under the exemption include: - premiums on personal accident or sickness insurance; 65 - payments to any insurance fund of a friendly society of which the taxpayer was a member on or before 8 November 1984; - payments to any insurance fund of a friendly society providing benefits solely in respect of accident, disease, sickness or expenses consequent on death; - payments to any fund providing benefits solely in respect of accident, disease, sickness or expenses consequent on death where the fund was approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Premiums on policies providing replacement income have also been deductible under section 104 since the proceeds of such policies have been assessable. 6.2.2 Premiums/contributions paid by the employer Premiums or contributions paid by employers for health insurance in respect of employees have generally been deductible under normal tax principles, being a business related expense. An exemption from Fringe Benefit Tax was provided under section 336N where an employer paid premiums or made contributions on behalf of employees to funds providing benefits in the event of sickness, accident or death. Qualifying payments were: - premiums on personal accident or sickness insurance; - payment to any insurance fund of a friendly society of which the taxpayer was a member; - payments to any fund providing benefits solely in respect of accident, disease, sickness or expenses consequent on death where the fund was approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 6.2.3 Benefits Section 61(39) of the Income Tax Act exempts income derived, in respect of any incapacity for work, from a friendly society or from a sickness, accident or death benefit fund to which the person was a contributor at the start of the period of incapacity. Similar benefits paid under a policy of sickness or accident insurance are exempt by virtue of section 61(40) unless the payments are calculated according to loss of profits or earnings in which case they are taxed. 6.3 The Arguments For and Against Tax Concessions - The CD The CD set out arguments against the need for tax concessions in the area of health insurance. These arguments are restated in brief below. 66 6.3.1 The distribution of benefits from the concessions The CD referred to a survey by the Health Benefits Review Committee that demonstrated that between 1.1 and 1.3 million New Zealanders held private medical insurance in 1986. The CD commented that approximately 35 percent of the population aged 15 or over held full private medical insurance. Coverage was found to vary markedly depending on factors such as age and income. Coverage was found to be most common amongst the 36 to 50 age group - 47 percent of this group held medical insurance. Despite the fact that the elderly are proportionately the heaviest users of health services, the survey found that only 13 percent of those in the 65+ age group were insured. Coverage for those employed in the paid labour force was estimated at 42 percent compared with 24 percent for the rest of the adult population. The survey results also showed that coverage was below average amongst individuals experiencing recent or chronic ill health. The distribution of private medical insurance by household income was also uneven. The survey found that coverage amongst those in the higher household income brackets was 47 percent, while only 27 percent of those in the lower household income brackets held private medical insurance. The CD noted that the associated distribution of tax concessions for health insurance was more heavily weighted toward higher income households than these statistics suggest because tax concessions given in the form of exemptions of income (or deductions from assessable income) are of greater value to those on higher marginal tax rates. The CD concluded that the major beneficiaries of the tax concessions have been those who are less likely to need care and those less likely to experience financial difficulty in obtaining access to care. 6.3.2 Effect on the demand for public health services The CD considered whether subsidised health insurance led to a reduction in the demand for public health services. It concluded that in the short term greater use of private health services is not likely to reduce pressures on public services. Another argument discussed in the CD was that the private health sector should be encouraged because it is considered more efficient than the public sector. The CD concluded that if the private sector is indeed more efficient, that in itself does not imply that tax concessions for public health insurance are necessary. It was suggested that a more appropriate response would be for Government to purchase services from the private sector directly - for example by contracting for the provision of services for the public. 67 6.3.3 Effect on the allocation of resources The CD referred to the inefficiency of the current system whereby the costs of health services are borne by three different funders, namely individuals, insurance companies, and government. It noted that where funding is shared in that way between three parties, there is little incentive for any one of the parties to control the expenditure on the services being supplied. The CD commented that insured individuals may use services beyond the point where the cost equals the benefit at the margin, and the level of resources used in the private health sector may be excessive. 6.4 Submissions Received The Committee received a total of 11 submissions from: Health insurers 6 Others 5 We met the following: Southern Cross Manchester Unity New Zealand Council of Friendly Societies The main comments made in submissions are outlined below. 6.4.1 The distribution of benefits from the concessions Two of the submissions disputed the validity of the statistical information referred to in the CD. They claimed that more recent information showed that many more New Zealanders had private health insurance than stated in the CD. One of the submissions referred to the findings of a survey carried out for the Royal Commission on Social Policy. That survey found that 25 percent of Maori people have insurance, 23 percent of those aged 60 or older are insured and that 38 percent of those with labouring jobs are covered. On the basis of the statistical information they presented, the submissions disputed the conclusion reached in the CD that the major beneficiaries of tax concessions are those who are less likely to need medical insurance and those who are best able to pay for it themselves. It was argued that if health insurance is enabling a larger percentage of the population to have access to better quality health care then individuals should not be discouraged from taking out insurance. It was suggested that the removal of tax exemptions and the imposition of Fringe Benefit Tax on employer contributions would discourage private insurance cover. Southern Cross informed the Committee that the introduction of FBT on employer contribution/premiums had caused a number of schemes in which employers provided health insurance for their employees through Southern Cross to be wound up. They noted that the number 68 of such scheme terminations was increasing. 6.4.2 Effect on the demand for public health services Two of the submissions disagreed with the conclusion in the CD that health insurance does not reduce public expenditure on health care significantly. Both were of the view that the health care industry provided services needed but not available in the public system. They submitted that the private health care industry reduces demand on the public sector and therefore reduces public expenditure. It was submitted that there is insufficient government funding available to meet the demands on the public system and accordingly, the government should provide incentives to bring additional resources to the health care sector. One of the submissions disagreed with the argument raised in the CD that some services covered by private insurance may not be available in the public sector. To support their argument they carried out an examination of all operations carried out in private hospitals in New Zealand in 1985. Those operations were compared with all operations carried out in public hospitals during that year. They concluded that out of 550 different surgical procedures performed in private hospitals in New Zealand in that year, only 4 of those were not performed in public hospitals. They argued that the only reason that those 4 procedures were not carried out in public hospitals in that year was because of their rarity as opposed to being operations which would not normally be carried out in public hospitals. One of the submissions argued that other than in the case of physiotherapy there was no evidence to support the argument that increases in demand for private care mean that resources, especially health care personnel, are attracted away from the public sector. It was noted that in the case of physiotherapy the diversion was caused entirely by ACC funding. One of the submissions referred to the findings of the Gibbs report. In particular it referred to the findings in that report that the majority of medical specialists worked in both the public and private sectors and that the productivity of medical specialists was higher in the private sector. It was argued that competition from the private sector should be seen as a good thing, which should lead to improvements in the public sector. In addition, it was argued that if all the private sector work load was diverted to the public sector (where on the basis of information put forward in the submissions it was found that the length of the patient's stay is longer) it would result in an additional cost of over $230 million per annum to the public sector. This estimate did not include additional capital expenditure and other resource diversion. One agreed with the conclusion reached in the CD that private 69 sector efficiency may best be recognised by the government encouraging the purchase of services from the private sector. However, it was submitted that it would be some time before this could be achieved, and that until then, the tax regime should not be changed. Another submitted that the government should recognise the efficiencies of the private sector by encouraging the development of medical insurance from the private sector (the implication being that this encouragement should be by way of tax concessions). 6.4.3 Effect on the allocation of resources Three of the submissions argued that private health insurance does not lead to abuse of health insurance facilities by consumers. It was stated that there was evidence (including overseas experience) to show that abuse can be avoided by a number of devices. They argued that they had in place management systems and controls to avoid abuse. It was submitted that health insurers in fact control costs, which benefits all parties. It was argued that the CD contained assumptions which under-estimated the sophistication of the health insurance industry. It was submitted that health insurers in New Zealand had learnt from overseas experience and that they were not aware of the supposed over use of services by people with health insurance. In support of this argument one submission referred to the Royal Commission on Social Policy's survey on Health Insurance. It was noted that the survey found that 73 percent of insured persons had used health services in the past 12 months, compared with 70 percent of those without insurance. It was submitted that this difference was not significant. 6.5 The Committee's View The Committee agreed with the CD that the issue was not whether the provision and use of health insurance was desirable in New Zealand, but rather whether such health insurance should be subsidised by way of tax concessions. The Committee was not persuaded that a case had been made in submissions for the continued subsidisation of health insurance through the tax system. With respect to the former personal tax exemption for health insurance, the Committee noted that the exemption was often fully utilised by superannuation and life insurance contributions. However, this did not appear to have hindered the growth of health insurance. This suggests that removal of the personal deduction should not have a marked impact on the purchase of private health insurance. Accordingly, the Committee considers that the removal of this concession has probably had only minimal effect. However, the Committee also noted that the tax concessions for 70 employer-paid premiums and for the income earned by the institutions themselves, will have tended to encourage private health insurance. The Committee is therefore inclined to agree with the suggestion, made in many submissions, that the demand for private health insurance is likely to decrease as a result of the removal of these concessions. We also agree that this may lead to some increase in demand for public health services. However, none of the submissions put forward evidence to suggest that meeting that increased demand would cost more than is currently foregone in providing tax concessions. The issue that has to be addressed is whether tax concessions for private health insurance are an efficient and equitable means of funding health services. The Committee was not persuaded of this by submissions and so supported the Government's decision to remove such concessions. In reaching this conclusion the Committee is mindful that health insurance has an increasingly important role to play in the funding of health services in New Zealand. As the rationalisation of the public health sector continues, the Committee considers that health insurance will no doubt become more important and widespread. 6.6 Changes Already Made 6.6.1 Premiums/contributions paid by individuals The Committee discussed the appropriate treatment of insurance premiums and claims in Chapter 4 above. In that chapter we concluded that, in general, premiums for policies of disability and life insurance should be non-deductible and claims should be tax-free. This conclusion also carries over to other sickness and accident insurance. The Committee therefore accepts the recommendation in the Consultative Document that health insurance premiums and contributions should not qualify for a personal tax deduction. However, pending a review of the treatment of fire and general insurance premiums and claims, the Committee recommends that the current treatment of disability policies providing replacement income should continue. The Section 59 exemption permitting premium deductions for pre 9 November 1984 policies of personal accident or sickness insurance, was abolished by s. 4(3) Income Tax Amendment (No.2) Act 1988, with effect for premiums paid on or after 17 December 1987. This change did not affect the deductibility of premiums for income-replacement policies. 6.6.2 Premiums/contributions paid by employers On normal tax principles, employers should be entitled to a deduction for expenditure on health insurance for employees where that expenditure is a business-related. However, since the insurance is a benefit to the employee, fringe benefit tax at the standard rate should apply. 71 The Fringe Benefit Tax exemption was removed from section 336M of the Income Tax Act in the Income Tax Amendment No 2 Act 1988 in respect of employer-paid premiums/contributions made after 17 December 1987. Different transitional FBT rates applied depending on the type of health insurance product. a The concessional FBT rate for payments to approved sickness, accident and death benefit funds existing on 17 December 1987 was 24 percent (non-deductible). The CD noted that the concessional rate was adopted as a transitional measure in recognition of the fact that income earned by such funds was previously exempt; b All other payments previously exempt were subject to FBT at the rate of 35 percent as from 17 December 1987. As an additional transitional measure, FBT on premiums/ contributions paid between 17 December 1987 and 31 March 1988 were not due until 20 July 1988. From 1 April 1989 the FBT cost has become deductible and the standard rate has increased to 49%. 6.6.3 Benefits The CD recommended that all proceeds of policies of sickness or accident insurance and benefits paid from sickness, accident and death benefit funds be tax free from 1 April 1989. As discussed in section 6.6.1 above, the Committee agrees that the proceeds of health insurance policies should be tax free. However, pending a review of fire and general insurance, the Committee recommends that the proceeds of policies providing for replacement income should continue to be taxed. Other health insurance benefits should continue to be tax free. Recommendations The Committee: a recommends that health insurance, with the exception of premiums for income replacement policies that are currently deductible, should be paid for by individuals out of their after-tax income; b endorses the removal of the previous FBT exemption for employer-paid health insurance premiums; and c recommends that the benefits from health insurance policies, with the exception of currently taxable benefits designed to replace income, should be tax free to the insured. 72 CHAPTER 7 - THE TAX TREATMENT OF CREDIT UNIONS 7.1 Introduction Credit unions are co-operative savings institutions which are registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. The role and function of a credit union was, in our view, best summarised in one of the submissions to the Committee made by the New Zealand Credit Union League. That submission stated: "A credit union is a ... non-profit financial co-operative having the objectives of the promotion of thrift among its members by accumulating their savings for the mutual benefit of the members. Wider social aims are the training and education of members in the wise use of money. The principal activity of the credit union is the making of low cost loans to members from the common pool of savings contributed by all members." A credit union is therefore in part a financial institution. As with any bank or similar organisation, it borrows money by taking in deposits (in the credit union's case these are in the form of "shares" which pay interest in the form of "dividends"). The pool of funds thus accumulated is then lent out to borrowers. There are, however, a number of factors which together distinguish credit unions from other financial entities. It was submitted to us that these distinguishing characteristics are as follows: a A credit union is neither a trust (although the assets of a credit union are held by trustees) nor incorporated under company law. It is instead established under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act by way of registration under that Act. b The Act imposes a number of constraints on credit unions including: - requirements that members have a common bond which is usually residence within a particular locality, a common employment relationship, or common membership of a friendly society; - restrictions on investments largely to lending money to members; - limited power to borrow money other than from members; and - limits on investments by members ($20,000) and lending to members. c Credit unions are co-operative ventures of members investing and dealing mainly within its circle of membership. 73 d Credit unions also assume a social role of promoting good money management among their members. e Credit union membership tends to be focussed more than other entities among lower income earners and the less financially sophisticated. In particular, it was claimed in submissions that they are often the only source of lending funds available at "reasonable rates" to those with a poor credit risk. f Credit unions are generally small in size and rely heavily on voluntary efforts for their administration. For the above reasons credit unions constitute a miniscule proportion of the overall financial sector (estimated at about 0.2%). The asset base of the average credit union is only about $500,000 with only five credit unions having assets of over $5 million in 1987. In general, loans to members advanced by credit unions are also small - the average being somewhat less than $2,000. As far as members themselves are concerned, normal taxation rules apply to their credit union savings. Deposits (share purchases) are made out of after-tax income, and interest received (dividends) are taxable in the hands of credit union members. The only special rule is that the credit union itself is exempt from taxation under section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act 1976. That section exempts the income of friendly societies from taxation except so far as it is derived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership. A credit union is defined by section 2 of the Income Tax Act to be a friendly society for the purposes of that Act. The effect of these rules is that the income derived by credit unions in the form of interest charged on member borrowings and income derived from any other allowable investment is not subject to tax unless and until it is distributed to members in the form of interest or dividends. It is then taxed as income of the recipient member subject to the limited section 61(13) exemption for interest and dividends which the government has separately proposed to phase out. 7.2 Options Proposed in the Consultative Document Volume 2 of the Consultative Document on Superannuation and Life Insurance considered the taxation treatment of credit unions in Chapter 6. In line with the government's Economic Statement of 17 December 1987, it was proposed that the section 61(23) exemption be removed, with effect from the beginning of the 1990 income year, so far as it applies to credit unions. A relaxation and review of the regulatory regime applying to credit unions under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act is also being carried out. 74 The Consultative Document then put forward three options for a replacement taxation regime for credit unions: a Tax credit unions under normal income tax rules with dividend payments to members being accounted for as interest payments which would be deductible to credit unions and assessable to members. This was seen as having the disadvantage of allowing credit unions to reduce their assessable income by effectively distributing it as low interest loans to members. Continued regulatory controls were therefore seen as being necessary if this option were adopted. b The second option was the same as the first but involved including in the assessable income of either members or the credit union the extent to which credit union income was effectively distributed as below market interest rate loans. This was seen as having the advantage of allowing for looser regulatory controls of credit union operations (while still retaining certain controls concerned with security of members' savings). On the other hand it was noted that it involved the determination of what was a low interest rate loan. c The third option advanced was to retain the existing tax rules for credit unions but to remove any exemption credit unions enjoyed with respect to investment income derived from non-members. This option would continue to provide credit unions with a tax advantage in certain circumstances but would involve double taxation in other circumstances. It was therefore not favoured by the Committee. The Consultative Document stated that the government wished to implement a non-concessionary taxation regime for credit unions with a relaxation of regulatory controls. However, the exact nature of any future taxation regime was left open for consideration of the recommendations of this committee. 7.3 Submissions Received We received a total of 47 submissions concerning the future taxation treatment of credit unions. Two of those submissions were detailed submissions by the New Zealand Credit Union League representing the majority of credit unions operating in this country. We met with and heard oral submissions from the League. The majority of submissions tended to support the continuation of the existing taxation exemption for credit unions. The reasons advanced for retaining the exemption can be summarised as follows: a Credit unions carry out a useful social function in providing relatively cheap finance to, and in educating, 75 less financially sophisticated members of the community. b To a large extent the investment income of credit unions is derived from within its circle of membership. People should not be taxed on dealings with themselves - "the mutuality principle". c The amount of taxation revenue which could be expected to be derived from removal of the exemption is negligible. Most credit unions distribute nearly all their income by way of assessable dividend payments to members, frequently retaining only what is necessary to accumulate sufficient funds to meet statutory reserve requirements of between 5% and 10% of total assets. d Given the small scale operation of most credit unions and their heavy reliance on voluntary labour for administration of their affairs, the compliance costs involved in preparing taxation returns were argued to be crippling. If the existing taxation exemption were to be removed the preference was for a regime which minimised compliance costs. In those circumstances, incorporation of credit unions into the taxation regime for co-operatives provided for in section 199 of the Income Tax Act seemed to be the most acceptable approach. In general that would allow credit unions to pay distributions (which would otherwise be treated as interest or dividends) as deductible rebates which would, as now, be assessable in the hands of members. There was considerable resistance to having to operate under the complexities of an imputation scheme. Under such a regime the following issues were considered to be of importance: a A deduction should be allowed for the statutory reserves which credit unions are required to maintain on the grounds that such reserves are compulsory. b A deduction should also be allowed for the imputed costs of voluntary labour provided to the union. c Any change in the taxation regime should be implemented after, or at least in tandem with, regulatory reform. d A long transition period, of up to ten years, should be provided for before credit unions become fully taxable. The issue of most concern, however, was the possibility that loans to members below a market interest rate could be included in the taxable income of either the credit union or union members. This was seen as being a punitive attempt to require credit unions to maximise income to the detriment of social goals such as the provision of low-cost finance to members. It was 76 argued that one of the main purposes of the existence of credit unions has been to provide such a facility. Any attempt to impose tax when that purpose was carried out was seen as an attempt to destroy credit unions. We agree that credit unions operate on a different level and fulfill different functions to many other financial entities. However, that is not in our view sufficient to justify a taxation concession. Credit unions may have useful social objectives which banks, for example, may not always have. However, other organisations have similar objectives or objectives which are arguably of equal social worth. Those organisations do not benefit from taxation concessions unless they qualify, for example, under the exemption for charitable organisations. We see no reason why credit unions should be singled out for favourable treatment. The Committee has concluded that continuation of taxation concessions for credit unions would be contrary to the government's overall taxation reform programme of removing tax- induced distortions from savings and investment decisions. We did not find any of the arguments advanced for continuing with the existing concession to be convincing enough to justify an exception to that general principle being made. The "mutuality principle" is not one which the government has previously considered as warranting a taxation exemption. In that regard we agree with the comments in the Consultative Document that people can derive income by trading with an organisation which they own. Entities derive assessable income by providing people with goods and services. The taxation system should not deliberately discriminate between entities according to whether the owners of the entities also happen to be the consumers of its goods and services. It is for that reason that mutual and proprietary life companies should be taxed under the same general principles. Departure from this principle would be likely to encourage one organisational form over another with adverse economic effects. Possible high compliance costs being imposed in order to raise a relatively small amount of revenue is a matter of legitimate policy concern. However, we were not convinced by the argument that the additional costs imposed by removal of the existing concession would be crippling. Indeed credit unions should be in a better position than many other small scale operations to comply with basic income tax requirements since, as financial entities, they should keep a reasonable set of accounts. Finally, even if the additional taxation revenue to be gained from removing this concession were minor, it needs to be appreciated that a credit union is in theory at least a possible substitute for a superannuation scheme. Retention of the credit union taxation concession would be inconsistent with the government's moves to remove the concessions applying to 77 superannuation. 7.4 Proposed Basis of Taxation for Credit Unions We consider that the taxation regime for credit unions should be non-concessional and mirror as closely as possible the taxation regime applying to other similar entities. We were nevertheless impressed with the importance of minimising the compliance costs which credit unions will have to bear. With those concerns in mind we have looked at integrating credit union taxation into existing taxation regimes applying to various entities. 7.4.1 Options considered by the Committee One option would be to tax credit unions along the same lines as superannuation funds. That would mean that the total tax impost on savings income would be borne by the credit union. It would pay tax on behalf of its members with respect to their savings. All benefits (including interest or dividend income credited to or received by members) would be tax-free. However, this regime is not in our view appropriate for credit unions. It is appropriate for superannuation because of the nature of member interests which makes attribution of income to individual members on an annual basis difficult. Those considerations do not apply to credit unions. A second option would be to tax credit unions under the imputation system as companies. Credit unions would be taxed on all interest income received (from members or otherwise). Income distributed as dividends would not then be deductible to the credit union but would carry imputation credits offsetting, to the appropriate extent, the tax members would bear on those dividends. That option was rejected for two reasons. First it has high compliance costs for relatively unsophisticated taxpayers. Secondly, a payment in the form of a dividend to members may be partly an equity return (and therefore properly treated under the imputation system) but is more substantially a return on a savings deposit. As such it is more properly treated as interest which should be deductible to the union and fully assessable in the hands of the recipient. The third, and recommended option, is to treat returns to credit union members as interest deductible to the credit union and assessable to the member. That would seem to be best achieved by incorporating credit unions into the taxation regime applying generally to co-operatives under section 199 of the Income Tax Act. Broadly, under section 199, co-operatives derive two types of income: income derived from dealings with members, and other income. Distributions of the latter are taxed as normal dividends under the imputation regime. Distributions of income derived from dealings with members are, at the option of the co-operative, taxed as either normal dividends under the 78 imputation regime or as the equivalent of interest under a deduction system whereby dividends are deductible to the co-operative but fully assessable in the hands of members. We propose that credit unions be given the option of applying the normal co-operative regime or of accounting for all distributions as being from income derived from dealings with members and thus able to use the deductible option. If the latter option were adopted, for that income year the union would be exempt from the requirement to keep an imputation account, although it could do so if it so wished. This would reduce compliance costs in apportioning income betwen the two categories and would recognise that to a large extent credit union dividends are in fact interest payments for funds lent rather than returns on equity. 7.4.2 Deductible expenditure The tax system for credit unions would otherwise apply normal tax rules. We do not support the submissions asking for deductions for reserve provisions or for imputed voluntary labour. There is no reason for credit unions to gain a deduction for reserves other than in the normal way as a bad debt write-off. A deduction for imputed voluntary labour is not provided for elsewhere in the Act. The offset is that such imputed income is not taxed as income of the provider of the labour. 7.4.3 Capital gains The Committee considers that credit unions should be treated the same as the banking industry, which is taxed on net realised capital gains in accordance with general law (rather than by a specific tax on capital gains). 7.4.4 Low interest loans to members As already noted, the suggestion that credit unions should be taxed on the extent to which they provide low interest loans to members was the most strongly resisted of all possible measures raised. We have therefore considered this issue carefully. We have concluded that, as a general rule, credit union members should be placed in a similar position to company shareholders receiving similar loans. The Government has proposed that a company providing such loans to shareholders should be subject to FBT on the extent to which the interest rate on loans to shareholders is less than the prescribed rate for FBT purposes. This recognises the fact that such loans are an alternative means of distributing corporate income to shareholders. We can see no justification for a general exemption from this rule with respect to credit unions. However, strict application of this rule would create high compliance costs and probably make most credit unions non-viable. Accordingly, we propose that the smaller credit unions be exempt from the requirement to pay FBT on low interest loans to members. The Committee proposes that a 79 credit union be exempt from this requirement in each quarter where: - the organisation existed and had assets under $lm as at 1/4/89; and - the organisation has assets under $lm at all times during the quarter. Our proposal would exempt the small credit unions presently in existence. In 1987/88, 30 credit unions had assets over $lm and 210 had assets under $lm. All new credit unions would have to pay FBT on interest discounts irrespective of the organisation's size. This recommendation parallels that made in Chapter 5 in respect of friendly societies. We emphasise that this proposed exemption is based on the high compliance costs that credit unions would otherwise face rather than being a taxation concession specifically provided to credit unions. 7.4.5 Tax rate The Committee has proposed that credit unions be subject to the tax treatment applying to co-operatives with an option to account for all income as if it had been derived from dealings with members, thus avoiding the need for an imputation credit account. Consistent with this model, credit unions should be taxed at the company tax rate, presently 33%. 7.4.6 Implementation date Initially, it was proposed that the new taxation regime for credit unions come into place with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1989. The Minister of Finance has subsequently announced a delay in implementation for at least a year. As the proposed taxation regime does not involve complex calculations and should fit within existing credit union systems, we were unconvinced that a longer transition period was needed or would be useful. Nor do we agree with the argument that taxation changes should follow regulatory changes. Indeed, as made clear in the Consultative Document, the final form of the regulatory regime is dependent on the credit union taxation regime. Regulatory controls would be needed for taxation purposes to the extent that credit unions retained taxation concessions. Under our proposals the main disitinguishing feature of the credit union tax regime would be the effective dividend deduction regime. The only control necessary for tax purposes would be that non-residents should not be allowed to be members. The Committee proposes that tax come into effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. 80 Recommendations The Committee recommends that: a credit unions be subject to the tax treatment applying to co-operatives with an option to account for all income as if it had been derived from dealings with members, thus avoiding the need for an imputation credit account; b general tax law (rather than a specific tax) apply to realised capital gains; c any interest discount on loans to members, as measured by reference to the prescribed FBT interest rate, be subject to FBT, except where the credit union: - existed and had assets under $lm as at 1/4/89; and - has assets under $lm at all times during the quarter; d the tax rate applying to the income of credit unions should be the company tax rate, presently 33%; and e taxation of the income of all credit unions apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. 81
Taxing Income Across International Borders A Policy Framework 30 July 1991 Minister of Finance, Hon Ruth Richardson Minister of Revenue, Hon Wyatt Creech TAXING INCOME ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS International tax is the most complex area of taxation policy, as it potentially involves the interface between the New Zealand tax system and every other tax system in the world. A clear international tax policy will reduce the uncertainty surrounding international taxes and assist taxpayers, professional tax advisers and tax administrators. The Government has issued this framework paper to raise the issues, and the interrelationships between them, for debate. The Government welcomes comment on these issues. The intention is to develop proposals for implementation on the basis of consideration of this framework and submissions received. The Government’s current intention is to have these policy issues decided in time for implementation by 1 April 1992.

New Zealand’s international tax policy must address four basic questions: • Who is a resident of New Zealand? • What is New Zealand-source income? • How should New Zealand residents be taxed on their foreign-source income? • How should non-residents be taxed on their New Zealand-source income? The answers to these questions are often inter-related. Answers to one question may alter the answers that can be made to others. To put these inter-relationships into context, the Government has developed a framework for consideration of international tax principles and objectives. This sets the groundwork for the detailed development of policy proposals. The first decision based on the framework has been made. This is the change to Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) on interest announced in this year’s Budget. Chapter 2 outlines the policy framework which the Government has developed and explains why the particular framework was selected. Chapter 3 sets out directions for reform of the taxation of non-residents. It first discusses the taxation of debt supplied by non-residents. Detailed decisions on this have been announced in the Budget. The paper then goes on to cover the taxation of non-residents’ equity investments. The taxation of residents’ foreign-source income is the subject of Chapter 4. The paper concludes in Chapter 5 with an outline of the Government’s proposals to co-ordinate its international taxation actions with those of other governments. 3 CHAPTER 2 Policy framework Introduction The international tax policy outlined in this paper is a key element of the Government’s fiscal and economic plans. The Government’s objective is to shift the New Zealand economy from a slow-growth to a high-growth track. To grow, New Zealand needs investment. Much of the funding required to finance that investment will come from overseas. A credible fiscal plan is one of the necessary conditions for achieving long-term growth. The 1991 Budget sets out a clear plan to bring Government expenditure and revenue into a sustainable fiscal position. To maintain that fiscal position, the tax system must continue to be able to raise revenue effectively. However, the Government needs to consider more than just the revenue raising potential of various taxes. Taxes on residents’ offshore incomes should be designed to ensure that capital flows to where it will produce the highest yield for all New Zealanders. If this is done effectively, the taxes should raise revenue directly and inhibit residents from locating their income outside of New Zealand to knowingly or unknowingly take advantage of lower or less effective tax structures elsewhere. Taxes on non-residents should be designed to raise revenue without raising interest rates or barriers to the foreign funding for investment that New Zealand needs to grow and without risking serious erosion of the New Zealand tax base. New Zealand needs to be an attractive destination for quality investment: investment that will improve the New Zealand skills base, raise productivity and encourage an outward-looking business focus. Background New Zealand’s international tax regime encompasses: • domestic laws defining New Zealand residence 4 • domestic laws defining New Zealand-source income • taxes on the foreign-source income of New Zealand residents • taxes on the New Zealand-source income of non-residents • double tax agreements (DTAs) with other countries. The two key questions discussed in this paper are: • How should New Zealand tax non-residents who earn income in New Zealand? • How should New Zealand tax residents who earn foreign-source income? Of special significance is the taxation of income both resident and non-resident individuals earn through separate legal entities like companies. Ways of earning income Individuals can earn income directly or indirectly through a company or other legal entity. Direct income includes dividends from companies, interest from bank accounts and wages and salaries. New Zealand taxes direct foreign-source income of residents in much the same way as such income earned domestically, although New Zealand often gives a credit for any taxes paid to foreign governments. For example, interest earned from a bank account in a foreign country is taxable in the hands of a New Zealand resident in the same way as interest from local banks is taxed. However, New Zealand would provide a credit for any NRWT paid to the foreign government in question. Likewise, New Zealand taxes the income that non-residents earn directly in New Zealand. For example, it applies non-resident withholding tax on interest, royalties and dividends paid to non-residents. Income earned indirectly through separate legal entities poses special taxation problems. This is because, legally, an individual and a company they own are not the same. Therefore, income earned by a company is not usually regarded as income earned by the individual. The individual shareholder, however, does expect to ultimately benefit from the income earned by the company. They can receive 5 this benefit through either the payment of dividends by the company or by selling shares in the company. Domestically, the company tax is used to ensure that individuals cannot escape tax by earning income through companies. New Zealand’s imputation credit system allows residents to claim credits for New Zealand company tax against personal income taxes on dividends where that company is a New Zealand-resident company. The combination of company tax, personal income tax, and the imputation system ensures that resident shareholders are taxed on both the retained and distributed income that they earn through resident companies. New Zealand cannot, however, apply its company tax to income earned through overseas companies or funds owned by its residents. To the extent that it seeks to tax this income, New Zealand must tax individuals themselves on the income they earn through such vehicles. Analysis Developing international tax policy depends on understanding the inter-relationships between international taxation, domestic taxation and the domestic economy. Taxes on non-residents This section presents an analysis of the taxation of non-residents. The examples given are stylised to bring out the key points. Specific directions for change to specific parts of the current taxation regime are discussed in Chapter 3. The taxes that New Zealand imposes on non-residents earning income in New Zealand can, while raising revenue, increase the cost of capital (including domestic interest rates) to all New Zealand businesses. This is because New Zealand has an open economy and is largely a price taker in world capital markets. For example, consider foreigners deciding whether to invest $1,000 in domestic bonds issued by their own country or in New Zealand bonds. If they could earn $100 (i.e. 10%) from the domestic bonds before home taxes, they would, all other things being equal, require the same return after New Zealand taxes before they would buy the New Zealand bonds. If New Zealand imposes a 15% tax on interest paid to foreigners, then New Zealand issuers of bonds would have to pay $117.65 to the foreigner to induce them to buy New Zealand bonds. That is, the 6 before-tax interest rate paid to foreigners would be 11.765%, while the rate would be 10% after New Zealand taxes. In other words, the post-New Zealand tax rate of interest the foreign lenders receive is the same, regardless of the tax New Zealand imposes. The tax is not in fact borne by the foreigner. It is borne entirely by the New Zealand borrower in the form of higher interest rates. Moreover, because bond markets are open to both local savers and foreigners, the bond issuers would have to offer a return of 11.765% to all purchasers of the bonds. This would have the effect of raising all interest rates in New Zealand. Accordingly, imposing a tax on foreigners, while raising revenue (in this example $17.65), also imposes an indirect cost on New Zealand residents in the form of higher interest rates, which will tend to lower investment and real wages. A similar argument applies, with some qualifications, to the returns to equity capital. That is, applying a tax on dividends paid to non-residents would require New Zealand firms to pay higher dividends to their non-resident shareholders to compensate for the New Zealand tax. Increasing productive investment is a key part of the Government’s economic strategy. Foreign capital can play a vital role in financing the productive investment that New Zealand needs to grow and prosper. In general, therefore, New Zealand should reduce the taxes imposed on non-residents. This would benefit borrowers from domestic financial institutions as well as borrowers from overseas. There is, however, one qualification to this general rule, which concerns the tax treatment non-residents receive from their home governments. New Zealand’s double taxation treaties are intended to co-ordinate New Zealand’s tax system with those of its treaty partners. They can help to improve the economic impact of those tax systems and reduce tax compliance and administrative costs. Tax treaties often involve a system of foreign tax credits. That is, in return for both parties agreeing to impose lower rates of NRWT, they agree to give a credit for each other’s NRWT against the taxes they impose on their own residents’ foreign-source income. Such credits allow New Zealand to raise revenue from NRWT (albeit at a lower rate) without increasing the cost of capital. 7 This leads to the conclusion that New Zealand might wish to lower some taxes on non-residents, except in the context of bilateral arrangements to tax non-residents with an offsetting credit. However, before this (or any) final decision can be made on the taxation of non-residents, it is necessary to explore the wider implications of such a decision. Taxes on residents There is a close link between the taxation of non-residents’ New Zealand-source income and the taxation of residents’ foreign-source income. Thus, the question of taxing residents on their foreign-source income needs to be considered in conjunction with the taxation of non-residents and decisions on the two integrated. Economic costs would result and the domestic tax base would be eroded if residents were able to use the lower taxes levied on foreign investors to reduce their New Zealand tax liability1 . Consider the example in the previous section of foreigners buying New Zealand bonds. Suppose that New Zealand chooses not to tax non-residents. In that case, a New Zealander could receive 10% before New Zealand tax on New Zealand bonds. After a 33% New Zealand income tax, the rate of return falls to 6.7%. However, there are a number of ways that a New Zealander could receive 10% rather than 6.7%. First, they could become a ‘tax exile’ by ceasing to be a resident of New Zealand while still having New Zealand-source income. They would receive the same 10% return after New Zealand taxes as foreigners, for the same reasons. This is not a significant policy concern, as the costs of becoming a tax exile usually mean that this is not a viable proposition. Secondly, they could remain a resident, but interpose a non-resident legal entity like a company or a trust that is not subject to New Zealand tax between themselves and the New Zealand source of their income. (This, in essence, is what ‘Island run-around’ tax avoidance 1 The motive for behaviour that results in escaping New Zealand tax will normally be to achieve the best business deal. Because, other elements being equal, a reduction in taxation increases the return achieved, the investment with the lowest rate of tax will tend to be preferred. The individual may be entirely unaware of the tax implications. This is especially so with small savers. In this case, the relationship between the taxpayer’s motive and a reduced tax burden is indirect. In other cases, the taxpayer’s objective may be quite explicitly tax minimisation and the underlying investment may be largely unaffected, i.e. the taxpayer is motivated for some reason to invest in a project, and will do so in a way that reduces the level of tax incurred. 8 schemes used to involve.2) The company would earn 10%, because it is a non-resident and, therefore, not subject to New Zealand tax. The person could defer paying New Zealand tax by accumulating the interest, tax free, in the company. Alternatively, they could repatriate the income tax-free, for example by way of a tax-exempt capital gain. Arrangements such as this would have a limited effect on investment or employment in New Zealand. However, as they have in the past, they would lead to substantial erosion of the New Zealand tax base. Finally, the person could remain a resident, but divest themselves of their New Zealand-based assets in favour of offshore assets which may be less productive from New Zealand’s viewpoint, but which are subject to lower New Zealand taxes. The incentive to do this would arise if the foreign-source income of residents is subject to a lower rate of New Zealand tax than domestic-source income. Such divestiture of assets is undesirable for a number of reasons. It results in New Zealanders undertaking investment which yields New Zealand a lower return even though it is more profitable for the individual concerned. Although the investment that New Zealanders no longer undertake will be partially replaced by foreign investment, it is unlikely to be fully offset. This has an obvious impact on the associated jobs and real wages in New Zealand. The New Zealand tax base would also shrink. The higher tax rates required to recover this tax base erosion will themselves have an adverse impact on investment and encourage further erosion of the base. In short, not taxing residents on their offshore income has much the same effect as not taxing a particular sector of the domestic economy. That is, it produces investment decisions that are, either knowingly or unknowingly, made for tax rather than commercial reasons and can directly or indirectly reduce tax collections. However, if the Government could put in place a robust regime for taxing residents on their foreign-source income, it can have low taxes on non-residents (with the lower interest rates and higher real wages 2 ‘Island run-arounds’ were tax avoidance schemes that developed in New Zealand in the period between the removal of exchange controls and the enactment of the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime. Under a run-around, a New Zealand controlled company resident in a third country (often a Pacific island nation, hence the name) was interposed between a New Zealand resident and their New Zealand-source income. Because New Zealand did not tax the income that residents earned through non-resident companies, this allowed New Zealand residents to greatly reduce their lax liabilities. This experience was by no means unique to New Zealand. Similar schemes developed in other countries that removed exchange controls. 9 that implies) without either risking erosion of the tax base by residents or inducing them to invest offshore. Taxation of residents in practice Low taxes on non-residents are important to the Government’s employment and growth objectives. However, pursuing that policy goal while exempting New Zealanders’ foreign-source income would have severe adverse economic and revenue impacts. This means that foreign-source income should be taxed unless the compliance and administrative costs outweigh the economic and revenue effects of not doing so. At the same time, New Zealand’s experience suggests that taxing all such income is impractical. In the New Zealand context, the most comprehensive way of taxing all foreign-source income would be to tax residents on all the income they earn directly offshore, to remove the ‘grey list’ and control tests from the CFC regime, and allow residents a deduction for foreign taxes when calculating their CFC income, rather than the current credit.3 It should be stressed that the Government is not advocating this extreme position. Such a regime would be past the point where the benefits of taxation (in terms of revenue and business behaviour) are offset by compliance and administration costs. The Government will not put in place tax structures where compliance and administration costs are larger than the benefits. The key question in addressing the taxation of residents’ foreign-source income is the design and scope of the CFC and FIF regimes. The key policy issues for these regimes are discussed below. Options to change the detailed design of the regimes are presented in Chapter 4. 3 Allowing a deduction for foreign taxes treats such taxes like any other cost of business. Granting a credit implies that New Zealand should compensate taxpayers for foreign taxes paid. The deduction approach may be more appropriate from New Zealand’s point of view, since foreign taxes are a cost to the New Zealand economy as much as to the taxpayer - New Zealand does not benefit from the payment of foreign taxes. A credit provides no incentive for residents to reduce the level of foreign taxes, while a deduction does. If a deduction is allowed, reducing foreign taxes will increase returns to the investor after New Zealand taxes. If, however, a credit is allowed, reducing creditable taxes only results in an offsetting increase in New Zealand taxes. There is no increase in post-New Zealand tax returns to the investor. However, under its Double Taxation Agreements, New Zealand is obliged to grant a credit for certain foreign taxes. 10 The desirable scope of the CFC regime involves judgements about the trade-off between compliance costs and the consequences of exempting some forms of income from tax. If some income is exempt from tax, other types of income need to be taxed more heavily. Thus reducing taxes on the people who earn income through CFCs involves a higher tax burden on those who do not. As discussed above, not taxing some sorts of income while taxing others will encourage people to earn the less heavily taxed income, even if that results in a lower yield to all New Zealanders. Exempting income also increases the ability of taxpayers to avoid tax more generally by converting their income into the exempt form. The operation of the ‘grey list’ in the CFC regime means that most offshore income is exempt from New Zealand tax and thus the regime does not impose any compliance costs on that income.4 However, the CFC regime does prevent the worst forms of abuse. For example, ‘Island run-arounds’ are now very difficult, if not impossible, to implement effectively. The Government considers that it will be necessary for a robust CFC regime to remain in place. It will consider easier ways of calculating CFC income for those to whom the regime does apply. Options are discussed in Chapter 4 below. The FIF regime A tax regime is required to protect the tax base from New Zealanders diverting their savings to overseas investment vehicles that they do not control. As noted above, this need becomes even greater if the Government has low effective taxes on non-residents. The FIF regime is intended to serve this purpose. The difficulty with all FIF-type regimes is the lack of control exercised by investors. This means that the method of calculating tax must not require detailed records of the fund’s underlying activities. In New Zealand’s case, the method chosen was ‘comparative value’, which includes an element of taxation of accrued but unrealised (and potentially unrealisable) income. The CFC regime 4 The CFC regime does not apply to companies resident in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Canada and Japan. The income New Zealanders earn through companies resident in these countries is only taxed by New Zealand when it is actually returned to New Zealand. 11 The FIF regime has a greater anti-avoidance focus and hence a narrower target than the CFC regime. The CFC regime applies to all companies outside the ‘grey list’, while the FIF regime is limited to those funds that have the most potential for tax avoidance and deferral. While the Government considers that the basic form of the FIF regime should stay in place, the regime can and must be improved. The comparative value method can result in a different tax treatment compared with domestic taxation of similar investments. This is because comparative value is only a proxy for the domestic company tax and personal income tax systems. It may also tax returns not taxable under domestic rules, for example genuine unrealised capital gains. This could only be justified if no other practical alternative is available. There are other difficulties with the FIF regime. The boundary of the FIF regime is often difficult to determine and, in some circumstances, the valuations required to calculate tax are almost impossible to obtain. While some changes will be made to make the FIF regime easier to comply with, there must be in place a regime that adequately protects the New Zealand tax base. Experience in New Zealand and overseas shows that countries without exchange controls will face accelerating erosion of the tax base if they do not have FIF-type regimes in place. Details of the reforms of the FIF regime being considered are discussed in Chapter 4 below. Directions for reform The New Zealand Government has decided in principle that it will move to limit the taxes on income from capital it imposes on non-residents, while maintaining a comprehensive system for taxing residents on their world-wide income. In line with its general tax policy, it will seek to minimise the compliance costs of that regime. Little change is envisaged in relation to the taxation of labour income. In reaching this view, the Government has balanced the need to raise revenue, its desire to make New Zealand an attractive investment destination, its policy of securing low interest rates and the compliance costs that the various taxation options involve. A strong revenue base is necessary for a sustainable fiscal position. 12 New Zealand needs foreign capital to finance the productive investment necessary for economic growth. Taxes on non-residents, while raising revenue, can increase the cost of financing investment by raising interest rates. Low taxes on non-residents will both attract foreign capital to fund investment and contribute to low domestic interest rates. 13 CHAPTER 3 Taxation of non-residents This chapter explains the implications for the taxation of non-residents flowing from the above decisions. The two most important sources of income earned by non-residents are debt (money that foreigners lend to New Zealand firms) and equity (direct investment in New Zealand firms). Taxes on non-residents raise significant amounts of revenue. NRWT on debt and equity brought in about $265 million in the year to 31 March 1991. Company tax cannot be precisely separated into payments attributable to resident and non-resident shareholders. However, non-residents own, on average, about 40% of all New Zealand companies. This suggests that non-residents pay about $800 million in company tax. Taxes on debt supplied by non-residents New Zealand taxes income earned from debt supplied by foreigners by applying NRWT to interest paid to non-residents. Most foreign countries provide tax credits for NRWT. However, credits are effectively limited for many financial intermediaries because NRWT is applied to gross interest and credits are restricted to net income. Tax-exempt bodies, like foreign pension funds, also cannot take advantage of credits because they have no domestic tax liability against which to credit NRWT. Intermediaries and pension funds are very important players in debt markets. There are a number of well-known techniques for avoiding NRWT. As a result, until recently the practical effect of New Zealand’s NRWT on interest tended to be: • NRWT was paid by those taxpayers who could receive credits. • Taxpayers who could not receive credits avoided or evaded NRWT. 14 This produced a desirable result from New Zealand’s point of view, as the Government raised revenue with a very limited effect on interest rates. Interest NRWT appears to have increased bond yields by about 2% of the yield during 1990. This was equivalent to about 30 basis points (0.3 of a percentage point) on average during 1990. This implies that additional interest paid to foreigners on overseas debt because of interest NRWT was about $100 million. In contrast, NRWT on interest raised approximately $180 million in the year to 31 March 1991. This suggests that a large proportion of NRWT was borne by foreigners. Thus New Zealand already has low effective taxes on interest paid to non-residents. However, this is achieved by wide-scale avoidance and evasion - practices this Government cannot and will not condone. Reforms As a first step to implementing its policy of maintaining low taxes on interest paid to non-residents, the Government has decided that resident borrowers will be able to apply for ‘Approved Issuer’ status under the Income Tax Act. Approved Issuers will be able to pay NRWT-free interest to the non-residents from whom they borrow. Approved Issuers will be required to pay a levy for the right to pay NRWT-exempt interest. The amount of the levy will be equivalent to 2% of the exempt interest paid. Full details of this scheme are contained in the Budget supplement on taxation measures. The practical effect is that residents who have been avoiding or evading their obligations to deduct NRWT will be able to become Approved Issuers and so pay interest that is exempt from NRWT. Taxation of equity supplied by non-residents New Zealand applies the company tax to the earnings of companies owned in whole or in part by non-residents and NRWT to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders out of those earnings. New Zealand’s imputation credit system allows residents to claim credits for New Zealand company tax paid by New Zealand resident companies against personal income taxes on dividends. The combination of company tax, personal income tax, and the imputation system ensures that resident shareholders are taxed on both the retained and distributed income that they earn through New Zealand resident companies. 15 New Zealand’s imputation credit system does not extend to non-residents and New Zealand charges NRWT on dividends. As a result, non-residents earning income in New Zealand are taxed twice by New Zealand on that income: once as the income is earned and again when dividends are paid. At first sight, it appears that this system for taxing foreign equity will raise the cost of capital in New Zealand and also encourage debt financing. The true situation, however, is less clear-cut. The Government has commissioned further work on this issue. First, it may be that there is a bias towards debt financing inherent in world capital markets caused by other countries’ tax systems. If this is the case, then it would not be practical nor desirable for New Zealand to attempt to correct that bias through its tax system. The tax system should allow taxpayers to finance their operation in the least costly manner before New Zealand taxes, given the costs of various types of capital New Zealanders face in world markets. Second, foreign credits for the tax New Zealand imposes on equity may reduce or eliminate the effect of New Zealand taxes on the return to equity. An important reason why this is so for the taxation of equity and not the taxation of debt is that financial intermediaries are less active in the equity market. Because NRWT is levied on gross income flows but home taxes are levied on net income, NRWT can exceed intermediaries’ net profits. However, if intermediaries are not large players in the equity market, this is not such a problem. On the other hand, tax-exempt investors, like foreign pension funds, are often active in both the debt and equity markets. Foreign tax credits are not available to such investors. In this case, it is likely that the imposition of New Zealand taxes would tend to increase the cost of capital in New Zealand. In many cases, New Zealand taxes on income from foreign-source equity may only alter which country gets the revenue from taxation rather than reduce taxation itself. This would be the case, for example, for a small non-resident individual investor who pays dividend NRWT to New Zealand and pays income tax with a credit for dividend NRWT to his or her residence country. Any reduction in New Zealand NRWT would be matched by an increase in home country taxes. The rate of return earned by the investor after all taxes would not have changed. The foreign government would, however, have collected more revenue at New Zealand’s expense. 16 In order to actually lower the effective rate of taxation, reduction in taxes by either the source or the residence country and recognition of those reductions by the other country without counteracting adjustments is necessary. This suggests that bilateral or multilateral action is an important part of any move to effectively reduce the taxes New Zealand imposes on equity supplied by non-residents. One option is bilateral recognition of imputation credits. Australia and the United Kingdom are the two countries with imputation systems that provide the bulk of investment into New Zealand at present. Australia is by far the major destination for New Zealand outward investment and is one of the chief sources of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand will be exploring the possibility of mutual recognition of imputation credits in forthcoming bilateral discussions. 17 CHAPTER 4 Taxation of residents’ foreign-source income This chapter reviews the practical implications of taxing residents’ foreign-source income. The particular emphasis is on the taxation of income earned through separate legal entities. The total foreign-source income of residents, earned both directly and through companies, is about $1 billion. It appears that only a small percentage of this amount is paid in New Zealand tax5. Taxing foreign-source income also helps preserve the domestic tax base (the New Zealand-source income earned by New Zealand residents), as discussed above. That is, while taxes on foreign-source income might not raise much revenue, they help ensure that individuals pay other taxes by removing an incentive to earn foreign-source income. Taxing income earned through foreign companies There are two important aspects to the taxation of foreign companies owned by residents. First, taxing domestic and foreign income on the same basis encourages New Zealanders to invest in a manner that produces the greatest benefit for New Zealand as a whole. Similarly, taxing New Zealanders on income earned on their behalf through companies on the same basis as income they earn themselves directly encourages them to select whichever direct or indirect investment yields the highest return to New Zealand as a whole. If New Zealanders were not subject to New Zealand tax on income earned on their behalf by non-resident companies, but were subject to company tax on income earned by resident companies, they would be encouraged to invest offshore, even when investment in New Zealand would have a higher yield. In effect, the tax system would be 5 The low rate of taxation on foreign-source income is mainly due to the fact that the vast bulk of this income is earned in companies that are located in the seven ‘grey list’ countries that are excluded from New Zealand’s CFC regime. 18 subsidising the export of productive investment and associated employment. That is, the tax system should, wherever possible, ensure that New Zealanders invest how and where they can earn the highest return, rather than how or where they can pay the lowest tax. Secondly, New Zealand residents can use companies in low-tax countries (‘tax havens’) or in concessionally taxed investment in otherwise high-tax countries, as a way of escaping tax on their New Zealand-source income. For example, a New Zealander could own a company in a tax haven that owns a factory in New Zealand. In the absence of the CFC regime, there are a number of ways this structure could then be used to avoid New Zealand tax. Such practices would have little effect on investment and employment in New Zealand, but could seriously erode the tax base. Taxing foreign-source income of New Zealand residents, including that earned through separate entities, will therefore both encourage investment with a sound economic base and protect the tax base from avoidance. Taxation of foreign-source income The Government considers that it should continue to tax New Zealanders on the foreign-source income they earn both directly and through separate legal entities. This section focuses on the three regimes New Zealand has for taxing income earned through such entities: • the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime • the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime • the Foreign Dividend Withholding Payment (FDWP) regime. In considering these regimes, the Government must find the best possible compromise between three competing policy objectives: • effective taxation of residents’ foreign-source income • removing barriers to investment • low compliance and administration costs. 19 Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime Purpose and description The CFC regime is necessary to ensure that foreign-source income is taxed effectively. Before the CFC regime was introduced, New Zealand residents could and did avoid tax by accumulating income in companies resident offshore, but effectively controlled from New Zealand. The CFC regime attributes the current income of an offshore company back to the New Zealand owners if: • A group of five or fewer New Zealand residents control 50% or more of an offshore company. • The offshore company is resident outside a ‘grey list’ of seven designated countries - Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. CFC earnings are subject to New Zealand tax with a credit for foreign income taxes paid. In effect, CFCs are taxed in the same way that the foreign branches of New Zealand companies have been taxed for many years. For this reason, the CFC regime is referred to as a ‘branch-equivalent’ tax. The seven grey-list countries were selected according to two criteria: • tax rules (including standards of administration) that produce effective company tax rates similar to those in New Zealand • comprehensive international tax rules that reduce international tax planning opportunities and support the New Zealand CFC regime. The grey list is an example of the compromise between the competing objectives of: • effective taxation of residents’ foreign-source income • minimising compliance and administration costs. Each of these countries have tax rates similar to New Zealand’s and the decision was made to allow New Zealand residents a credit for foreign taxes paid by the company. Therefore, applying New Zealand’s CFC regime to companies in these countries was judged to produce insufficient gain in investment allocation or revenue to justify the costs. New Zealand residents’ interests in foreign companies located in grey-list countries were exempted from the CFC regime. 20 Implicitly, the regime makes the judgement that where avoidance through the use of interposed entities is not a significant problem, and where revenue gains would be small or nil, the compliance cost savings from not requiring the calculation of income are greater than the disadvantages of encouraging investment and associated employment to move offshore and of higher tax rates on other New Zealanders. It thus means that the bulk of foreign-source income earned on behalf of New Zealanders through CFCs is exempt from tax on an accruals basis. Over the most recent four years for which statistics are available, 80% of New Zealand Direct Investment Overseas was in the seven grey-list countries. However, in the jurisdictions where it does apply, the regime does tax foreign-source income of all kinds earned by controlled foreign companies. In short, the operation of the ‘grey list’ means that most offshore income earned by controlled foreign companies is exempt from the CFC regime. The CFC regime will continue to tax foreign-source income except where the compliance and administrative costs of doing so outweigh the revenue gain and where there is no significant risk of tax avoidance. Some options for change The Government is investigating ways of modifying the current CFC rules to improve the balance between: • encouraging New Zealanders to invest where the returns to all New Zealanders are highest • raising revenue and protecting the tax base • compliance and administrative costs. In considering options for change, the Government will have regard to: • the compliance costs of the current regime, and any changed regime, for different classes of taxpayers • the revenue effects of any changes, including any tax avoidance possibilities such changes might create • the effect of any change on the location and quality of New Zealanders’ investment 21 • the Government’s view that foreign-source income as a general rule should be taxed. The Government will look to the experiences of other countries when considering the available options. Calculation of CFC income A principal source of CFC compliance costs is the need to convert CFC income, calculated in accordance with the tax laws of the country in which the CFC is resident, to the income definitions in force in New Zealand. More flexible methods of calculating CFC income are being considered. The Consultative Committee on Tax Simplification suggested that CFC calculations could be simplified by providing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the authority to accept some countries’ tax treatment of some assets and transactions. The Government is considering this approach. One option is for a list of the countries and/or acceptable tax provisions to be published. Under this approach, there would be three classes of CFC income: • exempt income, which is earned in a company resident in a ‘grey list’ country • income earned in ‘second list’ countries, with simplified calculation provisions • income earned outside either list, where the current ‘branch-equivalent’ regime would apply. Another approach would recognise that smaller taxpayers tend to have the most compliance problems by targeting the regime more towards large companies. A black list In its election manifesto, the Government said that it would consider applying the international tax regime to a restricted list of countries. During a transitional period from 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1991, in broad terms the CFC regime applied only to companies resident in a ‘black list’ of some 61 countries with very low effective tax rates and to specified corporate entities granted tax preferences in 10 other countries. 22 The current regime exempts virtually all income earned by CFCs resident in seven listed countries, but applies to companies resident in all other countries. The Government will be considering whether the current ‘grey list’ should be modified. In particular, it will be considering whether the ‘grey list’ should be replaced with a ‘black list’ of low tax countries, with all income earned by companies resident outside listed countries being exempt from the CFC regime. Passive income The Government’s election manifesto also said that the Government would consider only applying the CFC regime to passive income. Australia, Canada and the United States restrict their CFC regimes to ‘passive’ or ‘tainted’ investment income and exempt earnings of ‘active’ business operations. ‘Passive’ income is often regarded as income that is most likely to involve tax avoidance. That is, it is income that is either: • really New Zealand-source income that has been disguised as foreign-source income by interposing a foreign entity between its true New Zealand source and its ultimate New Zealand owner • a close substitute for New Zealand-source income, which may be chosen because of tax advantages rather than any innate superiority. ‘Active’ income is foreign-source income that is earned by a business largely for commercial reasons, rather than being tax driven. Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime Purpose and description As outlined in Chapter 2, New Zealand’s domestic income tax system ensures that residents cannot defer tax by investing through separate entities. Company tax and the taxation of trusts (including superannuation and life insurance funds) ensure that New Zealand-source income earned on behalf of residents is taxed as it is earned. By reducing tax deferral opportunities and incorporating more income into the tax base, New Zealand has been able to reduce marginal tax rates. 23 The measures that eliminate tax deferral on domestic-source income would be undermined if New Zealand residents could avoid or defer tax by accumulating income in offshore funds in which they do not have a controlling interest. In the absence of a FIF regime, New Zealanders would have an incentive to shift their investments offshore to get around the accruals regime for financial arrangements and the taxation of superannuation and life insurance funds. The objective of the FIF regime, where it applies, is to levy the same tax on the income earned by the FIF on behalf of the resident as would be levied if the fund were a New Zealand company. Because the FIF is resident offshore with no effective connection with New Zealand, the only way of levying the tax is on the New Zealand holder. Furthermore, because FIF investors do not exercise control over the fund, they do not normally have access to the detailed records of underlying activities needed for the branch-equivalent calculation of CFC income. Therefore, a proxy for this calculation is required. Annual FIF income is currently calculated according to the comparative-value method, which measures the change in the market value of a FIF interest during the taxation year plus any cash distributions. The comparative-value method seeks to tax foreign-source income that would be taxable if it were domestic-source income on the same basis that that domestic-source income is taxed. However, because details of the actual income earned by the FIF are often not available, the comparative-value method must approximate domestic taxation. The Government will consider alternative methods of calculating FIF income. The final choice of method will, however, depend on the method’s ability to meet the goal of effectively measuring the income earned by the taxpayer through a FIF. The FIF regime also complements the CFC regime. If the FIF regime did not exist, the CFC provisions might be avoided by structuring offshore investments to fall below the ownership levels that define a CFC interest (five or fewer New Zealand residents own 50% or more of a foreign company outside the seven grey-list countries). Even if not deliberately structured to avoid the CFC regime, FIF investments could also be easily substituted for domestic investments. The FIF regime or an equivalent regime will remain in place to support the CFC regime and protect the tax base. However, the Government recognises that the current FIF regime does pose compliance problems, sometimes insurmountable 24 problems, for taxpayers. Modifications to reduce compliance costs are being reviewed. As in other areas of international tax, the Government has to weigh the need to minimise compliance costs against the objectives of taxing income that should be taxed, removing barriers to productive investment and protecting the tax base. In practice, the FIF regime should be targeted on the areas which pose the greatest risk to the New Zealand tax base. The current FIF regime covers investments that provide the greatest scope for diverting New Zealand-source income or which are regarded by investors as being close substitutes for alternative New Zealand investments. The definition of a FIF is based on criteria that assess whether the offshore entity is structured to defer tax. An offshore entity is not a FIF if it meets one of these tests: • It is resident in one of the seven ‘grey-list’ countries. • It distributes at least 60% of its aggregate annual income, profits and capital gains. • No more than 40% of its total assets consist of listed assets that could be broadly described as ‘portfolio investments’. • It pays total (foreign plus New Zealand) tax at an effective rate of at least 20%. However, investors often cannot obtain the information needed to determine whether an entity is or is not a FIF. FIF regimes in other countries The Government has reviewed FIF-type regimes in other countries to see whether another country has found a simpler and less costly way to prevent tax avoidance and deferral in offshore investment funds. Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States have provisions similar to the FIF regime.6 The review showed that, in all these countries, provisions to tax FIF income are both more complicated and more severe on the taxpayer owning the interest than equivalent provisions to tax domestic-source income. Complexity and severe treatment appear to be necessary 6 In addition, these and many other countries tax other offshore income earned on behalf of individuals through provisions of their domestic law, like their capital gains taxes. 25 costs of protecting the tax base from offshore funds that provide tax avoidance or deferral benefits. Canada Canadian residents with interests in Offshore Investment Fund Property are subject to an annual imputation of income. Canada avoids any difficulties in obtaining information on the annual return of the fund by deeming the investment to earn a prescribed rate of return equal to the interest rate levied on unpaid taxes. Offshore investment funds are subject to this treatment if tax deferral is a primary motivation for holding the interest. Canada decides to accord this special tax treatment by looking at such factors as the foreign tax paid by the fund and the extent of fund distributions. The calculation of income from Offshore Investment Fund Property for Canadian residents is simpler than the FIF calculation for New Zealand residents. However, under the Canadian approach, taxpayers are levied on the basis of an assumed return, which may bear no relation to actual earnings. United Kingdom The United Kingdom does not tax income from non-qualifying offshore funds (non-resident companies, unit trusts or similar entities that distribute less than 85% of income) until distribution or realisation. British investors must report net gains from sales of non-qualifying offshore funds as ordinary income, rather than capital gains. Thus, investors in offshore funds cannot take advantage of the annual capital gains exemption and indexation allowance for capital gains. Investors cannot offset any losses on offshore funds against other income. By delaying tax until realisation, the British approach can induce a ‘lock in’ effect, discouraging the sale of offshore investments. Realisation taxes also require records of the purchase price of assets to be kept until disposal. Special ordering rules are also required to deal with disposal of part of a holding. United States American shareholders of Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs) are not taxed until they receive distributions or sell their shares. A PFIC is any foreign corporation or fund that earns 75% or more of gross income from ‘passive investments’ or holds 50% or more of total assets in the form of ‘passive investments’. Unlike tax on other income, the tax calculation for PFICs includes an interest charge to offset the benefits of tax deferral. The calculation 26 of this interest charge can be very complicated and can require extensive record keeping. Problems with the current FIF regime The definition of what constitutes a FIF is based on a set of qualifying tests of whether the offshore entity is structured to avoid or defer tax. However, individual investors often cannot obtain the information needed to determine whether an entity is or is not a FIF. Taxpayers have been dependent on determinations by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on whether particular entities are FIFs. The determination process has itself been lengthy because of the difficulty of obtaining information on foreign entities. Whether there are any significant compliance problems apart from the determination that the entity is a FIF depends on the nature of the entity. If the market value of the interest is readily available, for example traded shares, then compliance with the current FIF regime is reasonably easy. The calculation of taxable income is very simple. For some offshore funds, however, the market value required for the annual calculation of FIF income cannot be easily established because the funds are not traded. For example, in most cases, New Zealand residents with interests in foreign superannuation and life insurance funds will not be able to obtain a current market value of their interests. Some options for change The Government believes that New Zealand’s FIF regime can and must be improved to ease taxpayer compliance. The Government is particularly concerned about the compliance problems facing small investors with minimal FIF interests. In considering changes to the FIF regime, the Government will have regard to: • compliance costs • the role of the FIF regime in backing up any modified CFC regime • the revenue effects of any changes, including tax avoidance possibilities created by any changed regime • the interaction of the FIF regime with other parts of the tax system, especially the taxation of domestic superannuation and life insurance 27 • the desirability of taxing foreign-source income. Definition of a FIF As noted above, the greatest difficulty in the FIF regime is determining what is a FIF. Taxpayers and administrators often do not have and cannot easily obtain the necessary information to determine whether an entity meets the tests listed above. The Government will consider whether the definition of what constitutes a FIF can be changed to make the regime easier to comply with. One option is to class as FIFs all entities that are resident outside an expanded list of countries and are not CFCs. This would reduce the costs of determining whether an entity is a FIF, but would expand the scope of the regime. The Government has not made any decision on whether it will pursue this option. Small FIF holdings The Government is exploring the possibility of providing a simpler method of taxation for taxpayers with FIF investments below a minimum threshold. One option is an outright exemption if a taxpayer’s total FIF interests or FIF income were below a specified threshold. However, as the Consultative Committee on Tax Simplification pointed out, such an exemption would lead to a variety of problems. In particular, an outright exemption based on the level of FIF income earned will still require taxpayers to determine whether they earned FIF income and how much. Thus taxpayers would still incur significant compliance costs, but would pay no tax. An outright exemption would also undermine the objective of protecting the tax base. All taxpayers would have an incentive to avoid or defer tax by investing in FIFs up to the minimum threshold. This means that the threshold would have to be so small as to be of little practical value if significant fiscal costs and flight of funds for investment offshore were to be avoided. Choice of taxation methods for small FIF investors A further option is to offer those with total FIF interests below a specified threshold a choice between: • the current system of calculating and taxing FIF income annually; or 28 • taxation on distribution or realisation of FIF returns. To offset the benefits of deferring tax, a higher rate might be applied for small FIF investors opting for the realisation basis. Alternatively, a deemed earnings rate, along the lines of the Canadian approach, might apply during the time the individual holds an interest in a FIF. Foreign superannuation and life insurance funds Foreign superannuation and life insurance funds pose a particular problem. Earnings of offshore funds cannot be taxed directly on the same current basis as domestic superannuation and life insurance funds. However, if offshore funds were not subject to similar tax treatment as domestic funds, New Zealand superannuation funds and life offices would face a severe competitive disadvantage. Foreign superannuation and life insurance funds are included in the FIF regime to place the tax treatment of foreign and domestic funds on a comparable basis. However, it is often very difficult to obtain an annual market valuation of an investor’s interest in a foreign superannuation or life insurance fund. One possible solution to this problem would be to develop a separate tax treatment for investments in foreign superannuation and life insurance funds. One option might be to require New Zealand residents to pay a withholding tax of 33% of gross contributions. This would effectively act as a withholding of tax on future fund earnings. At the end of the term of the investment, contributors could have the option of reconciling on a Yield to Maturity basis or of paying tax on the withdrawals. Foreign Dividend Withholding Payment (FDWP) regime FDWP is a withholding payment on income earned offshore on behalf of shareholders of New Zealand companies. Operation of the regime FDWP applies when offshore income is repatriated to New Zealand in the form of dividends. Companies receiving such dividends are required to withhold 33% of the dividend against the future taxation liability of their shareholders. 29 When a New Zealand company which has paid FDWP distributes dividends to its shareholders, it attaches a FDWP credit which the shareholders can apply against their own tax liability. FDWP credits in excess of any tax liability are refunded in cash. However, to the extent the New Zealand company receiving the foreign-source dividend (and therefore paying FDWP) does not distribute its profits to its shareholders, FDWP constitutes a final tax. FDWP applies to dividends received by a company from foreign companies in all countries. For reasons outlined in Chapter 2, it is generally desirable that offshore income earned on behalf of New Zealand residents should be subject to tax. FDWP acts as a complement to the CFC and FIF regimes by ensuring that income earned on behalf of New Zealand residents in foreign entities is taxed when it is received by a New Zealand entity. The FDWP regime has been criticised for discouraging repatriation of dividends to New Zealand. This would occur when the New Zealand parent was not immediately passing all FDWP credits on to individual shareholders. In contrast, the CFC and FIF regimes, by taxing on an accruals basis, avoid this ‘lock-in’ effect, but do so at the expense of higher compliance costs. In reviewing the place of the FDWP within the tax system, the Government will have regard to: • the effect FDWP has on companies’ decisions to repatriate profits to New Zealand • the role FDWP has in supporting the CFC and FIF regimes • the compliance costs of the FDWP regime • the general desire to tax foreign-source income • the role of the FDWP regime in the context of the repeal of the inter-corporate dividend exemption.7 7 The Government has announced that in future resident companies will be taxed on the divi­ dends they receive from other resident companies. Previously, such dividends were exempt from tax 30 CHAPTER 5 Bilateral Action There is a limit to the international taxation objectives New Zealand can achieve alone. While domestic law will always be the primary source of any country’s international tax rules, there are instances where a country has to work with another country to achieve a desired taxation result. In principle, two countries working in concert can obtain better investment patterns than each can obtain working in isolation. This chapter discusses bilateral tax agreements and the bilateral actions New Zealand plans to take in the near future. The role of bilateral tax agreements Defining the international tax base A country’s domestic laws form the basis of its international tax system. As there are no international laws allocating taxing rights, countries can claim the right to tax any income earned anywhere. New Zealand’s rules for imposing tax on international income flows, like those of all countries, are found in domestic law. The inevitable result of having any international taxing rules is that New Zealand and other countries will in some cases assert taxing rights over the same persons and transactions. Thus, a secondary issue is whether it is in New Zealand’s interest as a whole to relieve instances of double taxation. Double taxation should be relieved where it is distorting business decision making away from New Zealand’s overall interests. But the extent of the relief should be limited to that necessary to remove the distortion. In some circumstances, this will require some double taxation to remain. In seeking to reduce the adverse effects of double taxation, New Zealand needs to remember that taxes paid to foreign governments are of no benefit to New Zealand or its residents. Taxes paid to foreign governments are no different from any other cost of doing business in a foreign country (see footnote 3). 31 In contrast, taxes paid to New Zealand, by either residents or non-residents, are of benefit to New Zealand as a whole. Reducing undesirable double taxation Co-ordinated action by two countries to impose similar tax burdens on investment funds flowing between them to the tax burdens applying to purely domestic investment can, however, yield benefits to both. In particular, it can lead to a pattern of investment which yields higher pre-tax returns to aggregate investment within the two countries, notwithstanding that higher taxes will be required elsewhere to make up the revenue foregone by reducing international double taxation. Once any undesirable double taxation has been identified, the best way to reduce that double taxation must be found. The only way that double taxation can be relieved is by governments giving up the right to tax certain types of income or agreeing to limit the taxes they impose on other types. As part of being co-operative members of the community of nations, many countries including New Zealand reduce double taxation unilaterally in domestic law. This usually takes the form of a foreign tax credit or an exemption for foreign-source income. In New Zealand’s case, it is a credit system. Section 293 of the New Zealand Income Tax Act provides a New Zealand tax credit for foreign taxes paid by the taxpayer up to the New Zealand rate of tax applicable on that income. This is a unilateral provision applying to all foreign income taxes. Bilateral measures can also be used to reduce undesirable double taxation. The most common form of bilateral action is a double tax agreement or DTA. DTAs involve a government agreeing to give up or limit its taxing rights, in exchange for reciprocal action by the other government. DTAs can also aid tax administration; for example, by allowing for the exchange of information between tax administrations and by containing dispute resolution procedures. Where states have taken unilateral measures to alleviate undesirable double taxation, DTAs by and large refine and adapt these general domestic rules in the context of two particular tax systems. DTAs allow countries to divide the cost of reducing undesirable double taxation in a manner that may make both countries better off. 32 DTA provisions which limit taxing powers prevail if there is any conflict between the DTA provisions and domestic rules imposing taxes. However, DTAs do not impose taxes. As DTAs involve bilateral negotiation, they tend to be more difficult to amend than domestic law and give investors a greater degree of certainty than if the rules merely appeared in legislation. Dealing with international tax problems With modem developments such as the globalisation of the world economy and the removal of exchange and other government controls, countries are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their income tax bases. The problem is particularly acute in relation to the multinational corporate groups that are responsible for much international investment and trade. As a result, a country with an open economy like New Zealand needs to consider what, if any, its response should be to issues such as: • the setting of artificial prices between related parties as means of shifting profits to low-tax countries - ‘transfer pricing’ • the practice of non-residents over-funding resident companies with debt in order to reduce company taxes -‘thin capitalisation’ • the structuring of transnational financial leases in order to take advantage of the tax bases of several countries to lower the cost of capital. Should New Zealand decide that it needs to act against thin capitalisation, transnational financial leases or any other international tax problems in the future, it will need to do so by enacting more domestic rules. Bilateral action, however, may be needed to help harmonise the unilateral provisions of two countries and make them more effective. Where a DTA is contributing to a problem in New Zealand’s tax system it will be necessary to seek amendments to the DTA. Implications for policy making and treaty negotiation In relieving undesirable double taxation and dealing with current international tax problems, domestic tax rules have a primary role and DTAs play a secondary but important role. This has implications for prioritising work on international tax and developing DTA negotiating objectives and strategies. 33 The first task is to identify New Zealand’s international tax goals. These goals have been set out in broad terms in the preceding parts of this paper. The second is to determine how to implement those goals. In most cases that will be in domestic law, taking into account any impediments that might exist in DTAs. Where New Zealand is unable to persuade another country to accept a New Zealand policy goal in the DTA, we should at least make sure that the DTA does not prevent us acting unilaterally to safeguard our essential interests through our domestic law. Effect of DTAs DTAs are fiscal documents. In addition to their role in removing double taxation, effective DTAs can assist investment and trade. However, particularly where New Zealand is a net capital importer from the proposed DTA partner, concluding a DTA can reduce the amount of revenue available to the Government.8 The Government needs to consider, therefore, whether the gains from a DTA in terms of increased investment and trade outweigh the fiscal cost. The interaction of the unilateral provisions of the two countries’ tax systems often means that the total tax burden of a taxpayer does not change as a result of a DTA being concluded. In practice, all that changes because of a DTA is the government to which those taxes are paid. This is illustrated in the Annex. New Zealand grants a unilateral foreign tax credit for income taxes paid by New Zealand residents to foreign governments. This applies regardless of whether there is a DTA or not. In this context, the use of the term ‘double tax agreements’ is a misnomer. New Zealand’s unilateral action is the primary means of relieving double taxation. The DTA refines the relief granted. DTAs mainly distribute the cost of relieving double taxation between Governments. While DTAs concern all types of income (including investment, trade and personal services income), their major impact is in respect of investment income. One reason is the magnitude of international capital flows. For example, annual international capital flows are now around 40 times higher than the value of international trade flows. In addition, DTAs can have a clear impact on the overall taxation on investment income. For example, DTAs often lower rates of NRWT on gross interest payments. This can ensure that a financial intermediary’s net profit on a transaction is not entirely 8 New Zealand is an overall net capital importer, although it is a net capital exporter to a small number of individual countries. Therefore, the overall fiscal effect of New Zealand’s DTA network is negative - New Zealand has given up more revenue than it has gained. 34 taxed away in the source country (see Chapter 3). The impact of DTAs on the overall taxation of trade income, however, is often limited. (See the Annex .) DTA policy Review of existing DTAs The Government is considering instigating an ongoing review of each of New Zealand’s 24 existing DTAs to ensure that they are in line with current taxation and economic policy and are contributing to New Zealand’s economic growth. Highest priority will be given to the DTAs with New Zealand’s major trading and investment partners. The taxation aspects of the the 1992 Review of the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with Australia are discussed in greater detail below. New Zealand will seek to re-negotiate DTAs that have fallen out of line with current policy. Criteria for assessing DTAs In addressing international tax matters, the Government will first identify any taxation problems before going on to identify the possible solutions and, importantly, their cost. If New Zealand is considering a new DTA or is re-negotiating an existing DTA, it should ask: • What are the tax problems that the DTA will overcome? • How will a DTA correct these problems? • What will be the fiscal cost of the DTA? • What are the risks to the New Zealand tax base of the DTA? • What will be the benefits to New Zealand as a whole from the DTA? • What alternative solutions exist to solve the tax problems the DTA will correct, and what are the costs and benefits of those alternatives? Once it has answered these questions, the final decision will be based on an assessment of the relative costs and benefits of the available options. 35 DTAs can be valuable demonstrations of the good relations between nations. New Zealand will continue to seek to strengthen its ties with other nations through DTAs. However, DTAs concluded largely for foreign policy reasons should include provisions for termination in the event that changing circumstances (for instance, changes in the tax system of the DTA partner) result in the DTA causing an unacceptable fiscal cost. Conclusion The same criteria that are used to assess proposed changes to domestic tax laws will be used to assess proposed DTAs. Within these constraints, New Zealand will continue to use DTAs where they can provide a positive effect on investment and trade. Australia New Zealand’s most important bilateral economic relationship is with Australia. With the achievement of free trade in goods and near free trade in services under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER), the remaining major area of unfinished business under CER is investment. Beyond both governments agreeing to consult on specific issues as they arise, investment has effectively remained outside the CER agenda to date. An efficient trans-Tasman investment regime is important to achieving and realising the full benefits of an integrated Australia-New Zealand market. The tax regime has been identified in both countries as a critical impediment to rational investment and efficient trans-Tasman equity/debt markets. The current rules and high compliance costs are seen as particularly detrimental. The New Zealand Government is committed to reforms of the trans-Tasman tax system. The New Zealand Minister for Trade Negotiations has agreed with his Australian counterpart that tax should be high on the agenda of the 1992 Review of CER. International relations considerations 36 New Zealand officials have been instructed to pursue trans-Tasman tax reform as a priority issue. Face to face discussions with Australia will begin soon. Mechanisms for reform Many trans-Tasman tax issues arise from the CER free-trade zone and, therefore, are outside the scope of a traditional double taxation agreement. The New Zealand Government is committed to finding the best solution to trans-Tasman tax problems. Reforming trans-Tasman tax brings new challenges to the way taxation policy is developed. The New Zealand Government has no preconceived ideas about whether an expanded DTA, a separate tax treaty under the CER umbrella or reciprocal legislation presents the best solution. New Zealand’s approach is to start with the problems, look for possible solutions and think about possible mechanisms last (e.g. a new double tax agreement, reciprocal legislation, administrative action or unilateral legislation). In thinking about solutions, New Zealand will keep in mind its tax design criteria of efficiency, fairness and simplicity. The fiscal cost and likely benefits of each option will also be important factors. 37 ANNEX The practical effect of DTAs on tax paid by New Zealand exporters Introduction This annex illustrates two points: • The effect of DTAs on the overall tax paid by New Zealand exporters on their business profits is often limited. • DTAs may have important effects on the respective tax takes of New Zealand and the other country involved. The examples are highly generalised to draw out what often happens in practice. It is not possible in a short Annex to deal with all possible impacts of DTAs on New Zealand’s exports. The focus of this Annex is on what generally happens. Exceptions have been ignored, particularly where they involve technical rules. Cases compared The Annex compares in broad terms the typical tax consequences for the business profits of a New Zealander trading: • with a country with which we have a DTA that follows the OECD Model • with a country with which we do not have a DTA. The examples follow a New Zealand exporter penetrating an export market step by step. They outline the likely tax consequences as the exporter takes each step further into the market. The revenue implications for both countries at each stage are noted at the end of each section. Exporting goods to a foreign firm in Country X Much international trade would be covered under this heading. In practice, a typical DTA will not alter the basic domestic tax treatment in both countries of the business profits arising from this transaction. 38 Country X is unlikely to tax the profits on this transaction. The ex­ porter will be fully taxable on its net sales income in New Zealand. The DTA business profits article is unlikely to alter the revenue col­ lected by either country on this transaction. Setting up a storage warehouse in Country X A typical DTA is likely to result in the same level of taxation as ap­ plies when there is no DTA. However, different amounts of tax will be paid to different governments. A typical DTA would provide that an exporter setting up a storage warehouse does not have sufficient connection with Country X to be taxable there on the business profits attributable to the warehouse. (In technical terms, this warehouse is not a ‘permanent establish­ ment’ of the New Zealand exporter in Country X.) Those profits would be taxable only in New Zealand. Without a DTA, the business profits of the warehouse are likely to be taxable in both Country X and New Zealand. New Zealand’s tax law, however, permits an offsetting of the tax paid on foreign-source income against the tax due domestically up to the New Zealand tax due on that income. Thus, whether there is a DTA or not, the tax re­ sult is likely to be the same unless Country X charges more tax on that income than New Zealand would. In this case, the exporter must pay the excess tax without credit. In this case, the business profits and permanent establishment rules in the DTA have increased New Zealand’s tax revenue at the expense of Country X’s tax take. The DTA overrode Country X’s source rules that required relatively little presence or activity in that country be­ fore the New Zealand exporter was taxed there. In effect, New Zealand can tax those profits and there is no Country X tax for which New Zealand must give credit. Where New Zealand exports more capital to Country X than vice versa, it is in New Zealand’s interest to negotiate definitions that re­ quire relatively more presence or activity before a permanent estab­ lishment is said to exist. Where New Zealand is a net capital-importer, it is in New Zealand’s interest to negotiate defini­ tions that require relatively little presence or activity before a perma­ nent establishment is said to exist. Setting up retail shop in Country X A typical DTA is unlikely to produce a different tax treatment or re­ sult than the two sets of domestic rules would on their own. 39 A typical DTA would provide that an exporter setting up a retail shop in Country X does have sufficient connection with that country to be taxable there on the business profits attributable to the shop. (In technical terms, this shop is a ‘permanent establishment’ of the New Zealand exporter in Country X.) The shop’s business profits would also be taxable in New Zealand with a credit for Country X’s tax. Without a DTA, the business profits of the shop would be taxable in both Country X and New Zealand. New Zealand’s tax law, however, permits an offsetting of the tax paid on foreign-source income against the tax due domestically. Thus, whether there is a DTA or not, the tax result is likely to be the same. In this case, the business profits and permanent establishment rules in the DTA are unlikely to alter the tax takes of Country X or New Zealand, as defined in their respective domestic law. Incorporating the shops trading in Country X This is the most common way that businesses, other than financial institutions, operate in other countries. An incorporated business managed and trading in Country X is likely to be taxable on its business profits in Country X alone, whether there is a DTA or not. A DTA, however, is likely to lower the rates of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) that Country X can levy on profits being repatriated to New Zealand. However, as New Zealand grants a credit for NRWT, the effect of lower rates of NRWT in most cases is not to reduce the total burden of tax payable but to change the distribution of taxes paid to Country X and New Zealand. Where New Zealand is the net capital-exporter of the two countries, the general effect of a DTA lowering NRWT rates is to increase New Zealand’s tax take. There will be less foreign tax to credit and, ac­ cordingly, more scope for New Zealand taxation. The opposite is true where New Zealand is the net capital-importer of the two coun­ tries. Implications for policy making and treaty negotiation To sum up, the unilateral foreign tax credit in our domestic tax law often means that DTAs have limited effect on the overall tax paid by New Zealand exporters on their business profits. DTAs, however, may have important effects on the respective sizes of the tax takes of New Zealand and the other country. In order to determine the likely 40 magnitude of those effects, it would be necessary to take into account more factors than has been possible in this short Annex. The examples also demonstrate how the interplay between the do­ mestic tax system of New Zealand and another country can often achieve a similar result to that achieved by a DTA. One of the main exceptions is illustrated by the storage warehouse example above. In that example, the DTA was more generous to the New Zealand investor than the foreign domestic-source rules were in determining when the foreign country could tax the profits of the New Zealand enterprise in that country. This may have little net ef­ fect for the New Zealand exporter in that where foreign taxes are paid they will generally be creditable in New Zealand. However, for the period that the exporter is deemed not to have a permanent establish­ ment in that country, the exporter is freed from filing a return in the foreign country and paying foreign taxes that would generally be creditable.

DRAFT LEGISLATION iv CONTENTS PART ONE CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 1.1 Purpose of the Discussion Document The Companies Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1990. After consideration by the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee the Bill was reported back to Parliament on 15 December 1992. The resulting Act, the Companies Act 1993, was enacted by Parliament in September 1993, and is scheduled to come into effect on 1 July 1994, together with other ancillary measures forming the company law reform package. This discussion document assesses the implications of company law changes for income tax rules in the various Revenue Acts, in particular the Income Tax Act 1976. The purpose of this document is to put the Government's perspective on the issues before the taxpaying community as part of the process of undertaking widespread consultation on tax policy changes. The Government seeks to ensure that the reasons for tax policy changes are well understood and that, before they become law, tax policy changes are properly worked through with those in the private sector who will operate under them. 1.2 Submissions Submissions are invited on the various proposals. They should be addressed to: The Director Legislative Affairs Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Submissions should be made by 21 February 1994. They should contain a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. Following a full and thorough consideration of submissions by the Government, legislation to amend the various Revenue Acts to accommodate the new companies regime will be introduced into Parliament. The legislation will be considered by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee of the House of Representatives. There will be a full opportunity for interested parties to make submissions on the legislation during the Select Committee process. CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 1 1.3 Background The major income tax implications of recent company law reforms relate to: • provisions in company law that allow a company to purchase its own shares; • company amalgamations and their treatment for tax purposes; • tax accounting procedures for existing companies when they register under the new companies regime; • the implications of the repeal of the notions of "par value" and "nominal capital", and "share premium"; • miscellaneous changes to the Income Tax Act where existing concepts and terminology will be redundant or are to be modified by the new companies regime. (For example, the new Companies Act does not retain the current distinction between public and private companies.) 1.4 Objective and Scope of this Review The objective of this review is to revise those aspects of taxation law that require amendment because of the linkages between company and taxation law. The review is not a complete revision of company taxation. The Government desires to see taxation law integrate well with revised company law rules. While there is no desire to see taxation provisions inhibit the willingness of companies to take advantage of any increased flexibility that company law changes may confer, the need to maintain the integrity of the tax base must be given due weight. It is unrealistic to assume that because company law changes may increase the ability of companies to restructure or return funds to shareholders, tax imposts on such activities should be removed. Tax rules must be designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the competing considerations of maximising commercial activity and maintaining robust and fair taxation rules. Furthermore, the Government seeks rules that provide certainty and that impose as few as possible compliance costs on taxpayers in their day to day operations. Existing tax rules which govern company distributions have also been reviewed. There are significant weaknesses in existing rules designed to prevent companies substituting tax-free distributions of subscribed capital for taxable distributions when shares are redeemed or cancelled by an on-going company. The current anti-dividend substitution rules are set out in section 4A(1)(c)(ii) of the Income Tax Act. Weaknesses include: 2 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW • The uncertain nature of existing rules. There is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances in which existing anti-dividend substitution rules apply and the exact meaning of the words used in the provisions. Consequently, the rules are difficult to apply in practice. • Inadequate marshalling rules. Existing rules provide opportunities for companies to attribute the entire amount of a distribution to tax-free reserves even though taxable reserves remain in the company. This effectively allows tax-free reserves to be distributed first. These weaknesses would be aggravated by the greater ease with which shareholders will be able to access the capital of a company under the new Companies Act. In addition, existing rules aimed at preventing reserves that are taxable on distribution from being converted into tax-free reserves through share for share transactions are not completely effective. These rules include the restrictive definition of "qualifying share premium". In order to address the weaknesses of the existing rules, this discussion document proposes new rules that: • define clearly when distributions made by way of share repurchases, cancellations or redemptions are deemed to be dividends; • modify the averaging formula that defines the portion of a distribution that is tax-free on the repurchase or redemption of shares, or liquidation of a company; • define additions to subscribed capital where shares are issued either: - directly or indirectly in consideration for the acquisition of shares in another company; or - in circumstances where the subscription for that issue is funded by the payment of tax-free inter-corporate dividends by the issuing company. The background to these proposals is described in more detail later in this report. 1.5 Outline of the Document This document is set out in two parts. Part One comprises five chapters and details the major tax implications of company law changes and proposed tax policy responses. Part Two contains draft legislation and explanatory notes to the legislation. CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 3 An overview of the significant implications of proposed changes to companies legislation on current tax rules is outlined below. The issues are discussed in more depth in succeeding chapters. 1.5.1 Share Repurchases and Related Issues (Chapter 2) From a tax perspective, proposed changes to company law will have their most significant impact on the tax treatment of company distributions. A key change is that companies will be able to purchase their own shares. Sections 58 to 67 of the new Companies Act provide that a company may purchase its own shares subject to: • the company's constitution containing a power to repurchase; • the solvency test; • the repurchase being fair and reasonable to the company and its shareholders; • no material information being withheld from shareholders; • shareholders receiving advance advice of the repurchase (with an exception for small repurchases made on the stock exchange). Repurchases can be initiated by the company only if the repurchase is made on: • a pro rata basis, that is, an offer is made to all shareholders to acquire a proportion of the shares that would, if accepted, leave unaffected relative voting and distribution rights (section 60(1)(a) of the new Companies Act); or • a selective basis, that is, an offer is made selectively to one or more shareholders to acquire shares (section 60(1)(b) of the new Companies Act); or • a stock exchange, so giving all shareholders the same opportunity to sell some or all of their shares (sections 63 and 65 of the new Companies Act). In all cases, shares are cancelled upon repurchase. A company may repurchase on the stock exchange, without prior notice to its shareholders, up to 5 percent of its shares in any 12-month period. However, it must advise its shareholders of any such repurchase within 10 working days of the repurchase occurring. A share repurchase may also be initiated by a shareholder under the buy-out of minority shareholder provisions in section 110 of the new Companies Act. A shareholder can require the company to repurchase his or her shares if: 4 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW • The shareholder casts all his or her votes against a resolution (passed by other shareholders) to: - adopt or revoke the company's constitution; - alter the company's constitution to impose or remove a restriction on the activities of the company; - approve a major transaction (defined in section 129 of the new Companies Act); - approve an amalgamation; or • The shareholder does not sign a shareholders' resolution made in accordance with section 122 of the new Companies Act. Such a resolution must be signed by at least 75 percent of the company's shareholders representing at least 75 percent of votes entitled to be cast on that resolution. A company may arrange for the shares it is required to repurchase to be acquired by another party. The basic issues with respect to the tax treatment of share repurchases discussed in Chapter 2 are: • determining the reserves from which tax-free distributions resulting from share repurchases can be funded (referred to as "tax-free reserves"); • determining when distributions by way of repurchases can be attributed to tax-free reserves; • the mechanism for taxing the dividend component of share repurchases. At present companies are able to cancel their own shares, subject to High Court approval, or, in the case of redeemable preference shares, redeem their own shares. However, the new Companies Act provides greater scope for companies to provide a cash return to shareholders in a form other than an ordinary dividend. This follows from the relaxation of the constraints on share repurchases or cancellations and the removal of the current company law requirement to distinguish between reserves that consist of subscribed capital and other reserves. 1.5.2 Amalgamations (Chapter 3) The new Companies Act provides that two or more companies may amalgamate and continue as one company, which may be one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. Broadly, the procedure to amalgamate requires CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 5 the consent of the boards and shareholders of each amalgamating company; there is no court involvement. The consent by shareholders must be by way of special resolution and the amalgamated company must satisfy the solvency test immediately after amalgamation. A short-form amalgamation procedure is provided under section 222 of the new Companies Act for a wholly-owned subsidiary that amalgamates with a parent or two wholly-owned subsidiaries that amalgamate. Under the short-form procedure, an amalgamation may be approved solely by the boards of each amalgamating company agreeing to the amalgamation, provided that the solvency test is still met. Following approvals, an amalgamation proposal is registered with the Registrar of Companies, who thereupon issues an amalgamation certificate. The certificate specifies the effective date of amalgamation. The new Companies Act provides that all assets and liabilities of the amalgamating companies are vested in the amalgamated company. However, shareholders of amalgamating companies must agree to the terms of the amalgamation, and shares and rights of shareholders in amalgamating companies are not necessarily converted into shares and rights in the amalgamated company. Where one amalgamating company holds shares in another amalgamating company, those shares must be cancelled for no payment when amalgamation becomes effective. Under current tax law, there are full tax consequences on the transfer of assets from the amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, and on the exchange of shares in the amalgamating companies for shares in the amalgamated company, where those are held on revenue account. Tax losses and imputation credits are generally extinguished. These consequences follow from an amalgamation being treated in substantially the same manner as a liquidation. Under the new rules proposed in Chapter 3, amalgamating companies would be able to utilise tax-free asset transfer rules based on the existing consolidation regime. The tax losses and imputation credits of the amalgamating companies will be able to be retained, subject to shareholder continuity and commonality tests being met. Dispositions of shares occurring under an amalgamation would continue to be assessable to revenue account shareholders. 1.5.3 Tax Accounting Issues (Chapter 4) Treatment of Reserves Company law reform will remove the concepts of "par value", "nominal capital" and "share premium" on which existing tax law relies. As a result, it is proposed that tax rules be amended to focus on subscribed capital (consisting of the sum of what is now paid-up capital and qualifying share premium). When existing 6 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW companies register under the new companies regime, it will be necessary to convert reserve accounts for tax purposes into a form appropriate to the new regime. The treatment in this context of paid-up capital, including bonus issues, share premium and capital redemption reserves, is covered in Chapter 4. Also considered in Chapter 4 is the carry over into the amended dividend definition applying after the enactment of company law reform of an equivalent of the concept of "qualifying share premium". Existing rules limit the range of share premium eligible for tax-free distribution to "qualifying share premium". This limitation is aimed at preventing companies from creating, via share swaps, share premium reserves on take-overs or mergers from which tax-free distributions can be made. Tax accounting issues relating to amalgamation are also addressed, as is the extent to which subscribed capital can be derived directly or indirectly from exempt inter-corporate dividends. Recovery of Excess Distributions The new Companies Act provides in section 56 for a company to recover distributions made to shareholders where such distributions breach the solvency test. The recovery of distributions from shareholders is likely to be a rare event, since repayment by the shareholder would not be required if the unauthorised dividend was received in good faith, and it would be unfair to require repayment having regard to the altered circumstances of the shareholder. The discussion document outlines how current income tax rules will need to be amended in order to cater for situations where taxable distributions are later returned to a company. 1.5.4 Miscellaneous Issues (Chapter 5) In addition to the issues outlined above, there are also a number of consequential changes to the Income Tax Act resulting from terminology changes in company law. A number of the existing definitions, largely relating to defining a shareholder's interest in a company, rely on the concepts of nominal and paid-up capital that, as previously noted, will have no relevance under the new companies regime. Also, the removal of the private/public company distinction means that changes will be necessary to those provisions of the Income Tax Act that rely on the definition of "private" and "public" companies. CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 7 8 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 2.1 Background The new Companies Act treats share repurchases as a distribution. When making a distribution under the new Companies Act a company is subject only to restrictions in the company's constitution and to satisfying the solvency test in section 4 of the Act. The term "distribution" is defined widely in section 2 of the Act to mean: "(a) the direct or indirect transfer of money or property, other than the company's own shares, to or for the benefit of \[a\] shareholder; or (b) the incurring of a debt to or for the benefit of \[a\] shareholder; in relation to shares held by that shareholder, and whether by means of a purchase of property, the redemption or other acquisition of shares, a distribution of indebtedness, or by some other means." There is no longer a restriction as to the fund or reserve out of which a distribution can be made. A distribution can now be made out of capital. The definition of a distribution recognises that, regardless of its form, a distribution by a company reduces the cushion of reserves available to creditors. The new Companies Act distinguishes between distributions in the form of "dividends" and other distributions, such as share repurchases and certain redemptions, because the administrative rules governing the payment of dividends differ in detail from those that govern other forms of distribution. However, the economic equivalence of all forms of distribution made by an on-going company is recognised so that all distributions, whatever their form, are subject to the same solvency test. 2.2 General Considerations Share repurchases as provided for in the new Companies Act are not contemplated under existing tax rules. The closest existing analogy to a share repurchase is a share cancellation. Both reduce the capital of the company. Until such time as a company is registered under the new Companies Act, if it wishes to reduce its capital it will only be able to cancel shares. Accordingly, the treatment applied to cancellations should, as far as possible, parallel the tax treatment of repurchases. The Valabh Committee considered the appropriate treatment of share repurchases in its two reports on The Taxation of Distributions From Companies, released in November 1990 and July 1991. The Committee proposed a CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 9 mechanism by which the dividend component of share repurchases could be subject to tax. A number of submissions to that Committee argued that, except in certain circumstances, a repurchase should be treated in the same way as a sale of shares to a third party. That is, no tax consequences should arise if the shares repurchased were on capital account. Furthermore, submissions argued that to tax the dividend component of a share repurchase would mean that it would never be prudent for a company to repurchase its shares because it would have to pay a premium on the market price. This was seen as undermining the objectives of proposed company law reform. The Valabh Committee considered these objections but maintained its earlier view that there is little difference in principle between the distribution of retained earnings as an ordinary dividend and the distribution of retained earnings by way of a share repurchase by a company. The effect on the company's retained earnings and shareholders' total wealth is the same in each situation. It logically follows that the overall tax consequences of each type of distribution should be identical. If this were not the case there would be an incentive for companies to characterise dividends as share repurchases (Valabh Committee (1991) p33). The Valabh Committee also rejected the argument that treating share repurchases and other distributions in a consistent manner would undermine company law reform. As the Committee noted, this is no more true than to say that taxation of ordinary dividends undermines company law provisions allowing the payment of such dividends (ibid, p33). The Government agrees with the Valabh Committee's general conclusions. There are three key questions to consider, however: • What part of the repurchase proceeds should be tax-free in the hands of the shareholder? In particular, should distributions funded from capital profits be tax-free when made through repurchases? • What ordering rule is to be used to determine the portion of the amount paid on the repurchase of shares that is tax-free? • What is the most appropriate mechanism for taxing the dividend component of amounts distributed through a repurchase? These issues are discussed below. 10 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 2.3 Current Rules For Taxing Share Cancellations 2.3.1 The Current Rules Under current income tax law: • A payment made to shareholders on cancellation of a share during the life of a company is taxable unless it represents a return of capital. • Cancellation payments funded from a company's capital gains are taxable (except on a full liquidation). This is consistent with the rules for dividends generally. Dividends funded from capital gains are taxable. • Rules apply to determine the contributed capital amount and qualifying share premium amount per share. This is the amount that can be returned tax-free. Where the company is being liquidated, capital profits can also be distributed tax-free. The formulae for determining these tax-free components are outlined in Annex 2.1. • Rules also apply to determine when a distribution is in substitution for a dividend, in which case the full amount is taxable. These rules are contained in section 4A(1)(c)(ii) of the Income Tax Act. Dividends are easily distinguished conceptually from a return of subscribed capital from a company to its shareholders. They are normally seen as a distribution of the profits of the enterprise to its owners. In a perfectly operating company tax system, imputation credits equivalent to full company tax would be attached to dividends. By contrast, a return of subscribed capital would be expected to be an unusual one-off event reflecting a distinct feature of a company at any point in time. To the extent that a company distribution to a shareholder consists merely of a return of the shareholder's investment, the distribution should not constitute a taxable dividend. While it is conceptually clear, there are difficulties in applying this "in principle" distinction in the operating commercial environment. First, the funds actually held by the company are not necessarily equal to the amount an individual shareholder has invested. Many shares are likely to have been purchased on the secondary market at a price different from their issue price. With bonds, this issue is dealt with by taxing as income any gain made by the holder on the bond. However, the same treatment applied to shares would result in the taxation of gains on shares held on capital account. The approach adopted for shares therefore is to treat as a return of capital the amount invested in a company with respect to those shares by the original shareholder. Under existing law this amount is paid-up capital for tax purposes. When company law reforms become effective, it will be subscribed capital. The concept of subscribed capital is considered in more detail in Chapter 4. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 11 Second, it is not uncommon for companies to issue bonus shares in lieu of dividends, or periodically seek new capital by offering new shares to existing shareholders. As the issue price of the new shares usually varies from the price of the initial shares, shares of the same class represent differing levels of investment in the company. Companies do not necessarily keep records tracing the issue price of specific shares. Thus, tax rules apply an averaging formula to compute the amount of capital attributable to shares in a class. Third, allowing companies to determine the source of the distribution without constraint (other than in the course of a liquidation) would seriously undermine the dividend tax base since it would allow companies to substitute distributions funded from tax-free sources for taxable distributions of retained earnings. Consequently, the current rules identify the order in which the funds are sourced. Any amount over and above paid-up capital is deemed to be a distribution of revenue reserves and is taxed. Where the market price is paid for the share, the current rule results in a distribution arising from a share cancellation being deemed to come from both taxable and tax-free sources. This is referred to as the "slice rule". The Government considers the slice rule to be the most appropriate approach to determining the portion of the distribution that is tax-free. Broadly, the aim of the slice rule is to base the non-taxable and taxable components of the share repurchase proceeds on the ratio between capital and the taxable reserves of the company. Given the variation in accounting treatments, it is inappropriate to specify for tax purposes reserves that are taxable on distribution. Existing tax rules specifically define tax-free distributions. Distributions in excess of those nominated as being tax-free are taxable. Consistent with this approach, taxable reserves are the difference between the tax-free reserves and the market value of the company's shares. Existing rules on the full liquidation of a company reflect this treatment. Under those rules, all the proceeds of a distribution on a full liquidation (representing the market value of the company's underlying assets at that time) are taxable except for those specifically deemed to be tax-free. 12 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES Since any dollar distributed cannot be specifically identified as coming from either tax-free or taxable reserves, the slice rule has the advantage of being "even- handed" by assuming the distribution comes from both sources in proportion to their contribution to total market value. 2.3.2 Problems With Existing Rules The existing rules that govern share cancellations have two key problems which give rise to a need to strengthen those rules so that they achieve their intent. First, while the slice rule applies if the market price is paid for the share, the rules allow a company to pay less than market price. As a result, the entire distribution can be made tax-free by the company paying only the contributed capital per share. Shareholders are not penalised provided their respective interests in the company remain unchanged. Existing rules in practice therefore provide scope for subscribed capital to be distributed ahead of taxable reserves. For tax base maintenance reasons, the Government considers that it is appropriate that the slice rule apply in these circumstances. Second, the test that determines when a cancellation is in substitution for a dividend is very difficult to apply because it is highly subjective. The test relies on identifying the distribution as being made "regularly, systematically or explicitly" in lieu of a dividend, which is very difficult for the Commissioner to determine. First, there may be some argument that "systematic" does not include a one-off cancellation. A more fundamental problem is that the test requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine what a company would distribute as an ordinary dividend in any particular year in the absence of an ability to cancel or repurchase shares. This has proved difficult to apply in practice, and in the case of a newly established company, or a company with a one-off gain, the test is particularly hard to administer. Since companies are expected to repurchase shares more frequently than they currently cancel shares, this weakness represents significant potential for dividend tax base erosion. 2.4 Proposed Changes 2.4.1 Distributions Funded by Way of Capital Profits General Proposal The Government, in determining what proportion of a distribution should be taxed as a dividend, has considered the appropriate treatment of distributions funded from capital profits. As noted above, under existing rules, distributions funded from capital profits are tax-free only when a company is fully liquidated. The Valabh Committee proposed that distributions funded from capital profits also be tax-free when effected by way of a share repurchase or redemption (Valabh Committee (1991), p37). The recommendation related only to non-qualifying CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 13 companies. The qualifying company regime, aimed at small incorporated businesses, already provides that distributions funded from capital profits are tax- free when distributed to shareholders. The arguments advanced by the Committee in favour of relaxing the existing rules and allowing distributions funded from capital profits to be tax-free on a repurchase or redemption of shares were that: • There is no "in-principle" distinction between an amount distributed by way of a repurchase and distributions on the full liquidation of a company (when distributions from capital profits are tax-free). • Rules aimed at preventing companies substituting tax-free repurchases for taxable dividends should be sufficient to protect the dividend tax base if the existing restriction is relaxed. There are some arguments for not relaxing the rules. Under the new Companies Act, repurchases and dividends are subject to broadly similar rules, such as the solvency test, while rules applying on a full liquidation differ significantly. Also, the proposal to allow distributions sourced from capital profits to be tax-free creates an opportunity for on-going companies to provide a tax-free return to their shareholders by way of share repurchases not currently available. This could undermine the dividend tax base. Existing anti-dividend substitution rules are considered inadequate in this regard. The proposal also involves some increase in compliance and administration costs. Implementing it would require rules to attribute distributed capital profits to shares of a company (other than fixed rate shares) repurchased by a continuing company. For their part, companies would need to have adequate records that identify realised capital profits and losses, as well as any past distributions from those sources. After careful consideration of this issue, the Government has determined on balance to support the Valabh Committee's recommendation that distributions by way of share cancellations or repurchases that are funded from realised capital profits be tax-free, so long as the distribution is of sufficient size to clearly not be in substitution for a dividend. For the reasons outlined above, the Government considers that such a change should be conditional upon the implementation of more robust rules to prevent the substitution of tax-free distributions for the payment of taxable dividends. These rules are discussed further below. Since the new rules will apply to share cancellations, they will affect companies registered under the Companies Act 1955 as well as the new Companies Act. This change would not apply to fixed rate shares. Distributions upon the redemption or repurchase of fixed rate shares, other than those funded by subscribed capital, would continue to be taxable. 14 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES Determining the Capital Gain Amount As noted above, it is necessary to apply rules to attribute realised capital profits to shares repurchased. Otherwise, there would be little constraint on a company targeting tax-free distributions funded from this source to particular shareholders, such as high-marginal rate taxpayers. The capital gain attributable to shares on a repurchase or redemption would be calculated by simply averaging the total realised capital gain reserves over the number of shares of all classes, other than fixed rate shares, on issue prior to the repurchase or cancellation. Capital gain reserves would be the sum of all realised capital gains, less capital losses and distributions previously funded from such reserves, since the creation of the company. 2.4.2 New Anti-Dividend Substitution Rule In light of the weaknesses in the current law, the Government proposes to amend the legislation to achieve two objectives. The objectives are: • to ensure that the slice rule applies even where less than the market price is paid for the share; • to incorporate a more robust and effective anti-dividend substitution rule. 2.4.3 Reinforcing the "Slice Rule" General Approach A company making a share repurchase or redemption, or a distribution on liquidation, would continue to be able to determine the amount that is attributed to tax-free reserves on a similar basis to the current section 4A(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, but with a key modification. It is proposed to amend the section to ensure that the tax-free and dividend components of the distribution better reflect the composition of the company's value. As noted earlier, currently companies can make a pro rata cancellation that is entirely tax-free by cancelling shares for their par value despite the market price being many times that amount. Such a strategy could also be possible with off-market repurchases but unlikely with on-market repurchases as shareholders would not sell their shares on-market for less than the market value. Under the proposed change, where the market value or more is paid for a share, the subscribed capital and capital gain amount in relation to the share could be returned in full. Where less than the market value is paid, those amounts would be reduced as follows: CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 15 price paid x (subscribed capital amount + capital gain amount) market price Section 4A of the Income Tax Act currently refers to the "returned capital amount". This term will be replaced by the term "subscribed capital amount", a concept that will reflect the capital position and shares on issue at any point in time, taking into account all previous capital subscriptions and reductions. The current formula refers to all shares and capital ever issued. Example Assume a company has 100 shares, all of one class, with subscribed capital of $0.50 per share. The market value of the company is $100.00 and its realised capital gain reserves are $20 (or $0.20 per share). The company repurchases 70 percent of the shares for $0.70 each through off-market repurchases. The tax-free component per share would be $0.49, that is: price paid x tax-free amount = $0.70 x ($0.50 + $0.20) = $0.49 market price $1.00 Determination of Market Value It is envisaged that the Commissioner would exercise a discretion as to how market value would be calculated in the case of repurchases, having already the power to determine the market value of shares in several other contexts. At the request of the Government, the Commissioner has considered ways to reduce compliance costs involved in determining the market value, and is conscious of the need to approve or confirm market values of shares to enable the proposed measures to operate in a satisfactory manner. For example, in the case of non- listed companies it is envisaged that detailed valuations will not be required but that a written valuation by an independent competent valuer will suffice in most cases. This should reduce compliance costs. Submissions as to how to further reduce compliance costs consistent with the general objective would be welcomed. 2.4.4 Brightline Tests The New Test Under the slice rule, amounts distributed by way of share repurchases and redemptions would continue to be tax-free to the extent that they are considered to be returns of subscribed capital or realised capital gains. However, it is proposed to include in section 4A(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act two new tests that would allow this treatment only in circumstances where a "qualifying capital reduction" or a material reduction in a shareholder's interest (a "qualifying 16 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES disproportionate reduction") occurs. These tests establish levels referred to as "brightlines". The tests are designed to give a clear, objective determination of when a distribution is a qualifying capital reduction or a qualifying disproportionate reduction as opposed to a deemed dividend. If the tests are not satisfied, the distributions would be taxable in full to the shareholder as dividends. The tests will apply to repurchases other than "on-market repurchases". The slice rule would automatically apply to on-market repurchases, with the company rather than the shareholder being responsible for meeting the tax imposition (refer to section 2.5 for further details). On-market repurchases would be defined as repurchases where: • The company acquires the repurchased shares through a broker in a recognised exchange (as defined in section 8B of the Income Tax Act for the purpose of determining interests in companies). • The seller, as a result, is unaware of the identity of the purchaser at the time the offer to acquire is accepted. The brightline tests specify that amounts distributed by way of repurchases, redemptions and cancellations (other than on-market repurchases) would be considered to be in lieu of taxable dividends, and would therefore be fully taxable as dividends, in the following circumstances: • where a repurchase offer is made on a pro rata basis under the terms of the companies legislation and the amount ultimately distributed represents less than 15 percent of the market value of the repurchasing company's shares at the time the company first notified shareholders of the intended offer. To be pro rata the offer must apply to all shares of the company other than fixed rate shares (defined in the proposed section 4A(3) of the Income Tax Act); • where a repurchase offer is made on a non pro rata basis, a shareholder's proportionate interest in the company after the repurchase or cancellation is more than 85 percent of the shareholder's pre-repurchase/cancellation interest. The shareholder's interest would include the interests of certain persons associated with the shareholder. This test would be applied to the aggregate of all shares in a company, other than fixed rate shares. Sections 8A to 8D of the Income Tax Act, which measure voting and market value interests, would be used as the basis for establishing a shareholder's underlying interest in a company. The tests of when a distribution is in lieu of a dividend have been designed to enable companies, for reasons such as downsizing of operations, to fund one-off distributions to all shareholders (or to selected shareholders in the case of disproportionate reductions) partly from tax-free reserves of the company. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 17 The brightlines have been set at levels where it is clear a company would be returning capital rather than paying a dividend. The 15 percent of market value level represents approximately three times typical dividend yields. This represents a reasonable level for a robust anti-dividend substitution rule. Commissioner's Residual Discretion The Commissioner's discretion currently in the law will be rewritten as a backstop measure for use only when taxpayer behaviour defeats the purpose of the new rules. Where there is either a qualifying disproportionate reduction or a qualifying capital reduction, the distribution will be considered to be in lieu of a dividend only if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the repurchase was made under an arrangement to acquire, redeem or otherwise cancel shares in lieu of the payment of a dividend. The factors to be considered by the Commissioner in this regard are outlined in the legislation. A circumstance in which this residual discretion for the Commissioner should apply is where a company (likely to be a closely-held company) accumulates earnings until they represent 15 percent or more of the market value of the company. The company then makes a distribution, ostensibly as a result of a downsizing operation, but without reducing any of its core business. Similarly, successive disproportionate reductions that leave the respective interests of shareholders largely unchanged would also run foul of this rule. Repurchase by Related Company It is necessary to include rules to prevent a repurchase being characterised as a sale of shares to a third party by using, for example, related sibling companies or trusts to acquire shares. While it is considered that section 99(5) of the Income Tax Act is likely to catch such repurchases, it would be difficult to apply the section in relation to on-market repurchases, since it is not practical to deem a dividend to have been derived by the vendor. Accordingly, to cover the case of repurchases occurring on-market in the circumstances outlined above (or similar circumstances), a new section 4(12) will be inserted. This in effect provides for a debit to the Imputation Credit Account (ICA) of the company that issued the shares in respect of the dividend component of the repurchase. There would be no tax consequences for the vendor. Under section 4A(1)(cb) the amount paid to the vendor would be excluded from the dividend definition. Treatment of Fixed Rate Shares Fixed rate shares would be excluded from the brightline tests. They are more akin to debt instruments and usually do not carry an entitlement to the reserves of the company. This means that only subscribed capital in respect of such shares would be returned tax-free. The only exception would be when there is a 18 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES plan or arrangement to redeem fixed rate shares in lieu of the payment of a dividend on other shares in which case the distribution would be fully taxed as a dividend. An anti-avoidance rule to deal with this situation is included in the draft legislation. 2.5 Mechanism for Taxing the Dividend Component of Share Repurchases 2.5.1 Introduction How the dividend component of a share repurchase will be subject to tax will vary according to a number of factors, including: • whether the repurchasing company is a resident or a non-resident company; • whether the repurchase occurs on-market or off-market. Since it will not generally be possible for repurchasing companies to identify vendor shareholders at the time shares are acquired through the sharemarket, on- market share repurchases are likely to be from selected shareholders. Pro rata share repurchases will generally be confined to off-market transactions; • whether the shareholder from whom shares are repurchased is a company, a non-corporate shareholder, a resident or is taxable on gains from the sale of shares. Each of the above combinations results in different considerations that should be taken into account in determining how best to tax the dividend component of share repurchases. The proposals are discussed in more detail below, and are summarised in general terms in Annex 2.2. 2.5.2 Off-Market Purchases by Resident Non-Qualifying and Qualifying Companies Background The Valabh Committee made the following recommendations on the appropriate general mechanism for accounting for tax on the dividend component of a share repurchase: • A company buying back its shares should be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the dividend component of the repurchase where that occurred on- or off-market. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 19 • The company should be able to debit its imputation credit account (ICA) in satisfaction of the FBT liability. • If insufficient ICA credits exist to satisfy FBT, then FBT should be actually paid with no credit to the ICA for that payment. • All vendor shareholders should be exempt from tax on the dividend component of the repurchase price. The Committee made its recommendations when non-cash dividends were subject to FBT and prior to the removal of the inter-corporate dividend exemption. This latter change means that where a company repurchases from a resident corporate vendor, the dividend component will be taxable. Where this occurs there is some argument that applying the Valabh Committee approach unaltered would operate harshly in relation to repurchases from corporate shareholders. In order to address this concern in respect of off-market repurchases, it is proposed that where shares are purchased by a qualifying or non-qualifying company off-market, the normal dividend distribution rules apply. Repurchase from Resident Non-Corporate Shareholder Where a company repurchases shares from a resident individual, the shareholder will be taxable on the dividend component of the sale proceeds. Imputation credits may be attached by the company in accordance with ordinary rules, and the dividend will generally be subject to the resident withholding tax regime. This treatment is illustrated in Annex 2.3. Repurchase from a Resident Corporate Shareholder A corporate shareholder would be taxed in the same way as an individual on the repurchase of shares. A credit will arise to the vendor's imputation credit account equal to the amount of any imputation credit, or resident withholding tax credit, attached to the dividend component of the sale proceeds. In this way, the appropriate amount of tax would be levied on dividend income. Repurchase from a Vendor who Holds Shares on Revenue Account The interaction between taxing the dividend component of a share repurchase and taxing gains or losses on shares on revenue account has not been fully evaluated. Any changes that may be proposed as a result of further evaluation will be discussed with interested parties during the consultation period. The proposal is that a vendor shareholder who holds shares on revenue account would be assessed on profits arising from the sale of the shares. The vendor would also be assessed on the dividend income arising from the repurchase. To ensure that both the dividend and the gain on share sales are not subject to tax, it is proposed that only the dividend component (excluding imputation credits) 20 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES and the excess profit over the dividend, if any, should be assessable. Where a loss had been made on sale, it could be offset against dividend income. Repurchase from a Non-Resident Shareholder The purchasing company would be required to deduct from the purchase price non-resident withholding tax on the dividend component of that repurchase price. Repurchase from Tax Exempt Shareholder Where the vendor shareholder is tax exempt, the dividend would be exempt and therefore not subject to RWT. However, imputation credits must be allocated to the dividend in accordance with the imputation rules. 2.5.3 On-Market Repurchase by a Resident Non-Qualifying Company Background Where a company purchases on-market from a shareholder of the company, the normal dividend rules will be inappropriate because: • The shareholder will be unaware of the identity of the purchaser. • At the time of the acquisition, the purchaser will not know the identity of the vendor. • Where shares (representing less than 5 percent of the company) are held by a nominee the purchaser may never know the identity of the beneficial owner of the shares. The Valabh Committee's recommended approach to taxing the dividend component of a repurchase, outlined above, assumed a link between dividends and FBT. The regime that applied at that time levied FBT on non-cash dividends. This is no longer the case. In view of this, and because a situation in which a company would prefer to pay FBT rather then debit its ICA is unlikely to arise, it is proposed that the legislation simply provide for a debit to arise to the ICA of a company to cover tax due where shares are repurchased on-market. Repurchase from Resident Non-Corporate Where a company repurchases shares from a resident non-corporate, the company would debit its ICA in respect of the dividend component of the repurchase price. The amount of the debit would be calculated in the same way as resident withholding tax on non-cash dividends. Where the purchasing company has insufficient credits in its ICA to absorb the debit at the time of purchase, it would CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 21 make a payment of tax sufficient to square the account by 31 March (without penalty) or 20 June. In almost all circumstances, this payment would offset a future provisional tax liability. The vendor would not be taxed on the dividend component. Repurchase from Resident Companies Where a company repurchases on-market from a resident corporate shareholder, the repurchasing company will debit its ICA in payment of tax on the dividend component of the repurchase. Although the shareholder would not be taxed on the dividend component, that amount may be taxed again if it is distributed to shareholders of the vendor. One mechanism by which this problem could be eliminated is to permit a credit to arise in the ICA of the vendor company. A corporate shareholder who sells shares to the company in which it holds shares would receive the same price for the shares as would have been the case had the shares been sold to a third party. In the former case, however, the shareholder would also receive imputation credits. The corporate shareholder who sells to the company should not be in a better position than one who sells to a third party. When the company sells its shares to a third party, it receives no such credit. Accordingly, allowing a credit to arise is inappropriate. The other possible solution to this problem is to exempt from the ICA debit mechanism dividends on shares repurchased from corporate shareholders. There are two concerns about such an exemption from the ICA debit mechanism: • Where shares are owned by a nominee company, the status of the beneficial owner should determine whether tax is payable. If the beneficial owner is a non-corporate, tax should be levied. However, companies will not typically know whether a corporate shareholder is a nominee, or the character of the beneficial owner. • Because the repurchasing company has an advantage if shares are acquired from a corporate, there is some incentive to arrange for shares to be purchased by a corporate prior to sale to the company. For these reasons, it is proposed that where shares are repurchased from a corporate, the repurchasing company would be liable for tax on the dividend component of the proceeds by way of a debit to its ICA. It should be noted that companies may be able to avoid these difficulties by repurchasing shares off- market. In that case, ordinary dividend rules would apply with imputation credits able to be attached to the dividend component of any share repurchase. 22 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES Repurchase from Tax-Exempt Entities To make the share repurchase rules as simple as possible, no special rules for on-market repurchases from tax-exempt entities are proposed. Such repurchases would be treated in the same way as acquisitions from resident taxable entities. A debit to the ICA of the repurchasing company would arise in respect of the dividend component. Repurchase from a Non-Resident Shareholder It is proposed that a debit (calculated as outlined above for residents) arise in the ICA of a company that repurchases its shares on-market from a non-resident. There would be therefore no need to distinguish between non-resident and resident vendors. An alternative approach would be to treat the dividend component as an ordinary non-cash dividend for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) purposes. This means that no deduction of NRWT would be made from the sale proceeds. Instead, the repurchasing company would pay an amount of NRWT equivalent to the amount that would have been deducted under general rules. This mechanism would be more appropriate than a deduction of NRWT because it ensures that the vendor is in the same position as a vendor selling to a third party. However, this approach assumes that a repurchasing company is able to identify the vendor as a non-resident shareholder. Where shares are held by a nominee company, it would seem that such identification is impossible. Accordingly, the approach proposed of debiting the ICA of the repurchasing company is simpler and is preferred. In addition, where a company has sufficient credits in its ICA, it may prefer to debit the ICA rather than pay NRWT. Repurchase from a Vendor who Holds Shares on Revenue Account Where a share trader sells on-market, the share trader will be liable for tax on any profit on sale of the shares. In addition, a debit will arise to the ICA of the repurchasing company in relation to the dividend component of the sale proceeds. However, as the vendor will not be able to identify the purchaser and the repurchasing company will not know whether the shares are held on revenue account, this appears unavoidable. Obviously, the problem would be reduced if shares are repurchased off-market, although this may not always be possible. 2.5.4 Repurchase by Non-Resident Companies Off-market The Valabh Committee considered that, while changes in our company law would have no impact on non-resident companies that repurchase shares, our tax law should address the consequence of a share repurchase permitted by CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 23 other jurisdictions. Their proposal was that the rules should be consistent with the rules that apply to resident company share repurchases. Adopting this approach, the ordinary dividend rules should apply to off-market repurchases by non-resident companies from resident shareholders. The Government agrees with this approach. If the resident shareholder is an individual, the dividend component would be assessed to the shareholder. Where the shareholder is a corporate, foreign dividend withholding payment may be payable on the dividend. On-market Placing a liability for tax on a foreign corporate repurchasing shares on-market poses jurisdictional and administrative problems. Therefore, it is considered that no tax liability should be imposed where shares are repurchased by non-resident companies on-market. 2.6 Treasury Stock Option During the course of developing the company law reforms, consideration was given to whether companies should be able to retain shares that they repurchased. This "treasury stock option" would enable companies to resell repurchased shares rather than be required to cancel them. However, this option was not included in the Companies Act. The Valabh Committee had made proposals on how a treasury stock option might work from a tax perspective, but in the context of company law providing for treasury stock. In the absence of company law providing for a treasury stock option, it would be very difficult to provide a workable treasury stock option in the tax legislation. For this reason the Government has decided against including a treasury stock option in the tax legislation. 2.7 Summary of Proposals The principal proposals outlined in this chapter are that: a Distributions funded from realised capital profits will be tax-free when made through qualifying share repurchases or redemptions. b Amounts distributed to shareholders on the repurchase, redemption, or other cancellation of shares that occur through off-market repurchases be fully taxable as dividends: i where the offer to repurchase or cancel is pro rata and the amount ultimately distributed represents less than 15 percent of the market 24 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES value of the shares of the company (i.e. it is not a qualifying capital reduction); or ii where the offer to repurchase or cancel is not made on a pro rata basis, a shareholder's proportionate interest in the company after the repurchase or cancellation is more than 85 percent of the shareholder's interest prior to repurchase or cancellation (i.e. it is not a qualifying disproportionate reduction). c Where there is a qualifying capital reduction or a qualifying disproportionate reduction, the "slice rule" would apply to determine the dividend component of the distribution except where the Commissioner applied the residual discretion to deem the full distribution to be in lieu of a dividend. d Where the slice rule applies the tax-free component of an amount distributed on a repurchase or cancellation is the sum of: (i) the subscribed capital amount (broadly, the subscribed capital per share repurchased or cancelled); and (ii) the capital gain amount per share (broadly, the total realised capital profits of the company divided by the total number of shares on issue, other than fixed rate shares). e Where less than the market value is paid for a share that is repurchased or cancelled, the subscribed capital amount and the capital gain amount attributable to the share will be reduced so that the tax-free component of the distribution is the amount of subscribed capital and capital gain over the market value of the share. f Where a company purchases its shares off-market, the dividend component of the purchase is taxable to the vendor of the shares. g Where a company purchases its shares on-market, the company is liable for the tax on the dividend component of the purchase price. This is met by way of a debit to its imputation credit account which is calculated in the same way as resident withholding tax on a non-cash dividend. The vendor is exempt from tax on the dividend component. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 25 ANNEX 2.1 Current Rules For Calculating Paid-Up Capital, Qualifying Share Premium and Excess Return Amount Section 4A of the Income Tax Act sets out a number of exclusions from the term "dividends". Principal among those exclusions are amounts funded from subscribed capital (being paid-up capital and qualifying share premium) distributed when shares are cancelled or redeemed, and amounts funded from capital gains distributed on the liquidation of a company. Hence, a dividend for tax purposes is a benefit which is derived by virtue of a shareholder's ownership interest in a company, excluding the return of the original investment and, in the case of a liquidation, capital gain amounts. Under section 4A those excluded amounts are calculated as follows: Distributions Attributable to Paid-Up Capital Under the section, the amount per share returnable tax-free as paid-up capital is computed as: a b where: a is the total amount of capital paid up prior to the redemption of the shares of the class being redeemed or cancelled; and b is the total number of shares of the class that have ever been issued by the company prior to the redemption that are still on issue. Distributions Attributable to Qualifying Share Premium Qualifying share premium amounts returnable tax-free are computed according to a similar averaging formula to that outlined in the previous paragraph. However, the amount of tax-free share premium is the actual amount debited to the company's share premium account in respect of the redemption if this is smaller than the amount computed under the averaging rule. Distributions Attributable to Other Tax-Free Sources on a Liquidation Distributions funded from certain realised and unrealised capital gains are also non-taxable when distributed on the liquidation of a company. These residual 26 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES non-taxable amounts are allocated to distributions on a pro rata basis according to total distributions made on a liquidation, other than distributions of subscribed capital. Broadly, the residual amounts distributable tax-free to a shareholder on liquidation are computed as: a x b c where: a is the amount of realised and unrealised capital gains available for distribution to shareholders; b is the distributions received by the shareholder on the liquidation, other than distributions of paid-up capital and share premium; and c is the total amount of distributions payable to all shareholders on liquidation, except distributions of paid-up capital and qualifying share premium. Where a distribution exceeds the total amount that can be attributed to tax-free sources, the excess is taxable as a dividend. The first two formulae operate on a class by class basis for each class of shares redeemed or cancelled. Shares are considered to be of the same class for tax purposes if: • the shares carry the same rights to exercise voting power and the same rights to distributions; or • the same amount has been subscribed in respect of each share, the company elects to treat such shares as being of the same class, and the company can distinguish between such shares and other shares.

The market value of each share is $20. B owns 500 shares. Company A purchases those shares for $20 per share. B receives $10,000. As all of B's shares are sold, the distribution is not deemed to be in lieu of a dividend and the slice rule applies. The subscribed capital and capital gains attributable to the repurchased shares will be tax-free and are calculated in the following way: Subscribed capital $20,000 ------------ = $10.00 per share 2,000 Capital gains $10,000 ------------ = $5.00 per share 2,000 The balance, being the dividend component, is therefore $5 per share ($2,500 in total). The company attaches the maximum imputation credits to the dividend ($1,231.34) which is the benchmark ratio for the year. As the dividend is fully imputed, no RWT is deducted. B returns $3,731.34 as assessable income and claims $1,231.34 as a credit of tax. (If B was a resident company it would also credit its ICA with $1,231.34, being the imputation credit attached to the dividend). CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 29 Where the repurchasing company is distributing tax-paid income (and assuming that the company is able to fully impute the dividend) no premium above market price need be paid to attract shareholders to sell to the company. However, where the company does or cannot fully impute the dividend component, the cost to the company of the repurchase may be greater than the market value of the shares. This is because, where there is a market for the shares, the shareholder will look for an after-tax return that is not less than what the shares could be sold for on-market. In practice, however, it is difficult to understand why a company would prefer to pay a premium on the market value and deduct resident withholding tax rather than make a payment of tax (which it could use to offset a future tax liability) and fully impute the dividend to the shareholder. On-market If the shares were repurchased on-market the slice rule would automatically apply. The dividend component would also be $5 per share. A debit would arise to company A's imputation credit account as follows: 0.33 x $2,500 = $1,231.34 0.67 Example 2: Off-market repurchase from vendor who is taxable on share profits Assume in the above example that B is a trader who purchased the shares for $15 each (and subsequently sold them to the company for $20). B receives taxable income of $5 per share, totalling $2,500 for 500 shares. In addition, (assuming the company is paying the distribution from tax-paid profits) B will receive a fully credited gross dividend of $3,731.34, comprising a dividend component of $2,500 and imputation credits of $1,231.34. This transaction has therefore been taxed twice - once as a dividend and then again as a profit on sale. To avoid this double taxation, B would be assessed only on the dividend component of the share repurchase. If B had purchased the shares for $5 per share so that the profit on the transaction was $7,500, $5,000 ($7,500 - $2,500) would be taxable as a profit on sale. 30 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 3.1 Introduction This chapter considers the tax implications of the amalgamation provisions of the new Companies Act. 3.2 The Amalgamation Provisions of the New Companies Act Under the amalgamation provisions of the new Companies Act, the procedures governing the amalgamation of two or more companies into one company have been simplified in comparison with those applicable under existing company law. Under the new Companies Act, the amalgamation of two or more companies generally requires the following: • approval from the board of directors; • a resolution of the board of directors that the amalgamation will be in the best interests of the company; • a resolution of the board of directors that the amalgamated company will satisfy the solvency test immediately after the amalgamation; • advice to all secured creditors of the amalgamation proposal; • shareholders' approval by special resolution; and • registration of the proposal with the Registrar of Companies. The amalgamation takes effect on the date specified in the amalgamation certificate issued by the Registrar of Companies. Under the new amalgamation procedures court involvement is no longer required unless sought. In addition, an even simpler amalgamation process is provided for the amalgamation of wholly-owned companies. A "short-form" amalgamation procedure is provided under section 222 of the new Companies Act for a wholly- owned subsidiary amalgamating with a parent, or for two wholly-owned subsidiaries that amalgamate. Under the short-form procedure, an amalgamation may be approved solely by the boards of each amalgamating company agreeing to the amalgamation, provided the solvency test is still met. Under the new Companies Act, the amalgamating companies continue as one company, which may be a continuation of one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. All assets and liabilities of the amalgamating companies are vested in the amalgamated company. Amalgamating companies can agree to CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 31 the terms of their amalgamation. Thus, if the terms of the amalgamation so provide, some shareholders in the amalgamating companies may be issued shares in the amalgamated company, while other shareholders in the amalgamating companies may be bought out for cash and debentures. Where one amalgamating company holds shares in another amalgamating company, those shares must be cancelled for no payment when the amalgamation becomes effective. 3.3 Tax Treatment of Revenue Account Shareholders in an Amalgamation 3.3.1 Current Treatment Under current tax rules, the realisation of a gain or loss upon the disposal of a parcel of shares by a revenue account shareholder is a taxable event. Therefore, revenue account shareholders making a gain or loss on any shares swapped for other shares as part of an amalgamation face the same tax consequences as if they had sold the shares for cash. 3.3.2 Rollover Relief Ideally, taxes should not influence taxpayer preferences between different investment choices. However, any tax incurred on realisation of an investment spanning multiple tax periods changes taxpayer behaviour to the extent that taxpayers defer the tax liability by retaining an asset longer than they otherwise would. This is known as "lock-in". Lock-in influences are unavoidable in a realisation based income tax. The Government is aware that some taxpayers believe that shareholder lock-in in relation to company amalgamations should be addressed by the provision of some form of shareholder rollover relief, which would enable a tax liability arising as a result of a share swap to be deferred until the shares acquired in the amalgamation were sold. Providing shareholder rollover relief only changes the timing of income recognition for tax purposes. The incentive to delay realisation is not eliminated. Indeed, if the shares acquired in an amalgamation increase further in value, rollover relief would exacerbate lock-in influences. Accordingly, the existence of lock-in does not support arguments that there is a sound policy basis for providing rollover relief. In New Zealand only gains on shares held on revenue account are taxed. In Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom rollover relief was not available prior to the introduction of comprehensive capital gains taxes in those jurisdictions. Thus, if anything, the experience of those jurisdictions suggests that the provision of rollover relief is not appropriate for New Zealand. 32 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS Introducing rollover relief would also result in tax considerations further distorting taxpayer decision-making by creating a bias towards amalgamation over other forms of sale or reorganisation. Finally, the relief provisions that apply to corporate restructuring in other jurisdictions are understood to be among some of the most complex tax rules of those countries. These rules are apparently subject to considerable "tax planning". Under the circumstances, it does not appear necessary or appropriate to add to the Income Tax Act another layer of complexity that will increase opportunities for tax planning. In summary, the current treatment of shares disposed of as part of a corporate reorganisation is consistent with the general realisation-based treatment of other taxable gains. The new Companies Act does not introduce any special feature in relation to amalgamations that is sufficient to warrant a departure from current tax treatment by the introduction of tax treatment inconsistent with general tax principles for taxpayers holding shares on revenue account. Accordingly, no legislative change is proposed. 3.4 Tax Treatment of Asset Transfers 3.4.1 Asset Transfers in an Amalgamation The purpose of the amalgamation provisions in the new Companies Act is to simplify the administrative procedures that must be followed when two or more companies merge. Thus, the new amalgamation provisions are designed to minimise administrative impediments to corporate restructuring through amalgamations. The Government favours extending to amalgamations the tax-free asset transfer treatment available to consolidated groups. Both consolidation and amalgamation can be used to achieve the same substantive restructuring. Tax rules should not influence which method (amalgamation or consolidation) taxpayers use in merging their corporate operations. In other words, the two different methods of restructuring should yield the same tax consequences. The amalgamation of two or more companies can be viewed as a one-step procedure by which companies become wholly-owned (100 percent commonly- owned by the same shareholders) and then merge their assets into a single company. The consolidation regime can be used to achieve this result without triggering income tax consequences on the transfer of the merging companies' assets to a single company. The Government proposes that amalgamation be dealt with by utilising the tax- free asset transfer rules of the consolidation regime. CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 33 3.4.2 Other Considerations Consistent with the consolidation regime, the amalgamated company would inherit each transferor's tax cost for the asset (as well as the transferor's other tax attributes in respect of the asset). The Valabh Committee has recommended an asset classification system under which tax consequences would be triggered when a taxpayer moves an asset out of the tax base. Accordingly, the Government considers it would be appropriate to implement rules that would trigger tax consequences when an asset moves from revenue to capital account as a result of an asset transfer made pursuant to an amalgamation. In addition, tax-free treatment should only apply where the amalgamated company will be resident in New Zealand. Otherwise, assets could be transferred out of the New Zealand tax base free of tax consequences, thereby permanently avoiding (rather than deferring) New Zealand tax. Under the consolidation regime, only companies that are resident in New Zealand are eligible to be members of a consolidated group. If the amalgamated company is a qualifying company, tax-free treatment should only apply if all amalgamating companies are also qualifying companies. Otherwise amalgamating a non-qualifying company into a qualifying company would enable qualifying company election tax to be avoided. 3.5 Losses and Imputation Credits 3.5.1 Introduction In the Government's view, an amalgamated company should be able to succeed to the losses and imputation credits of the amalgamating companies, subject to ensuring that the shareholder continuity rules and the limitations on loss grouping are not circumvented. 3.5.2 Losses - Implications of Shareholder Continuity and Loss Grouping Rules for Amalgamations The tax treatment of companies that amalgamate should be consistent with the tax treatment of company losses generally. An amalgamated company should inherit the losses of an amalgamating company only when shareholder continuity and commonality tests are met. 34 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 3.5.3 Existing Shareholder Continuity Rules The purpose of the loss carry-forward rules is to ensure that, to an extent, shareholders in a company at the time it incurred tax losses are still shareholders when the company utilises those losses. This is achieved through shareholder continuity rules that determine what tax losses a company may offset against its future income. A company may carry forward its losses and offset them against income arising in subsequent income years provided that shareholder continuity of at least 49 percent is maintained throughout the period beginning with the year in which the loss is incurred and ending with the year to which the loss is carried forward (the "continuity period"). Shareholder continuity is maintained if at least 49 percent of the shares in the company are owned by the same persons throughout the continuity period. 3.5.4 Shareholder Continuity Rules and Amalgamations An amalgamation would not provide a means of circumventing the shareholder continuity rules with respect to the amalgamating companies provided those rules continue to apply after the amalgamation. The amalgamated company would be considered to satisfy shareholder continuity with respect to the losses of an amalgamating company if at least 49 percent of the shares in the amalgamated company and 49 percent of the shares of the amalgamating company are owned by the same persons throughout the continuity period. The amalgamated company would be considered a continuation of the loss company for the purposes of the shareholder continuity test. Of course, if at the time of the amalgamation more than one amalgamating company had carried forward tax losses, and those companies had different shareholders during the relevant continuity periods, the amalgamated company would need to keep track of the losses of each such company separately, even where those losses were incurred for the same income year. 3.5.5 Existing Loss Grouping Rules The purpose of the loss grouping rules is to enable the losses of loss companies to offset the income of profit companies provided a minimum commonality of ownership is achieved. The application of the commonality of ownership test is separate and different from the shareholder continuity test. Under current loss grouping rules, the losses of one company (both current losses and those carried forward) may be offset against the income of another company only if, throughout the period beginning with the year the loss is incurred and ending with the year of offset, a group of persons concurrently owns at least 66 percent of the shares in each of the companies. This group of shareholders is not restricted to persons who were shareholders at the time the CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 35 losses were incurred. This requirement is often referred to as "shareholder commonality". If a loss company wishes to group its losses with a profit company, and it has some losses that do not satisfy the shareholder commonality test, and other losses from subsequent years that do satisfy the shareholder commonality test, only those losses satisfying the shareholder commonality test may be used to offset the profit company's taxable income. 3.5.6 Loss Rules And Amalgamations The Government considers that an amalgamated company should be allowed to inherit the losses of any amalgamating company if: • The shareholder continuity rules continue to be satisfied with respect to the losses of that amalgamating company after the amalgamation. • The losses of that amalgamating company could have been grouped against income realised by all other amalgamating companies immediately prior to the amalgamation. If the losses of more than one of the amalgamating companies are carried into the amalgamated company, the losses of each predecessor company would continue to be identified separately in order to continue to test shareholder continuity. Where the losses arose in the same income year, the amalgamated company would be able to elect the set or sets of losses against which its income could be offset. Where no election is made, losses would be offset against assessable income on a pro rata basis. Shareholder continuity would be measured by reference to ownership interests in the amalgamated company compared to ownership interests in the predecessor amalgamating company for the continuity period. Where the amalgamated company subsequently breaches shareholder continuity, any remaining losses carried over from the amalgamating company would be forfeited in the usual way. A more lenient approach is possible in the consolidation regime as the members of the consolidated group continue as separate legal entities. Therefore, under consolidation, where a consolidated group contains a loss company with pre- consolidation losses that cannot be grouped with any other members of the consolidated group, the losses can be carried forward and offset against the loss company's income, as long as it continues to meet the loss carry-forward shareholder continuity requirements. 36 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS However, it is not practicable to develop rules regarding amalgamations that fully replicate this, as the amalgamating companies that form an amalgamated company have no continuing legal existence separate from the amalgamated company. 3.5.7 Imputation Credit Shareholder Continuity Rules The purpose of imputation carry forward restrictions is to ensure that the imputation credits are enjoyed by substantially the same shareholders of the company as existed at the time the imputation credits arose. The shareholder continuity rules apply to imputation credits in the same manner as to losses, except that the shareholder continuity threshold is 66 percent. Except for consolidated groups there are no provisions for grouping imputation credits between members of commonly-owned groups. Consequently, an amalgamated company should be allowed to succeed to imputation credits of an amalgamating company if, after the amalgamation, the shareholder continuity requirement continues to be satisfied with respect to the relevant amalgamating company up to the period those credits are distributed by the amalgamated company. 3.6 Conclusion The simplified amalgamation provisions in the new Companies Act are designed to remove unnecessary regulatory impediments to amalgamations. The provisions are not designed to create a bias towards amalgamations for their own sake. Similarly, tax rules should not favour amalgamations over other similar forms of corporate restructuring. This means that tax rules regarding amalgamations should be more or less the same as current generally applicable rules regarding company and shareholder taxation. Tax rules relating to the amalgamation of two or more companies should be closely aligned with existing rules governing the carry forward and grouping of tax losses and the carry forward of imputation credits. Amalgamating companies should also be able to use the preferential asset transfer rules currently available to taxpayers through the consolidation regime, without needing to consolidate or group the amalgamating companies prior to amalgamation. A tax liability would be triggered when shareholders trading on revenue account swap shares in an amalgamating company for shares in an amalgamated company. This is a continuation of existing law. CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 37 3.7 Summary of Proposals It is proposed that the following income tax rules apply to company amalgamations: (a) Revenue account shareholders in an amalgamating company will realise assessable income or loss on the exchange of their shares in the amalgamating company for shares in the amalgamated company. This requires no change to existing tax rules. (b) The transfer of assets to an amalgamated company from the amalgamating companies will be tax-free, under rules similar to those that apply to consolidated groups. (c) An amalgamated company will be allowed to succeed to losses of a particular amalgamating company if: (i) the shareholder continuity requirement with respect to that amalgamating company continues to be satisfied; and (ii) immediately prior to the amalgamation, the losses of that amalgamating company could have been grouped against income of all other amalgamating companies. (d) An amalgamated company will be allowed to succeed to imputation credits of an amalgamating company only if the shareholder continuity requirement continues to be satisfied with respect to that amalgamating company after the amalgamation. (e) For the purposes of the shareholder continuity tests the losses and imputation credits of each predecessor company would continue to be separately identified by the amalgamated company. Where the losses arise in the same income year, the amalgamated company will be able to elect the set or sets of losses against which its assessable income could be offset. Where no election is made, losses would be offset against assessable income on a pro rata basis. 38 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 4.1 Introduction This chapter covers tax accounting questions associated with the transition between the existing and the new companies regime, as well as issues relating to company distributions made other than by way of share repurchases. The following areas, in particular, are discussed in this chapter: • treatment of the existing capital reserves of companies registering under the new companies regime; • revision of the current qualifying share premium rules; • determining the subscribed capital of an amalgamated company; • tax rules where distributions made to shareholders breach the company law solvency test and are subsequently recovered. 4.2 Treatment of Company Accounting Reserves for Tax Purposes The current tax treatment of company reserves generally requires only minor changes to respond to the reform of company law. The only significant change will be the proposed revision of the current qualifying share premium rules. 4.2.1 Existing Capital Reserves The new Companies Act makes no distinction between reserves arising from shareholder contributions and other reserves. However, this distinction is important for tax purposes, as reserves contributed by shareholders can be distributed tax-free. Therefore, the existing tax concepts of paid-up capital and share premium will be supplanted by the single concept of "subscribed capital". Subscribed capital will, like paid-up capital and share premium, be available for tax-free distribution on liquidation, or on the redemption or repurchase of shares, subject to the proposed rules regarding share repurchases detailed in Chapter 2. Where shares are "partly paid" on subscription, only the amount paid on subscription is included in subscribed capital. For tax purposes, existing paid-up capital and qualifying share premium reserves will be included in subscribed capital. CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 39 The subscribed capital of new companies registering under the new Companies Act will include all sums paid to the company in return for shares in the company and the net value of subsequent taxable bonus issues. For three years after the new Companies Act comes into force, some companies will have re-registered while others will remain under the old regime. Consequently, some companies will distinguish in their capital reserves between share premium and paid-up capital, while other companies will record only subscribed capital. Several sections of the Income Tax Act, including sections 4 and 4A, will be redrafted to accommodate both situations. 4.2.2 Capital Redemption Reserves The Companies Act 1955 provides that where redeemable preference shares are redeemed otherwise than from the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares, a company must transfer a sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed to a "capital redemption reserve fund", sourced from funds available for distribution as a dividend. Capital redemption reserves are not currently treated as paid-up capital for tax purposes. This treatment will be preserved for companies registering under the new companies legislation - capital redemption reserves will not be subscribed capital for tax purposes. 4.2.3 Existing Bonus Issues Under the Companies Act 1955, bonus issues represent a transfer of retained earnings to paid-up capital effected by way of the creation of additional "bonus" shares which are issued to shareholders for no consideration, or in lieu of a dividend. For tax purposes, there are currently three types of bonus issues, namely taxable, non-taxable and 10-year bonus issues. A different tax treatment applies to each of these. Where non-taxable bonus issues are made, the bonus issue is tax-free, and the transfer to paid-up capital is ignored for tax purposes. It is proposed that amounts of paid-up capital resulting from non-taxable bonus issues will be taxable on distribution, with the exception of amounts bonus issued out of capital gain or qualifying share premium reserves and distributed during a liquidation or cancellation of shares. 40 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES In the case of taxable bonus issues, the value of the issue, less any attached imputation or RWT credits, is transferred from taxable reserves to paid-up capital at the time the issue occurs. It is proposed that on transition to the new companies regime, amounts of paid-up capital that have arisen from capitalised taxable bonus issues will be subscribed capital for tax purposes. A 10-year bonus issue is a bonus issue made between 1 April 1982 and 1 October 1988. These bonus shares were non-taxable at the time of issue, with the capitalisation not being recognised for tax purposes until the tenth anniversary of the bonus issue. In effect, companies are permitted to make a tax-free transfer to paid-up capital 10-years after the bonus issue. It is proposed that upon registration under the new Companies Act, amounts capitalised from 10-year bonus issues that have reached their tenth anniversary will be subscribed capital for tax purposes, while amounts capitalised in 10-year bonus issues that are less than 10 years old will not qualify as subscribed capital until the tenth anniversary of the issue. The exception to this is where the bonus issue was sourced from capital gain amounts or qualifying share premium. Other amounts capitalised by way of 10-year bonus issues would continue to be taxable if distributed before the 10-year period has elapsed. 4.2.4 Future Bonus Issues With the elimination of company law distinctions between capital reserves and retained earnings, there is no need to maintain a tax distinction between share splits and non-taxable bonus issues. Therefore, Income Tax Act references to non-taxable bonus issues will also be applicable to share splits. It is proposed that for taxable bonus issues other than those made in lieu of a dividend, the issuing company will be free to elect the amount transferred to subscribed capital per bonus share issued. While the new Companies Act does not explicitly authorise bonus issues, section 42 provides a general authorisation for a company to issue shares as it sees fit. Consequently, it is not intended at this stage to develop tax rules that provide an alternative to taxable bonus issues. It may be appropriate, however, to consider developing a mechanism that would enable companies to distribute imputation credits without creating additional shares or paying out cash. In particular, it may be appropriate to develop notional distribution rules similar to those applicable for co-operative companies, with appropriate anti-streaming rules. Submissions on this matter are welcomed. CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 41 4.2.5 Tax-Exempt Taxable Bonus Issues and Dividends At present, if a taxable bonus issue is exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act (for instance, a bonus issue made between members of a consolidated group) a tax-free transfer from that company's taxable to tax-free reserves may be achieved without any tax being paid. Similarly, a tax-free transfer from taxable reserves to subscribed capital may occur when tax-exempt dividends are paid out, and the funds are then re-subscribed in the dividend paying company. This is inconsistent with other tax rules that aim to tax, either at the time of the transfer or upon distribution to shareholders, amounts transferred from potentially taxable reserves to subscribed capital. Accordingly, it is proposed that special rules apply to such a dividend that is either: • used to directly or indirectly fund a subscription of capital in the company paying the dividends or in an associated company; or • a taxable bonus issue. The amount of the above subscription will be ineligible to be included in subscribed capital for tax purposes, to the extent that the dividend from which the subscription was sourced was: • exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act; and • less than fully imputed, in which case an allocation rule will determine the portion of the dividend that is fully imputed. For example, assume a company pays an exempt dividend of $800, attaching imputation credits of $200. The shareholder then subscribes $1,500 to the company. The attached imputation credits are sufficient to fully credit $406 of the dividend, with the remaining $394 being uncredited. The first $406 of the capital subscription would be subscribed capital for tax purposes, the next $394 would not be subscribed capital, while the remaining $700 would also be subscribed capital. 4.2.6 Qualifying Share Premium Rules Subscribed capital (including qualifying share premium) can be returned tax-free to shareholders, unless it is distributed in lieu of a dividend. This is in contrast to retained earnings, which are generally taxed on distribution. Therefore, in the absence of effective tax rules to the contrary, taxpayers face an incentive to recharacterise retained earnings as subscribed capital. 42 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES Under current law, qualifying share premium does not include share premium arising with respect to the issue of shares in one company for shares in another company. This limitation on qualifying share premium is designed to prevent a tax advantage resulting from share swaps on capital restructuring occurring either as part of a genuine commercial transaction or motivated entirely by tax considerations. The current rule is somewhat arbitrary and poorly targeted, in that the application of the rule to shares issued in the exchange is determined by the relationship between the par value and issue price of the shares (the difference being the share premium), rather than the relationship between paid-up capital plus qualifying share premium and the issue price of the shares acquired in the exchange. Accordingly, it is proposed to revise the existing qualifying share premium rule to take account of company law changes, to better reflect the tax policy underlying the current rule, and to provide a rule suitable for application to both share swaps made in the course of an amalgamation, and other share swaps. Where a transaction or series of transactions has the effect of the issuing of shares by a company in exchange for shares in another company, the subscribed capital attributable to the issued shares shall be the lesser of the subscribed capital or market value of the shares acquired in consideration for the issued shares. This would include a transaction where the acquiring company pays cash for the acquired shares, on condition that the cash is then re-subscribed in the issuing company. This rule might be defeated by inflating the subscribed capital of the acquired company in anticipation of the share swap. Therefore it is proposed to include an anti-avoidance provision that would prevent the limitation on subscribed capital being defeated in this way. Existing amounts of non-qualifying share premium resulting from the application of the existing qualifying share premium definition will continue to be taxable on distribution. Share premium that currently qualifies for tax-free distribution will retain that status. 4.3 Amalgamations Amalgamations would be subject to the general rules limiting subscribed capital attributable to shares issued in return for other shares. In addition, it is proposed that the subscribed capital of any amalgamating company represented by shares held by or on behalf of any other amalgamating company immediately prior to the amalgamation would not qualify as subscribed CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 43 capital in the amalgamated company. This prevents double counting of subscribed capital, eliminates a tax planning opportunity, and is consistent with the new Companies Act. The new Companies Act requires that shares in any amalgamating company held by or on behalf of another amalgamating company be cancelled without payment or the provision of other consideration (sections 220(3) and 222(2)(b)(i) refer). The example in Annex 4.1 demonstrates both this rule and the general subscribed capital limiting rule applicable to shares issued in exchange for other shares. Other aspects of amalgamations are discussed in Chapter 3. 4.4 Excess Distributions 4.4.1 General Approach Under the new Companies Act, the board of a company may authorise a distribution (including a repurchase of shares) only if it is satisfied that the company will be solvent after the distribution. Where the company does not satisfy the solvency test after the distribution, the dividend may be recovered by the company from the shareholder. There are three exceptions to this right of recovery: • where the shareholder received the distribution in good faith and without knowledge of the company's failure to satisfy the solvency test; • where the shareholder has altered its position relying on the validity of the distribution; • if it would be unfair to require repayment. It is anticipated that use of the recovery provisions is likely to be a rare occurrence. However, the Income Tax Act has to be amended to provide for this. An amendment to unwind the distribution for tax purposes is complicated by the fact that some dividends will have been fully imputed, some will have had resident withholding tax deducted and others will carry neither imputation nor RWT credits. In addition, where imputed dividends are paid to a company the attached credits will have been credited to the recipient's ICA. It is proposed to amend section 4 of the Income Tax Act to provide that where a shareholder repays a dividend to the company pursuant to the new Companies 44 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES Act, the shareholder shall be deemed not to have received that dividend or any imputation credits attached to it. The Commissioner will reassess the shareholder's return for the year in which the dividend was received. The company that recovered the distribution will credit its ICA as at the date of recovery for the amount of imputation credit attached to the dividend. It is proposed that the Commissioner be required to refund any RWT or NRWT previously deducted on payment of the dividend. 4.4.2 Corporate Recipient A corporate recipient will have credited to its ICA any RWT or imputation credits attached to the dividend. It is proposed that an offsetting debit to the corporate shareholder's ICA arise on repayment of the dividend. 4.5 Summary of Proposals The following tax rules are proposed for companies registering under the new Companies Act: (a) That the following amounts be "subscribed capital" for tax purposes: (i) existing paid-up capital reserves, being: • amounts subscribed by shareholders; • where shares are "partly-paid" on subscription, the amount paid on subscription; • amounts that have arisen from taxable bonus issues; • amounts represented by 10-year bonus issues that have reached their tenth anniversary; • amounts represented by both unexpired 10-year bonus issues, and non-taxable bonus issues, that were sourced from either capital gain amounts or qualifying share premium; (ii) existing qualifying share premium reserves. (b) In respect of future transactions, including amalgamations, having the effect of the issuing of shares by a company in exchange for shares in another company: CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 45 (i) The subscribed capital of the issued shares will be the lesser of the subscribed capital or market value of the shares received in exchange for the issued shares. (ii) For the purposes of paragraph (b)(i) an anti-avoidance rule would apply, so that the subscribed capital of the acquired company will not include capital resulting from subscriptions in that company made in anticipation of the share swap, to the extent that some or all of that capital is returned to the subscribing shareholders in some form other than as shares in the amalgamated company. This removes any tax advantage that would otherwise result from inflating the subscribed capital of a target company prior to acquisition. (iii) Subscribed capital represented by shares held by amalgamating companies in each other would not be credited to the subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. (c) Subscriptions be excluded from subscribed capital for tax purposes to the extent that they are attributable to dividends that were: (i) exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act; and (ii) were not fully imputed (in which case an allocation rule will apply to determine the non-imputed amount). (d) In the case of a company recovering a distribution from shareholders: (i) A credit to the value of imputation credits attached to the recovered dividend would arise in the imputation credit account of the company that recovers the dividend. The ICA credit would arise on the date of dividend recovery. (ii) The shareholder would be deemed not to have received that dividend, or any imputation credits attached to it, and would be reassessed accordingly. (iii) The Commissioner would be required to refund any RWT or NRWT that had previously been deducted from the refunded dividend. (iv) Where the recipient of the dividend was a corporate, the repaying company would debit its imputation credit account with an amount equal to the value of any resident withholding tax or imputation credits attached to the recovered dividend. 46 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES Annex 4.1 APPLICATION OF TAX ACCOUNTING RULES TO AN AMALGAMATION Stage 1 Start position: Stage 2 A and B agree to amalgamate C Co, Do, and E Co into a new company, F Co. F Co Issues 2,000 shares in total to A and B in proportion to the market value of their direct holdings (double counting results if indirect holdings are Included, as the value of an indirect shareholding Is counted once as the market value of the subsidary company, and again as a share investment forming part of the value of the shareholding company). In return for existing holdings In C Co and D Co, A is Issued shares In F Co with a market value of: C Co's market value x A's shareholding, plus D Co's market value x A's shareholding, = $3,000 x 100% + $400 x 40% = $3,160 In return for existing holdings in D Co and E Co B Is issued shares in F Co with a market value of: D Co's market value x B's shareholding, plus E Co's market value x B's shareholding, = $400 x 10% + $ 1,000 x 100% = $ 1,040. The subscribed capital of F Co is the subscribed capital of C, D and E Co shares acquired by F Co in return for the F Co shares, excluding holdings by any of the amalgamating companies In each other = Subscribed capital (C Co + D Co + E Co), less sub. cap. of D Co held by E Co = $1,000 + $100+ $500-($100 x 50%) = $1,550. End position: CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 47 48 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 5.1 Introduction This chapter covers aspects of company law reform with tax implications which have not already been specifically addressed: • capital structure: abolition of nominal and par value; • use of new measurement of company ownership rules to replace obsolete company law concepts; • revising associated persons and company control definitions to accommodate company law changes; • substituting the closely-held company definition for private and proprietary company definitions; • providing for references to both the new and old Companies Acts during the transition period; • the effect of companies having only one shareholder or one share; • replacing memoranda and articles of association references in the Revenue Acts with the term "constitution"; • other terminology changes; and • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's preferred creditor status. 5.2 Capital Structure: Abolition of Nominal and Par Value The concepts of "par value" and "nominal capital" (and also as a consequence the concept of "share premium") are abolished under the new Companies Act. This will mean that the capital structure and financial accounts of a company incorporated or registered under the new Act will be significantly simplified. Par value and nominal capital had their origin in the capital maintenance rule, which required a company to retain assets equal to its capital for creditor and shareholder protection reasons. The concept of capital maintenance is superseded under the new Act by the solvency test. Par value was intended to provide protection for existing shareholders against stock watering (i.e. reducing the value of shares) by the issue of shares below CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 49 the value established at par. This protection, however, is not effective in circumstances where the shares are worth substantially more than par value. Section 47 of the new Act addresses the problem of stock watering by effectively requiring there to be adequate consideration paid on the issue of a company's shares. The board of directors is responsible for deciding the consideration for which a company's shares will be issued. Before issuing any shares the board must be satisfied that the consideration received for the shares is fair and reasonable to the company and to all existing shareholders. If the shares are to be issued other than for cash the board must determine the reasonable present cash value of the consideration. Section 35 simply defines a share as personal property. This means that the new Act retains an essentially common law definition of a share. The Income Tax Act mainly relies on the common law understanding of what is and what is not a share (with the exception of section 192 and 195 debentures, which are deemed to be shares for Income Tax Act purposes). There are various provisions in the Revenue Acts which use the terms nominal value, nominal capital or par value. As these terms are obsolete under the new Act, references to them will be replaced. These references are listed in Annex 5.1. The terms nominal value, nominal capital and par value are mainly used in the various Revenue Acts to measure shareholders' interests in companies. It will be possible to replace these terms with the voting and market value interest concepts used in sections 8A to 8D of the Income Tax Act. Such a change of terminology can have effect from date of enactment and therefore can apply to companies incorporated under either the Companies Act 1955 or the new Companies Act. 5.3 Measurement of Shareholder Interests In addition to replacing such terms as nominal capital, nominal value and par value, the measurement of shareholder interest rules in section 8A to 8D of the Income Tax Act can also be used to replace references to issued capital, paid- up capital (where this term is not used for distribution purposes) and shares generally where those terms are used as a measurement of company ownership. Those rules are not dependent on the existing terminology of the Companies Act and can therefore be applied more generally in the Income Tax Act. The company control definition in section 7 of the Income Tax Act and the various associated persons definitions are the main areas where the voting and market value interest concepts will be applied. 50 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 5.3.1 Associated Persons and Company Control Definitions As noted above, it is proposed that the company control definition (section 7) and the various associated persons definitions in the Revenue Acts be amended to employ the measurement of shareholder interests rules contained in sections 8A to 8D. Under these rules shareholders' economic interests in a company will generally be measured by reference to their voting interests in that company. In certain limited circumstances, shareholders' interests may need to be determined by reference to both their voting interests and market value interests in the company. Section 7 provides a standard company control definition which is used throughout the Income Tax Act (i.e. there is no multiplicity of definitions as there is with associated persons). By contrast, in addition to the general associated persons definition in section 8, there are currently four other associated persons definitions which apply only for the purposes of certain provisions in the Income Tax Act. They appear in: • section 67 - tax treatment of profits and gains from land transactions; • section 166 - notional interest on loans made to employees under an employee share repurchase scheme; • section 214E - associated persons definition for the petroleum mining regime (sections 214D to 214N). (This definition is also used for section 74 purposes, where in the case of timber sold to an associated person of the seller the seller's deduction for the cost of the timber is limited to the amount of the profit or gain derived by the seller); • section 245B - for purposes of the CFC and FIF regimes in Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. (For example, control interests held by associated persons are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC). Each of these definitions also requires amendment to employ the new measurement of shareholders' interests. Similarly, it is proposed to amend the associated persons definition in section 2 of the GST Act. The corporate and nominee look-through rules in existing section 8(2) are inadequate as they only refer to paid-up capital and not nominal capital, even though the latter is also used in section 8(1)(b) as a measure for determining whether a company and any individual are associated persons. The use of voting interest/market value interest tests in the recast section 8 will address this shortcoming. CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 51 5.4 Abolition of Private and Public Company Distinction The new Companies Act does not retain the current distinction between private and public companies, which in effect distinguishes between closely-held and widely-held companies. It is not considered necessary to have a separate regime for closely-held companies in the new Act. The flexibility typically provided by such a regime, such as less formality in management and shareholder decision-making, can be achieved under the new Act by a particular company's constitution providing that various presumptions in the new Act will not apply to that company. Tax references to the existing Companies Act private company definition are listed in Annex 5.2. The use of the private/public company classification in certain Income Tax Act provisions recognises the desirability of distinguishing between closely-held and widely-held companies in certain situations for tax purposes. In light of the absence of a closely/widely-held company distinction in the new Companies Act, those Income Tax Act provisions which currently refer to a private company could use the closely-held company definition contained in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. This would have the advantage of reducing the number of similar definitions. However, there are distinctions between the definitions. While a private company can currently have between 2 and 25 shareholders, there is no associated persons rule whereby associated shareholders are treated as one person. A closely-held company, as defined in section 8B, is a company in which five or fewer shareholders (with associated shareholders such as relatives being treated as one person) have in total over 50 percent of the direct voting interests (or direct market value interests where a market value circumstance exists). After receiving submissions the Government will determine whether its goal of applying a single definition in all circumstances is the best approach. While the closely-held company concept is embodied in various provisions in the Income Tax Act through the use of private company and proprietary company terms, there is no similar need for a widely-held company concept to replace the term "public company" outside of the shareholder continuity provisions. The term public company is used only once in the Income Tax Act, in section 147. This reference can remain as it is defined separately from the Companies Act 1955 and relies currently on the definition of the private company. In short, a public company for section 147 purposes will generally be defined as any company which is not a closely-held company. 52 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES There is a reference to a public company, within the meaning of the Companies Act 1955, in section 35 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 relating to the treatment of evidence in Taxation Review Authority proceedings. It is proposed to replace the public company references in this provision with a reference to the widely-held company definition in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. 5.5 Proprietary Companies In light of the removal of the private company references in the Income Tax Act, it is appropriate to review the proprietary company definition in section 2 of that Act. That definition also embodies a closely-held company concept of a company with a small number of associated shareholders and where ownership and management are often by the same persons. The proprietary company definition is utilised in various provisions which recognise that transactions between such companies and their shareholders (including persons associated with these shareholders) are more likely than in the case of other companies to be governed by other than arm's length considerations. A proprietary company is defined generally as a company under the control of not more than four persons. Provisions in the Income Tax Act which use the proprietary company definition and the closely held concept that it embodies are set out in Annex 5.3. As discussed in the private company section of this chapter, the closely-held company concept is now also embodied in the appropriately named "closely-held company" definition in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. It would be desirable if the Income Tax Act could employ a single, general closely-held company definition. Accordingly, it is proposed that the existing proprietary company references in the Income Tax Act also be replaced with the section 8B closely-held company definition. 5.6 Companies Act References Sections of the Revenue Acts which refer to the Companies Act 1955 are listed in Annex 5.4. This does not include Income Tax Act references which are used only for the purpose of defining a private company and which will therefore be omitted when private company references are removed. Immediate replacement of all Companies Act 1955 references with Companies Act 1993 references will not be possible because during the three year transition period following the enactment of the new Companies Act there will continue to exist companies incorporated under the 1955 Act, which will not be repealed until the end of the transition period. Therefore, until the expiration of the transition period there will have to be references in the Revenue Acts to both Companies Acts. CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 53 5.7 One Shareholder/One Share Companies It is possible under the new Companies Act for a company to have only one shareholder and/or one share. Under the present law a company must have a plurality of shareholders and shares (i.e. at least two of each). Many provisions in the Revenue Acts referring to shares or shareholders are predicated on the basis that a company must have a plurality of shares and shareholders and accordingly use words importing the plural number. The advent of one shareholder/one share companies should not, however, be problematical. Section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924, relating to the general interpretation of terms used in New Zealand statutes (unless inconsistent with the express provisions or context of an Act), provides that words and statutes importing the plural number are to include the singular number. Consequential amendments to the Revenue Acts to take account of the possibility of one shareholder/one share companies will therefore not be necessary. 5.8 Company Constitutions: Abolition of Memoranda and Articles of Association A company's constitutional arrangements under the new Act will no longer be governed by a separate memorandum of association (containing the objects of the company and the amount of its authorised share capital) and articles of association (providing for the company's internal government). Instead, each company will have a constitution. The absence of memorandum of association and articles of association terminology in the new Companies Act will involve little change to the Revenue Acts as they already typically use the generic term "constitution". For example, the term is employed in section 394B(2)(c) and the measurement of company ownership provisions in sections 8A to 8D. The few references to "memorandum of association" and "articles of association" in the Revenue Acts (listed in Annex 5.5) can be immediately replaced with the analogous term constitution. 5.9 Other Terminology Changes 5.9.1 Change from Allotment/Allotted to Issue/lssued The new Companies Act refers to shares being issued by a company and the issued shares. This is a change from the language used in the current 54 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Companies Act, which refers to the allotment of shares by a company and the allotted shares. The Income Tax Act currently uses both types of terms (i.e. allotment/allotted and issue/issued) in relation to shares. It would therefore be sensible for reasons of conformity with the new Companies legislation and the standardisation of terms within the Income Tax Act itself to change the allotment/allotted references in the Income Tax Act to the terms "issue" or "issued". In those sections where allotment/allotted is used in tandem with issue/issued, the allotment/allotted references merely need to be omitted. The Income Tax Act sections which currently use allotment/allotted terminology are listed in Annex 5.6. As the allotment/allotted and issue/issued references, in relation to shares, have exactly the same meaning, it will be possible to change these terms from the date of enactment of the taxation legislation. 5.9.2 Change from Wound Up/Winding Up to Liquidated/Liquidation The rules for ending the life of a company have been greatly simplified in the new Act. Partly because of this simplification the following terms used in the Companies Act 1955 - "winding up", "voluntary winding up", "dissolution", and "striking off" - have been able to be dispensed with and replaced simply with the concepts of liquidation and removal from the register in the Companies Act 1993. The term "liquidation" describes the process under which a company's assets are liquidated. The removal from the register of companies (equivalent to dissolution under the Companies Act 1955) is the final step on the liquidation of a company. Removal from the register can also constitute the entire process of ending a company's life in its own right (i.e. a prior liquidation process may not be necessary). It should be noted that where the grounds for the removal from the register are that the Registrar is satisfied that the company is defunct, or the director or shareholders of an insolvent company have applied for it to be removed, notice must be given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This notice allows the Commissioner to object to a company being removed from the register where there is outstanding tax owing by the company. The Income Tax Act currently uses the terms winding up or wound up to describe the process of ending a company's life. Winding up is defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act as including the final dissolution of a company. In order to achieve conformity with the new terminology in the new Companies Act relating to the termination of a company's existence the current Revenue Act references to the terms winding up or wound up (listed in Annex 5.7) CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 55 should be changed to liquidation or liquidated. This change can apply from the date of enactment. The term liquidation should be defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act as including the removal of a company from the register of companies under the new Companies Act or a dissolution under the Companies Act 1955. The reference to dissolution under the Companies Act 1955 can be deleted at the end of the three-year transition period. As with the term liquidation, winding up refers to the process by which a company's life is ended. Dissolution is the final step in the winding up of a company. 5.10 Commissioner's Status as Preferred Creditor Section 312 of the new Companies Act provides that a liquidator, after meeting the claims of secured creditors (other than the claims of debenture holders under any floating charge), must pay out of the assets of the company the preferential claims set out in the Seventh Schedule of the new Act. Clause 2(d) of the Seventh Schedule refers to amounts deducted by the company from the wages or salary of an employee in order to satisfy obligations of the employee. The total sum to which priority can be given under section 2(d) is limited by section 6 of the seventh schedule to $6,000 in the case of any one employee. This section is widely drafted and could include PAYE liability. The Commissioner would, however, rely on his specific priority under clause 5 in respect of this liability. Clause 2(e) of the Seventh Schedule includes any amounts relating to child support which are required to be deducted from an employee's wages or salary by a company and paid to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in accordance with the Child Support Act 1991. Clause 5 of the Seventh Schedule gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue preferred creditor status in respect of: • GST; • source deduction payments under Part XI of the Income Tax Act (this specifically includes PAYE obligations without any limit as to the amount to which priority is given); • non-resident withholding tax deductions; • resident withholding tax deductions. Clause 9 of the Seventh Schedule provides that after a liquidator's or receiver's expenses are met all other preferential claims rank equally and if a company's assets are insufficient to meet them the debts abate and are paid in equal proportions. 56 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Clause 9 also provides that preferential debts are paid in priority to the claims of holders of debentures under any floating charge. If the assets available for payment of general creditors are insufficient to satisfy preferential debts, then the shortfall can be taken from assets which are subject to a floating charge. The existing preferential creditor status of the Commissioner is unchanged by Clause 5 of the Seventh Schedule, which specifically states the nature and extent of the Commissioner's priority. The Commissioner's preferred creditor status is not specifically referred to in section 308 of the Companies Act 1955 (the equivalent provision to section 312); instead, this status is "imported" by specific provisions in the GST Act (section 42) and the Income Tax Act (section 365(2)(b)). It is proposed to amend these preferred creditor provisions in the Revenue Acts so that they contain cross-references to the Seventh Schedule to the new Companies Act. 5.11 Summary of Proposals The proposals in this chapter are that: (a) The current references in the Revenue Acts to nominal capital, nominal value, par value, issued capital, paid-up capital and shares generally - where those terms are used to measure shareholders' interests in companies - be replaced with the concepts of voting interest and market value interest contained in the measurement of company ownership rules in sections 8A - 8D of the Income Tax Act. (b) The Income Tax Act employ a single, general closely-held company definition (outside the qualifying company regime) which would be substituted for the current private company and proprietary company references in the Income Tax Act. (c) The public company reference in section 35 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 be replaced with a reference to the widely-held company definition in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. (d) Other existing company law references in the Inland Revenue Acts identified in Annexes 5.4 to 5.7 be amended to align the Revenue Acts with the new definitions and concepts used in the Companies Act 1993.

In the interests of brevity, the commentary is confined to amendments that are considered to be significant and complex and that are not described in detail in the discussion document. The commentary should be regarded as a guide only, and it does not, for interpretation purposes, override the actual words used in the legislation. Section 3(1) The definition of "bonus issue" will be amended to reflect the absence of a company law concept of capitalisation. The definition of "non-taxable bonus issue" will be retained, but will in future be synonymous with a share split. The term "ten year bonus issue" will be repealed. Amounts bonus issued between 31 March 1982 and 1 October 1988 which have served their time or which are paid up after 20 August 1985 and sourced from capital gain amounts and qualifying share premium are credited to subscribed capital (see item i(i) of "Transitional capital amount" in section 4A(3)). Section 3(2) Section 3(2) will be repealed as "subscribed capital" is not reduced where losses are written off. The provision is therefore unnecessary. Section 3(3) Section 3(3) will also be repealed. The replacement subsection provides a mechanism for determining for tax purposes how much is converted to subscribed capital by a taxable bonus issue (other than a bonus issue in lieu). This is required because there is no longer a distinction between the types of reserves for company law purposes and therefore no external reference point for determining the amount bonus issued. The amount credited to subscribed capital is the amount which the company elects is bonus issued (by notifying the Commissioner). The amount of dividend arising on a taxable bonus issue is the amount per share that the company so elects (section 4(6)). The provision only applies to New Zealand resident companies. Section 4(1) and (3) It appears that there is no reason for the specific inclusion of "specified payments" in section 4(1)(a). "Specified payments" are defined in sections 4(3) EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 71 and 4A(2) as (in effect) share premium. Distributions of share premium in cash appear to be covered in the general category "all sums in money" in paragraph (a). The proposed deletion of this term does not reflect any change in policy in relation to distributions of share premium. Section 4(1)(g) This paragraph has been redrafted to make it clear that amounts paid to shareholders on the acquisition by a company of its shares are included in the dividend definition (to the extent that they are not excluded under section 4A). Section 4(7A) New subsection (7A) reverses the tax effect of a distribution which is subsequently recovered by an insolvent company. The provision operates on the assumption that the net dividend (that is, the dividend less any resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax) will be recovered from the shareholder. The RWT or NRWT will be refunded by the Commissioner directly to the company. Section 4(12) The Government is concerned that companies, rather than purchase their own shares, will arrange for related companies to acquire those shares in order to avoid the dividend consequences that attach to the repurchase of shares. Such arrangements are likely to be caught by section 99(5). However, section 99(5) does not adequately deal with the tax consequences of an on-market repurchase. Accordingly, section 4(12) will clarify how section 99(5) will apply in such circumstances. Where a company arranges for a related company to purchase shares in substitution for an on-market buy back, section 4(12) in effect provides that a debit will arise to the imputation credit account of the company that issued the shares. Section 4(15) Section 4(15) will be amended to provide that where a person holds shares on revenue account, and sells those shares off-market to the company, the shareholder is taxed on the profit on sale only to the extent it exceeds the dividend (exclusive of imputation credits) arising on the sale. 72 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION Section 4A(1)(c) The new section 4A(1)(c) excludes from the dividend definition, if the conditions set out in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) are satisfied, amounts returned to shareholders when a company repurchases, redeems or cancels its shares (other than on liquidation) up to the amount of subscribed capital and realised capital gain per share. Subparagraph(i) This subparagraph contains the "brightline tests" discussed in section 2.4.4 of the discussion document. Subparagraph (ii) The brightline tests do not apply to fixed rate shares. The subscribed capital will be tax-free on redemption of such a share (assuming the anti-dividend substitution provisions in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) do not apply). Subparagraph (iii) This subparagraph contains a redraft of the current anti-dividend substitution provision. Subparagraph (iv) This provision contains the "slice rule" described in sections 2.3.1 and 2.4.3 of the discussion document. Section 4A(1)(ca) This paragraph excludes from the dividend definition amounts returned to shareholders when the company's shares are redeemed or cancelled upon its liquidation. The exclusion is limited to the aggregate of the subscribed capital per share and realised and unrealised capital gains per share. Section 4A(1)(cb) This paragraph excludes from the dividend definition amounts returned to shareholders when a company repurchases its shares on the stock market. Such amounts are treated as dividends only for the purposes of: - requiring that a debit arises to the repurchasing company's imputation credit account in relation to the dividend component of a distribution; EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 73 - enabling section 99(5) to apply (in the circumstances where it can apply) where there is an on-market acquisition; - the recovery of dividend provisions in section 4(7A). Section 4A(1)(h) Paragraph (h) will be repealed because losses written off will not affect a company's "subscribed capital amount" (defined in new section 4A(3)). Section 4A(3) A new section 4A(3) will replace the current provision. It will contain definitions of new terms to be used in section 4A as well as amended definitions of terms currently in use. The terms used are in relation to a single share. "Excess return amount” This formula is used in section 4A(1)(c) and (ca). It distinguishes between realised capital gains (item d) that may be distributed tax free on a cancellation or repurchase of shares, and unrealised capital gains (item e) which are available for tax free distribution only on liquidation. The formula spreads such gains across all shares of the company, other than fixed rate shares. Paragraph (ii) of the present item e has been broadened to align that paragraph with section 4A(11). "Fixed rate share" Fixed rate shares are essentially shares in respect of which the rate of dividends paid is not commensurate with the company's profits. The definition in this subsection is similar to the definition of that term in sections 8B and 63(2D). It has a further requirement that there be no shareholder decision- making rights available to the holder of the shares except in very limited circumstances. "Fully credited" This term is used in the definition of "subscribed capital amount" (item f(iv)) and discussed in section 4.2.5 of the discussion document. The calculation of the subscribed capital amount of a share excludes: 74 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION - taxable bonus issues made to shareholders who are exempt from tax under section 63; and - consideration received by a company on the issue of shares which is attributable to the payment by the company of a dividend exempt to those shareholders. The exclusion applies except to the extent to which the taxable bonus issue or the dividend is fully credited. "Fully credited" in relation to a dividend thus refers to that proportion of a dividend which is credited with imputation or withholding payment credits at the maximum imputation ratio. "Ineligible capital amount" This concept is the "anti-avoidance" provision referred to in section 4.2.6 of the discussion document. The term is used in the definition of subscribed capital amount (item f(vi)). It is intended to prevent the inflation of the subscribed capital of an acquired company in anticipation of a share swap. "Subscribed capital amount" The subscribed capital amount is a new concept which refers in essence to consideration received by a company on the issue of its shares. Its relevance is in determining the amount that can be distributed tax-free to shareholders under section 4A(1)(c) and (ca) described above. The predecessors of the subscribed capital amount are the current "returned capital amount" and "returned share premium amount" which effectively compute the subscribed capital per share based on an overall average of shares ever issued of the same class. It is considered that the current returned capital amount computation will be deficient in the context of the "slice rule" in that where less than market value is paid for a share the rule restricts the amount of subscribed capital that may be returned to shareholders. Accordingly, there is a need for a new concept of subscribed capital which is based on a "moving average". The "moving average" formula will in effect calculate subscribed capital attributable to shares on issue at any particular time. Subscribed capital amount is thus the aggregate of:- - for a company that was in existence before the application date, its "transitional capital amount" (see below); and - consideration received by a company on the issue (after the application date) of shares of the same class as the share being cancelled (subject to certain exclusions); EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 75 less - subscribed capital amounts which have previously been returned to shareholders on the cancellation of shares of that class on or after the application date and which have been treated as tax-free distributions under section 4A(1)(c). The result of the above calculation is divided by the number of shares of the same class on issue immediately prior to the relevant cancellation. It is important to note (see item f(vi) in the calculation) that the amounts making up the consideration received by a company on the issue of its shares do not include consideration in the form of shares in another company acquired by the company to the extent to which the value of those shares exceeds the subscribed capital amounts (after deducting the ineligible capital amounts ) in respect of such shares. Thus, if (for example) a company ("A Co") issues shares to a shareholder of another company ("B Co") in exchange for shares in B Co the subscribed capital amount of A Co increases only by the subscribed capital amount attributable to the shares acquired in B Co (calculated after deducting the ineligible capital amount). "Transitional capital amount' This term is only relevant to companies formed before the application date. As noted above, the calculation of the subscribed capital amount based on a moving average will require knowledge of amounts of subscribed capital paid up on shares of a class currently on issue. It was thought that it may be time consuming for companies to identify amounts of paid up capital returned to shareholders on shares previously cancelled. Therefore, the simplest solution was to include in the subscribed capital amount calculation, a "transitional" amount which would relieve companies from having to identify those amounts. The transitional capital amount is thus simply an amount calculated by multiplying the outstanding shares in each class by the returned capital and share premium amounts determined under the current averaging formula. Section 191WD Corporate Amalgamations Some corporate amalgamations qualify for particular taxation treatment under this section. The taxation treatment minimises administrative impediments to corporate restructuring through amalgamations by permitting, for example, tax- free asset transfers on amalgamation and preservation of accumulated losses 76 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION and imputation credits for use by the amalgamated company. The provision also details the tax consequences for non-qualifying amalgamations. Section 191WD(1) This subsection contains a number of definitions relevant to the operation of section 191WD. It limits the particular taxation treatment to "qualifying amalgamations" occurring under the 1955 and 1993 Companies Acts. Each amalgamating company must be an "eligible company" (essentially resident in New Zealand and not exempt from income tax). Amalgamations between qualifying and non-qualifying companies are not qualifying amalgamations. Section 191WD(2) Amalgamating companies have up to 63 days from the date documentation evidencing the amalgamation is given to the Company Registrar for registration purposes to give notice of the amalgamation in writing to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Section 191WD(3) This subsection explains how to calculate the subscribed capital amount of shares issued in the amalgamated company. It has the same effect as item f(vi) in the definition of subscribed capital amount (a separate provision is included here as the term ineligible capital amount referred to in that item relates only to the acquisition of shares). Except as discussed in relation to subsection (4), generally the subscribed capital amount of the amalgamating company becomes subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. However, a portion of the amalgamating company's subscribed capital may be ineligible to be attributed in this way. This restriction is intended to prevent an amalgamating company increasing the level of its subscribed capital in anticipation of amalgamation with another company, in order to inflate the amount which may be credited to subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. This provision is only triggered to the extent a shareholder in the amalgamating company receives cash or other liquid property for shares converted. Section 191WD(4) The effect of this subsection is to subtract the subscribed capital of shares held by an amalgamating company and cancelled upon an amalgamation from the subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. The subscribed capital attributable to the cancelled shares therefore does not form part of the subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 77 Section 191WD(5) The transfer of assets out of an amalgamating company may affect the market value of the shares held by an amalgamating company in that company. The cancellation of the shares and the issue of new shares in the amalgamated company in effect result merely in the gain or loss being transferred to the amalgamated company. Accordingly, this provision prevents that gain or loss from being taken into account by deeming the amalgamating shareholder company to have disposed of the shares at their opening book value (for shares purchased in prior years ) and at cost ( for newly acquired shares ). Section 191WD(6) This provision ensures the continuity of the liabilities and rights of an amalgamating company that ceases to exist after the amalgamation. For tax purposes, this ensures continuity of the amalgamating company's objection rights, loss election rights and rights to refunds. Section 191WD(7) Income received by the amalgamated company for the provision of services by an amalgamating company is treated as assessable in the recipient's hands if the income would have been assessable to the amalgamating company that provided the services. Section 191WD(8) Taxation consequences apply on the transfer of assets in a non-qualifying amalgamation. There is a deemed disposal at market value. Section 191WD(9) This subsection contains several provisions relating to the tax treatment of the asset transfers that occur from an amalgamating company to an amalgamated company. First, it provides for the tax-free transfer of assets other than trading stock at the time of amalgamation. In determining the assessable income that may arise later to the amalgamated company in respect of these assets, the consolidation provisions in section 191N(1) to (4) apply with some modifications. Second, the transfer of trading stock of the amalgamating company to trading stock of the amalgamated company is treated as a deemed disposal at opening book value (for trading stock on hand) and at cost ( for new acquisitions ). This 78 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION prevents movements in the opening and closing values to the date of amalgamation being taken into account by the amalgamating company. Third, it provides for tax to be payable where an asset is converted from revenue account to capital account on amalgamation. This provision ensures the tax-free treatment of asset transfers is not used to convert assets without taxation consequences. Section 191WD(10) This subsection provides for a deemed consideration for the base price calculation required on the transfer of a financial arrangement (of which the amalgamating company is the issuer) to an amalgamated company. In certain circumstances, for example, where the same method of allocating income or expenditure is used by both the amalgamating and amalgamated companies, the deemed consideration is one that results either in a nil allocation or a fair and reasonable allocation. Where a different method of allocation is used, the market price of the financial arrangement is taken into account. This provision is identical to the treatment of financial arrangements of which the amalgamating company is the holder. Section 191WD(11) An amalgamating company that ceases to exist may, subject to certain conditions, carry forward any accumulated loss, attributed foreign loss, foreign investment fund loss or tax credit into the amalgamated company. The amalgamated company is allowed to succeed to losses of an amalgamating company only if the shareholder continuity requirement is satisfied with respect to the amalgamating company after the amalgamation, and immediately prior to the amalgamation, offset of the losses of that amalgamating company was allowable against the income of all the other amalgamating companies. Section 191WD(12) This subsection provides an ordering rule for the offset of losses and the tax credits referred to in subsection (11) of two or more amalgamating companies against the future income or tax liability of the amalgamated company. Section 191WD(13) The liability of an amalgamated company to make provisional tax instalment payments after an amalgamation is based on the residual income tax of the preceding income year of each amalgamating company. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 79 Section 191WD(14) This subsection contains several provisions relating to debits and credits of an amalgamating company in its imputation credit account, dividend withholding payment account, branch equivalent tax account and policyholder credit account. First it provides for the pre-amalgamation debits and credits to be treated with effect from the amalgamation as debits and credits of the amalgamated company provided the continuity of shareholding has been maintained. Second, it provides the mechanism for posting any debits or credits of an amalgamating company that arise after the amalgamation to the equivalent accounts of the amalgamated company. Finally, it mirrors the limits applying to refunds contained in sections 394M and 394ZO of the Act. Section 327C(1) Resident withholding tax on taxable bonus issues (except bonus issues in lieu) will be calculated under paragraph (c). For the purposes of item b of the formula, the dividend paid is the amount which the company elects to transfer to subscribed capital. Paragraph (d) will be redrafted so that it applies only to a bonus issue in lieu. Section 394E(1) and (2) Where a company repurchases shares on-market, a debit arises to that company's imputation credit account. The formula for calculating the amount of the debit is contained in proposed new paragraph (1)(ab). The debit arises on the date of acquisition of the shares. The slice rule automatically applies in calculating the debit amount, i.e. the brightline tests do not apply in relation to an on-market repurchase. Section 394ZW (1) This section will be amended to remove the reference to refunds under section 394ZO. This is to accommodate a refund of dividend withholding payment arising on the recovery of a dividend distribution from a corporate shareholder by a non-resident insolvent company. 80 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION DRAFT LEGISLATION - 1 - TAXATION IMPLICATIONS OF COMPANY LAW REFORM - DRAFT LEGISLATION Income Tax Act 1976 OO.

Preface International Tax - A Discussion Document New Zealand’s current high rate of economic growth is the result of an extensive structural reform of the economy, including major reforms in the area of taxation. Critical to sustaining this growth is continued investment by business and increased participation in the world economy. Openness to foreign capital, ideas and goods and services is essential. One of the fundamental principles driving the Government’s economic policies is a commitment to a broad base, low rate tax environment. Such a tax environment is conducive to sound business decision making and encourages investment on merit. Such an environment is also good for the New Zealand economy. The international tax has a history of being a contentious area of tax policy. This is due to the inherently complex nature of international tax and the role international tax plays as a back-stop to New Zealand’s domestic tax regime. The complexity of reforms to international tax since 1988 and the lack of a comprehensive discussion of the underlying rationale for the policy, have hindered the development of a broader agreement on tax policy details. This document performs two roles: • it presents a discussion of an economic framework which covers the whole field of international tax, allows evaluation of other regimes and demonstrates how the various elements of international tax ru les interact. This discussion is intended to provide a basis for ongoing refinement of New Zealand’s existing international tax rules; and • it outlines specific reforms to the tax rules (covering foreign direct investment, transfer pricing and thin capitalisation) which the Government proposes to consider implementing this year. These reforms, together with existing rules, constitute the building blocks for a more coherent international tax regime consistent with the framework presented. The Government welcomes comments on both parts of the document. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.

An Overview 1 .1 Introduction The past ten years have been characterised by major reforms within the New Zealand economy. Those reforms have included very significant changes to the New Zealand taxation system. Major new taxes have been introduced; for example, GST. Part of this overall tax reform process has been fundamental reform of the taxation laws as they affect income flows across international borders. A deregulated international capital environment requires robust international tax rules to protect the New Zealand tax base. While providing that essential protection to the New Zealand tax base, the reforms of the international taxation regime have also been designed to underpin the development of the dynamic, open, internationally competitive economy that has been a key component of New Zealand's economic success in recent years. Continued investment, necessary to support sustainable economic growth, demands that New Zealand businesses be able to satisfy their requirements for capital, either from New Zealand or overseas. Policies that give domestic producers access to capital at low cost will enhance the competitiveness of New Zealand business and are consistent with the Government's policy of repaying public debt to remove the risk premium for New Zealand. New Zealand’s recent economic performance The average annual GDP growth over the past 20 years was 1.6%. In the year to June 1994, GDP growth was 6.3%.1 New Zealand is now one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD. Forecast average GDP growth for 1994/95 is 5.8%. Net public debt has fallen from 48% of GDP in 1992/93 to 43% in 1993/94. It is projected to fall to 26% by 1996/97 and 18% by 2003/04. Underlying inflation has remained below 2% since 1991 and the fiscal balance moved into surplus in the 1993/94 year. Exports of goods and services totalled 31 % of GDP in 1993. Manufactured non-food exports rose from 19% of export earnings in 1980 to 30% in 1993, growing at 11% per annum in the two years to June 1993 (15% per annum for non-commodity manufacturing exports—on present trends, exports of this sort will double between 1993 and 1997). Foreign direct investment can bring with it the additional benefit of a transfer of technology and ideas to New Zealand. Openness to foreign capital, ideas and goods and services will aid the effort to build a dynamic, fast-growing enterprise economy that generates exports and jobs here in New Zealand. At the same time, New Zealand businesses invest overseas to build infrastructures that support the sale of their New Zealand-made products and to pursue opportunities not available at home in the New Zealand economy. A growing, dynamic economy that is raising the living standards of all New Zealanders will therefore see a combination of foreign investment in New Zealand and overseas investment by New Zealanders. The Government is committed to New Zealand's continuing full participation in the international economy. As much as possible, investment decisions should be driven by the intrinsic quality of the investment rather than by tax considerations. The tax system should not make offshore investment more or less attractive than domestic investment for New Zealand investors. Inevitably, however, tax policy plays a role in business decisions, including those decisions which affect international capital and income flows both into and from New Zealand. 1 Source -Economic and Fiscal Update, 20 December 1994. 1 Openness Openness and growth are strongly connected. Recent World Bank work on East Asia has confirmed this. Foreign direct investment into New Zealand in the year to March 1994 alone was $4.7 billion. In legal terms, New Zealand is very open to foreign investment. Specific restrictions on foreign investment apply only to fishing quota and Air New Zealand. The Overseas Investment Commission oversees any proposal by non-residents to establish a business; acquire a 25% or greater share; increase an equity share; or acquire assets above $10 million. From 1988 to 1992, the Commission declined only three out of more than 4,000 applications. Authorisation is also necessary for a non-resident to purchase rural land or offshore islands. Capital flows world-wide already dwarf trade flows and are growing faster. Total world trade volume in 1992 was US$10 billion per day, while foreign exchange turnover was US$880 billion per day. In July 1994 non-resident investors held about NZ$4,671.5 million of New Zealand Government stock, 24.5% of the total and about NZ$3,342.7 million of Treasury Bills, 55.9% of the total. In addition, foreign currency Government debt at 30 June 1994 was NZ$16,864 million. Foreign investors now hold substantial equity stakes in listed New Zealand companies, facilitated by dual listings on overseas markets. Any tax policy development involves achieving a mix of objectives. Clearly, protecting the New Zealand tax base and low compliance costs must be key goals. Prior to Christmas 1994, the Government issued a discussion document giving significant weight to minimising the compliance costs associated with the taxation system. Obviously, ensuring the maximum economic benefit to New Zealand must also be given full and thorough consideration in tax policy formation. The policy objective of minimising compliance costs has already been given effect in the international tax regime by the introduction of such features as the "grey list". Those investing in countries on the grey list are excused from complying with the rules of the international tax regime. The grey list countries have robust rules which are likely to ensure that any income-earning activity will be taxed at a similar rate to that which would apply under the New Zealand rules. Over the last ten years, changes in international tax policy have led to the introduction of rules which allow the taxation of New Zealanders on their worldwide income, measured according to New Zealand tax rules. Both Controlled Foreign Companies (CFCs) and Foreign Investment Funds (FIFs) have been brought into and are now fully covered, by the international tax regime. As part of the continuing reform process, in August 1993 the Government reformed the tax system as it affects non- resident portfolio investors by introducing a mechanism called the Foreign Investor Tax Credit (FITC). The introduction of the FITC removed the double imposition of New Zealand taxes on dividends paid to foreign portfolio investors. Foreign portfolio investors are no longer required to pay full tax at the New Zealand company level as well as Non-Resident Withholding Tax. That puts a foreign investor in a similar position to a domestic investor as far as the maximum New Zealand tax payable is concerned. The change had an immediate positive effect on the New Zealand share market. (One large New Zealand business estimated that this one measure reduced its cost of capital by about 8%.) At the time of those changes in August 1993, the Government announced that the next stage of the reform process would cover the areas of foreign direct investment, transfer-pricing and thin-capitalisation. These, together with existing rules, represent the remaining items in the current round of reforms of the international tax regime. The Government is of the view that, after the measures proposed in this package (foreign direct investment, transfer pricing and thin capitalisation) 2 have been given effect to, New Zealand will have an effective and comprehensive international tax regime. Although Ministers are always willing to listen to concerns, and obviously any part of the tax law must be the subject of continual refinement to address issues that arise (for example, base maintenance and other concerns), in the fundamental sense, what has been achieved by way of major reform in the last ten years is in the view of the Government settled. After such a protracted period of intense legislative activity, it is appropriate that there be a period of consolidation. This discussion document is produced as part of the generic tax policy development process recommended by the Review Committee chaired by the Rt Hon Sir Ivor Richardson of the Court of Appeal. It outlines the Government’s intentions for the next stage in the development of the international tax regime. 1.2 Brief overview of this discussion document To assist understanding of the approach being taken to international tax policy, Part A of the document introduces a high-level discussion of the economic and tax policy considerations which the Government is working through to establish tax policy. This discussion is intended to indicate to interested parties the thinking on policy development in this area. It also offers an assessment, in the light of that discussion, of the current regime for taxing cross-border income. To assist the Government in its ongoing refinement of international tax rules, submissions are sought on the issues raised. The key issue here is the weighting to be placed on residence versus source tax bases. Chapter 2 discusses the broad policy framework issues that underlie international tax policy. Chapter 3 describes the current international tax regime and then assesses it in the light of the earlier discussion in Chapter 2 of the broad objectives of tax and economic policy. Part B of the document then details the reform measures which the Government proposes to consider implementing this year. Submissions are sought from interested parties on these measures. Chapter 4 discusses technical problems inherent in the existing rules for measuring cross-border income flows. Chapter 5 covers the broad proposals for reform canvassed in this document, after which Chapters 6, 7 and 8 canvass in detail the options for reform. They introduce the Government's proposals for the tax treatment of foreign direct investment and put forward the Government's proposals to address the issues of transfer-pricing, source and thin- capitalisation rules. 1.3 Submissions Submissions on Part A, the Policy Framework, should be sent to: The Manager International Tax The Treasury PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON. Interested parties can contact Treasury directly if they wish to discuss any issues raised in Part A. Submissions on Part B, the Reform Proposals, should be sent to: The Director Legislative Affairs Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON. Submissions on either Part should be made by 12 April 1995. 3 Part A: Policy Framework 5 2. POLICY MAKING CONSIDERATIONS A general discussion on the broad framework for international tax 2.1 Introduction Previous consultations on international tax reform have tended to focus directly on the proposed measures themselves. Although “Taxing Income across International Borders - A Policy Framework” introduced a comprehensive discussion of the rationale and issues underlying international tax policy, there was little feedback on that document at the time that it was published (July 1991). This lack of focus in the past has made it difficult to explain the underlying rationale for the Government’s international tax proposals. To fill this gap, the Government has been working through the issues involved in the international tax regime identifying those factors that must be considered if the Government is to meet its economic and tax policy objectives. This will provide the context for discussion on international tax policy. In the process of developing this discussion document, the Government has undertaken preliminary consultations with overseas experts and members of the business community. This chapter highlights these issues, many of which are based in economic theory and very technical in nature. To make the points while keeping the exposition as straightforward as possible, the economic aspects of the discussion simplify many of the real-world factors that influence business investment decisions. It has already been pointed out that the Government, in determining its tax policy, endeavours to meet many objectives, some of which do not fit neatly with each other. Greater accuracy, for example, can often only be achieved at the cost of greater complexity and vice versa. The design of an international tax regime involves many judgments about the economic effects of taxes, and the numerous trade-offs between the economic effects and the various practical issues. The following analysis focuses largely on the economic effects of tax policy rather than the related practical issues. As such, it is an illustrative guide to the economics of international tax rather than a definitive statement of the tax policy framework that must be rigorously followed. 2.2 Outline of the chapter This chapter first discusses economic considerations. It adopts a step-by-step approach to illustrate how the many important judgments fit into the analysis, and how they affect the design of the international tax regime. This approach should make it easy for readers to pinpoint any particular areas of concern about the economic analysis and the judgments made. Being able to identify their key concerns should enable parties to engage in a process of consultation on international tax which will be more constructive than in the past. The economic discussion starts by canvassing the aims of international tax policy. It then looks at the factors, other than tax, that influence investment decisions. Analysing such influences is important, because an ideal tax system is one in which tax plays as small a role as possible in investment decision-making. The discussion then considers the ways in which New Zealand taxes can influence the investment decisions of New Zealanders investing here and overseas, and of non-residents who are considering investing in New Zealand. This discussion includes comments on the influence of taxes imposed by other countries on the New Zealand Government’s tax policy. Finally, the discussion outlines other important considerations that the Government must take into account when setting international tax policy, including the need to protect the domestic tax base, the need to reduce the costs of complying with and administering the tax system, and the desirability of sustainable policy. 2.3 The broad aim of international tax policy 2.3.1 Introduction Because New Zealand is an open economy, New Zealanders are free to invest either in New Zealand or offshore. Likewise, foreigners can invest in New Zealand or elsewhere. For the purposes of this discussion, investment activity is divided into three separate forms. They are: 7 • investment undertaken outside New Zealand by New Zealanders. This sort of investment uses exported capital; • investment undertaken in New Zealand by non-residents. This uses imported capital; and • investment undertaken in New Zealand by New Zealanders. This uses domestic capital. Although a discussion of domestic investment may seem out of place in a document dealing with international tax, taxes on cross-border income flows in fact have a marked impact on investment decisions, and the way that all three forms of investment interact is a key tax policy consideration. 2.3.2 Supporting efficient use of New Zealand's resources A fundamental aim of the Government’s policy will always be, consistent with meeting other policy objectives, to ensure that, whatever the location of investment or the source of finance, all investment decisions make the most efficient use of New Zealand’s resources. Policy that achieves this objective will make the greatest possible contribution to economic growth and consequentially improving living standards for all New Zealanders. Investors use relative rates of return as a guide to choosing the most productive of alternative investments, both in New Zealand and overseas. For example, if relative rates of return are higher overseas than they are in New Zealand, the incentive on non-residents especially, but NZ residents as well, will be to invest offshore as opposed to in New Zealand. It has to be taken as read that an unavoidable consequence of gathering government revenue through taxes is to reduce the actual direct return the investor achieves on the investment. To promote investment that benefits New Zealand, therefore, it is important to ensure the tax system does not have adverse effects on the relative rates of return available from onshore as opposed to offshore investments. Less obvious, however, are the ways the tax system can affect patterns of investment. Deficiencies in the tax regime that result in different rates of New Zealand tax being applied to different types of investments will alter the relative rates of return investors can derive from those investments. This imposes a "deadweight cost" on the economy by potentially supporting inefficient patterns of investment. If the international tax regime is to play its part in encouraging the efficient use of New Zealand's resources, the Government must aim for a regime that does not distort the relative rates of return from alternative investments both in New Zealand and offshore. When relative rates of return are not distorted by tax, investors will concentrate on those activities that make the most efficient use of New Zealand's resources, rather than those investments that take advantage of deficiencies in the tax system. There is also an inescapable link between the world and the domestic rate of return on capital. If the return on domestic investment exceeds the cost of imported capital, then New Zealand can gain by increasing the level of investment financed by imported capital. Conversely, if the return on domestic capital is lower than the costs of foreign capital, then New Zealand loses money by financing domestic investment with foreign capital. Hence, New Zealanders will gain where productive investment opportunities available to them give a return at least as high as the cost of foreign capital. And likewise, New Zealand benefits from making offshore investments only if the return to New Zealand is at least as high as the returns available domestically. To do otherwise would mean that New Zealanders would be investing offshore when better opportunities are available locally. Combining these two factors means that New Zealanders should have an incentive to invest offshore only when the returns are at least as high as the cost of imported capital. 8 These two factors can be summarised as follows: FACTOR ONE: New Zealanders should continue to take up domestic investment opportunities until the return to domestic capital falls to the level of the cost of imported capital, but not below it. FACTOR TWO: New Zealanders should continue to take up offshore investment until the return to exported capital falls to the level of the cost of imported capital, but not below it. If the international tax regime alters the relative rates of return available in New Zealand such that either of these two conditions, or both, are not met, then New Zealand will not be making the most efficient use of its resources. 2.4 Influences on investment Cross-border investment occurs for a variety of reasons. Tax related issues are but a part of the overall picture. The impact of these differing influences varies depending on the type of investor. Although the reasons for investment and types of investor are myriad and complex, there are two types of investors generally considered in a broad discussion such as this. They are portfolio and direct investors. A portfolio investor is a shareholder with a non-controlling interest in a company. The level of shareholding is generally less than 10% of a company's shares or, alternatively, consists solely of debt instruments in a company. Usually the holdings are relatively liquid and small influences can see major changes in the content of a particular investor's portfolio. In New Zealand, portfolio investors have a wide range of investment options to choose from. It is safe to assume that portfolio investors will, as a key motivation, seek the highest return on the funds at their disposal. The nature and location of specific investments are less of a factor in investment decision-making for portfolio investors. The motivation for investment will include the desire to diversify portfolio risk. Direct investors, by contrast, are investors who take a significant stake in the company in which they invest. Factors other than immediate return on capital are important determinants of direct investors’ investment decisions. These investors will tend to follow carefully the performance of the particular company concerned, and will often actively participate in the operations of the company. They will almost certainly have some influence over the affairs of a company, if not a controlling interest. Many direct investments will be wholly owned subsidiaries. Direct investments are less liquid. They do not move out of a holding quickly or merely because the rate of return is temporarily lower than they expect. Factors such as the location of markets and production inputs, tariffs and other barriers to trade, and access to new technology and knowledge will concern direct investors. In the longer term, however, direct investors will still be influenced by the return on their investment. The return that investors seek is an amalgamation of all the factors that influence investment. 2.5 The source of capital - domestic or foreign The amount of capital imported into a country will be influenced by the extent to which foreign investors can switch from investments in one country to investments in other countries. The comparative rates of return available from investments between countries will be important in driving switching between countries. Obviously, political and economic stability also play a role in an investor’s decision to go into a particular country, as do a variety of other features of a particular economy. In a small open economy like New Zealand’s, the supply of foreign capital is very sensitive to the rates of return available in New Zealand compared with rates of return available in other countries. Further, because New Zealand is such a small part of the world capital markets, changes in the supply and demand for capital here have no discernible effect on those world market rates. It is the actions of international investors operating throughout the world's financial markets that set the return for imported capital. 9 From the New Zealand business perspective, demand for foreign investment funds will depend on a number of factors, including the rates New Zealand businesses must pay for domestically sourced capital and the extent to which New Zealand firms are willing to switch from domestically sourced capital to foreign capital. If New Zealand businesses are in a position where they can readily switch between domestically sourced and foreign- sourced capital, their demand for domestic capital will be very sensitive to the rates of return paid to foreign investors. Although levels and sources of investment are sensitive to many factors, the implication of this process is that the more freely business investment can move, the more investment decisions will be influenced by the world rate of return required by non-resident suppliers of such capital. 2.6 THE IMPACT OF TAXES 2.6.1 Introduction To understand the impact of taxes, we have to first consider what would occur were there no taxes. Theoretically, the real cost of foreign funds equals the pre-tax return accruing to non-residents minus the portion of that pre-tax return received by New Zealand as tax revenue. For the purposes of the following discussion, assume this figure is 10%. Consider the case in which foreign investors are able to earn 10% by lending money to a number of prospective borrowers. In this example, foreign investors are indifferent as to where they earn their money. Given these assumptions, New Zealand businesses will have to pay non-resident investors 10% after tax to attract finance. If they paid less than 10%, foreign investors would simply shift their investments to jurisdictions in which they can earn 10% after tax. In this simplified model of the world, because there are no taxes, there are no tax-driven distortions to economic behaviour. Funds move freely to the highest bidder. The world rate of return applies to all investments, whether they be imported, exported or domestic capital. 10 2.6.2 How taxes affect investment decisions To the extent that taxes reduce equally the return to the investor from all potential investments, then the level of investment will be affected, but not the pattern of investment. If taxes alter the relative returns from different investment opportunities, then the pattern of investment will be altered, leading potentially (as explained in the section above on efficient use of New Zealand’s resources) to a less efficient use of New Zealand’s resources. New Zealand tax policy will alter these impacts least when investment and production choices of individuals and firms are least affected by income taxes levied by New Zealand. There are several ways New Zealand can tax the three bases referred to in this discussion; that is imported, exported or domestic capital. New Zealand could: • tax residents only on their domestic income • tax residents on their world-wide income • tax non-residents on their New Zealand-sourced income Each of these is now considered. a) New Zealand taxes only residents and only on their domestic income The overall return to New Zealand equals the after-tax return to the New Zealand investor plus the tax revenue paid to the New Zealand Government. That is, the return on the investment is spread between the investor and the Government. The pre-tax return on domestic investment reflects the productivity of the investment for New Zealand. Where there are no or lower foreign taxes (assuming all else is equal), imposing New Zealand tax on residents' domestic income, while exempting residents’ foreign-sourced income from tax, would merely drive residents to invest offshore where there are no or lower taxes. In this case, to the extent of New Zealand taxes lost because the investment is not located in New Zealand, there would be a loss to New Zealand. Consider the following example: Suppose a resident has $1,000 to invest and that domestic income is subject to a 33% New Zealand tax rate but that offshore income is exempt from New Zealand tax. The investor can earn after-tax income of $67 at home. The residents will invest in any offshore project yielding pre-tax returns as low as $67, but only invest at home if the pre-tax return is at least $100. Thus, an exemption for offshore income encourages New Zealanders to invest in offshore projects yielding less than the 10% rate of return. A New Zealand investor could borrow from foreigners at a 10% interest rate and on-lend it to other foreigners at a 6.7% interest rate and still have the same amount of cash in hand. Therefore, to refrain from taxing the earnings of foreign investments of New Zealanders is obviously a bad policy from New Zealand's point of view. The following diagram explains this point. For the purposes of the diagram, we will assume there are no taxes offshore. 11 Figure 2 illustrates why it is inefficient to tax domestic investment but not exported investments. It is of course a stylised example. The extreme result is a tax system that collects no revenue, but encourages New Zealanders to hold tax-free investments offshore and non-residents to hold tax-free investments in New Zealand. Non-residents taking up the investment opportunities abandoned by residents will, however, still require the full 10% world rate of return to come to New Zealand. b) New Zealand taxes only residents but on their world-wide income Under this scenario, New Zealand would tax the offshore income of residents at the same rate that applies to residents’ domestic income. This approach is referred to as the residence basis for income taxation. Under the residence basis of taxation the after-tax return to residents from both domestic and offshore investments is reduced by the same proportional amount. As a result, New Zealand investors will choose the investment yielding the highest pre-tax return because that also yields the highest post-tax return. Offshore investment under these circumstances will occur only when the investment returns justify the investment; that is, when the after-tax return is equal to or greater than that achievable in New Zealand. In the example above, New Zealand residents will invest offshore only when they can earn more than the $67 after-tax income available at home. If residents are subject to a 33% tax rate on both their domestic and offshore income, then they will invest only in offshore projects yielding pre-tax income equal to or greater than $100: in the absence of foreign taxes investments benefit New Zealand because: (1) the overall return for New Zealand (i.e., the pre-tax income) equals or exceeds what they could have achieved at home; and (2) the overall return exceeds the cost of foreign capital to New Zealand. The latter condition means that any cross-hauling effects benefit New Zealand. There are, however, situations where New Zealand cannot fully tax offshore income. Both practical and inter- jurisdictional difficulties arise. For example, some international agreements New Zealand has entered into limit our ability to tax New Zealanders in other jurisdictions. In particular, double tax agreements (DTAs) New Zealand has entered into (as well as practical considerations) generally prevent New Zealand from taxing foreign companies on offshore income they derive that accrues to New Zealand residents. Moreover, if a New Zealand resident makes a direct investment in a country with which we have entered into a DTA, New Zealand tax will generally be reduced by credits for any foreign tax paid. 12 As a result, the effective tax rate New Zealand imposes on foreign-sourced income can be lower than the rate applied to domestic-sourced income. c) New Zealand taxes residents only on their New Zealand-sourced income and non-residents Applying the same rate of tax to both residents’ and non residents’ New Zealand income is referred to as the source basis for income taxation. Under the source basis taxation system, all income earned in New Zealand by both residents and non-residents would be fully taxed. The source basis of taxation has the apparent advantage of seeming to be “fairer” than a residence basis. Under the residence basis New Zealand investors would be fully taxed on their domestic and foreign income whereas competing non-resident investors would be exempt from New Zealand tax even on New Zealand investments. However, such a conclusion loses its strength if the burden of any tax New Zealand levies on non-residents is in fact merely shifted on to New Zealand residents. Can non-residents shift the burden of New Zealand taxes? Again, the example begins with the world rate of return equal to 10% and a foreign investor having $1,000 to invest in any offshore country including New Zealand. The return is, however, taxed by New Zealand at say 33%. International capital markets will endeavour to respond to the imposition of such a tax. Investors with liquid funds can either transfer their funds to a country other than New Zealand where they can earn the required 10% post-tax rate of return or demand higher returns from New Zealand to compensate for the effect of its taxes on non-residents. 13 Returning to the earlier example, the initial impact of New Zealand’s taxation of non- residents will be to reduce returns to non-residents from $100 pre-tax to $67 post-tax. Because investors can earn $100 elsewhere, in these circumstances they will require $150 pre-tax to continue to invest in this country. Therefore, pre-tax returns increase by 50% to $150. Because of the operation of financial markets, interest rates in New Zealand would also rise to match the new level. This means that all New Zealand borrowers must pay $150 instead of $100 to borrow $1,000 from any potential investor be they domestic or non-resident. This means that the cost of capital in New Zealand increases, slowing economic growth. Care therefore has to be taken with the practical application of the source taxation method. To the extent that non- residents can shift the burden of New Zealand taxes back onto New Zealand businesses by covering the cost of any New Zealand taxes paid in the price they charge for the funds, taxing non-residents adds to New Zealand business costs and will not improve New Zealand’s competitiveness. If taxing non-residents leads to a higher domestic cost of capital, New Zealand firms will need to reduce their costs, including potentially the real wages of their workers so that they can pay the higher cost of capital and remain internationally competitive in product markets. Taxing non-residents could therefore prove self-defeating for New Zealand businesses to the extent that it merely led to a rise in the domestic cost of capital. It follows therefore that an issue for international tax policy consideration is to assess to what extent taxes on non-residents impact on the domestic cost of capital. 2.7 The problem of double taxation In the above examples, other countries do not tax income. In practice this generally does not occur. The analysis is now extended to reflect the impacts of such taxes. When other countries tax cross-border income, the potential for juridical double taxation arises. Juridical double taxation occurs when both the country where income is earned and the country where the investor resides tax the same income. If there are no foreign taxes, taxing New Zealanders’ domestic income while exempting New Zealanders’ offshore income from tax will drive investment offshore (the section above on the source of capital discussed this point). To see how foreign taxes alter this conclusion, consider the case of a world (including New Zealand) where there are no taxes. Assume a New Zealander has $1000 to invest in three countries: New Zealand and two other countries, A and B. The interest rates in each country are as follows. CASE 1 Country A Country B New Zealand (zero tax)(zero tax)(zero tax) Pre-tax Return 11%9%10% In this case, the New Zealander investor would invest in country A, because that is where they can earn the highest return (the investor’s choice is in bold). Now consider what happens if Country A imposes a tax of, say, 20%, on all foreigners, including New Zealanders, investing there. The investor now earns the following rates of return: CASE 2 Country ACountry BNew Zealand (20% tax)(zero tax)(zero tax) Returns after Foreign Tax8.8%9% 10% 14 In this case, the New Zealander would rather invest in New Zealand than in Country A or Country B. Case 2 provides the benchmark from which to judge the imposition of taxes by New Zealand. If New Zealand had no taxes it would not try to offset the foreign tax with a subsidy to encourage New Zealanders to invest in Country A. Theoretically therefore the same result should apply when New Zealand taxes domestic and foreign-sourced income. Now consider the case where New Zealand imposes a 33% tax rate on New Zealanders' domestic-sourced income, while their foreign-sourced income remains untaxed. In this case, the incentives facing the New Zealand resident investor again change. They would now prefer to invest in Country B than in either New Zealand or Country A. CASE 3 Country A Country B New Zealand (20% tax) (zero tax)(33% tax) Returns after Tax 8.8% 9% 6.7% However, from New Zealand’s point of view the investment choices made in Case 2 remain preferable: the investor should invest in New Zealand, because that is where the overall return to New Zealand is highest. New Zealand can restore the benchmark result in Case 2 by taxing its residents’ foreign-sourced income in addition to any taxes imposed by foreign governments. If it does so, the investor faces the following returns: CASE 4 Country ACountry B New Zealand (20% tax) (zero tax) (33% NZ tax)(33% NZ tax)(33% NZ tax) Returns after Tax5.8% 6% 6.7% In practice, however, a deduction system along these lines cannot be applied. There are a number of reasons for this including the costs that such an approach would add to the New Zealand economy. Our DTAs require New Zealand to adopt either an exemption or foreign tax credit approach. Under an exemption approach foreign-sourced income is exempt from New Zealand taxes. Whereas, under the foreign tax credit approach, New Zealand gives a credit for foreign taxes paid by its residents on their foreign-sourced income. Further, there is a concern that other countries would strongly object to a system that would be seen by them as a deliberate effort by New Zealand to place an extra tax cost on businesses investing in their country, thus deterring investment in their economy. In addition, as a rule those involved in business activity do not regard tax cost as the same in character as other business costs. The business proprietor has no control over taxes. Intuitively therefore in principle, the general reaction would be that it is wrong to impose a layer of New Zealand tax on top of a layer of tax already paid overseas. the deduction approach would be seen by most people as imposing an unfair tax burden on New Zealanders investing offshore. In line with this theoretical discussion though, this “double layer” of tax argument could be looked at another way. Namely, to the extent that taxes on non-residents adds to the domestic cost of capital, other countries that apply such taxes will give a compensatory lift in returns to non-residents, including New Zealanders, that invest in their country to compensate them for their tax charge. This is illustrated by expanding on the above example. CASE 5 Country ACountry B New Zealand (20% tax) (zero tax) (33% NZ tax) (33% NZ tax) (33% NZ tax) Returns after Tax 7.4% 6% 6.7% 15 Therefore, while New Zealanders investing offshore may legally pay taxes to two countries, they may only bear the economic incidence of the New Zealand tax. In economic terms, they only pay one layer of tax. Second, if the pre-tax returns do not rise to offset the tax on non-resident investors, the foreign tax penalises New Zealand by reducing the overall returns to New Zealand from offshore investment. But there is nothing New Zealand can do to avoid that penalty. Lowering the tax rate applied to foreign-sourced income merely shifts the burden onto other New Zealanders. 2.8 The Role of Tax Treaties and Tax Administration Considerations There are considerations arising for the tax administration and in the negotiation of double taxation agreements with other competent authorities that must be considered in any tax policy developments. We must consider how other jurisdictions will view our actions. As explained earlier in this document, New Zealand taxes residents on their worldwide income, and, since the early 1960’s, has allowed a credit both unilaterally and in terms of tax treaties for foreign income tax paid on any foreign income derived by a resident. The tax credit is limited to the amount of the New Zealand tax that would otherwise be payable. The effect is the resident pays the higher of the two countries’ rates. Under the twenty four tax treaties we have with foreign countries our residents receive certain benefits. The major benefit that they receive is certainty of tax treatment in the foreign country, i.e., the treatment guaranteed by treaties which follow international norms. More specifically, they commonly receive the following benefits: • exemption of foreign tax on foreign profits not attributable to a branch in the foreign country. • reduced or nil rates on investment income earned in the foreign country. • a guarantee of tax credits in New Zealand for any foreign tax paid in accordance with the treaty. • procedures for corresponding adjustments in one country when transfer pricing adjustments are made in the other In other words, if one country increases the returned profit of one affiliate, the other country may reduce the profits of the other affiliate). • mutual agreement procedures between the tax authorities to deal with other cases of difficulties which might arise an render the taxpayer liable to double taxation. Examples are the clashing of residence rules and the clashing of source rules (For example, both countries may under their domestic tax laws treat a taxpayer as a resident and seek to tax that taxpayer on their worldwide income.). • some protection against changes in legislation in the foreign country (where such legislation is contrary to the provisions of the treaty, the treaty normally prevails). In contrast to residents, non-residents are taxed on New Zealand source income only. Full New Zealand tax rates are levied on net business income according to normal deductibility concepts. Lower rates are levied on investment income (dividends, interest and royalties) but the lower rates are applied to gross income with no deduction of expenses. The underlying concept under our tax treaties is to reduce tax rates on non-residents on a reciprocal basis within the protection of a treaty and thus leave tax havens out in the cold. From the point of view of the tax authorities the tax treaties have a number of benefits. The major one is the ability to obtain information from the other country. This is of crucial importance for our Inland Revenue Department in combating avoidance and evasion. The overall policy direction for New Zealand over the last 20 years has been to follow the OECD recommendations to use such treaties to remove obstacles to the flow of capital and people, and to combat international evasion/avoidance through the exchange of information. In practical terms that means that we have reduced our tax rates on non-resident within the protection of a tax treaty while at the same time obtaining reciprocal benefits for New Zealand residents in relation to their tax exposure in those other countries. Benefits are granted to taxpayers on whom information and verification can be obtained in line with the exchange of information provisions of the treaty. By reducing domestic rates within the protection of treaties this has helped to combat international evasion and avoidance. 16 2.9 The relationship between domestic and international tax The above discussion indicates that there is no one simple system for taxing cross border income flows that meets all objectives. Either system, that is, source or residence taxing, has advantages and disadvantages. The effect of not taxing residents on their worldwide income and the way taxes on non-residents can influence the relative rates of return between domestic and foreign-sourced income means that there is a connection between the two arms of international tax policy. The aim of the Government must be to equalise as far as possible the rate of return on imported and exported capital by levying an appropriate net tax on income flowing from both sources. The basic logic underlying this approach is as follows: 1. New Zealand taxes should not affect residents' decisions between investing locally or offshore, provided New Zealand applies the same tax treatment to both their domestic and offshore sources of income; 2. when New Zealand taxes the foreign-sourced income of New Zealanders at lower rates than domestic-sourced income, New Zealanders receive an implicit increase in the after-tax return on their offshore investments. 3. taxing non-residents can offset this implicit increase in the return, since it raises pre-tax rates of return in New Zealand relative to offshore and provides a further implicit incentive to invest onshore. For the purposes of this discussion, we refer to this link between the taxes imposed on residents and non-residents as the "see-saw" relationship. In purely theoretical terms, the "see-saw" relationship would require the aggregate tax rate on cross-border income flows to sum to around the New Zealand corporate tax rate. Theoretically, under the "see-saw" the choice appears to be between explicitly double taxing residents on their foreign-sourced income or imposing a hidden additional cost through a higher domestic cost of capital. In practice the link is not so definite. The “See-saw” Relationship In its simplest form, the "see-saw" relationship arises because to the extent that taxes on non-residents are recovered by the non-resident from the New Zealand business, they in effect raise the rates of return in New Zealand relative to the world non-taxed rate of return. Further, if New Zealanders are taxed more lightly on their offshore investments than on their domestic investments, then the tax system encourages them to invest offshore. Taxing non-residents can offset this bias by this increase in the rate of return, thereby making New Zealand a more relatively attractive location for residents to invest. Implementing a pure application of the see-saw relationship would impose other costs on New Zealand if it raises the domestic cost of capital facing businesses already producing and investing in New Zealand. The choice of tax rate on non-residents involves therefore a complex trade-off that takes into account and balances all these factors. If New Zealand applied the deduction approach while other countries applied the exemption and credit approaches, New Zealand resident international investors would be competitively disadvantaged vis-à-vis their foreign rivals. The situation would be akin to New Zealand exporters that have to compete against subsidised producers from other countries. There is nothing New Zealand can do to remove either implied or direct subsidies given by other countries. Offering competing subsidies to New Zealand exporters and offshore investors only serves to make New Zealand worse-off by making it more attractive for New Zealanders to invest offshore. Applying the same tax treatment to foreign-sourced income as other countries maintains the competitiveness of New Zealand based international investors, but potentially at the expense of the competitiveness of the New Zealand economy. In practical terms, the realistic option for the Government is to have some combination of taxes on both residents and non-residents. 17 2.10 Foreign tax credits received by non-residents When non-resident investors receive full credits for taxes paid in New Zealand, each dollar of New Zealand tax is fully offset by a reduction in home country taxes. The non-resident’s tax bill remains constant. Taxing non-residents in these situations transfers revenue from the foreign country to New Zealand. Under these circumstances, New Zealand is able to raise tax revenue without deterring foreign investors and without increasing domestic interest rates or the domestic cost of capital. If all non-residents are taxed currently by their home country and receive credits for New Zealand taxes, then the best policy for New Zealand would be to tax non-residents at least up to the level of those credits. If non-residents received tax credits in their own country of residence for foreign-sourced income they earn through their New Zealand operations, New Zealand should also tax those earnings. However, most countries do not currently tax income earned by a New Zealand subsidiary, so New Zealand does not get “free” revenue from applying the company tax, even though those earnings may be eventually taxed by the home country, with a credit for New Zealand taxes, when the income is distributed via dividends. The value of the deferred tax credit reduces the cost of the New Zealand tax, but does not offset it completely. Most countries do not provide full credits for taxes paid overseas or restrict when their credits can be used. To the extent that these limitations cause a double tax effect to arise, the advantages gained from taxing non-residents can be reduced. 2.11 OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS 2.11.1 Compliance and administrative costs In the course of designing or evaluating an international tax regime, it is also important to incorporate the Government policy of minimising compliance costs, both the costs taxpayers incur when complying with their obligations under the regime and the costs that the Government incurs with the administration of the regime. It is important to note, however, that there is a further trade-off in the compliance costs area. Simply put, the trade-off is between accuracy and simplicity. Improving the accuracy with which the income tax regime measures cross-border income flows or reduces the scope for tax planning opportunities tends to increase the compliance and administrative costs arising from the international tax regime. Balancing these trade-offs is not straightforward. For instance, the company tax regime is of necessity more complex than the source deduction system on wages. For the first regime, full accrual accounting records with their supporting administration and analysis must be maintained. For the second regime, a more straightforward calculation to determine a specific deduction from a cash payment must be made. The additional work involved imposes higher compliance costs than the PAYE system, but the company regime is a key “backstop” to the effectiveness of the PAYE regime. Without the company regime, it would be very attractive for taxpayers to convert wage and salary income into company income and remain untaxed on that income until it is distributed to the ultimate shareholders. It would also be attractive for them to defer investment income taxation through the same mechanism. Similarly, taxes on the foreign-sourced income of residents are a key "backstop" for the domestic income tax regime. They may be more costly to enforce and comply with than domestic taxes, but the regime plays an important role in protecting the integrity of the whole tax system as it applies to New Zealanders. For the Government, considerable weight is given to compliance costs in the design of the policy and its day to day operation. 2.11.2 Minimising tax planning opportunities Some taxpayers develop complex arrangements to reduce their tax liabilities in a jurisdiction by exploiting differences in tax treatments across countries and different forms of income, by recharacterising in legal terms the source of their income, its type, or their place of residence. Such activities can impose additional "deadweight costs" on New Zealand as a whole by: • encouraging taxpayers to use resources to design legal and financial structures to reduce New Zealand tax. Such expenditure is socially wasteful as it is directed at "gaining a larger share of the pie" rather than at "making the pie larger"; 18 • encouraging poor investment decisions by artificially altering the after-tax rates of return to alternative investments; and • requiring the Government to impose costs on business by the complexity of the measures needed to address this activity and the higher rates of tax needed to raise the same amount of revenue (ie., to make up for the resultant erosion of the tax base). Tax planning can best be countered by ensuring that, as far as practical, tax is levied on a broad income tax base at low rates. This broad base, low rate approach is reflected in the Government’s international and domestic tax reform programme. New Zealand can tax non-residents only on income sourced in this country. The non-resident base is best protected by, as far as practical: • applying uniform rates of tax on different forms of New Zealand income; and • having clear and robust rules determining when income is sourced in New Zealand. The measures canvassed in this document relating to foreign direct investment, transfer pricing and thin capitalisation aim to meet these objectives. 2.11.3 Multinationals and International Tax As discussed above, applying the residence principle (that is levying equal tax on both the domestic and offshore income of New Zealand residents) reduces any tax incentives to invest offshore and protects the tax base. Strictly, this principle applies to New Zealand resident companies only to the extent they have New Zealand resident shareholders. Application of this principle to a New Zealand resident company owned fully or partially by non-residents would mean those non-residents are subject to New Zealand tax on their foreign income. This can make New Zealand an unattractive base for offshore investment by multinationals. Consideration needs to be given to whether this problem can be ameliorated without reintroducing artificial incentives for New Zealand shareholders to invest offshore and without exposing the tax base to avoidance problems. 2.11.4 Policy sustainability Investments are, by their nature, a "forward-looking" activity and once initiated they are often costly to reverse. Investment thrives in a world where the rules are understood and permanent. Tax changes that can be reversed at a later stage after investments have been made would be unwelcome. These concerns tend to be of greater importance to foreign investors who often feel more exposed to changes in policy. To avoid deterring investment, it is important to have broad community support for major tax rules so that they are seen as sustainable in the future. To engender this support, the Government intends to consult widely before deciding on the direction and nature of policy initiatives. In addition, adopting reforms based on a consistent framework will build credibility over time. It is therefore very important that individual reforms to the international regime are consistent with an overall economic and policy framework for international tax policy and that the long-term direction of policy be signalled clearly and adhered to over time. 2.12 Conclusion In the course of gathering revenue, the income tax regime has a number of effects on economic behaviour. Of particular concern is the ability of a poorly designed income tax system to: • deter foreign investment and the associated benefits of new capital, skills and technology it embodies; • increase the domestic cost of capital for New Zealand firms, thereby reducing their international competitiveness; 19 • encourage patterns of foreign and domestic investment that do not make the most efficient use of New Zealand's resources; and • make New Zealand an unattractive base for foreign multinationals to invest offshore. In principle, the international tax regime should be designed in such a manner as to reduce these "deadweight costs". However, the process of designing a practical international tax regime that meets the Government's economic policy objectives and international obligations is a complex process involving numerous trade-offs between various objectives. Theoretically, the broad features that the international tax regime should possess to be consistent with the Government's economic policy objectives are in particular: • the effective tax rates applying to the New Zealand-sourced income of non-residents should be as uniform as possible across alternative investments; and • the effective rates of tax applying to the foreign-sourced income of residents should be as uniform as possible across investments. In both cases, this requires accurate measurement of income and uniform statutory tax rates on each type of income. The rates of New Zealand taxes imposed on inward and outward investment need to reflect the desirability of minimising the cost of capital to New Zealand and encouraging investment into New Zealand. So far as possible the rate structure should not provide an incentive for New Zealanders to invest offshore rather than here. The “see-saw” relationship is a theoretical framework for considering this issue. However, tax rules on investment flows also need to be practical and fair. Consideration also needs to be given to: • minimising opportunities for tax planning; • the compliance and administrative costs of the regime. Reducing such costs inevitably involves some sort of trade- off between the accuracy of income measurement and the simplicity of the regime; • ensuring the regime is sustainable in the longer term and sends clear signals to potential foreign investors about New Zealand tax structures; noting that a well designed regime will leave business investment decisions the same as they would be in the absence of New Zealand taxes. 2 0 3. The Current Tax Regime A description and assessment of the current regime in the light of the general discussion in Chapter 2 Summary Residents: • shareholders of New Zealand companies are taxed at their New Zealand rate with a credit for New Zealand taxes and a deduction only for foreign taxes; • income received directly from offshore is taxed at the relevant tax rates (usually 33%) with a credit for foreign taxes; • a dividend received by a New Zealand company is subject to Foreign Dividend Withholding Payment (FDWP) at 33%, with a credit for foreign Non-resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) and with a credit for underlying foreign company taxes if the New Zealand company owns at least 10% of the foreign company; • income accrued within most forms of foreign entities is taxed on a current accrual basis with a credit for foreign taxes, unless the entity is resident in a "grey list" country in which case it is exempt from New Zealand tax on accrual. Non-Residents: • debt investment is generally subject to either NRWT or AIL; • portfolio equity investment is subject to company tax and NRWT; • direct equity investment through a branch is subject to 38% branch company tax; • direct equity investment through a subsidiary is subject to company tax and NRWT. 3.1 Current tax treatment of foreign-sourced income of New Zealand residents 3.1.1 The general principle - New Zealand residents pay tax on their world wide income In principle, New Zealand residents are taxed on their world-wide income; that is, the income they derive from all foreign sources as well as the income that they derive from New Zealand. However, as explained below, credits are offered for taxes paid overseas. New Zealand residents can engage in a wide range of economic activities offshore, directly or indirectly, through various mechanisms such as companies, partnerships and trusts. 3.1.2 Credits for taxes paid overseas The amount of New Zealand tax collected from the foreign-sourced income of residents can vary greatly depending on the extent to which New Zealand grants the taxpayer a credit for taxes paid overseas to a foreign jurisdiction. 21 3.1.3 Income from foreign "portfolio" investment and distributions Resident individuals or companies can receive distributions of income from offshore in a number of different forms, including: • interest paid by a non-resident borrower; • dividends paid by a non-resident company; • royalties paid by a non-resident; • payments for services performed offshore; and • business income derived from an offshore branch. Income earned by a New Zealand resident individual from foreign portfolio investments, such as interest, dividends and royalties, is subject to the resident’s personal New Zealand tax rate, less a credit for foreign taxes paid by the individual (these are usually withholding taxes imposed by foreign governments). The same types of income, other than dividends, earned by a New Zealand company are also taxed at 33% less a credit for foreign taxes paid by the New Zealand company. A dividend received by a New Zealand company is subject to FDWP of 33%, less a credit for foreign taxes paid by the New Zealand company. If the New Zealand company owns at least 10% of the foreign company paying the dividend, the New Zealand company may credit against its FDWP liability a proportionate share of the foreign company taxes borne by the foreign company which pays the dividend. 3.1.4 Income earned from investment in foreign companies The CFC regime applies to investment in foreign companies controlled by the New Zealand shareholders. Broadly, that is the case where five or fewer residents own more than 50% of the foreign company or, in specified circumstances, where a single person owns 40% or more of the company. The FIF regime applies when the CFC regime does not apply; that is, it applies to investment in foreign superannuation schemes, foreign life insurance policies and foreign companies that are not controlled by New Zealand shareholders. Resident shareholders are allowed a credit for foreign withholding taxes paid by them. Additionally, under the CFC regime and in certain circumstances under the FIF regime, the resident shareholders are allowed a credit for the underlying foreign taxes paid by the foreign company that is earning the income on their behalf. In other circumstances, the FIF regime gives only a deduction for the foreign taxes. The main exception to this treatment is the “grey list” exemption. If the foreign company is resident in a grey list country, neither the CFC nor the FIF regimes apply (unless the foreign company is subject to a low foreign tax rate due to a designated concession listed in the 16th Schedule to the Act). Since New Zealand offers a credit for taxes paid to overseas countries, it is likely that little revenue, if any, would be collected by New Zealand from businesses operating in countries that apply taxes equal to or greater than those imposed under the CFC regime. Accordingly, to reduce unnecessary compliance costs, companies operating in grey list countries are exempted from the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) and Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regimes. The tax regimes in overseas jurisdictions vary enormously. Certain countries have robust tax rules while others do not. A list of countries that meet certain robustness criteria are listed in the 15th Schedule to the Act and are referred to as the "grey list" countries. The list of countries included on the grey list is reviewed annually. As would be expected, given the benefit that inclusion confers, the criteria for inclusion on the grey list are rigorous. There are currently six countries on the grey list (Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Germany and Japan). As a general rule, tax levied in a grey list country should equate to the level of New Zealand tax that would be payable if that income was sourced entirely from New Zealand. The grey list and the availability of tax credits mean that 2 2 New Zealand residents might pay nil New Zealand tax on profits earned overseas. At most, the payment of New Zealand tax on overseas earnings is no more than the corporate rate; that is, 33%. The Government announced its policy on the “grey list” in the 1992 Budget. Under that policy, each year the schedule of countries on the “grey list” will be reviewed as part of the Budget consideration process. As other countries meet the criteria for inclusion laid out in the 1992 Budget documentation, they will be added to the “grey list”. Apart from this, the Government considers the current “grey list” criteria as settled. As explained above, this exemption is given to save taxpayer compliance costs. It is presumed that companies resident in these countries pay foreign taxes sufficient to generate foreign tax credits that would offset all of the New Zealand tax otherwise due under the CFC or FIF regimes. If the grey list exemption applies, the income will be taxed upon distribution to the shareholder rather than when it is earned. The grey list exemption applies to 70-80% of New Zealand’s foreign direct investment income. If a taxpayer is subject to the CFC or FIF regimes on income earned through investment in a foreign entity, mechanisms are used to prevent the double application of New Zealand tax on the income when distributed to the shareholder. This means that income distributed to a shareholder is subject to total New Zealand tax equal to the shareholder’s total tax rate. However, the mechanism does not apply to foreign taxes and therefore shareholders are effectively given a deduction for foreign taxes. In essence, foreign tax credits given for CFC, FIF or FDWP imposts are ‘clawed back’ at the shareholder level. 3.1.5 Income earned from trusts Income derived by a trustee of a trust in any income year is either 'trustee income' or 'beneficiary income'. Beneficiary income is that part of income that vests in or is distributed to a beneficiary in the year that it is derived by a trustee or within six months after the end of the year. A resident beneficiary can be taxed on beneficiary income and certain other distributions from trusts with foreign connections. Trustee income of a trust that has a resident settlor at any time in an income year is taxable in New Zealand, even where the trustees are non-resident and the income has a foreign source. In the latter case, the resident settlor will be liable for the tax as agent for non-resident trustees. Taxable distributions can be made by foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts. A foreign trust is a trust in which no settlor has been a resident of New Zealand from 17 December 1987 (or when the trust was first settled, if later) to the time that the distribution is made. A non-qualifying trust is a trust which, at the time of a distribution, is neither a qualifying nor a foreign trust.2 3.1.6 Provision of credits for foreign taxes New Zealand provides foreign tax credits both unilaterally and through its Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with other countries. The objective of foreign tax credits is to avoid double taxation of the foreign-sourced income of residents. If a resident derives foreign-sourced income and that income is subjected to foreign tax, New Zealand provides the resident with a foreign tax credit. Calculating the foreign tax credit involves two steps: 1. determining, in accordance with s.293(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act)3, the foreign income tax borne by the New Zealand resident; and 2 A qualifying trust is generally a trust that has always been subject to New Zealand tax from the time it has been settled. 3 This document refers to the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976, rather than to the recently passed Income Tax Act 1994, which will come into force on 1 April 1995. 23 2. determining, in accordance with s.306(2) of the Act, the New Zealand tax that would have been payable on the foreign-sourced income if no foreign tax had been paid. This is the foreign tax credit limit. (The method of calculating the foreign tax limit is shown below.) The foreign tax credit allowed is the lesser of the foreign tax borne by the New Zealand resident and the foreign tax credit limit. 3.1.7 Foreign tax credit gross-up If income is received net of foreign tax (for example, interest subject to foreign NRWT), then the income must be grossed-up by adding the amount of the foreign tax before determining the New Zealand tax. 3.1.8 Calculating the foreign tax credit limit The foreign tax credit limit is calculated by multiplying the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the taxpayer's world- wide income (determined after the gross-up and before the foreign tax credit) by the ratio of the foreign-sourced income subject to the foreign tax to the total assessable income of the taxpayer. Foreign Sourced Income Foreign Tax Credit Limit = New Zealand Tax X --------------------------------- Total Assessable Income 3.2 Current tax treatment of non-residents - general comments Non-residents can engage in a wide range of economic activities in New Zealand, directly or indirectly, through various mechanisms including companies, partnerships and trusts. There are considerable differences - from 1.34% to 53% at the extreme ends of the range- in the rates of New Zealand tax applied to the income derived from these economic activities. These differences arise not only because of differences in the statutory rates of tax that New Zealand applies to different forms of income (that is, interest or profit), but also from differences in the tax treatment of different entities and in the tax treatment of non-residents in different countries. 3.3 Taxation of income to non-residents from "portfolio” investment 3.3.1 Equity investment There are two distinct layers of New Zealand tax that can be imposed on the income that non-residents derive from equity invested in a New Zealand company: • the New Zealand company pays 33% company tax on the profit made in New Zealand; and • NRWT is applied to any dividends distributed offshore to the non-resident. Dividends paid by a company, unlike interest, are not deductible in determining its New Zealand tax liability. Therefore, the income that non-residents derive from equity investments in New Zealand can be subject to both the rate of company tax when that income is derived by a New Zealand company in which they have invested and the rate of NRWT when that income is distributed in the form of dividends. A New Zealand resident shareholder in a New Zealand company receives credit for company tax through the imputation system. For non-resident portfolio shareholders, partial relief for double taxation is provided through the foreign investor tax credit described below. 3.3.1.1 NRWT on dividends The rate of NRWT applying to dividend income is 30%, except where the non-resident resides in a country with which New Zealand has negotiated a DTA. 24 The usual rate of NRWT on dividends set by DTAs is 15%.4 This means that, except where the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) applies, the overall combined statutory tax rate on non-resident equity investment in New Zealand is 53% in cases where the 30% NRWT rate applies and 43% in cases where the 15% DTA NRWT rate applies.5 The amount of NRWT on dividends is reduced, however, by credits for foreign dividend withholding payments levied on foreign-sourced dividends derived by New Zealand resident companies. 3.3.1.2 Foreign investor tax credit The FITC regime, enacted in September 1993 (s.308A), provides a credit of company tax to non-resident portfolio investors. The FITC is calculated as 0.5583 of the imputation credits attached to the dividends paid to non-resident portfolio investors (defined as non-resident shareholders owning a voting interest of less than 10% in the company). The credit is paid to companies, which are required to pass it on to eligible non-resident shareholders through the payment of a supplementary dividend. With the FITC, the total New Zealand tax on non-resident portfolio investment in New Zealand is the standard New Zealand company tax rate of 33% when the DTA 15% NRWT on dividends applies and 45% when the dividend is paid to an investor from a country which does not benefit from a DTA and the statutory 30% NRWT on dividends applies. 3.3.1.3 Taxation of income from "direct" investment Non-residents can engage in direct investment in New Zealand either through a branch (that is, an unincorporated "fixed establishment"), or a subsidiary (that is, an incorporated "fixed establishment"). 3.3.1.3.1 Branch investment One common investment option for non-residents is to establish a branch of their business operations in New Zealand. For example, a non-resident individual can operate a branch factory in New Zealand. Similarly, a non-resident company can establish an office in New Zealand to administer its operations here. Distributions from a branch to its head office are not separately taxed because no payment to another separate legal entity is made. For this reason, branches are subject to a 38% company tax rate instead of 33%. 3.3.1.3.2 Subsidiary investment Another common form of non-resident investment is the establishment by the foreign company of a subsidiary in New Zealand. New Zealand tax law does not "look through" a company to its shareholders to determine where a company is resident. A subsidiary of a non-resident company is treated as a New Zealand resident and taxed by New Zealand on its world- wide income if: • the subsidiary company is incorporated in New Zealand; or • it has its head office in New Zealand; or • it has its centre of management in New Zealand; or • control of the company by its directors is exercised in New Zealand. In addition, interest or dividends paid from a New Zealand-resident subsidiary to its offshore parent would generally be New Zealand-sourced income derived by the parent and subject to the tax treatment discussed in this Chapter. 3.3.1.3.3 Summary 4 The exceptions are the Indian DTA that reduces NRWT on dividends to 20% and the Philippines DTA that reduces it to 15% if the shareholder is a company or 25% if the shareholder is not a company. 5 In the remainder of this Chapter, tax rates refer to combined statutory (rather than effective) tax rates unless otherwise indicated. 25 Currently, the FITC does not apply to direct investment, although this document proposes that it should apply in future. Company tax is only one of the levels of tax imposed on the income that non-residents derive from direct investment in New Zealand. As distributions are also often taxed, the tax on the distribution must be considered as well. The combined effects of the company tax and tax on distributions of interest and dividends are summarised in the following table.

Tax Rate1% 10% 33% 43% 3.3.2 Debt investment Generally, interest income derived by a non-resident from debt investment in New Zealand will be deemed to have a New Zealand source and therefore be subject to NRWT in cases where a non-resident12: • lends money in New Zealand (s.243(2)(l) of the Act; • lends money outside of New Zealand to a resident, except where the resident uses the money for the purposes of a business carried on outside New Zealand through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand (s.243(2)(m)(i)); or • lends money outside of New Zealand to a non-resident, if the money is used for the purposes of a business carried on in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s.243(2)(m)(ii)). The rate of NRWT applying to such interest income is 15%,13 except: • where the non-resident resides in a country with which New Zealand has negotiated a DTA. Most of New Zealand’s DTAs restrict, to 10% of the gross amount of the interest,14 the rate of NRWT that New Zealand can apply to the interest income earned by a non-resident; or 6 Because interest is deductible in determining company tax, there is no net company tax imposed on profits distributed as interest. 7 33% company tax less FITC credit which amounts to approximately 12% of distributed profits. 8 2% AIL less the effect from 0.66% company tax deduction for net 1.34% effective cost of AIL. 9 Presumes 10% NRWT rate on interest applies under a DTA as a final tax. AIL not available on distribution to direct investor (associated person). When the 10% NRWT is not a final tax, the effective tax rate on debt supplied by direct investors will exceed 10%. 10 15% NRWT on the dividend and supplementary dividend which together amount to $79 in this example. 15% DTA NRWT rate presumed to apply, otherwise 30% statutory NRWT rate may apply (or alternative DTA rate). 11 15% of $67 distribution. 15% DTA NRWT rate presumed to apply, otherwise 30% statutory NRWT rate may apply (or alternative DTA rate). 12 NRWT does not apply to interest derived by a non-resident who is engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. Such interest income is subject to ordinary income tax. 13 However, NRWT is a final tax only when the borrower and the issuer are not associated. If they are associated, NRWT represents a minimum tax, subject to DTA restrictions. The remainder of the discussion assumes that the borrower and the lender are not associated. 26 • where the borrower is an "approved issuer" for the purposes of the Approved Issuer Levy (AIL) under Part VIB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. If the borrower is an approved issuer and is not associated with the lender, the rate of NRWT is reduced to zero. An approved issuer must pay a levy of 2% of any interest that is paid to unassociated persons. This levy can be deducted when calculating the borrower’s New Zealand taxable income, so that the effective cost of the levy to a taxable borrower is 1.34% of the interest paid. When a non-resident lends money to a New Zealand company engaging in a business activity that generates assessable income, interest paid on that debt can generally be deducted by the borrower in determining a New Zealand income tax liability. Deductibility means that the interest income of the non-resident investor making a loan to a New Zealand company is not subject to the company tax as well as NRWT. Rather, the total New Zealand impost applying to such interest income is the rate of AIL payable by borrower, or the rate of NRWT imposed on that interest income. 3.4 Conclusion Statutory imposts of New Zealand tax on cross-border income flows are quite disparate, ranging from very high to very low. Residents are generally taxed on foreign-sourced income at the time when it is received by them. They are sometimes taxed on foreign-sourced income on a current basis as it is earned; for example, when the CFC or FIF regimes apply. In some cases, the grey list exemption and foreign tax credits reduce the effective New Zealand tax rate on foreign-sourced income to nil. As a result, the rate of New Zealand tax payable on offshore income can range from 0% to 33%. For non-resident investors, combined statutory imposts range from 1.34% to 43% where a DTA applies and up to 53% otherwise. For treaty investors, some examples of imposts on non-resident investment in New Zealand are: • portfolio debt investment is subject to an effective impost of approximately 1% when AIL applies; • portfolio equity investment is taxed at approximately 33%; • direct debt investment is taxed at approximately 10%; and • direct equity investment is taxed at approximately 43%. Given the wide range of tax rates applying to both arms of international tax policy, significant changes in either area need to be considered in conjunction with the other; for example, significant reductions in the high tax rates on non- residents would have to be considered together with measures to increase uniformity in tax rates and the level of New Zealand tax applied to offshore income of residents. In practice, there are difficulties applying even rates and timing rules for New Zealand tax to cross-border income flows. In each case, the underlying logic of the particular regime covering a particular income flow drives the applicable New Zealand rate. For example, residents who own offshore entities that are not CFCs or FIFs are generally taxed on foreign-sourced income when it is received by them in New Zealand. For CFC and FIF income, the tax is applied to the income as it is earned. Foreign tax credits and the “grey list” can see the New Zealand impost reduced to zero, although those taxpayers will normally be meeting their tax impost in the overseas jurisdiction from which the income comes. 14 Most DTAs provide for 10% NRWT on interest, except those with India, Canada, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, which provide for 15% NRWT on interest and the Japanese DTA, which does not cover interest, so the statutory 15% rate applies. 27 Any changes in these areas were it contemplated would have to be fully integrated taking into account all factors including the final determination as to the extent to which the theoretical considerations outlined in Chapter 2 should be drivers of policy in this area. Submissions are invited on that and other relevant issues raised in this chapter. 28 Part B: Reform Proposals 29 4. Problems With The Existing Rules Measuring Cross-Border Income Summary The ideal foundation for a set of rules for taxing cross-border income would be: • source rules that allow income from each tax base to be measured accurately; • uniform rates of tax applied to each tax base. Current tax rules could be moved closer to this foundation by: • clarifying New Zealand’s source rules, including transfer pricing; and • reducing disparities in the tax rates applying to the different forms of foreign investment. 4.1 Introduction The current tax regime, as outlined in Chapter 3, seeks to levy tax on all three income tax bases on which New Zealand could levy tax: • New Zealand-sourced income of residents; • foreign-sourced income of residents; and • New Zealand-sourced income of non-residents. As discussed in Chapter 2, an important policy issue is the weighting that should be placed on each of these bases so that the tax impost is appropriate given economic efficiency, fairness, practicality and compliance cost concerns and given New Zealand’s international obligations. This is a matter requiring on-going dialogue. A more immediate issue is to ensure that, as far as practical, New Zealand’s existing rules provide a sound foundation for levying whatever is considered to be an appropriate tax impost on each base. The theoretical ideal foundation would be source rules that allow income from each base to be measured accurately and the application of relatively uniform rates of tax on each base. Current tax rules do not measure up to this theoretical ideal. Significant problems are: • a lack of adequate statutory guidance for taxpayers to determine the source of income. Some of these deficiencies are technical, relating to the structure of the legislation. Others are more significant in policy terms; for example, the lack of adequate transfer-pricing rules; • in contrast to the theoretical ideal, current rules can impose highly variable rates of tax within each source base. For example, foreign investment is subject to different tax rates according to whether it is debt or equity financed. This document does not include proposals to change New Zealand's existing tax rules to bring them into line with the theoretical ideal. That would not be practical. However, improvements can be made. The remainder of this Chapter discusses various problems with existing rules. The next Chapter outlines a reform programme to deal with these problems and chapters 6 to 8 canvass details of that reform programme. 31 4.2 Source rules - technical problems The main legislative source rule is found in s.243 of the Act. However, there are a number of other sections covering source issues, including ss. 245, 293 and 307. In addition, the general expenditure deduction provision (s 104) and the existing transfer-pricing provision (s 22), are important to the determination of net New Zealand-sourced income. Technical problems with these rules tend to fall into one of four categories: • insufficient statutory detail on where income is sourced; • lack of explicit apportionment rules; • structural problems regarding whether statutory apportionment rules apply to gross or net income; • practical problems with the determination of source, leading to inconsistent rules and rules that are difficult to apply. While some of these problems may seem to be relatively minor, at least when viewed in isolation, any weaknesses in the basic source rules are likely to flow through into the transfer-pricing rules. General income and expenditure source rules must be the basis upon which transfer-pricing rules are built, because transfer-pricing rules largely focus on the manipulation of prices to alter the source of net income. 4.2.1 Insufficient statutory detail as to where income is sourced. The main statutory provision determining the source of income for New Zealand tax purposes, s.243(2), does not provide a general criterion for defining New Zealand-sourced income. Instead it merely lists some of the more common specific forms of such income. As a result, the section can provide insufficient guidance for determining the source of those forms of income which do not exactly match those listed and which therefore fall within the "catch-all" provision of paragraph (r). In those circumstances, it has been necessary to resort to common law rules to determine source. This can create uncertainty. Problems in the definition of New Zealand-sourced income lead to uncertainties over whether income is foreign-sourced and, if foreign-sourced, from precisely where. The Act has no general definition of foreign-sourced income. It seems to work on the general presumption that income not sourced in New Zealand is foreign-sourced. The exception is dividend income. S 307 specifies that dividends paid by a company resident in a country which has a DTA with New Zealand are deemed to be derived from a source in that country. S 293(3) extends this source rule to dividend income from non- DTA countries. As well as causing general uncertainty about the source of income, the above rules do not integrate well with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules. Those rules limit tax credits to the level of New Zealand tax payable on the income from a specific source on which overseas tax is paid. Thus the absence of general rules determining foreign-sourced income creates problems. 4.2.2 Apportionment issues The general source provision (s.243) implies that some forms of income with more than one source must be apportioned to determine the extent to which they have a New Zealand source. In addition, s.245 explicitly requires business and contract income to be apportioned. S.104 then requires expenditure to be apportioned between that which is used to derive New Zealand-sourced income and that which is not. Despite these apportionment requirements, the legislation does not provide any explicit guidance on either the process or the methodologies that taxpayers should use to apportion their income and expenditure between different countries. This can create problems, not only for non-residents calculating their net New Zealand-sourced income, but also for residents calculating the proportion of their net income that they have derived from each foreign country. A specific apportionment problem arises with expenditure incurred jointly in deriving New Zealand and foreign-sourced income. Joint costs incurred in one country can give rise to assessable income in more than one country. For example, research and development costs incurred by a parent company in one country may increase the profitability of its branches and subsidiaries in other countries. Similarly, head office management expenses incurred in one country can produce assessable income in a number of other countries. One approach to joint cost allocation is to allocate on a marginal cost basis. However, this has some practical limitations. Overall, the joint costing issue in the international 32 arena raises the same basic issues as in the domestic context. Joint costing in this context was considered by the Valabh Committee in their Tax Accounting Issues document. 4.2.3 Structural problems In common with the rest of the income tax legislation, it can be unclear whether forms of income are intended to be expressed in gross or net terms. For example, it is not explicitly stated whether “business income” as used in s.243(2)(a) is intended to be net income (after deduction of expenses) or gross income (with expenses then deducted separately under provisions such as s.104). The Inland Revenue Department interprets s.243(2) as applying exclusively on a gross basis. However, this can raise some other issues. For example, if non-New Zealand expenses are deductible under the normal provisions of the Act there seems to be no explicit requirement for those expenses to have a jurisdictional link with New Zealand. If a deduction is taken under s.104, that jurisdictional link is automatic. But that is not the case with some other deductibility provisions such as s.106(1)(h)(ii) where a jurisdictional links needs to be inferred. Finally, while s.243(2) may best be interpreted as using concepts such as “income” in gross terms, it is schematically clear, though not explicitly stated, that the term “income” when used in reference to the foreign tax credit limit in s.293(2) should be interpreted as net income. Even in this case, there is no statutory guidance on the allocation of expenses in determining overseas net income; for example, whether an appropriate proportion of head office management expenses incurred in New Zealand should be deducted prior to calculating the net income on which foreign tax credits are allowed. A clearer structuring of source rules would provide better guidance for taxpayers and better protection for the tax base. 4.2.4 Practical problems with implementing source rules In principle, the economic source of income is the country in which the value-added activity leading to the generation of income takes place. In general, New Zealand’s source rules tend to follow this notion. However, the fungibility of money makes it difficult to apply the value-added principle to the determination of the source of income generated by debt or equity, The interest source rule in s.243(2)(m) applying to money lent overseas seems in general to follow the value-added principle, but can be difficult to apply in practice. For example, New Zealand’s current rules deem interest on money lent overseas to a person living overseas (but resident in New Zealand for tax purposes) to have a New Zealand source (and thus be within the New Zealand tax net) if the funds are used for a non-business purpose. Clearly such a rule is difficult to administer. New Zealand defines the source of dividend income as the residence of the paying company. This is an arbitrary rule. The global profits of a multi-national enterprise will be derived from the value-added activities in each country in which the company operates, not just the country in which it is tax resident. The dividend source rule is quite different from the interest source rule. This difference is difficult to defend on theoretical grounds, especially since New Zealand moved to an imputation system (as extended by FITC) which reduces the general differences in tax imposts on debt and equity. New Zealand’s dividend source rule, when combined with the basic tax rule that a multi-national company resident in New Zealand is taxable on its worldwide profits irrespective of the ownership of that company, creates specific problems. It means that income which, in economic theory, is sourced overseas (where the value-added activity takes place) is subject to New Zealand company and dividend tax, even though the ultimate owners of the income are overseas resident shareholders. This imposes a tax penalty on multi-national companies operating out of New Zealand. Other countries, such as the USA, have tried to mitigate this sort of problem by reducing tax levied on income derived offshore and then distributed to overseas owners. New Zealand should consider giving relief along similar lines if this can be done with reasonable compliance and administrative costs and without undermining the other desirable core features of New Zealand’s international tax regime. 4.3 Absence of adequate transfer-pricing rules and approved methodologies Another factor that complicates the calculation of net New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income is the absence of adequate transfer-pricing rules incorporating approved transfer-pricing methodologies which multinational enterprises can use to value their transactions between New Zealand and overseas arms of their operations. This creates uncertainty 33 in the calculation of the net New Zealand income statistics and provides opportunities for multinational enterprises to manipulate prices on actual or deemed transactions in order to lower the New Zealand tax payable. This area is now largely governed by s. 22 of the Act. This section empowers the Commissioner to readjust New Zealand income if a business carried on in New Zealand produces less income than the Commissioner might expect and when the business is: • controlled by non-residents; or • carried on by a non-resident company or a company controlled by non-residents or persons who have control of a non-resident company. There are, however, a number of problems with this section, making it deficient as a key part of New Zealand’s source provisions. In particular: • the control tests which must be met before the provision comes into play are limited and therefore can be circumvented; • insufficient guidance is provided about what is, in terms of the section, the appropriate level of net income to be sourced in New Zealand; and • the relationship between s. 22 and other sections of the Act is not clear. Clearer transfer-pricing rules, possibly buttressed by thin-capitalisation measures, would improve taxpayer certainty as well as base maintenance. 4.4 Variability of Tax Rates As outlined in Chapter 3, statutory imposts of New Zealand tax on cross-border income flows are quite disparate. While differences in the level of tax imposed on outbound as opposed to inbound investment can have an economic justification, it is particularly difficult to justify: • direct inbound investment being subject to a statutory rate higher than the rate on domestic investment (33%). Under current rules, the tax rate on repatriated income from direct investment equity investment can be as high as 43% when the normal corporate tax rate plus NRWT on dividends (at the normal DTA tax rate) are combined; • the large differences that exist between the tax rates applying to foreign debt versus equity investment. As outlined in Chapter 3, foreign debt investment can be taxed at rates as low as about 1% whereas foreign equity investment is subject to a statutory rate of at least 33%. The latter feature provides an incentive for foreign investment to be financed with debt rather than equity. The high tax on direct equity investment exacerbates this problem. To the extent that some investors cannot substitute debt for equity, differential taxation of debt and equity will distort the pattern of foreign investment in New Zealand. Reforms to reduce the very high statutory tax on direct foreign investors therefore seem justified. Such a measure would in itself reduce some of the pressure on the debt/equity distinction but further measures to reduce pressure on this boundary should also be considered. 4.5 Conclusion The current statutory rules applying to cross-border income can be improved. This would involve clearer and more detailed rules for determining New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income and apportionment rules for income that has more than one source (where apportionment is allowed) and expenditures incurred in producing both New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income. Such rules should include approved methodologies for determining transfer prices. Reforms along these lines would help both resident and non-resident taxpayers in their attempts to fulfill their obligations to accurately determine their New Zealand tax liabilities and help protect the New Zealand tax base. 34 In addition, a reduction in the variability of tax rates applying to different types of cross-border investment would improve the economic efficiency of current rules. 35 5. Proposed Programme For Reform Summary The Government proposes a reform package consisting of three main, mutually- reinforcing elements: • the extension of the Foreign Investor Tax Credit (FITC) regime to direct investors and, as a consequence, the reduction of the branch profits tax rate to 33%; • new transfer-pricing rules applying to all cross-border transactions, using inter- nationally accepted methodologies and compatible guidelines for the application of New Zealand’s existing source rules; • possibly, thin-capitalisation rules. 5.1 Introduction This Chapter outlines the Government’s proposals for dealing with the problems associated with the international tax regime. 5.2 THE REFORM PACKAGE When the FITC regime was introduced, the Government announced that it would consider the existing rules governing the taxation of direct investment by non-residents. These changes are proposed as part of a package of reforms to New Zealand’s transfer-pricing, source and thin-capitalisation rules. The Government also proposes to implement an extended FITC regime. This package should be seen as a whole rather than as a set of separate proposals. In particular, the Government considers that this package should be a continuation of and consistent with, the previous direction of the reform of international taxation. The proposed transfer-pricing rules and extended FITC regime are part of the strategy of imposing lower, but less variable, effective tax rates on non-residents. Further, the FITC extension for direct investors and the transfer-pricing proposals are mutually reinforcing. The FITC extension will reduce incentives for companies to transfer-price or thinly-capitalise, because New Zealand tax payments will have value to non-resident investors. 5.3 Extension of the FITC regime The Government proposes that the FITC regime be extended to all non-resident shareholders in New Zealand companies. Applying the regime to non-resident direct investors would involve a simple technical amendment, although some additional minor reforms may prove necessary in specialist areas such as life insurance. The FITC is a particularly desirable mechanism for reducing tax-related distortions on cross-border capital flows because it applies only where and to the extent that, New Zealand company tax has actually been paid. This is because the FITC is a portion of the imputation credits attached to the dividend. It is also proposed that the corporate tax rate on the New Zealand branch income of non-resident companies be reduced from 38% to 33%. The extension of the FITC would apply from the date on which amending legislation is enacted, which is expected to be in the second half of 1995. It is proposed that the removal of the branch profits tax would take effect from the start of the 1996-97 income year. 37 5.4 NEW TRANSFER-PRICING RULES It is proposed that new transfer-pricing rules be implemented to improve the measurement of New Zealand-sourced income and to reduce the scope for manipulating cross-border transfer prices. The existing transfer-pricing rules contained in s.22 of the Act do not ensure that New Zealand-sourced profits are properly measured. The proposed regime is intended to be narrowly-focused, while protecting the tax base by being difficult to circumvent. Transfer-pricing rules would require cross-border transactions to be recorded for tax purposes at arm's-length prices. They are intended to properly apportion income between New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income and between New Zealand residents (within the New Zealand tax base) and non-residents (not within the New Zealand tax base). They are therefore a necessary part of New Zealand source and residence rules. Adequate source and residence rules, including transfer-pricing rules, are desirable for ensuring that the aggregate rate of New Zealand tax on income derived by non-residents is applied as accurately as possible. The key elements of the proposed new transfer-pricing rules are that: • the rules would apply to all cross-border transactions in which parties are not dealing with each other at arm’s- length; • the parties to a cross-border transaction would not be required to have a direct relationship such as common ownership; • apportionment rules would apply to deemed transactions between a New Zealand branch and its head office, in order to treat the branch like a separate subsidiary of the head office; • taxpayers would be required to report, for tax return purposes, all cross-border transactions at arm's-length terms; • to ease compliance costs, however, submissions are sought on introducing a presumption that transactions by unrelated parties are at arm’s-length; • the internationally accepted range of arm's-length transfer-pricing methods would apply. These are transaction-based methods (comparable uncontrolled price, resale price, cost plus) and profits-based methods (comparable profits and profit split); • the comparable uncontrolled-price method would be available to taxpayers as a safe-harbour. If taxpayers can apply this measure, the Commissioner could not apply any other method; • outside this safe-harbour, a best method rule would apply to decide the specific method to be used to determine arm’s-length prices in particular cases. Guidance on suitable approaches would be provided by some form of binding determination procedure; • to reduce compliance costs, it is proposed that taxpayers be required to make only a reasonable estimate of an arm’s- length price, rather than be within a statistically acceptable band of arm’s-length prices; and • to increase taxpayer certainty, advance pricing agreements would be available from Inland Revenue as part of the binding rulings regime. The types of transactions to which the proposed rules would apply are those that deplete the New Zealand tax base. They include: • a non-resident’s sale of goods or services to a New Zealand taxpayer for greater than arm's-length consideration; • a New Zealand taxpayer’s sale of goods or services to a non-resident for less than arm's-length consideration. Generally, the regime would not apply to wholly domestic transactions between residents, but if such transactions had an offshore connection resulting in a shift in income from a New Zealand resident to a non-resident, they would have to be subject to the regime, to limit abuse. 38 Like the reforms as a whole, the transfer-pricing regime is a package of measures designed to better measure New Zealand-sourced income and to limit avoidance while keeping compliance costs to a minimum. The elements of the regime should be considered not in isolation, but in terms of their overall effectiveness in meeting these objectives. Submissions are invited on all aspects of the proposed regime, including: • the absence of a de minimus rule. Whether compliance concerns are better met by taking a reasonably flexible approach to calculating the required arm's-length prices; • whether taxpayers should be required to make only a reasonable estimate of an arm's-length price, or to use a price within a specified range produced by an acceptable arm’s-length method; and • the absence of a requirement for a direct relationship such as common ownership between parties to a cross-border transaction, to counter avoidance concerns and whether the breadth of this approach raises concerns about compliance costs and uncertainty that can not be adequately addressed by the introduction of a presumption similar to that referred to above. It is proposed that the new transfer-pricing rules will apply from the start of the 1996-97 income year. 5.5 Improved source rules Detailed guidelines governing the application of the general apportionment provision (s.245) are proposed. These will follow the proposed transfer-pricing regime. Clarification of the source rules and implications of the Valabh committee recommendations regarding apportionment of joint costs should be considered in parallel with the re-write of the Income Tax Act. 5.6 Consideration of thin-capitalisation rules Thin-capitalisation is the name given to the practice whereby a non-resident investor deliberately loads a New Zealand taxpaying entity with debt, so that large interest deductions will be attributed to the New Zealand tax base. This has the effect of reducing the New Zealand taxable income of the non-resident’s New Zealand operations. Like transfer-pricing, thin-capitalisation can be used by non-resident investors to artificially reduce New Zealand tax. Rules to counter thin-capitalisation may be required to act as a backstop to the proposed transfer-pricing regime. The Government has not finally determined whether such rules are absolutely necessary. However, it has determined that, given the context of this discussion, the issue should be thoroughly canvassed. The Government does not want to implement an ineffective package. There is little point in introducing effective transfer-pricing rules if they are defeated in practice by thin-capitalisation. Therefore it has decided that rules to counter this practice should be considered. The Government seeks submissions on this issue and on whether an effective thin-capitalisation regime is feasible and necessary. 5.7 Conclusion The reforms proposed above are an integrated package of measures designed to address particular concerns in the taxation regime as it affects non-resident investment in New Zealand. The key components of this package are: • the extension of the FITC to direct investment; • transfer-pricing and source rules; and • consideration of thin-capitalisation rules. 39 6. Extension Of Tax Credits To Foreign Direct Investment Summary Extending the Foreign Investor Tax Credit (FITC) regime to direct investment will reduce the tax burden on such investment where New Zealand company tax is paid, thereby reducing the cost of capital for New Zealand businesses. The extension will initially cost $60 - $70 million per annum. The branch profits tax will be lowered from 38% to 33% to achieve consistency with the extended FITC regime. 6.1 Introduction This chapter covers: • the objectives of extending the FITC to foreign direct investors; • the fiscal cost of the extension; and • the consequent change to the tax rate applying to branches of non-resident companies. 6.2 Objective of the proposed extension of the FITC regime The FITC is a useful tool for reducing tax-related distortions in cross-border capital flows, consistent with the objectives in Chapter 2. This is because the FITC simultaneously: • reduces the pre-tax rate of return required by foreign investors for them to place their capital in New Zealand; • reduces the differential between the tax rates on foreign and domestic investment in New Zealand; and • applies only where and to the extent that, the company actually pays New Zealand tax. As mentioned in the Overview, at the time of the introduction of the FITC, the Government decided that it should initially apply only to foreign portfolio investors (that is, those owning less than 10% of a company). The Government said it would consider later whether the FITC regime should cover foreign direct investors. The deferral was to allow time for further consideration of the complex economic and taxation issues surrounding foreign direct investment. For example, direct investors are more likely to be able to claim credits for company tax against their home tax liabilities, which could mean that levying both company tax and NRWT in New Zealand does not increase their final tax liabilities. Such investors may also be able to reduce their tax liabilities through measures such as thin-capitalisation and abusive transfer-pricing. The current proposal is to extend the FITC in tandem with the other reforms in this package. Overall, the Government believes that extending the FITC to foreign direct investment now will reduce the total tax burden on such investment. This benefit will flow through to a reduced cost of capital for New Zealand firms, thereby lowering costs to businesses operating in New Zealand and increasing investment and employment. Accordingly, the Government proposes to extend the FITC mechanism to foreign direct investment. This will involve a straightforward amendment to s.308A of the Act to remove references to portfolio investor status. 41 6.3 Compliance costs of the extension Essentially, extending the FITC will have a neutral to positive effect on compliance costs for firms. Firms must already identify foreign investors for the purpose of withholding NRWT and foreign portfolio investors for the purpose of the existing FITC. If this proposal becomes law, firms would no longer have to separately identify direct investor shareholders (by the size of their shareholdings), thus saving that minimal compliance activity. 6.4 Fiscal costs of the extension Extending the FITC would have a direct effect on tax revenue. The estimated additional annual revenue cost would be $60 - $70 million. Most of this reduction would be expected to flow through to businesses by way of reductions in their cost of capital. The resulting additional activity and profits generated from that activity would be expected to generate revenue, although it is not possible to determine the extent of the gain. 6.5 Implications for the branch profits tax For DTA countries, the FITC will give portfolio and direct investors a maximum effective New Zealand tax rate of 33% on underlying company income. This is lower than the tax rate currently applying to branch operations of foreign companies. Extending the FITC to foreign direct investors therefore also requires an adjustment to branch taxation. This is to restore equality in New Zealand taxation - the rationale for the current regime - between: • the maximum rate for non-branch equity investment from DTA countries; and • the single rate for branches. When the FITC was introduced, it did not require any change to branch taxation because the branch structure is a substitute for direct, rather than portfolio, investment. The Government therefore proposes to reduce the rate of tax on the New Zealand branch income of non-resident companies from 38% to 33%, coincident with the extension of the FITC. The estimated annual revenue loss is $5 million. 6.6 Conclusion The Government proposes to: • extend the FITC to cover all foreign investors; and • correspondingly, reduce the tax rate on branch profits of non-resident companies from 38% to 33%. This reform will involve simple technical changes to existing legislation, with minimal, if any, effects on compliance costs. It will benefit the New Zealand economy by increasing the attractiveness of New Zealand to foreign investors and reducing the cost of capital to New Zealand firms. This regime is consistent with the trend over the past decade toward eliminating differential tax treatments that are based on the type of investment or the nature of the investor. The FITC mechanism also recognises that New Zealand is a small open economy, drawing on and investing in, a global economy. Any distortions the tax system introduces into interactions between New Zealand and the global economy can significantly affect New Zealand's overall economic performance. The extension of the FITC regime would apply from the date on which amending legislation is enacted, which is expected to be in the second half of 1995. It is proposed that the removal of the branch profits tax would take effect from the start of the 1996-97 income year. 42 7. Proposed New Transfer-Pricing And Source Rules Summary These reforms are aimed at improving the measurement of income by source and deterring taxpayers from manipulating transaction prices to decrease their taxes. The proposed transfer-pricing rules will apply to: • cross-border non-arm’s-length transactions that deplete New Zealand’s tax base; • domestic arrangements that are part of a broader agreement involving non- residents; • individuals and companies. To further the Government's objective of minimising compliance costs, it is proposed at this stage to: • require taxpayers to make only a reasonable estimate of an arm’s-length price; • include a presumption that unrelated parties transact at arm’s-length prices; • allow the comparable uncontrolled price method as a safe-harbour if taxpayers can apply that measure. A binding statement will be made on approved transfer-pricing methodologies, requiring: • use of the best method (outside the proposed safe-harbour); and • reasonable accuracy. To achieve integration with the rest of the Act: • advanced pricing agreements will be available within the binding rulings process; • self-assessment will apply; • limited provision will be available for downward adjustments; • the normal disputes resolution process will apply; and • explicit apportionment rules will apply for income that is not sourced exclusively in New Zealand. Detailed rules for apportioning cross-border income and expenditure that are consistent with the proposed transfer pricing regime are proposed. Parallel with the re-write of the Act, the Government will consider apportionment rules for joint costs, foreign-sourced income and income without an explicit New Zealand source and clarification of the use of the net and gross concepts. 43 7.1 Introduction This Chapter outlines proposals to introduce a new transfer-pricing regime and explicit apportionment rules for income that is not exclusively New Zealand-sourced. 7.2 The proposed new transfer-pricing rules 7.2.1 Objectives The objectives of the proposed new transfer-pricing rules and improved source rules are to: • improve the measurement of both the net New Zealand-sourced income of non-resident investors in New Zealand and the net foreign-sourced income of residents; • deter taxpayers from attempting to decrease their New Zealand tax liabilities by manipulating the level of income they claim to be deriving from New Zealand and foreign sources; and • to achieve these objectives in a manner consistent with the Government's policy of minimising compliance costs. To achieve these objectives, the Government proposes to repeal the existing transfer-pricing rules in s.22 of the Act and replace them with a new set of rules. Explicit apportionment rules would also be introduced during the current process for income that is not deemed to be exclusively New Zealand-sourced. 7.2.2 Scope of the proposed transfer-pricing rules The proposed transfer-pricing regime is intended to be narrowly-focused, while protecting the tax base by being difficult to circumvent. It is therefore proposed to restrict the regime to cross-border transactions which are not at arm’s-length and which deplete the New Zealand tax base. The regime would not affect wholly domestic transactions nor ordinary cross-border transactions conducted on arm’s- length terms. The coverage of the regime will be considered carefully in the consultative process. 7.2.3 Only cross-border transactions covered The requirement to use arm's-length prices would be restricted to cross-border transactions. It is only in such transactions that the source of income can be transferred out of the New Zealand tax base. The regime would apply where a cross-border transaction is not on arm’s-length terms. The requirement to report income using arm's-length prices would therefore apply to transactions between: • a New Zealand resident company and a non-resident company; • two non-resident companies when at least one of those companies is taxable in New Zealand (to the extent of its New Zealand operations); • a New Zealand company and a controlled foreign company; and • two controlled foreign companies resident in different countries. 7.2.4 Restricted to where the New Zealand tax base could be depleted The requirement to use arm's-length prices should be restricted to cross-border transactions in which a New Zealand taxpayer depletes the New Zealand tax base by: • supplying goods or services for inadequate consideration; or • receiving goods or services for excessive consideration. 44 For example, if a New Zealand subsidiary purchases trading stock from its offshore parent for excessive consideration, the cost of sales of the New Zealand subsidiary is inflated and profit and taxable New Zealand income is depressed. On the other hand, where the New Zealand subsidiary receives goods or services for a lower-than-market price from its parent, the New Zealand taxable income of the subsidiary is augmented. There is no policy reason for New Zealand to have rules preventing the latter. 7.2.5 Application to branches The arm's-length requirement should also apply to the rules apportioning income between branches and parent companies. Because they are not inter-entity transactions, such apportionments would not fall within any legal transactional definition. An arm's-length rule must therefore apply to deemed transactions between: • a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company and its head office, or other branches or subsidiaries offshore; • a resident company and its branch or subsidiary offshore; and • the offshore branches of two resident companies where those offshore branches are in different countries. This objective seems to be best achieved by deeming transactions to occur between branches and parents and then applying an arm's-length standard to: • the gross value of goods and services supplied by the parent company to its branch (that is, the proportion of gross revenue of the company attributable to the activities of its branch); and • the gross value of goods and services acquired by the branch from its parent company (that is, the proportion of gross expenditure of the company that is attributable to the gross income generated by the activities of the branch). 7.2.6 The need to apply the arm's-length standard to arrangements that have a character similar to that of cross-border transactions. As in Australia, it seems necessary to broaden the term cross-border transactions to cover arrangements that have a character similar to that of cross-border transactions. For example, while the rules would not, in general, apply to transactions between two resident taxpayers, it seems necessary for them to apply if the transactions are part of a broader agreement involving non-residents. A stylised example of such a transaction is illustrated below. It has been adapted from an Australian Tax Office ruling:15 In this example, two unassociated company groups comprising NZCo.1 and ForCo.1 in one group and NZCo.2 and ForCo.2 in the other group, have agreed that NZCo.1 will receive 80% of the arm’s-length consideration from NZCo.2 in respect of the supply of property in New Zealand. NZCo.1's offshore associate, ForCo.1, will receive the balance of 20% of the arm's-length consideration from ForCo.2. While, at first glance, the transaction between the two New Zealand companies appears to be wholly domestic, the transactions represent a transfer of New Zealand-sourced income from NZCo.1 to ForCo.1. Applying the transfer-pricing rules in circumstances like these seems to be necessary to protect the New Zealand tax base. 15 TR 94/14. 45 7.2.7 Application to non-related party transactions At this stage, it is not proposed that the transfer-pricing regime would require any control or other specific relationship between the parties to a transaction. Instead, a general obligation that all cross-border transactions be at arm's-length prices is proposed. Narrowing the regime to related party transactions would reduce uncertainty and compliance costs, particularly in day- to-day cross-border transactions. This would be consistent with the commercial reality that arm's-length parties normally conduct transactions at arm's-length prices. However, when the Australians designed their transfer-pricing rules, they concluded that restricting them to related party transactions would enable people to circumvent them. Instead, they applied the rules to all transactions not conducted at arm’s-length. In determining whether a transaction is at arm’s-length, regard must be had to “any connection between any two or more of the parties to the agreement or to any other relevant circumstances.”16 A recent ruling of the Australian Tax Office (ATO) shows that a primary concern was the tax avoidance that would occur if the transfer-pricing rules depended on the existence of control or share ownership.17 The ruling, (and other ATO transfer-pricing commentaries) refers to a number of examples of this type of avoidance. For example: “\[Consider\] a deal between a company in Australia that is a member of one group with a company overseas that is a member of another, quite unrelated group. The particular transaction could be one that results in the company in Australia receiving less for its exports than the relevant price on the open market. Why, it might be asked, should a company here do that. The answer could be that there are other, completely offshore, deals between members of the two company groups that, in one way or another, redress for each group as a whole the income imbalance resulting from the reduced export price to the company in Australia. There might, for example, be such an offshore agreement not to compete in a particular market. Whatever might be said about the arm's-length nature of the set of deals between each of the two groups considered as a whole, the export transaction itself is not one carried out at arm’s-length and \[transfer- pricing rules\] are there to redress the revenue imbalance for Australia that would otherwise exist." This suggests that while a transfer-pricing regime restricted to related party transactions can increase certainty, there is a potential cost to its integrity. Alternatively, it could involve complex and detailed anti-avoidance rules. New Zealand could adopt wording similar to that of the equivalent Australian legislation. However, this seems to do little to narrow the regime, while at the same time creating uncertainty about what is a "relevant circumstance" or "any connection". Another way of narrowing the scope of the regime (the method favoured by Government) would be to incorporate a presumption that non-related parties have transacted at arm's-length unless there is any connection or relevant circumstance to suggest otherwise. This would put the onus on the Inland Revenue Department to demonstrate that transactions between non-related parties were not conducted on arm's-length terms before the transfer-pricing rules could be invoked. At this stage, it is proposed that subject to the presumption, all cross-border transactions be valued at arm's-length prices. In the consultative process, consideration will be given to whether the regime can be more closely targeted without raising the concerns noted by the Australian authorities. 7.2.8 Application to individuals, trusts and partnerships Transfer-pricing rules would have to apply to individuals on the same basis as they would apply to companies. 16 See, for example, TR 94/14. 17 See, for example, TR 94/14. 46 For the purpose of determining whether a transaction involving a trust is cross-border, a trust that would be a qualifying trust if it made a distribution (on the last day of its income year) should be treated as resident in New Zealand; any other trust should be treated as non-resident. In the case of partnerships, the transaction should be regarded as cross-border if it would fall within that definition had it been with any member of the partnership. For example, the rules would be invoked if a partnership containing one non- resident member conducted a transaction with a resident. Where the transaction is not at an arm’s-length price and the source of income is moved offshore, total New Zealand-sourced partnership income would be adjusted upwards. This should affect only non-resident partners, since resident partners are taxable on worldwide income. The adjustment should change the composition, but not the amount, of the resident partner’s assessable income. 7.2.9 De minimus rules In general, overseas transfer-pricing rules avoid de minimus rules, which seem to be seen as arbitrary exemptions from what should be a general requirement that taxpayers transact at arm’s-length. Arguably, the unsophisticated taxpayer at whom de minimus rules are aimed is unlikely to engage in significant transfer-pricing activity. Moreover, while de minimus exemptions can reduce compliance costs, they can also increase uncertainty. Compliance concerns may be better met by applying a reasonably flexible approach to calculating the required arm's-length prices. Suggestions are given below for a comparable uncontrolled price safe-harbour rule and a reasonable estimate rule. 7.2.10 Determinations of arm's-length transfer-prices Taxpayers will need explicit guidance on the methodologies to use in determining arm’s-length transfer-prices. To assist them in this process, the Government proposes to issue a binding public statement on the question. This statement could be made in a number of different forms, including regulations or determinations issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Submissions are sought on the most appropriate form for the binding statement. 7.2.11 Methods of determining the arm's-length transfer-price Where feasible, the arm’s-length price would be set using the comparable uncontrolled price method. Under this method, the arm’s-length price would be set by reference to similar transactions in which adequate consideration was provided for the goods and services transferred, with adjustments for any minor differences in the nature of the transactions. Using the comparable uncontrolled price would, in effect, provide a safe-harbour rule for taxpayers. Taxpayers would have the assurance that, if they used this method, Inland Revenue would not impose a different methodology. If a comparable uncontrolled price could not be identified, an appropriate proxy method for estimating the arm’s-length price would be applied. Possible proxies include: 7.2.11.1 The resale price method This method could be applied where a New Zealand taxpayer (reseller) purchases goods or services from a related offshore supplier (supplier) which are then on-sold to an unrelated customer. To determine the transfer price for the controlled transaction (supplier to reseller), an arm’s-length gross profit margin plus any relevant expenses is deducted from the price paid in the uncontrolled transaction (reseller to unrelated customer). The arm’s-length gross profit margin would be obtained by reference to comparable uncontrolled sales of similar products. 7.2.11.2 The cost plus method This method could be applied where a New Zealand taxpayer supplies goods or services to a related offshore party. The transfer price for this controlled transaction is determined by adding an arm’s-length gross profit margin to the costs incurred by the New Zealand taxpayer in supplying the goods or services to the related offshore party The arm’s-length gross profit margin would be determined by reference to comparable uncontrolled profit margins in similar activities. 47 7.2.11.3 The comparable profits method Under this method, it is presumed that the taxpayer earns a profit similar to comparable uncontrolled profits of similar persons in similar industries, measured as a return on assets, operating assets or equity; or as ratios of profit to sales, or some other financial ratio; or by some other appropriate measure. This method is most similar to s.22 of the Act. 7.2.11.4 The profit split method Under this method, the profit of a group of persons engaging in a common activity is apportioned among the members of the group, using an apportionment system that would be agreed upon by unrelated persons acting at arm’s-length. For example, the profit might be distributed in proportion to the capital contributed by each member, taking into account differing bargaining powers such as the ability to contribute intangibles or some other unique asset. 7.2.12 Application of the best method It is proposed that if taxpayers cannot use the comparable uncontrolled price, they should use the method that provides the most accurate and practical measure of the arm's-length price. This would give taxpayers and the Inland Revenue Department maximum flexibility in arriving at methods that best suit the very different circumstances in which arm’s-length prices are required. For example, profit-based methods could be applied in circumstances where they yield a more accurate and practicable method of determining net New Zealand- sourced income than transactions-based methods would. The approach outlined in the previous paragraph is similar to the “best method” rule used for the US transfer-pricing rules. The US regulations for determining the most reliable arm's-length method outline a range of factors that must be considered, including: • the degree of comparability between the uncontrolled transactions used for comparison and the controlled transactions of the taxpayer; • the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data; • the reliability of the assumptions used; and • the sensitivity of the results to possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions. It seems appropriate to apply the same guidelines in New Zealand. Generally, taxpayers would be expected to follow the same methodology for similar transactions and from one year to the next, unless the best-method rule called for a different one. This might occur because of a change in circumstances or the available data, or because a different method gave more accurate results. Taxpayers will be able to agree with the Department in advance on the method that best suits their circumstances. One option would be to obtain either a binding or non-binding ruling. Obtaining such an upfront agreement can reduce uncertainties. 7.2.13 Accuracy requirement Arm’s-length price calculations are merely estimates of what the price would have been if the transaction had been conducted between arm’s-length parties. Because of this, there is always room for disagreement about the exact arm’s- length price that the taxpayer should adopt. This can create uncertainty for taxpayers and conflict with revenue authorities. There are two ways to reduce this problem. The first is the United States approach, which allows a range of arm’s-length prices; the extent of the range is determined by the accuracy of the statistical data used. Under this approach, the taxpayer can use an actual transfer- price if it falls within the range. If the data-source used for the range is highly accurate (for example, comparable uncontrolled prices for the sales of the same products on similar terms), the acceptable range would be the entire range of arm’s-length prices. If the data source is less accurate (for example, sales of similar, but not the same, products) the arm’s-length range may be only a portion of the entire range of arm’s-length prices. 48 An alternative is to require taxpayers merely to make a reasonable estimate of an arm’s-length price. If the Inland Revenue Department challenges that price, it would have to establish, as a threshold issue, that the taxpayer's estimate was unreasonable. The approach adopted may depend on the overall structure of the regime. For example, as noted above, a reasonable estimate rule could be adopted instead of de minimus exemptions. The current proposal is for a reasonable estimate rule, but the Government will consider submissions on this. 7.3 Integration with the rest of the Act 7.3.1 Binding rulings and advance pricing agreements It is proposed to incorporate provisions for issuing advanced pricing agreements under the binding rulings process, in order to: • provide certainty to taxpayers who engage in transactions that are potentially subject to the new transfer-pricing rules, preventing possibly lengthy and costly transfer-price investigations later. An up-front investigation, with the taxpayer's co-operation, is likely to be easier than an adversarial ex-post investigation. In addition, if a multilateral agreement is used, the other countries' tax authorities may be able to help determine the arm's-length price; and • reduce international disputes over source of income. It is important to note that countries that did not participate would not be bound, so such disputes could not be eliminated altogether. To obtain an advance pricing agreement, taxpayers would have to disclose all relevant information. As with any other binding ruling, the agreement would bind the Commissioner of Inland Revenue only if this were done. 7.3.2 Self-assessment process In order to be properly integrated into the way the modern New Zealand income tax system operates, the transfer-pricing regime has to operate within a self-assessment system. This means that taxpayers must use the transfer-pricing methodologies to determine their taxable income when engaging in transactions subject to the regime. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should then be able to apply normal re-assessment procedures if he or she determines that the taxpayer did not comply with the regime. When reassessing taxpayers, the Commissioner would have to comply with the guidelines issued on the methods that taxpayers are expected to employ for calculating arm’s-length prices. 7.3.3 Provision for downward adjustments It is proposed that, in general, the transfer-pricing methodologies will supersede the actual terms of the transaction only where this would increase the taxpayer’s taxable income, or reduce a loss. In certain circumstances, however, the new rules could allow taxpayers to adjust their actual transaction prices in a manner that would reduce their New Zealand taxable income. An example is where a New Zealand parent charges a subsidiary CFC an excess price for goods. If CFC income must be returned based on the lower arm's-length cost of its purchases, there is an argument that the parent should return income using the same arm's-length price. A downward adjustment to taxable income may be appropriate when: • it is to offset an adjustment to the other party to the transaction, when both parties are taxable by New Zealand; or • the adjustment is required to comply with a multilateral competent authority adjustment. Any provision for such downward adjustments must fit within a self-assessment system and be administratively manageable. A process that enabled taxpayers to dispute the outcome of a specific transfer-pricing adjustment by requesting a series of compensating adjustments to other, unrelated, transactions would probably be unworkable. The proposed compromise is that taxpayers should be able to make downward adjustments that are the direct consequence of an upward adjustment to the same, or another, taxpayer. This provision must be subject to sufficient information being provided to the Inland Revenue Department - including identification of the downward adjustment sought and the other adjustment to which it directly relates. Provision would have to be made for later reassessments when a downward adjustment is sought following a reassessment including an upward adjustment, or an alteration to such an adjustment. 49 7.3.4 Dispute resolution processes Unilateral transfer-price issues would proceed on the same basis as domestic tax disputes. For tax purposes, the taxpayer would report cross-border transactions at arm’s-length terms on a self-assessment basis and the Commissioner could investigate transfer-price issues in an audit. Following re-assessment, the taxpayer could go through the objection process and, if necessary, dispute the tax liability through the court system. If a transfer-price dispute involved allocation of income with a DTA partner, the taxpayer could invoke the competent authority provision of a treaty. In this case, the Inland Revenue Department would discuss the transfer-price issue with the competent authority of the other country and an agreement would be made among the competent authorities, as provided in the DTA. 7.3.5 Penalties The new transfer-pricing rules do not seem to require any special penalty provisions. If a taxpayer failed to comply with the rules, the standard hierarchy of penalties, as finally determined following the completion of the Penalties and Compliance Review relating to taxpayer culpability, would apply - that is, negligence, lack of a reasonably arguable position and so on. It should be stressed that the Government has yet to make final decisions on the Penalties and Compliance Review. 7.3.6 Reporting and record keeping requirements Taxpayers already report differences between their normal accounts and their accounts for tax purposes. For administrative purposes, there will have to be a specific requirement that where a taxpayer uses an arm’s-length price for a particular transaction instead of the actual price paid, that transaction will be reported. On a more general level, it is proposed that disclosure will be required whenever taxpayers use DTA provisions to override other specific provisions of the Income Tax Act. This new provision will apply to the Act generally, not just to the new transfer-pricing rules. Taxpayers would be required to retain records supporting their cross-border transaction decisions for seven years, in line with the practice for all records relating to determining tax liabilities. No other special record-keeping rules regarding transfer-pricing are proposed. 7.3.7 Structure of the legislation It is proposed that the legislation be structured like that of Australia. Under this approach, the legislation itself would require only that transactions subject to the regime be reported at arm’s-length. The legislation would also define arm’s- length in a general way, using terminology similar to that used in OECD reports. Guidance in determining arm’s-length prices would be provided in regulations or determinations. The alternative, which the Government does not favour, would be to include the required methodologies in the legislation itself. As already noted, it is anticipated that the regulations or determinations describing the methodologies outlined above would be published before the regime came into effect. Supplementary regulations or determinations could be published later, refining these methodologies or providing new ones reflecting experience with the regime. It is proposed that the transfer-pricing rules be superior to all other Income Tax Act sections for the purpose of determining the price at which transactions occur. This means that the other sections, including s.99, would apply only after application of the transfer-pricing rules. However, it would always be open to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to adjust transfer-prices under s.99 if that were necessary to restructure a tax avoidance arrangement. More generally, an appropriately calculated arm’s-length price would be deemed, for all purposes of the Act, to have been the price at which the transaction occurred with respect to the taxpayer or taxpayers for which the arm’s-length calculation was made. The existing anti-abusive transfer-pricing rules outlined in s.22 of the Act would be replaced by the proposed new rules. The transfer-pricing rules would work in conjunction with the deemed dividend rules contained in s.4. In this instance, the arm’s-length price would be used to determine the market value. For example, if a New Zealand company purchased 50 inventory from its parent at more than the arm’s-length price, the transfer-pricing rules would deem the purchase price to be the arm’s-length price, thereby reducing deductions. In addition, s.4 would deem the amount paid in excess of the arm’s-length price to be a dividend to the parent. The combined effect of transfer-pricing and deemed dividend rules would be to increase the company's profits from which a higher-than-declared dividend was paid. If the taxpayer originally reported income using an arm’s-length price, the adverse effect of such a rule should be mitigated by the extension of the FITC regime, because any dividends arising should, generally, be covered by imputation credits. 7.4 Improved source rules 7.4.1 Proposed apportionment rules To measure their net New Zealand-sourced income and to comply with the proposed transfer-pricing rules, taxpayers need clear rules for apportioning, between countries, income that has more than one source (where such apportionment is allowed). As discussed in Chapter 4, s.245 (the general apportionment provision) provides little guidance on how such an apportionment process should be carried out. Clearer apportionment guidelines would help taxpayers to comply with the requirement under s.245 to apportion, between countries, income that is not deemed to be exclusively New Zealand- sourced - for example, business profits derived by a non-resident with a branch in New Zealand. It is proposed that the Inland Revenue Department remedy this position by providing more detailed cross-border apportionment guidelines which are consistent with the transfer pricing rules outlined in this document. These rules could be set out in regulations issued in accordance with s.245 of the Act. Alternatively, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could issue a policy statement (for example, a Technical Information Bulletin) clarifying the apportionment rules considered by the Commissioner to be “just and reasonable” for the purposes of s.245. Submissions are invited on which of these alternative approaches would be preferable. Draft guidelines will be released at a later date for consultation. The gross income apportionment methodologies would outline common measures that taxpayers could use to apportion forms of gross income between countries. This would give taxpayers a clear indication of how to apportion, between countries, income that is not deemed to be exclusively New Zealand-sourced. In addition, it would ensure consistency in apportioning particular types of gross income. 7.4.2 Apportionment of joint costs As discussed in Chapter 4, a specific apportionment problem arises with expenditure which has been incurred jointly in deriving New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income. Possible apportionment rules to apply to such joint costs were recommended by the Valabh Committee in their report on “Tax Accounting Issues”. As a separate exercise the Government will be considering those recommendations. Specifically, during consultations on this issue, consideration will be given to: • introducing more targeted apportionment rules for non-interest joint expenditure (that is, expenditure incurred in producing assessable and non-assessable benefits); • basing the apportionment of non-interest joint expenditure on a common measure that fairly and reasonably results in an objective allocation of the joint expenditure between the benefits produced by that expenditure; and • where it is not practicable to use a common measure, basing the apportionment on the dominant purpose for which the joint expenditure was incurred. Such apportionment rules for joint expenditure could be used to apportion joint expenditure not only between gross income derived from different countries, but also between activities that produce both taxable and non-taxable benefits. 7.5 Other possible changes to the source rules to be considered In addition to apportionment issues, Chapter 4 also identified a number of other problems with the existing source rules. These included structural problems arising from uncertainty over whether the rules relate to gross or net income and the 51 absence of general definitions of New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income. As a result, in parallel with the re- write of the Income Tax Act, the Government also intends to consider possible amendments to the source rules in the Act, to: • implement separate definitions of New Zealand-sourced income, foreign-sourced income and income that is not exclusively New Zealand-sourced; and • clarify the use of the net and gross concepts in the definitions of New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income. 7.6 Effective date It is proposed that the transfer-pricing legislation be introduced by the middle of 1995. Provided that this timetable is met, the transfer-pricing regime and the guidelines would therefore be effective from the start of the 1996-97 income year. 52 8. Thin-Capitalisation Considered Summary Thin-capitalisation rules should aim to accurately determine interest expenses that are properly attributable to New Zealand, without interfering with normal commercial behaviour, at minimum compliance cost, within the self-assessment system. The range of possible approaches include: • a regime along the lines of that operating in Australia (which covers interest- bearing debt from foreign direct investors which exceeds equity from those investors by more than 3:1); or • a more general regime which is designed to go beyond the most extreme cases of thin- capitalisation abuse and determine the proportion of interest that should properly be attributed to the host country; or • a regime whose ambit falls between these two positions. The Government is proposing, via this discussion document, to raise the issues surrounding thin-capitalisation and seeks submissions on the most appropriate approach; in particular on whether a thin-capitalisation regime is feasible and necessary. 8.1 Introduction Interest income derived from New Zealand by non-residents is subject to markedly lower aggregate New Zealand tax rates than is income from equity. Even after the proposed extension of the FITC regime, income from equity will face an aggregate tax rate of 33% compared with the 10% maximum that typically applies to interest income. The more generous tax treatment afforded debt in comparison with equity provides an incentive for non-residents to highly gear their New Zealand operations, thereby attributing high interest costs to New Zealand. An effective thin-capitalisation regime would limit the ability of non-resident investors to artificially reduce their net New Zealand-sourced income by allocating excessive interest costs to New Zealand. Such a regime would need to apply equally to non-residents earning New Zealand-sourced income themselves and to non-residents operating in New Zealand through a subsidiary. Other countries with transfer-pricing regimes similar to that proposed in this document have buttressed those regimes with measures to reduce the opportunity for thin-capitalisation, which allows non-residents to lower their net taxable income. There is logic in this. However, if New Zealand were to follow this path, the Government would need to be satisfied that an effective and acceptable thin-capitalisation regime could be put in place that would not impose excessive compliance costs on businesses. The feasibility of this is addressed in this Chapter and submissions are invited. If submissions are negative, consideration should be given to how the underlying problem of variable tax on debt and equity should be tackled. 53 8.2 Parameters of an effective thin-capitalisation regime 8.2.1 Objectives An acceptable and effective thin-capitalisation regime should: • determine the amount of interest expense properly attributable to New Zealand in a manner which is flexible enough to have regard to the normal variation of commercial finance, while nevertheless being effective when excessive debt finance is used; • operate in the self-assessment system (that is, without the need for a Commissioner’s discretion); and • impose the minimum compliance costs necessary to achieve the above objectives. 8.2.2 Other countries’ thin-capitalisation regimes A number of other countries have already implemented thin-capitalisation measures. These countries include Australia, Canada, Japan, USA, Germany, Sweden and Norway, while the UK administers thin-capitalisation restrictions within the broad ambit of its transfer-pricing legislation. These overseas precedents do not, however, appear to meet the objectives stated for an effective and acceptable thin- capitalisation regime. Australia is an example. Under the Australian regime, if interest-bearing debt finance from foreign direct investors (those owning 15% or more of the equity in an Australian company) exceeds equity finance from the same investors by more than 3:1, then interest paid on the excess debt to the foreign direct investors is disallowed as a deduction. The Australian rules provide a look-through for back-to-back loans from the foreign direct investors, but do not treat debt finance from a third party that is guaranteed by a foreign direct investor as debt from a foreign direct investor. While the Australian rules may capture extreme cases of thin-capitalisation, they do not appear to operate as a more general rule for determining the amount of interest properly attributable to the host country and deductible with respect to that country. This is because: • the Australian rules operate with an arbitrary 3:1 debt:equity ratio only, which may be too high in some cases because the entire group operates with a lower ratio; and • the Australian rules only regard debt from foreign direct investors, whereas given the fungibility of debt, all debt should ideally be considered for determining the amount of interest properly attributable to the host country. The following example uses New Zealand as the host country to illustrate this point. Consider a group that initially comprises a non-resident parent company. The company has shareholders' funds of $100 and no debt. It proposes to set up a subsidiary company in New Zealand which will require total capital of $100. The desired debt:equity ratio for the New Zealand operation is 4:1; that is, $80 debt and $20 equity. The group obviously needs to borrow money to finance its expansion into New Zealand and can do so either by: 1. the parent company borrowing $100, which it uses to inject $20 equity into the New Zealand subsidiary and to extend an $80 loan to the subsidiary; or 2. the parent company borrowing $20 for its equity injection and the subsidiary company borrowing the remaining $80 from a third party. In the first case, the New Zealand company’s debt is to a related party; in the second, to a third party. In both cases, total group indebtedness is $100. 54 The example is stylised, but this does not affect the validity of its basic argument: non-resident companies can use genuine third party debt18 to thinly capitalise their New Zealand subsidiaries or branches. This means that, to be effective, thin-capitalisation rules must ideally cover third-party debt as well as related-party debt. 8.3 Description of a possible effective thin-capitalisation regime The following broadly focused thin-capitalisation regime has been designed to be effective in limiting the excess allocation of interest expenses to New Zealand operations. 8.3.1 Main features of the proposal The regime has the following main features: • it would apply only to entities or operations that are controlled by a single non-resident. That is because the policy concern is to restrict the ability of non-residents to exploit the debt/equity distinction to under-report net New Zealand-sourced income; • it would have a safe-harbour debt:equity ratio set at a level that excluded most operations with a commercially- normal debt:equity ratio. The objective would be to reduce compliance costs and limit the extent to which the measures increase aggregate tax rates on non-resident investors operating with commercially-normal capital structures; • entities whose debt:equity ratios exceeded the safe-harbour ratio would be subject to the regime only if their debt:equity ratios also exceeded 110% of the worldwide debt:equity ratio of the group to which that entity belonged; and • entities which failed these two debt:equity ratio tests would not be permitted to deduct their excessive interest expense. Excessive interest expense would equal Actual debt — Threshold debt Total Interest Expense x ----------------------------------------- Actual debt where threshold debt is the maximum amount of debt that would be consistent with the higher of the safe-harbour and 110% of the consolidated group debt:equity ratios. 8.3.2 Entities The regime would apply to any taxpaying entity, such as an individual, company or trust. The legal form of the taxpaying entity should not determine whether or not a substantive provision, such as a thin-capitalisation rule, should apply. The rules would need to apply individually to each partner of a partnership. 8.3.3 Non-resident control The regime would apply only to non-residents deriving New Zealand-sourced income (such as a branch of a non- resident company) and to New Zealand resident entities controlled by a single non-resident. Non-resident would include persons defined as resident under the Act, but treated as non-resident for purposes of a DTA. For the purposes of such a regime, a trust that would be a qualifying trust if it made a distribution on the last day of its income year would be treated as resident for that income year; other trusts would be treated as non-resident. Non-resident control of a resident company would be defined as a single non-resident entity with ownership of 5 0% or more of the controlling interest in the resident company, as defined for the CFC regime. Attribution and look-through rules would apply to determine ownership of a controlling interest. These rules would be similar to ss.245B and 245C which are used to attribute control interests of foreign companies for the CFC regime. 18 Rather than disguised related-party debt. 55 8.4 Debt:Equity ratio 8.4.1 Safe-harbour ratio A safe-harbour proposal would seem desirable in order to: • reduce compliance costs by excluding most taxpayers from the ambit of the regime; • target the regime at cases giving rise to the greatest tax-base concerns; and • reduce the extent to which the regime would force non-resident investment to be heavily weighted towards highly taxed equity investment, thereby markedly increasing effective tax rates on such investors. All three objectives would require a safe-harbour ratio set at a level that would exclude most entities. To keep compliance costs to the minimum, the regime must be targeted at levels of activity that would reasonably be seen as abusive. Business operating at a normal commercially acceptable gearing level should definitely be excluded by the safe-harbour rule. Many overseas countries have a safe-harbour debt:equity ratio. Provided that this ratio is not breached, businesses are not affected by the thin-capitalisation rules. If this ratio is breached, interest deductions are generally denied. Under the general scenario proposed by this document, however, further provisions would still allow the interest payments to be deducted, even when the safe-harbour is breached. In Australia, Canada, Japan and Germany the safe-harbour debt:equity is 3:1 (25% equity regime). In Spain it is 2:1 (33% equity regime). In USA it is 1.5:1 (40% equity regime). Because of significant differences in the regimes, it is difficult to use these as automatic precedents. The choice of the safe-harbour level is essentially a judgment. It has no basis in any hard taxation theory. The aim, as stated above, is to stop abuse. It is envisaged that the New Zealand safe-harbour ratio would be within the range that other countries use. This should exclude most companies from the regime, for example, the average debt:equity ratio of the top 40 companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (November 1994) is about 1:1 (median 53% equity, mean 45% equity). The Government seeks submissions on the most appropriate ratio for New Zealand. 8.4.2 Debt:Equity ratio defined The New Zealand debt:equity ratio is the (related and third-party) debt on which New Zealand interest deductions are incurred, in relation to the equity of the New Zealand entity or branch. Debt for the New Zealand taxpayer would need to be limited to debt giving rise to New Zealand tax deductions. Where no New Zealand tax deduction is taken, there is no issue of excessive interest costs being attributed to the New Zealand tax base. Thus, an interest-free loan from a non-resident parent to a New Zealand subsidiary should not be included in the debt of the New Zealand subsidiary. For example, a non-resident controlled company has assets of $1,000 funded by an interest-free loan of $500, interest-bearing debt of $400 and shareholders' funds of $100. Under the proposals, the debt:equity ratio of this company would be 2:3 (60% equity). Debt would need to be defined widely enough to encompass all instruments and arrangements that are closely substitutable for debt. For example, it would need to include interest-bearing convertible notes. The definition of financial arrangements in the accrual rules covers all such arrangements. However, since the focus is on excessive interest and similar costs, the debt definition needs to be limited to financial arrangements for which a deduction is taken under s.106(1)(h) of the Act19 or sections such as s.136, which allows a deduction for expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in borrowing money and employing it as capital in the production of assessable income. In other words, financial arrangements for which no interest deduction (or similar) is taken would not be considered as debt. Equity for the non-resident, or non-resident controlled, New Zealand taxpayer would be the taxpayer’s gross assets (for non-residents, gross assets located in New Zealand or employed in the production of New Zealand assessable income) less interest-bearing debt (using the above debt definition). To reduce compliance costs, assets should be able to be valued at either depreciated cost or market value. However, the valuation method would need to be consistent across all 19 The general interest deductibility provision. 56 assets unless different valuations are used for financial reporting in a way that is consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 8.4.3 Determining when the debt:equity ratio should be measured The debt:equity ratio of the non-resident or non-resident controlled taxpayer would need to be calculated for an income year. For compliance cost reasons, the same ratio should be used for the entire income year. However, this leaves open the question of when debt and equity should be measured in order to calculate the annual ratio. One way would be to measure debt and equity on the last day of the accounting year. The problem with such an approach is that companies could manipulate their debt and equity levels for that particular day. Another option would be to take an average amount of debt and equity over the accounting period. Although this option is more equitable, it would have higher compliance costs as it requires taxpayers to perform detailed calculations. A further option would be to take the highest debt level and lowest equity level during the year. However, that could be unfair. For example, a company requiring a high level of debt over a short period would be penalised. Since equity is a residual item that is calculated only after completing a full set of accounts, requiring the lowest level of equity to be calculated would impose excessive compliance costs. A balance needs to be struck between preventing manipulation of debt levels to meet the safe-harbour ratio and the compliance costs involved in an averaging approach. The best approach for debt may be to calculate debt as the highest amount of debt in the accounting year and allow an option for taxpayers to use the monthly (or possibly quarterly) average amount of debt for the accounting year, if this would give a fairer result. If such an option were provided, it would need to have associated anti-avoidance rules to prevent debt levels from being suppressed on the measurement dates. Equity would always need to be measured on the last date of the accounting year, when accounts are prepared and this residual item is measurable. Measuring it on any other day would involve high compliance costs. 8.4.4 Calculating debt:equity ratios on a consolidated basis In many cases, the New Zealand debt:equity ratio of a non-resident, or non-resident controlled New Zealand taxpayer, would flow mechanically once debt and equity were defined. However, in some cases the debt and equity of associated parties may need to be amalgamated to provide one debt:equity ratio for all associated parties. For non-corporates this would seem unnecessary and would incur unnecessary compliance costs. If the New Zealand debt:equity ratio of a corporate group were not measured on a consolidated basis, it would be possible to meet any required debt:equity ratio simply by establishing a chain of companies, each meeting the required ratio. The problem arises because equity introduced into a corporate chain is counted as equity for each company down that chain. Thus, if company debt:equity ratios were measured separately, the same equity could cover the allowable debt level as many times as there are companies. It would therefore be necessary to require the debt:equity ratio of a New Zealand group of companies to be calculated on a consolidated basis with the same debt:equity ratio applying to all companies in that group. Clearly, for these purposes the definition of a group should be limited to companies that are non-resident or non-resident controlled. For simplicity, the existing 66% common ownership company group definition in s.191(3) of the Act could be used - provided that each company in the group is non-resident or non-resident controlled. The alternative would be a wider rule such as a group of companies with a common non-resident controller. In cases where group companies have different balance dates, calculating the debt:equity ratio on a group basis would raise the issue of which date should be used for calculating debt and equity. The obvious date would be the balance date of each company for which the thin-capitalisation rule applies. However, that could require several different debt:equity calculations. To reduce compliance costs there would need to be an option for all members of a company group to elect to use the balance date of one member. For taxpayers other than companies (individuals and trusts), there would not seem to be the same need to calculate the debt:equity ratio on a consolidated basis. 57 The Annex at the end of this Chapter provides some examples of using a consolidated basis for calculating the New Zealand debt:equity ratio. 8.4.5 Determining the world-wide debt:equity ratio After determining that the New Zealand debt:equity ratio exceeds the safe-harbour, it would be necessary to determine whether the New Zealand debt:equity ratio exceeds 110% of the consolidated world-wide debt:equity ratio for the group. This would be used to determine whether the interest incurred in New Zealand is excessive in comparison to the group’s overall debt finance. Where the controlling non-resident is a company that produces audited consolidated financial accounts in accordance with GAAP, the world-wide debt:equity ratio could be calculated from those accounts. There would need to be a provision allowing a taxpayer to use unaudited accounts if these could be shown to provide a true and fair view of the taxpayer's position. Under these rules, the primary difference between calculating the debt:equity ratio of the New Zealand taxpayer and the ratio of the world-wide group is that the group’s ratio would be calculated by treating all legal debt as debt, regardless of whether it is interest-bearing. The New Zealand taxpayer, in contrast, would treat only interest-bearing debt as debt for the purposes of calculating its ratio. Therefore, the ratios used for comparison would not measure exactly the same types of debt. However, it would not be reasonable to require a multi-national company group to recalculate its debt:equity ratio using New Zealand tax debt concepts. Nor would it be reasonable to include in domestic debt, arrangements on which no interest deduction (or its equivalent) was provided. A compromise based on compliance-cost concerns is required. There may, however, be circumstances when the non-resident controlling shareholder would prefer to calculate its debt:equity ratio using New Zealand tax concepts of debt and equity. There is no apparent reason to disallow this. In such cases, debt would need to be defined as all financial arrangements that would give rise to a deduction if the non- resident company group had been resident in New Zealand. Consolidated accounts would still be needed. A consolidated debt:equity ratio would be calculated for the non-resident controller and all persons associated with that non-resident, with an associated person test along the lines of s.245B. Such an approach would be appropriate where the controlling non-resident does not have audited consolidated accounts, or where that person is not a company. To add flexibility to the regime, taxpayers should be allowed to apply to the Commissioner for a ruling on variations to the above method for determining the debt:equity ratio of a controlling shareholder. The Commissioner would be authorised to provide such a ruling where a variation is in accordance with the principles of the regime. For example, this might be usefully applied where a world-wide diversified business with a low debt:equity ratio operates a bank in New Zealand with a high debt:equity ratio which is normal for such an operation. There may also be other cases where strict application of the debt:equity ratio could lead to inequitable results. The Government seeks submissions on such cases and suggestions on how to identify them and provide relief without compromising the integrity of the regime. In the unusual case where more than one non-resident entity or group is considered to control the New Zealand taxpayer, the taxpayer would have the option of choosing which non-resident controlling entity or group to use for determining the group debt:equity ratio. For simplicity, the debt:equity ratio of the controlling entity would need to be determined on the last day of its preceding accounting year; that is, a year which ends before the New Zealand taxpayer's accounting year begins. That should be satisfactory for calculating the world-wide debt:equity ratio, since the opportunity to manipulate the amount of world- wide debt and equity is not likely to be significant. Once the world-wide debt:equity ratio has been determined, it would be increased by 10%, to account for the different times of measurement of the ratios for the New Zealand taxpayer and the group and to allow for a reasonable amount of difference between the New Zealand debt and the world-wide debt. It would then be compared to the New Zealand ratio so that excess interest could be determined. 58 8.4.6 Deduction disallowance for excess interest If a non-resident or non-resident controlled entity has an excess level of debt, this would indicate that interest costs are being over-allocated to the New Zealand tax base. In such cases, an interest deduction relating to the excess debt would be denied. All interest and interest-type expenditures deductible under the Act, including the accruals rules (these include foreign exchange losses), would be subject to partial disallowance. Under such a rule, a proportion of total interest expense, calculated according to the formula below, would be denied: Actual debt — Threshold debt Total Interest Expense x ----------------------------------------- Actual debt where "threshold debt" is the higher of: a) the debt:equity ratio of the controlling entity (plus the 10% margin); and b) the safe-harbour ratio. In calculating excess interest costs, it would seem inappropriate to net off interest income received by a taxpayer against the interest expense of that taxpayer. The rationale of such a regime would be to deny interest deductions when a taxpayer is excessively geared. The nature of the income received (interest, dividends or other) as a result of investing the borrowed funds would not be relevant. However, consideration would need to be given to the case where the recipient of an interest payment is also the payer; for example, current accounts moving between debit and credit balance. In such cases, netting off balances might be appropriate. Consideration should also be given to back-to-back loan arrangements with non-resident related companies. If there is more than one New Zealand company in the consolidated group, excess interest would need to be disallowed in proportion to the interest claimed as a deduction by each company, up to the total amount of interest claimed by the New Zealand group of companies. It would not be appropriate, under such a regime, to recharacterise as equity excessive debt for which interest deductions are denied, so that the interest payments would be regarded as dividends. For example, Australia adopts this approach of not recharacterising debt as equity when their thin-capitalisation rules apply. 8.4.7 Anti-avoidance rules A regime along the lines outlined above would need to include anti-avoidance rules to ensure that taxpayers do not: • structure transactions to circumvent the control test; or • temporarily or artificially inject or inflate equity to avoid an excess debt calculation. 8.4.8 Reporting requirements and penalties No special reporting requirements or penalty provisions would be necessary to operate the above thin-capitalisation proposals. 8.5 Thin-capitalisation rules - issues for submissions The Government invites submissions on all issues discussed in this Chapter and related matters. In particular, it solicits discussion on the necessity and feasibility of a thin-capitalisation regime and would also welcome submissions in the following areas. 8.5.1 Ambit of the regime A key issue is whether thin-capitalisation rules should be narrowly focused (as in the Australian regime) or more broadly focused (as in the regime outlined above). A narrowly focused regime has the advantage of being more closely targeted, but the disadvantage of being less effective. An intermediate position may be appropriate. 59 8.5.2 Safe-harbour ratio An appropriate safe-harbour, in line with international norms, needs to be set for a broad and effective thin-capitalisation regime. 8.5.3 Third-party debt The broad regime outlined includes third-party debt as well as related-party debt, both in determining the New Zealand taxpayer’s debt:equity ratio and applying interest deduction disallowance. Some overseas regimes only refer to related- party debt for both purposes. The United States refers to all debt for determining the debt:equity ratio, but refers only to related-party debt for disallowing the interest expense deduction. In some respects this proposal could be seen as an interest allocation rule rather than a thin-capitalisation rule. The Government in this circumstance faces a difficult issue. Referring to related-party debt only would focus the regime on those cases where debt finance is directly used in substitution for equity finance. However, with that focus, the regime could be avoided with back-to-back loans and related-party guarantees. There is evidence from overseas that where a limited regime applies this is exactly what happens; that is, the regime is avoided. Unless the consultation process shows that such a concern is not relevant in New Zealand, only a wider rule would seem effective. Certainly, there seems little point in introducing a regime that we know in advance can easily be avoided. Applying the regime to all debt would obviously avoid such a problem. It would allow the regime to operate effectively as a way of determining the appropriate amount of interest expense incurred in New Zealand. But it would, unless tightly contained, threaten the Government's goal of reducing compliance cost. The wider rule would involve what some would see as a significant involvement, perhaps too significant an involvement, of tax rules in normal commercial decisions, made for normal commercial reasons, about the financial structure of a firm. For this reason, the Government has determined that such a regime needs to be focused in a way that addresses abuse only and it therefore seeks submissions on what the final shape of such a rule should be. 8.5.4 Consolidated groups The regime outlined above would require that New Zealand companies use consolidated accounts for the purpose of the calculations. This may impose additional compliance costs. However, if this is not done the regime could be avoided by multiple counting of equity that is flowed through a chain of companies. Again, submissions are sought on this point. 8.5.5 Inequitable results Taxpayers may wish to identify cases where they believe application of the rules would be inequitable and suggest a rule which will identify such cases and provide relief without compromising the integrity of the regime. 8.6 Conclusion This Chapter has outlined the elements of a thin-capitalisation regime intended to meet the objectives of being both flexible and effective. The Government seeks submissions not just on the issues discussed above, but on any other relevant issues relating to thin-capitalisation. The Government invites submissions on the extent to which attribution of excess deductions of interest expense to New Zealand is a problem and, if a significant problem, whether an effective thin-capitalisation regime is an appropriate response and if so what should be the ambit of the regime. 60 ANNEX: Calculation Of Debt:Equity Ratios This example assumes that the broad and effective thin-capitalisation regime outlined is applied The structure to which the regime applies is as follows where NRCO is a non-resident company: NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2 have the following balance sheets as at 31 December 1994: NZCO Assets $ Liabilities $ Investment in NZCO1 100 Debt 100 Plant etc. 100 Equity 100 200 200 NZCO1 Assets $ Liabilities $ Investment in NZCO2 100Debt 100 Plant etc. 100Equity (NZCO1) 100 200 200 NZCO2 Assets $ Liabilities $ Plant etc. 200 Debt 100 Equity (NZCO2) 100 200 200 From the individual balance sheets, it would appear that all three companies have a debt:equity ratio of 1:1. However, in substance $400 is being invested in plant, which is being funded by $300 of debt. This is recognised on a consolidated accounting basis, where the debt:equity ratio of the corporate group consisting of NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2 is 3:1. 61 Consolidated Balance Sheet of NZCO and Subsidiaries as at 31 December 1994 Assets $ Liabilities $ Plant etc.400 Debt300 Equity 100 400 400 If the safe-harbour debt:equity ratio was set at 3:1, NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2 would not be denied an interest deduction. If the safe-harbour ratio was set at 2:1 NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2 would be subject to the proposed regime. This would mean a portion of their interest expense would be denied. Conversely, under a non-consolidated approach, a chain of companies, where each company borrows from its parent, could result in each company breaching the proposed safe-harbour debt:equity ratio, even though the corporate group as a whole would not do so. For example, consider again the example of NRCO, NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2. NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2 have the following balance sheets as at 31 December 1994: NZCO Assets $ Liabilities $ Inter-Co Advance 300 Debt 300 Plant etc. 100Equity 100 400 400 NZCO1 Assets $ Liabilities $ Inter-Co Advance 300Debt 300 Plant etc. 100Equity100 400400 NZCO2 Assets $ Liabilities $ Plant etc. 400 Debt300 Equity100 400 400 The debt:equity ratios of NZCO, NZCO1 and NZCO2 are 3:1 and so would be within a 3;1 safe-harbour ratio but would breach a 2:1 safe-harbour ratio. However, on an consolidated basis, NZCO and its subsidiaries have a debt:equity ratio of 1:1 and so would be within a safe-harbour ratio of either 2:1 or 3:1.

i THE TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS A discussion document on proposed changes to the accrual rules Hon Winston PetersRt Hon Bill Birch Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue ii First published in December 1997 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington, New Zealand. The taxation of financial arrangements; a discussion document on proposed changes to the accrual rules. ISBN 0-478-10324-7 iii FOREWORD We are issuing this discussion document as part of a post-implementation review of the accrual rules contained in Part EH of the Income Tax Act 1994. It examines the problems and anomalies of the accrual rules and puts forward proposals to resolve them. The accrual rules govern the taxation of financial arrangements. The scope of the rules is very wide, as they cover a broad range of transactions from straightforward loans to some extremely complex financing arrangements. New Zealand has been a leader internationally in accrual legislation, having introduced the accrual rules in 1986 as a comprehensive set of rules for the taxation of financial arrangements. This review is therefore based on over ten years’ experience of the rules for taxpayers, practitioners and administrators. While the rules have been working reasonably well for straightforward debt instruments, and have proven to be sufficiently robust to deal with most financial innovation, application of the rules has not always been easy for those required to use them. Our aim in this review, therefore, is to simplify the rules wherever this is compatible with the basic policy underlying them, and with protection of the tax base. This document raises the issues we know to be problematic, and invites discussion from interested parties on the policy solutions we have proposed. We look forward to receiving your submissions.

govern the tax treatment of financial arrangements. 1.2 The purpose of the accrual rules is: •to bring to tax all returns on financial arrangements on an accrual basis over the term of the arrangement, including the returns on instruments that can alter the incidence of those returns, such as derivatives; •to overcome deferral of tax by spreading income and expenditure over the term of the arrangement; and •to set out the methods by which expected income and expenditure are calculated and allocated to an income year. 1.3 This was discussed by Gault J in CIR v Dewavrin Segard (NZ) Limited: The broad object or purpose to be inferred from the provisions is to bring in as assessable for tax income and to allow deduction of expenditure across the term of financial arrangements in which they are earned or incurred. This would overcome avoidance by the loading of expenditure at the commencement of the arrangement and deferring or capitalising income. 1 What is within the rules 1.4 Financial arrangements are very broadly defined in the Income Tax Act 1994. They encompass virtually any arrangement in which there is an exchange of consideration with an element of deferral or futurity. 1.5 Examples of a financial arrangement include: •loans including those evidenced by mortgages and debentures; •credit card accounts; •forward contracts; •agreements for sale and purchase of property with deferred payment. 1 (1994) 16 NZTC 11,048 (CA). 2 1.6 Excepted financial arrangements are specifically excluded from the definition of financial arrangements and are thereby excluded from the ambit of the accrual rules. Excepted financial arrangements fall into three categories: •equity instruments, such as shares; •those excluded for compliance costs reasons, for example, short- term trade credits and short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property; and •those arrangements already subject to a specific tax regime such as life insurance, superannuation schemes and farm-out arrangements. How the rules apply 1.7 The core of the accrual rules comprises the two basic requirements that: •income from a financial arrangement is brought to tax regardless of whether that gain is of an income or capital nature; and •income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement is spread over the term of that financial arrangement. 1.8 All income is taxable. Expenditure may or may not be deductible, depending upon the general deductibility provisions within the Act. An automatic deduction is currently available to holders for expenditure arising from a base price adjustment. 1.9 When the financial arrangement is entered into, the expected cashflows (and other consideration) are used in determining what amounts of income or expenditure will be spread. Thus expected income or expenditure is spread over the term of the financial arrangement, but all income or expenditure, expected or unexpected, is taken into account on maturity or disposal. The exception to this is where a market valuation method of spreading is used, because this brings unexpected income or expenditure to account at each balance date. 1.10 The rules provide the methods by which the income and expenditure are spread over the term of the arrangement. The primary method is the yield to maturity method. Other methods are acceptable if they produce a result which is not materially different from yield to maturity, are commercially acceptable, and are used by the taxpayer in its financial reporting. Other spreading methods, including an annual market valuation, are permissible provided certain criteria are met. THE ACCRUAL RULES 3 1.11 When taxpayers sell or dispose of their interest in a financial arrangement, or the financial arrangement matures, the base price adjustment is calculated. This is a wash-up provision that calculates all remaining income and expenditure in relation to the financial arrangement that have not been brought to tax under the spreading provisions. 1.12 The determinations procedure in section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue power to issue determinations in relation to the accrual rules. They cover matters such as the application of the yield to maturity method to particular financial arrangements and acceptable alternative methods of spreading income and expenditure where the yield to maturity method cannot be used. Such determinations are legally binding on both the taxpayer and the Commissioner. 1.13 In order to reduce compliance costs, taxpayers who fall below appropriate thresholds are not required to spread their gains over the term of the financial arrangement; instead, they are permitted to continue to recognise income under normal principles. However, they are still required to recognise all gains from a financial arrangement, whether income or capital, and to carry out a base price adjustment to ensure that all such gains have been brought to tax. Historical background to the accrual rules 1.14 The origins of the present accrual rules lie in the announcement of the Government in the 1986 Budget of the introduction of new timing rules for the recognition of interest income and expenditure. 1.15 The introduction of the accrual rules was considered necessary to curb tax avoidance and to protect the tax base. The law prior to the introduction of the accrual rules permitted taxpayers to defer or effectively eliminate their income tax liabilities by bringing forward deductions or deferring income. This was especially evident when one party to a transaction was able to advance deductions for expenditure and the other was able to delay recognition of income. 1.16 The consultative process on the proposals began with the release of the Government’s Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure in October 1986. 1.17 Following the release of the consultative document, the Government appointed a consultative committee of tax practitioners and financial experts to hear submissions on the proposals and prepare the draft legislation necessary to implement the accrual rules. The committee widened the scope of the original scheme proposed in the consultative document. 4 1.18 The consultative document envisaged accrual rules redressing anomalies in the taxation of debt and debt instruments. The committee, however, was aware of the ease of substitution of such instruments by derivatives and combinations of transactions that were not traditional debt instruments, and the consequent opportunity for tax avoidance. Therefore, primarily owing to anti-avoidance concerns, the resulting legislation encompassed a wide range of commercial dealings. 1.19 The accrual rules, having been subjected to further refinements through the legislative process, were passed into law on 31 March 1987 in the form of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1987. The rules were radically different from previous tax law. They departed from the traditional recognition of the distinction between capital and revenue, and the requirement to spread income was much wider than was previously the case. Previous reform 1.20 Not surprisingly for such a radical and complex piece of fiscal legislation, the accrual rules have not been problem free. In 1988 the Government appointed another committee of consultants in response to growing concern about the effect of the accrual rules on property transactions and, in particular, the effect of the abolition of the distinction between capital and revenue. The recommendations in the subsequent report of the committee led to legislative changes in 1988. Inland Revenue commissioned a report in 1989 on the effect of the accrual rules on trusts and estates as a result of uncertainty over the application of the rules in this area. 1.21 Some aspects of the accrual rules were also considered by the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee. Following recommendations made by this committee in its final report in July 1990, the accrual rules were amended to allow for simplified accrual calculations for certain taxpayers and to increase the thresholds for qualification as a cash basis holder. 1.22 The Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee) was appointed in December 1989 to hear public submissions on matters concerning the design and implementation of reforms outlined in the Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital. 1.23 The Valabh Committee highlighted the accrual rules as an area of taxation law requiring review. Following the release of the committee’s final report in July 1992, legislation was introduced to deal with hire purchase agreements and bad debts. 1.24 In this document we have drawn on the excellent work of that committee, as well as that of other commentators. 5 CHAPTER 2 THE REVIEW AND SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS The purpose of this discussion document 2.1 This discussion document is part of a post-implementation review of the accrual rules. It examines the problems and anomalies of the accrual rules and puts forward proposals to resolve them. Notwithstanding those problems, the basic policy objectives underlying the rules are sound and they are essential to the protection of the tax base. 2.2 We seek submissions from the public on these proposals in order to develop simplified, more coherent and workable accruals legislation for Part E of the Act. The main issues 2.3 In its report The Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime, published in October 1991, the Valabh Committee noted that relatively few problems existed with the accrual rules in relation to the central areas on which they were originally focused, namely debts. However, the rules were ultimately applied across a wide range of financial transactions. It is in these other areas that practical problems and uncertainties most frequently arise. 2.4 We agree with the Valabh Committee that the major problem behind most of the criticisms is the lack of clear statutory guidance on the boundaries of the accrual rules and, in particular, in the definition of the term “financial arrangement”. A clearer definition of this term would assist in the application of the rules. In the interests of certainty, taxpayers need to know whether particular transactions fall within the rules. It is generally acknowledged that the present definition is too wide, including within its scope some commercial transactions that were not originally anticipated as being subject to the rules. 2.5 Two other areas that have attracted criticism are the accrual treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses, and remission income. As regards the former, criticism was founded on hedging arrangements, where there is a mismatch between a taxpayer’s economic income arising from a hedged position and the taxable income from the same hedged position. Criticism of the debt remission rules has been largely based on opposition to the idea that such economic income should be subject to tax at all. 6 2.6 Other boundary issues that have arisen are: •The definition of the term “excepted financial arrangement”. This term contains the specific statutory exclusions to the wide definition of financial arrangement and thus can govern whether or not the accrual rules apply in a particular situation. •The application of the rules to assignments of income and debt defeasances, which can take a variety of forms. The present rules give no clear guidance as to which forms should be included and which should be excluded from their ambit. •The application of the rules to wider transactions, elements of which are financial arrangements and elements of which are not. 2.7 Uncertainties arising from difficulties of application of the rules include: •The distinction between “holders” and “issuers”. The rules depend on this distinction for, amongst other things, the calculation of the base price adjustment at maturity of the financial arrangement. In some circumstances it may not be clear which party to a financial arrangement is the holder and which is the issuer. •The application of the rules on the death of a taxpayer who is a party to a financial arrangement. At present, there is uncertainty as to when a base price adjustment is required. •The application of the rules to security arrangements. 2.8 Problems arise in many areas from the failure of the legislation to reflect the policy intent, including: •the confusion that exists over the relationship between the accrual rules and other provisions in the Act, as set out in section EH 8; •the lack of clarity in the distinction between agreements for sale and purchase of property, forward contracts and futures contracts as they are used in the rules; •the overlap that can be found between the definitions of trade credit, short-term trade credit and short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property. The generic tax policy process 2.9 This review of the accrual rules is one of the elements of the generic tax policy process adopted by the Government for the development of tax policy in New Zealand. It requires the Government to review legislation after its introduction, to identify remedial issues and provide the opportunity for public comment. THE REVIEW AND SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS 7 2.10 The adoption of this process is one of a number of initiatives taken by the Government over recent years to ensure that the New Zealand tax system is effective and efficient. 2.11 This Government is committed to the clarification of tax legislation. This should bring about more logical, coherent and understandable legislation in which the policy intent is more apparent. 2.12 The policy review of the accrual rules outlined in this discussion document will form an important part of this process. It is timed to coincide with the rewrite of parts C, D and E of the Act. Benefits of the review 2.13 The expected benefits of the review of the accrual rules include: •improving the clarity of the rules to make them more workable for taxpayers, their advisers and Inland Revenue; •removing uncertainty by the resolution of questions of application of the accrual rules to specific areas; and •reducing administrative and compliance costs. SUMMARY OF MAIN PROPOSALS Definition of financial arrangement The first two limbs of the definition of financial arrangement will be retained in principle. The reference to wider financial arrangements will be made more explicit. Definition of excepted financial arrangement The list of excepted financial arrangements will be expanded to exclude more arrangements from the ambit of the rules, such as some prepayments for goods and services, and employment contracts. Wider financial arrangements The concept of wider financial arrangements will be retained and the meaning of “solely attributable” in section EH 2 clarified. Distinction between holder and issuer The distinction will be removed leading to a rewriting of the base price adjustment formula, and alignment of the deductibility and the low compliance cost provisions for all parties to a financial arrangement. 8 Spreading provisions The spreading provisions will apply to expected returns except where the market value provisions are applied. The requirement that Inland Revenue approve markets before a market valuation method can be applied will be removed. Taxpayers unable to use the yield to maturity method or determinations will be required to take into account the scheme of the accrual rules in choosing an allocation method. They must apply that method consistently to the same class of financial arrangements across income years. Taxation of foreign exchange loans and forward contracts All foreign exchange gains and losses will continue to be brought to tax under the accrual rules on the base price adjustment. Only expected foreign exchange gains and losses will be spread over the life of the arrangement. Forward rates will be used to measure expected foreign exchange gains and losses. Assignments of income and debt defeasances Absolute assignments of income and legal defeasances of debt will not create a new financial arrangement; an assignment or legal defeasance (novation) which absolutely disposes of the rights/obligations of an assignor/defeasor under an arrangement will terminate that financial arrangement for the assignor/defeasor. Arrangements other than novations or absolute assignments will create a new financial arrangement. Partial assignments and defeasances Partial assignments and defeasances of the cashflows under a financial arrangement will be required to be accounted for as a variation to a financial arrangement. Debt remission Amounts forgiven under a financial arrangement will continue to be treated as income. In certain circumstances, the sale of a debt to an associate of the debtor will be deemed to be settlement of the debt. Specified or finance leases Leases with financing characteristics entered into on or after 1 April 1999 will be included within the scope of the accrual rules. To avoid confusion with those leases entered into before 1 April 1999, leases that fall within the accrual rules will be referred to as “finance leases”. In line with the Valabh Committee recommendations, the definition of “finance lease” will be narrower than the current definition of “specified lease”. THE REVIEW AND SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS 9 Security arrangements Guarantees, security arrangements and insurance contracts will be excluded from the accrual rules, except when they are substitutes for derivative transactions such as forward contracts. Trusts and estates A transfer of a financial arrangement, necessitating a base price adjustment, will be deemed to occur on the death of any party to a financial arrangement and on the distribution of a financial arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. Section EH 4(6) (natural love and affection) will be extended to cover debts owing by a trust to the settlor in some circumstances. Deferred settlements The rules applying to trade credits and agreements for the sale and purchase of property will be integrated. The rules for these agreements will be extended to include services. Definitions The definition of agreements for the sale and purchase of property, forward contracts and futures contracts will be clarified. Miscellaneous issues • Section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to disclosure of interrelated arrangements will be repealed. • The scope of section GD 11(1) will be broadened to remove the limitation on Inland Revenue powers to set independent or market related prices. • A distribution in specie by a company in liquidation will necessitate a base price adjustment. • Temporary residents will be exempted from the requirement to calculate a base price adjustment under section EH 4(9)(d) if they become non-resident for tax purposes within three years of initially obtaining tax residence. Relationship between the accrual rules and other provisions of the Act Section EH 8(1) will be retained and will clarify the position that while the accrual rules govern timing and amount of gross income and expenditure, the core provisions determine assessability and deductibility. 10 Draft legislation 2.14 We have included at the end of some chapters indicative draft amendments to the existing legislation where we consider this will assist discussion. This is to illustrate the policy intent of the proposals in this document. The draft amendments are not, however, draft legislative proposals. Only when the policy has been finalised (after consultation) will legislation be drafted in bill form. 2.15 The draft amendments build on existing legislation. The final bill may propose a greater change in drafting style to create clearer legislation in plain English. Submissions 2.16 We invite submissions on the matters set out in this discussion document, including the draft legislation, and any other aspect of the accrual rules not specifically referred to in this discussion document. When we consider there are specific issues on which we would appreciate comment, we have indicated this at the end of the relevant chapter. When this occurs, it is not intended to limit the scope of submissions. 2.17 All submissions should be addressed to: The Accruals Review C/o General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Facsimile:(04) 474 7215 2.18 Submissions should be made by 27 February 1998. They should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. Submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. 11 CHAPTER 3 THE DEFINITION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT Proposed policy • Retain the concept of a broad definition of financial arrangement as contained in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a) of the current definition to ensure that debts, debt substitutes and derivatives are within the rules. • Remove references to “promises” in subparagraph (ii). • Include debts created by operation of law in subparagraph (i). • Repeal subparagraph (iii) and replace it with a more targeted reference to wider financial arrangements. The accrual rules and the definition of financial arrangement 3.1 The definition of financial arrangement sets the outer boundary of the accrual rules. 3.2 The accrual rules apply to every arrangement that is a financial arrangement within the definition in section OB 1. The only exceptions to this are: •Certain arrangements that are prima facie within the definition of financial arrangement are explicitly excluded from the operation of the rules (excepted financial arrangements). •The status of certain parties to a financial arrangement may affect the application of the rules (non-residents and cash basis holders). 3.3 The definition is very wide and the boundaries are not precise. This is because the definition attempts to describe the characteristics of the transactions intended to be covered, rather than listing certain classes of transactions. Practical difficulties 3.4 The current definition was deliberately cast very widely to minimise avoidance opportunities and to include both traditional debt and derivative instruments. However, it has proven to be insufficiently targeted. The broad definition gives rise to several problems. 12 Mutual promises 3.5 The current definition describes an arrangement in which one person provides money in consideration of a promise by another person to pay money in the future. “Money”, by definition, includes money’s worth, so should include the value of a future right. However, the second reference to “money” in the definition is to a promise to provide money in the future. This implies that when “money” is first referred to, that (first) consideration must be more immediate than a promise. 3.6 The resulting implication is that if the consideration to be provided by both parties is not to be provided until some time in the future (for example, deferred settlement agreement for the sale and purchase of property), the arrangement will not be a financial arrangement. If, on the other hand, promises were treated as consideration for accrual rules purposes, this lends weight to the argument that both the promise (the future right) and the actual consideration (the exercise of that right) would have to be valued. Prepayments for goods and services, such as employment contracts, bus tickets and magazine subscriptions 3.7 Prepayments for goods and services, such as employment contracts, bus tickets and magazine subscriptions fall within the definition of financial arrangement. Any discount for prepayment is income for the purchaser which, in theory, should be accounted for on an accrual basis. To enforce this would give rise to unacceptably high compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for the Government. The relationships between paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the definition, and between paragraphs (ii) and (iii) 3.8 It is possible for a debt to be created by operation of law, rather than by agreement between the parties. Thus that part of the definition contained in paragraph (i) is potentially wider than (ii), in respect of debts and yet, the term “financial arrangement” itself implies some consensual agreement. 3.9 It is not clear whether paragraph (iii) is limited by reference to paragraph (ii) – that is, is an element of futurity required before an assignment is a financial arrangement? Proposed reform 3.10 The Government has explored ways of limiting the definition of financial arrangement while still achieving the aim of the rules. THE DEFINITION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT 13 3.11 We consider that the core definition should be wide enough to include all transactions which could result in a return for any party. Our proposal, therefore, is to: •retain in principle paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the current definition of financial arrangement; •redraft paragraph (ii) to deal with mutual promises; and •make it clear that debts arising by operation of law are included. 3.12 Because we have retained a wide definition of financial arrangement, we propose to expand the definition of excepted financial arrangement to deal with the issues such as small prepayments (see chapter 4). The concept of a return 3.13 Some instruments that are not financing transactions per se are still within the scope of the accrual rules, but do not give rise to accrual income or expenditure. This is currently achieved under the accrual rules because the non-financing element of those financial arrangements is excluded from the income or expenditure calculation in the base price adjustment. Examples of these instruments are an agreement for sale and purchase where delivery and payment occur contemporaneously, and a New Zealand dollar denominated interest-free loan. In each of these cases, the transaction is a financial arrangement and a base price adjustment is required, but the base price adjustment will give a nil result. 3.14 We looked at several ways of excluding these arrangements from the scope of the rules without success. The alternative approaches we considered, and the reasons we rejected them, are set out later in this chapter. Consideration 3.15 We have reviewed the terminology used throughout the accrual rules to describe payments and other consideration. As discussed above, if paragraph (ii) distinguishes between money, and a promise to pay money in the future, this implies that “money” must refer to immediate payment. However, the definition of money uses the term “right to money”. This reference to “promises” in the definition of financial arrangement can therefore be removed. Absolute assignments 3.16 Chapter 9 deals with assignments and defeasances. For the reasons discussed there, we consider that an absolute assignment of a financial arrangement should not itself be a financial arrangement. Similar rules should be applied to assignments and defeasances of excepted financial arrangements. The reference to assignments and defeasances should be removed from the definition of financial arrangement. 14 Relationships between paragraphs (i) and (ii), and between paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the definition. 3.17 Various commentators have considered paragraph (i) of the definition to be redundant because a debt falls within paragraph (ii). This is not necessarily the case. A debt can be created by operation of law, as well as by agreement between the parties. When such a debt carries a return, that return should be subject to the accrual rules. A debt created by operation of law is still a debt within subparagraph (i) of the definition, even though it is not a consensual arrangement within subparagraph (ii). Therefore subparagraph (i) is not redundant. We do not see any conflict between subparagraphs (i) and (ii) except where “arrangement” in the term of “financial arrangement” implies a consensual arrangement, and paragraph (ii) overrides the specific word “debt” in subparagraph (i). However, for certainty we propose that debts arising by operation of law be specified in the legislation. 3.18 The relationship between subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) is more complex. Subparagraph (iii) refers to arrangements that are of a substantially similar nature to those in (i) and (ii). It is not clear what substantially similar means in this context. Subparagraph (iii) seems to be operating as a general catch-all provision, and we do not believe this is appropriate. Such a provision is useful at the end of a list, but here a broad unfocused provision follows a very widely drafted definition. 3.19 It may need to be made explicit that tripartite arrangements and composite arrangements are within the definition in subparagraph (ii). If so, it should be stated explicitly. Therefore we recommend that subparagraph (iii) be repealed and replaced with a more targeted reference to wider financial arrangements. Other options considered Valabh Committee proposal 3.20 The main feature of the Valabh Committee proposal was to limit subparagraph (ii) of the definition to arrangements in which there is a reasonable expectation of a return. This proposal is problematic because it does not bring within the main definition transactions for which there is no certainty of a return, such as forward rate agreements and swaps. These types of transactions would have to be listed in a third part of the definition and would have to be continually amended to keep up with innovation in the financial markets. We consider this would eventually lead to the problems that prompted the introduction of the broad inclusive definition – namely, the definition would not encompass innovative debt substitutes. 3.21 We agree with the Valabh Committee that there should be a more extensive definition of excepted financial arrangement. THE DEFINITION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT 15 Modified Valabh proposal – equality of consideration 3.22 These difficulties with the Valabh Committee proposal could be remedied by excluding from paragraph (ii) of the definition, arrangements in which there is a reasonable expectation of equality of consideration. 2 This approach would mean that all arrangements in which there is an expectation of movement in value of the subject of the arrangement would come within the definition. The extent to which this movement in value might be taxed is limited by specific valuation rules. An example is the lowest price concept, which takes out of the calculation of income any movement in the value of property which is the subject of an agreement for the sale and purchase of property. 3.23 On closer investigation, however, this proposal would achieve little. A deferred settlement agreement for the sale and purchase of property, even with no implicit interest charge, would still be within the rules because the value of the property transferred might move. The taxpayer would still have to go through the base price adjustment calculation to find that, in that case, there was no accrual income or expenditure because of the valuation rules. An interest-free loan would still be a financial arrangement under this analysis, because it is a debt within paragraph (i) of the definition. A foreign currency denominated arrangement would also still be within the rules, because currency movements are always likely to occur. Draft legislation “Financial arrangement” – means (a)Any debt (including any debt arising by operation of law); (b)Any arrangement under which a person obtains money in exchange for money provided by any person to any person at some future time or times, or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events (including the giving of, or failure to give, notice); (c)An arrangement that meets the criteria of paragraph (b) and that includes or is comprised of any combination of financial arrangements or excepted financial arrangements or both; other than an excepted financial arrangement that is not part of a financial arrangement. 2 Certainty would be a better test in theory, but in practice this can never be achieved. For example, there might be an unpredictable default under a loan. 16 CHAPTER 4 THE DEFINITION OF EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT Proposed policy Expand the definition of excepted financial arrangement to clarify the boundaries of the accrual rules. The main expansions are: •travellers’ cheques; •interests in a group investment fund, partnership or joint venture; •security arrangements relating to credit risk; •small variable principal debt instruments; •employment contracts; •small prepayments for goods and services; and •warranties. The accrual rules and the definition of excepted financial arrangements 4.1 A definition of excepted financial arrangement is needed to deal with arrangements that are financial arrangements within the core definition, but which for policy reasons should not be subject to the accrual rules. Those policy reasons are high compliance costs (as in short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property); equity (as in shares); or when the arrangement is subject to its own rules (as in farm-out arrangements). Practical difficulties and proposed reform 4.2 The current definition of excepted financial arrangement is too narrow. This means that the rules may be applied to arrangements that in policy terms are not intended to fall within their scope. The Valabh Committee recommended specific additions to the proposed definition of excepted financial arrangement if exclusion from the rules could not be achieved through contracting the definition of financial arrangement. 3 We have reviewed the Valabh Committee recommendations and other proposals and detail our list of proposed exclusions below, from paragraph 4.5. 3 Operational Aspects of the Accrual Regime: Discussion Paper, October 1991, page 14. THE DEFINITION OF EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT 17 Other options considered 4.3 We considered defining excepted financial arrangements by feature, such as describing equity as an excepted financial arrangement, and listing the features of equity in order to assist identification. However, we concluded that this would only create another uncertain boundary within the accrual rules, and that taxpayers are better served by a definitive list of arrangements that are specifically excluded. A similar idea was tried unsuccessfully in the United States in the 1980s, 4 but the regulations defining the debt/equity boundary were withdrawn as they proved to be no more helpful than the case law. 4.4 Narrowing by detail implies that everything not on the list is a financial arrangement, and generally this is considered to be bad drafting style. However, when these exclusions are made for compliance cost reasons, the boundaries can be justified and they do not necessarily create pressure to extend them on other policy grounds. Proposed changes to arrangements currently falling within the definition of excepted financial arrangement A debenture to which sections FC 1 or FC 2 applies 4.5 Debentures within sections FC 1 and FC 2 have the characteristics of an equity instrument. A share is defined in section OB 1 to include an interest in the capital of a company and any debenture to which section FC 1 or section FC 2 applies. This exclusion should therefore be repealed because it is covered by the general exclusion for shares. Leases 4.6 Specified leases were excluded from the accrual rules because they had their own rules. Other leases were excluded because they are not financing transactions. Prepayments under a lease are dealt with under the accrual expenditure provisions in section EF1. 4.7 The Valabh Committee recommended bringing specified leases within the accrual rules. We agree with that proposal (see chapter 12). Finance leases entered into on or after 1 April 1999 will be financial arrangements. Other leases will continue to be excepted financial arrangements. 4 Treasury regulations proposed under section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code - first proposed in 1980 and withdrawn in 1983. 18 Short-term agreements 4.8 Trade credits will be integrated with the rules governing agreements for the sale and purchase of property. Short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property will continue to be excepted financial arrangements but, as is now the case for short-term trade credits, will be able to be treated as financial arrangements on an elective basis. The short-term trade credit exclusion will be repealed, therefore, because it will be redundant. 4.9 Short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property will also cover agreements for the provision of services (see chapter 15). Proposed additions to the definition of excepted financial arrangement Travellers’ cheques 4.10 Currently, travellers’ cheques are financial arrangements. Excluding them from the accrual rules will reduce compliance costs of accounting for changes in exchange rate movements between the date of purchasing travellers’ cheques and the date they are presented. Interest in a group investment fund 4.11 An interest in a group investment fund (GIF) is a type of equity interest. A group investment fund allows a trustee company to gather the funds of small investors into an administratively efficient entity. Although some aspects of the company taxation rules can apply to GIFs, an interest in a GIF is not an interest in a company (and therefore not a share) for the purposes of the Act. 4.12 The intention of the legislation is that equity instruments should not be included in the rules. In practice, Inland Revenue has taken the position that GIFs are not financial arrangements. 5 The proposed amendment clarifies the intent of the legislation. Interests in a partnership or joint venture 4.13 The Valabh Committee considered that partnership and joint venture interests were the major addition to the excepted financial arrangement definition in the “equity” category. It was never intended that such interests were financial arrangements and they will be added to the excepted financial arrangement list to make this clear. The exclusion does not extend to financial arrangements held or issued by the partnership or joint venture. 5 Tax Information Bulletin, No. 6, December 1989, page 1. THE DEFINITION OF EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT 19 Security arrangements 4.14 Security arrangements will be included in the definition of excepted financial arrangement to the extent they relate to credit risk (see chapter 13). The exclusion will not extend to arrangements that secure a person against various price fluctuations, such as foreign exchange and interest rate movement, since these arrangements could be used as substitutes for derivative contracts. Insurance contracts that indemnify a person against foreign exchange movements should also be included in the accrual rules on the same basis. VPDIs and promissory notes issued at par (including cheques) if the accounts or VPDIs do not exceed $20,000 4.15 A variable principal debt instrument (VPDI) is defined in section OB 1 as a bank deposit account or other financial arrangement for which it is contemplated that the holder may advance further sums to the issuer upon demand. This would include most credit card facilities. 4.16 The rationale for excluding these small VPDIs is based on compliance costs, since record keeping for such an instrument over an extended period is onerous and there are no substantial deferral opportunities with these kinds of instruments. The exclusion will apply to New Zealand dollar as well as foreign currency denominated VPDIs. The limit of NZD20,000 per person is appropriate. It is the same threshold we have suggested for small prepayments of goods and services. Employment contracts 4.17 An employment contract can be a financial arrangement because a person (employer) obtains money (in this case money’s worth is represented by work) in consideration for a promise by any person (the employer) to provide money (wages or salary) to any person (the employee) at some future time or times. 4.18 We believe these would usually be excluded as short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property (assuming these rules apply to services) based on a continuous supply. However, the matter is not beyond doubt, in our view. We therefore propose to add them to the excepted financial arrangement list. Cash basis persons providing on demand loans without interest, discount or premium 4.19 Where a cash basis person provides a loan that is denominated in New Zealand currency, repayable on demand, and does not carry a premium, discount or right to receive interest, no accrual income or remission income can arise. For this reason the holder’s interest in these loans will not be subject to the accrual rules. 20 Small prepayments for goods and services 4.20 The Valabh Committee recommended excluding contracts that are exclusively for the provision of services (except financial services). This was to make it clear that bus tickets and the like cannot be interpreted as falling within the definition of financial arrangement. 6 4.21 This proposal conflicts with the committee’s alternative proposal to include services in the definition of property and would be difficult to implement, as it requires a detailed definition of financial services. 4.22 Instead, we propose a $20,000 threshold for prepayments for goods and services. This will avoid the unacceptably high compliance and administrative costs associated with small prepayments. Arrangements in which the amount lent is denominated in a foreign currency 4.23 Any arrangement in which the rights acquired by a cash basis person are to obtain money lent, the money is expressed in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, and the person applies the money for private and domestic purposes is to be excluded from the accrual rules. 4.24 This exception is designed to cover private or domestic borrowings in a foreign currency, such as an overseas mortgage. The rationale for the exclusion is removal of the compliance costs of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses for relatively small transactions. 4.25 A transitional provision will apply when funds cease to be used for private and domestic purposes. It will operate by deeming the issuer to have issued a financial arrangement for an arm’s length price at the time the borrowed money ceases to be used for private and domestic purposes. Warranties 4.26 The Court of Appeal in CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd 7 made it clear that a warranty and a sale and purchase agreement were one inseparable financial arrangement that was an excepted financial arrangement (a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property). However, there is a wider issue of whether warranties that are less well integrated with a sale and purchase agreement should be included in the accrual rules. 4.27 Warranties should not be accounted for under the accrual rules if the arrangements are not debt or debts substitutes. These should be treated consistently with other contingent contracts such as guarantees and insurance contracts. 6 Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime: Discussion Paper, October 1991, page 22. 7 (1994) 16 NZTC, 11,099.

Wider financial arrangements and the accrual rules 5.1 The current definition of financial arrangement can apply to a series of subordinate arrangements. 5.2 The concept of a wider financial arrangement is necessary because without it, the intent of the rules could be defeated. A wider financial arrangement can be constructed from a combination of financial arrangements or excepted financial arrangements to create the same return as a financial arrangement. 5.3 The return on a wider financial arrangement that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is excluded from the operation of the rules. The statutory provision giving effect to this is section EH 2: The amount of the gross income deemed to be derived or the expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified accrual rules shall not include the amount of any income, gain or loss, or expenditure, that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement that is part of the financial arrangement. 24 Practical difficulties If the wider financial arrangement includes one or more excepted financial arrangements 5.4 The distinction between financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement is reflected in the current rules in that any part of the income from a wider financial arrangement that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, is excluded by section EH 2. The confusion in this area arises from the fact that the accrual rules cover some debt substitutes, such as the loan element in a deferred settlement agreement for sale and purchase of property, and yet many equity instruments that on the surface appear to be debt substitutes are excluded by section EH 2. Thus the relationship between section EH 2 and the stated policy intent of the rules is not clear. 5.5 In practical terms, this means that it is not always clear whether a particular part of a wider financial arrangement should be excluded under section EH 2, and if so, how the amount to be excluded should be calculated. 5.6 Section EH 2 purports to exclude from the rules an amount of income that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, but gives no guidance as to how this amount is to be calculated. It is not clear what “solely” means in this context. 5.7 There are two extreme approaches to the interpretation of “solely attributable” in section EH 2: •If the excepted financial arrangement would not have been entered into without the wider financial arrangement, none of the income from the wider financial arrangement is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement. •If part of the wider financial arrangement is an excepted financial arrangement, any income attributed to it by the arrangement is excluded from the accrual rules. 5.8 The first approach would render section EH 2 redundant, as it could never achieve its purpose of preserving the distinction between financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement. 5.9 The second approach may be too simplistic. It should be clear that the parties to a financial arrangement cannot defeat the purpose of the rules by attributing income to an excepted financial arrangement that is part of a wider financial arrangement. WIDER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS 25 If all of the subordinate arrangements are financial arrangements 5.10 A wider financial arrangement can be a combination of arrangements that are financial arrangements in themselves. An example is a foreign currency denominated agreement to purchase several trucks over a three-year period, with different delivery and settlement dates for each truck. 5.11 There are currently no specific rules to guide taxpayers in the treatment of these arrangements. The wider financial arrangement could be broken down into its component parts (arrangement to purchase each truck) and each subordinate arrangement taxed as if it were a stand-alone financial arrangement. Alternatively, the entire agreement could be treated as one wider financial arrangement. If all the subordinate arrangements are subject to the same set of rules (for example, the consideration for each subordinate arrangement is valued in the same way) this would yield a result not materially different from the result achieved by breaking the arrangement down. 5.12 If the wider financial arrangement comprises financial arrangements that are subject to different valuation rules, the two approaches described above could give materially different results, and it is not clear which valuation rules should be used. Options for change 5.13 The concept of a wider financial arrangement is necessary to counter the construction of financial arrangements to defeat the intention of the accrual rules. 5.14 Amalgamating the components into a wider financial arrangement is referred to as “integration”. Our rules do not adopt a full integration approach, as this is sustainable only where there is no distinction between financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement to be preserved. Breaking a wider financial arrangement down into component parts is referred to as “bifurcation”. This is what section EH 2 aims to achieve. If the wider financial arrangement includes one or more excepted financial arrangements How should the amount to be excluded be calculated? 5.15 Difficulties arise in determining the extent to which it is appropriate to separate out any part of the return on a wider financial arrangement that is properly attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, and in determining the best method for calculating any amount to be excluded. The excepted financial arrangement component of a wider financial arrangement should be separated out by using pricing or valuation rules. We propose that if the terms and conditions (including the consideration paid for the excepted financial arrangement) on which the excepted 26 financial arrangement are issued are such that it would stand alone on those terms and conditions, it can properly be said that the return on that excepted financial arrangement is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement. However, if those terms are dependent on the issue of the wider financial arrangement, the return cannot be said to be solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement. Convertible notes 5.16 This valuation approach is consistent with that adopted by the determinations dealing with convertible notes. Determination G22: Optional Conversion Convertible Notes sets out a method for determining that part of the acquisition price, and that part of the consideration, that is attributable to the excepted financial arrangement. The method involves taking the expected cashflows under the arrangement and discounting them back. 8 This discounted amount gives the acquisition price for the debt component. What excepted financial arrangements should be excluded? 5.17 Some financial arrangements are excluded from the accrual rules as a concession where the costs of complying would be onerous and there is little scope for defeating the intent of the rules. Short-term agreements that provide little scope for deferral are a good example of this. Unless the wider arrangement as a whole is an excepted financial arrangement, that concession need not apply. We consider that section EH 2 should not exclude those arrangements that are excepted financial arrangements on compliance cost grounds only. Examples of these are short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property, travellers’ cheques and some foreign currency denominated borrowings. If all the subordinate arrangements are financial arrangements 5.18 If the wider financial arrangement comprises more than one financial arrangement, the consideration passing under that wider financial arrangement should be measured according to the value of that consideration on the day it passes under paragraph (e) of the definition of core acquisition price. There are special rules governing the value of consideration that passes under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property, hire purchase agreement and trade credit. These rules were developed to deal with transactions where the main purpose of the arrangement is to transfer property between the parties. Where property is being used as a vehicle for transferring some other benefit, those rules should not apply. In chapter 15 we discuss the definition of an agreement for the sale and purchase of property, and note that the special rules for valuing consideration under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property should not apply where the agreement contemplates settlement by 8 Using rates provided in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, which are essentially market rates. WIDER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS 27 any means other than the delivery of the property. Our proposal here, that parties to a wider financial arrangement should not be able to take advantage of those rules, is consistent with that approach. Other options considered 5.19 The boundary between financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements is most marked in the cases of the debt/equity boundary. Many commentators have come to the view that the only solution to the difficulty with this boundary in the context of financial arrangements, is to remove the distinction altogether and tax all equity on an accrual basis. 5.20 We do not consider this to be a viable proposition. As discussed in chapters 3 and 4, there are valid reasons for preserving the distinction between financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement: •From the taxpayer’s point of view, the debt/equity boundary could be undermined if merely by aggregating arrangements into a wider financial arrangement, equity was subject to the accrual rules. This would place more pressure on the definition of financial arrangement. •It would not necessarily be clear to taxpayers whether various arrangements subject to their own regime (farm-out arrangements, insurance, shares) would be subject to the accrual rules or to their own regime. •We have a well developed dividend imputation system for the taxation of equity and do not propose to interfere with that. Specific issue for consultation This chapter sets out the principles under which paragraph (c) of the proposed definition of financial arrangement and section EH 2 should be applied. We would like comment on any problems that might arise from the practical application of these principles. 28 CHAPTER 6 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOLDER AND ISSUER Proposed policy Remove the distinction between holders and issuers and apply the same rules to any party to a financial arrangement. This will result in: • The removal of the acquisition price terminology and the rewriting of the base price adjustment formula. • The alignment of the deductibility rules for all parties to a financial arrangement so that expenditure arising on a base price adjustment will give rise to a deduction if the core deductibility tests are satisfied. If those deductibility requirements are not met, taxpayers who have been overtaxed in previous years may be entitled to a deduction. The maximum deduction will be equal to the amount of overtaxation in previous years. • The cash basis concession (subject to certain thresholds) being extended to all parties to a financial arrangement who are natural persons. This will be optional. • The repeal of the discretionary powers of the Commissioner in sections EH 1(9) and EH 3(2)(a). The distinction between holder and issuer and the accrual rules 6.1 The accrual rules distinguish between holders and issuers of financial arrangements. The holder is generally the person who will receive a pecuniary benefit from the arrangement. The issuer is the person who is not the holder. 6.2 The distinction has evolved from the traditional concept of a debt instrument where a lender (the holder of the instrument) lends a principal amount to the borrower (the issuer of the instrument acknowledging the debt). Practical difficulties 6.3 This terminology is not always appropriate. Financial risk management instruments such as options, forward exchange contracts, futures, swaps, and forward rate agreements incorporate risk and return concepts that are expressed differently from the lending of a principal amount. Some financial arrangements may not have any principal cashflows: they may simply contain a mechanism whereby it is agreed to settle in cash any difference arising under the arrangement. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOLDER AND ISSUER 29 6.4 Other problems with the distinction between holder and issuer are: •A party to a financial arrangement can be a holder at times and an issuer at others. For example, as in a credit card account, where one can be in debit or credit. •A party may be defined as the holder but in economic substance should be an issuer. An example of this is a property agreement in which the seller (defined as the holder) receives payment in advance of the delivery of the property. •It is not always obvious which party is the holder and which party is the issuer. For example, under the pecuniary benefit test both parties may be a holder under a forward contract for foreign exchange. Proposed reform 6.5 We propose to remove the distinction between holders and issuers and apply the same rules to any party to a financial arrangement. 6.6 This means we will have to deal with a number of issues where the current rules depend on that distinction, such as the base price adjustment formula, the concept of acquisition price, automatic deductibility for holders, and the cash basis holder’s concession. These issues are dealt with in this chapter. The base price adjustment 6.7 At present, for the purposes of the base price adjustment calculation, the amount of consideration paid to the holder is compared with the acquisition price paid by the holder in relation to the financial arrangement. The amount of consideration paid by the issuer is compared with the acquisition price paid to the issuer. Example With a loan of $100 at 10% for one year, for the lender (holder) the base price adjustment would be “a” consideration of $110, less “b” the acquisition price of $100. This gives a result of $10, which, because it is positive, is income for the holder. The base price adjustment for the borrower (issuer) is “a” consideration paid of $110 less ”b” the acquisition price of $100. This gives a result of $10, which, because it is positive, is expenditure of the issuer. 30 6.8 Another way of expressing this relationship, but without distinguishing between holders and issuers, is to compare the amount of consideration paid to and by a person. Using this approach, a positive outcome is always income and a negative outcome always expenditure. 6.9 Our proposal is that the base price adjustment be changed to: a - b - c + d + e where: a =all consideration paid to the person (everything received) b=all consideration paid by the person (everything paid) c=income derived in all previous income years d=expenditure incurred in all previous income years e=any amounts that have been remitted by the person. 6.10 A positive amount would be gross income derived and a negative amount would be expenditure incurred. The expenditure would be subject to the core provisions of the Act to determine deductibility. Example Using the previous example, for the lender, the base price adjustment would be “a” consideration received of $110, less “b” consideration paid of $100, giving $10, which, being positive, is income. For the borrower, the base price adjustment would be “a” consideration received of $100, less “b” consideration paid of $110, giving ($10), which, being negative, is expenditure. 9 The acquisition price and consideration 6.11 With the removal of the distinction between holder and issuer, the concept of acquisition price no longer works for the base price adjustment. This is because the acquisition price would be item “a” for one party to the financial arrangement, and item “b” for the other. 6.12 However, the acquisition price concept contains the rules that have been developed to determine the amount deemed to be consideration for certain types of financial arrangements. Apart from the general market valuation rule (in paragraph (e) of the definition of core acquisition price), valuation rules apply to: 9 Other examples of the application of the new base price adjustment can be found in chapters 8, 9 and 12. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOLDER AND ISSUER 31 •non-market value transfers subject to the anti-avoidance section; •trade credits; •agreements for the sale and purchase of property or specified options; and •hire purchase agreements. 6.13 Our proposed base price adjustment formula does not use the acquisition price terminology, but refers only to “consideration”. Although the acquisition price terminology will be removed, those same valuation rules will be retained. It may be possible to rationalise some of those rules. The indicative draft legislation at the end of this chapter shows one way in which this might be achieved. Section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would have to be amended to give specific authority for the Commissioner to determine a price for finance leases, and for prepayments. Prepayments are discussed in chapter 15. Fees 6.14 The acquisition price concept discussed in the preceding paragraphs is the core acquisition price adjusted for non-contingent fees that exceed 2% of the core acquisition price. 6.15 Since we propose that this 2% threshold be removed, and that only contingent fees be spread, there is no need for a distinction between the acquisition price and the core acquisition price (see chapter 17). Automatic deductibility 6.16 There are different consequences for holders and issuers under the base price adjustment. A negative adjustment for a holder is currently automatically deductible without having regard to the core provisions. 6.17 These rules reflect, in part, the initial thrust of the 1986 reforms, which proposed that the accrual rules tax all economic gains and allow deductions for all losses for both holders and issuers. This approach, however, would have enabled deductions for capital losses for both holders and issuers. This would have been a significant extension of the deductibility rules and was thus later modified, because such an approach is not appropriate in an income tax system which does not tax all sources of income. 6.18 Even so, holders of financial arrangements could be disadvantaged if they were not entitled to a deduction for negative amounts on a base price adjustment. This is because in some cases they might have paid tax on gains over the life of the financial arrangement (for example, on foreign exchange gains) that were not eventually realised. An entitlement to an automatic deduction for these overstatements is appropriate. 32 6.19 However, the automatic deduction as it currently applies is problematic for two reasons: •It extends deductibility to one group (holders) when there is not always a rational reason for the distinction between holders and issuers. •It provides an incentive for taxpayers to create financial arrangements to take advantage of the provision. 6.20 We propose that for any party to a financial arrangement, a negative base price adjustment will give rise to a deduction if either: •the core deductibility tests are satisfied; or •the loss arises because of an overstatement of amounts deemed to be income derived in previous income years. 6.21 This will better reflect the original policy intent and can be calculated relatively simply by reference to the base price adjustment. Amounts of income derived and expenditure incurred in previous years appear as items “c” and “d” in the proposed base price adjustment formula. 10 A negative base price adjustment result can then be deductible up to a specified maximum amount. That maximum will be equal to income previously returned, less expenditure previously deducted, represented as item “c” less item “d” of the formula. Cash basis method 6.22 If there is no longer a distinction between holders and issuers, the cash basis method of accounting for income and expenditure under a financial arrangement (currently available only to natural persons who are holders) will have to be either removed or extended. The policy objective behind the cash basis method is to reduce compliance costs for individual taxpayers. This is recognised as being appropriate for parties other than holders, as is evidenced by Determination G15: Exemption from section 64C for Small Debtors, which allows a cash basis for some debtors with low levels of borrowing. 6.23 We intend, therefore, to extend availability of the cash basis method to any natural person who is a party to a financial arrangement. The Commissioner will then rescind Determination G15. 10 Both items are incorporated in item “c” in the current formula. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOLDER AND ISSUER 33 6.24 The threshold for the cash basis method will also be amended. The cash basis method will be available to a natural person who is party to financial arrangements with a face value in total of not more than a certain dollar value. The current level is $600,000 for holders, and $200,000 for qualifying small debtors under Determination G15. We suggest $1,000,000 as an appropriate threshold. This conforms with the threshold for availability of the straight-line method – another low compliance cost option. 6.25 We consider the income test should also be retained because it allows more scope for people to come within the provision. For example, some financial arrangements may not be easy to value, or arrangements with a value of more than $1,000,000 may not generate significant amounts of income. The income test threshold could be raised to $100,000. 6.26 Currently if the difference between income calculated on a yield to maturity (or straight-line) basis and on a cash basis is more than $20,000, the cash basis method is not available. We appreciate that this test imposes compliance costs on taxpayers who have significant interests in financial arrangements which are issued at a large discount or premium. Those taxpayers are required to calculate and apply both accrual and cash methods to determine whether they are eligible to use the cash basis method. However, we propose to retain this test because removal of it could lead to an unacceptably high level of deferral. Cash base price adjustment 6.27 Removal of the holder and issuer distinction means that the cash base price adjustment in section EH 4, which currently applies only to holders, must be changed. We consider that the new base price adjustment can be applied to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers. Commissioner’s discretionary powers 6.28 A discretionary power is difficult to justify in the self-assessment environment. Our starting point, therefore, is that these powers should be repealed, unless there is good reason to retain them. 6.29 Section EH 1(9) gives the Commissioner the discretion not to require issuers to comply with the spreading requirements of section EH 1. This is effectively allowing a cash basis method for issuers and, as noted above, the Commissioner has already issued one determination in respect of qualifying small debtors. Section EH 3(2) gives the Commissioner the discretion either to deem individuals to be cash basis holders (paragraph (a)) or not (paragraph (b)). 6.30 If the distinction between holder and issuer is removed, the cash basis method will be extended to issuers, which will render the discretion in section EH 1(9) redundant. Therefore we consider that the Commissioner’s discretion in section EH 1(9) can be repealed. 34 6.31 The discretion in section EH 3(2)(a) should also be repealed. It would seem to be useful only when the threshold for the cash basis method has been breached. Although thresholds are arbitrary, if each such threshold in the Act were subject to a Commissioner’s discretion, it would create uncertainty for taxpayers. 6.32 We propose, however, that the discretion in section EH 3(2)(b), which allows the Commissioner to deem persons not to be cash basis holders for certain classes of financial arrangement, be retained. This is aimed at schemes promoted to exploit the ability to defer tax by using the cash basis method. Scheme promoters in any particular case can apply for a binding product ruling to ensure that the Commissioner will not use his discretion. Election not to use the cash basis method 6.33 The cash basis method is currently mandatory, and there is no scope for a person below the cash basis threshold to account on an accrual basis. We consider that an accrual method should be available to any taxpayer wishing to use it. 6.34 Our proposal is that natural persons below the cash basis threshold will be required to use the cash basis method, unless they elect to use an accrual method. This election should be given a year in advance. The rules introduced in 1996 11 for electing to treat short-term trade credits as financial arrangements are similar, and to adopt them will provide consistency within the accrual rules. Following notification, the accrual method would apply from the beginning of the next income year. Any such election will apply to all financial arrangements held or issued by that taxpayer. 6.35 Taxpayers becoming eligible to use the cash basis method will automatically be required to use this method. The exception is that when moving from an accrual basis to a cash basis, taxpayers can continue to treat financial arrangements held at that time on an accrual basis. If they wish to continue using an accrual method, they will have to notify the Commissioner in that year. Specific issues for consultation Are there occasions when the removal of the automatic deduction for holders would deny a deduction that ought, on policy grounds, to be available? 11 Section EH 10. 35 Draft legislation EH 4 GROSS INCOME AND EXPENDITURE WHERE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT REDEEMED OR DISPOSED OF EH 4 (1) Where, in relation to any person, a financial arrangement matures, is remitted (other than by way of being written off as a bad debt), sold, or otherwise transferred by the person in any income year, the amount of the base price adjustment in relation to that income year and that person, and that financial arrangement, shall be the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a – b – c + d + e where – ais the amount of all consideration that has been paid, and all further consideration that has or will become payable, to the person in relation to the financial arrangement;

and (B)all amounts that are dividends within the meaning of section CF 2(1)(b) (being dividends which, if the transaction giving rise to the dividend had been effected with a shareholder of the relevant company, would have been dividends within the meaning of section CF 2(1)(b)) within the meaning of section CF 2(1)(k), that are derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement; and (C)all amounts that are gross income of the person under section DC 2(1) in respect of the financial arrangement; dis all amounts, except non-contingent fees, that are expenditure of the person in respect of the financial arrangement in all previous income years since the acquisition of the financial arrangement;

The requirement for consistency will apply unless there are sound commercial reasons for change. The taxpayer, in this event, must notify Inland Revenue of the change. The spreading provisions and the accrual rules 7.1 Debt instruments can have expected and unexpected returns. The accrual rules, in order to tax debt instruments and debt substitutes consistently, bring to account all gains and losses, both expected and unexpected, by way of the base price adjustment on maturity or transfer of financial arrangements. The total amount of gross income or expenditure associated with a financial arrangement is determined by reference to all consideration paid to and by a person. 7.2 In order to minimise opportunities to defer gains or accelerate losses that would, under a realisation-based system, be taxed only on maturity, gains and losses that are expected to arise are spread over the term of financial arrangement. The spreading provisions provide methods that allocate this income or expenditure to income years. 7.3 Subsection EH 1(1) establishes a link between the base price adjustment and the spreading provisions. This is because section EH 1, like section EH 4, refers to consideration paid to or by a person. This indicates that amounts that will not be included in the base price adjustment should not be subject to the spreading provisions. THE SPREADING PROVISIONS 39 7.4 One exception to the rule that only expected gains or losses are spread, is where a market valuation method is used. Market valuation accrues expected and unexpected gains or losses by valuing arrangements periodically and taxing the change in value over the period. Methods provided by determination may be another exception to the general rule. Practical difficulties 7.5 Problems and criticisms have arisen regarding the application of the spreading provisions. These include: •uncertainty over the relationship between the different accrual methods; •the restrictive nature of the market valuation method; •in the absence of a determination and if the yield to maturity method cannot be used, uncertainty whether a taxpayer is entitled to use a market valuation method under a general provision; and •the robustness of the consistency requirements. Proposed reform 7.6 The main accrual methods are yield to maturity, market valuation, and methods set out in determinations. These methods are to be retained, although the relationship between them will be clarified. Yield to maturity is the primary method, and when this cannot be used, either a determination must be followed, or an alternative method within the provisos to section EH 1(2) or EH (1)(5)(a), must be followed. The alternative method in section EH (1)(5)(b) can be used only when there is no determination. A market value method can be used in the circumstances described below. Straight-line and cash basis methods are available for certain taxpayers. Yield to maturity method 7.7 The yield to maturity method is applied if cashflows can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Increases or decreases in value of the financial arrangement associated with changes in market prices, such as interest rates, are brought to account on realisation through the base price adjustment. No changes are proposed to this section. Market valuation 7.8 Market valuation provides the best comprehensive measure of income. 40 7.9 However, the approach can cause problems including: •valuation problems if there is no active secondary market for an instrument; and •potential deductions for doubtful or bad debts. 7.10 Its use is limited, therefore, to dealers in financial arrangements who are entitled to deductions for losses on those traded instruments, and to certain markets (futures and foreign exchange market) where the risk of default is low and a market valuation basis is the easiest way of calculating accrued income or expenditure. 7.11 The requirement that the Commissioner approve the market before a market valuation method is applied is to be amended. Taxpayers will be able to continue to use a price from a market approved by the Commissioner, which will provide certainty for taxpayers. Alternatively, taxpayers may use prices from non-approved markets provided they can show the Commissioner that the prices obtained are reliable arm’s length prices on which market participants are prepared to act. The objective criteria that should be considered in determining whether markets are reliable include: •the number of participants in the market or having access to the market; •the frequency of trading in the market; •the existence of an appropriate regulatory body; •the existence of industry standards regulating trading practices; and •the accessibility of sources of information to market participants. 7.12 Taxpayers will be allowed to mark to related markets if there is no, or an inadequate, direct market in the instrument. Examples are over the counter traded options marked to a futures market, and swaps marked to the market in the indicator rates. This will allow taxpayers to use methods which have regard to such factors as volatility. 7.13 The valuation methods will not be prescribed, although the general conditions in section EH 1(6) must be met: the person must be a dealer and must consistently apply the method for tax and financial accounting, and the method must be commercially acceptable. THE SPREADING PROVISIONS 41 Determinations 7.14 When the yield to maturity method does not apply, the Commissioner may issue determinations setting out the appropriate tax treatment of the financial arrangement. Methods prescribed in determinations are currently required to result in an allocation of income or expenditure to income years in a way that has regard to the tenor of section EH 1(2), that is, yield to maturity. 12 7.15 This requirement is too narrow. Determinations should have regard to the broader spreading requirements of the accrual rules. This means determinations based on yield to maturity, market valuation or another appropriate allocation method can be issued. Alternative methods 7.16 The purpose of providing alternative spreading methods to those set out in legislation or determinations is to reduce compliance costs by enabling taxpayers to use the same methods of accounting for tax and financial reporting purposes. 7.17 Alternative methods are acceptable if they have regard to the principles of accrual accounting and: •are consistent with the method used for financial reporting; •are consistent with commercially acceptable practice; and •provide results that are not materially different to yield to maturity or the relevant determination. 7.18 We do not propose changing these criteria. They are flexible enough to enable changing practice to be taken into account, while ensuring that alternative methods of accrual do not have significant tax base effects. In the absence of a determination 7.19 Where the yield to maturity, straight-line or market value method cannot be applied and there is no relevant determination, section EH 1(5)(b) provides that a taxpayer may use another method if it is commercially acceptable practice and applied consistently for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the method must result in an allocation to each income year that is fair and reasonable and has regard to the tenor of the yield to maturity method. 12 Section 90(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 42 7.20 There are two problems with this provision. First, the reference to yield to maturity is too restrictive. A method should be acceptable if it has regard to the tenor of the spreading provisions. Where financial reporting is inconsistent with the tenor of the spreading provisions, the spreading provisions should take precedence. Another method, such as market valuation, should then be allowed. 7.21 The reference to financial reporting in section EH 1(5)(b) also means that where a taxpayer does not prepare financial reports, such as an issuer who is a natural person, the provision does not apply. Determination G12: Accounting for a Financial Arrangement in the Absence of a Determination attempts to fill this gap in the legislation. It is better to legislate for this situation, and we propose that a taxpayer who does not prepare financial accounts should use a method which is fair and reasonable, having regard to the tenor of the accrual rules. Consistency criteria 7.22 The purpose of consistency requirements is to minimise the ability to manipulate income or expenditure by changing the method used to calculate gains and losses from a financial arrangement. Consistency requirements are most important where different methods of accounting may produce materially different results – for example, market valuation compared with a spreading method that brings only expected income and expenditure to tax. 7.23 Our proposed policy is that: •Taxpayers will use the same method for all financial arrangements of the same class, unless Inland Revenue approves otherwise. •The same method will be consistently applied across income years unless there is a valid commercial reason for change. 7.24 Taxpayers who wish to change methods for commercial reasons will have to give notice, together with details of the reason for change, to Inland Revenue by the end of the filing period for their income year before that in which the change is to take effect. These proposals will not affect the taxpayer’s ability to use different methods under section EH 1 (7). 43 CHAPTER 8 THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOANS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS Proposed policy •Continue to bring to tax all foreign exchange gains and losses under the accrual rules on the base price adjustment. •Spread only expected foreign exchange gains and losses over the life of the arrangement. •Use forward rates to measure expected foreign exchange gains and losses. •Allow taxpayers to continue to use market value based spreading if they meet the requirements of the Act. Treatment of foreign exchange under the accrual rules 8.1 The objective of the accrual rules is to treat all forms of debt as consistently as possible, so as to minimise the impact of tax on the structuring of debt instruments. This means that all gains to a financial arrangement should be taxed, and the expected or anticipated gains should be spread over the life of the arrangement. 8.2 This objective was put simply in relation to foreign currency denominated instruments in the report of the Consultative Committee, which said: Accrued gains and losses on \[foreign currency denominated\] instruments are measurable and clearly alter the wealth of the business; it is consistent over time to provide the same income tax treatment in this context as is provided for other debt instruments denominated in New Zealand dollars, where domestic interest rates move. 13 8.3 In the case of foreign currency denominated instruments, it is necessary, therefore, to take into account expected movements in exchange rates, since they form as much a part of the return as do interest payments. For example, if a taxpayer purchases a yen denominated security which pays interest at a rate of, say, 3%, the taxpayer will generally expect the yen to appreciate over the term of the security so that the overall risk-adjusted yield is equivalent to what could have been earned on a New Zealand dollar denominated security. If the anticipated exchange gain is not accrued, the true interest income derived by the taxpayer would be understated, which would create incentives to hold financial assets denominated in “hard” currencies. 13 Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure, April 1987, page 12. 44 8.4 Similarly, if a taxpayer issues a debt denominated in a currency where the domestic interest rate is 25%, that currency will be expected to depreciate over the term of the loan so that the cost of borrowing does not exceed the rate at which the taxpayer could borrow in New Zealand dollars. In this case the true interest expense (and taxpayer’s deductions) would be overstated if the anticipated foreign exchange gain were not accrued for tax purposes. Valabh Committee recommendations 8.5 The Valabh Committee noted taxpayer concerns over the fact that foreign exchange was the only area of the accrual rules where unexpected and unrealised gains were brought to tax on a mandatory basis. The Committee said that accruing only anticipated gains using forward rates seemed an attractive compromise to overcome these concerns, although it noted two flaws in the approach. We consider these problems can be addressed. 8.6 The first problem was that forward rates are available only a few years in advance. We believe that advances in financial markets and information technology mean this is no longer a constraint. Quoted forward rates are now more accessible, and where a rate is not quoted, ready access to spreadsheet software makes their calculation from interest rate information reasonably straightforward. 8.7 The second problem, which was first raised in the 1986 consultative document, is the potential for investors to realise losses and defer gains. We share this concern, especially in relation to forward contracts for foreign currency, but note that taxpayers currently have the opportunity to realise losses on domestic debt instruments without bringing to tax unexpected increases in value. We believe similar treatment for foreign currency denominated arrangements should not pose a greater problem so long as all the expected gains are spread. Treatment of foreign currency loans 8.8 The treatment of foreign currency denominated loans is governed by Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. It broadly follows the accounting treatment of foreign exchange loans in that changes in the spot value of the loan are brought to tax on each balance date. This is done by returning as income or expenditure the difference between the opening and closing book value of the loan in New Zealand dollars, and any consideration given or received over the course of the year at the spot exchange rate on the relevant day. THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOANS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS 45 Problems with the current treatment 8.9 The current treatment of foreign currency loans causes problems for some taxpayers, where gains from changes in the spot exchange rate are reversed in the future and therefore never realised. 8.10 In most situations, a market value based approach provides the best measure of income. We recognise, however, that the current treatment is causing some difficulties because of the volatile nature of spot exchange rates. It is possible in this case to overcome these problems by deferring the tax on unexpected gains until realisation, without distorting taxpayer’s investment decisions. 8.11 This approach would be more consistent with the scheme of the accrual rules – that is, to spread only the anticipated gain or loss on an arrangement. 8.12 This can be compared to the tax treatment of a domestic bond. The anticipated yield is taxed over the life of the arrangement, while any unexpected gains or losses, say from a change in the market interest rate affecting the price of the bond, are captured by the base price adjustment when the bond matures or is transferred. Options for change 8.13 Our proposal is to spread the anticipated yield of a foreign currency denominated loan over the term of the arrangement and to tax any unexpected gains or losses when they are realised. This would overcome the present problems with foreign currency denominated loans and align the treatment of foreign currency debt with New Zealand dollar denominated arrangements. 8.14 It is worth noting that the proposed changes will not restrict access to market valuation methods of spreading. Taxpayers can continue to use mark-to-market if they are dealers in such financial arrangements and they meet the other conditions set out in the Act. Measuring the anticipated gains 8.15 What is the best way to measure the expected foreign exchange gain or loss on a financial arrangement? As recognised in the original consultative document 14 , the best objective measure we have of expected exchange rate movements is the set of forward exchange rates. This is not because forward rates are always equal to, or even close to, actual future spot rates, but because they do not systematically err on the high or low side of actual spot rates. Although changes in the spot exchange rate may be erratic in the short term, over the longer term they tend to reflect differences in inflation rates between countries. These differences will in turn be reflected in the interest differential between countries. It is these interest differentials that 14 Pages 119 - 120 46 are the basis for calculating forward rates (along with other factors such as credit risk and dealers’ margins). 8.16 Under our proposal the anticipated gain on a foreign currency loan would be calculated by using forward exchange rates to determine the expected New Zealand dollar value of foreign currency cashflows. These amounts would then be spread on a yield to maturity basis. Any realised amounts would be converted into New Zealand dollars using the appropriate spot exchange rate. Example Taxpayer A buys a US dollar bond at its face value of US$10,000.00. It pays a 5% coupon and is redeemed in 3 years. The New Zealand interest rate is 10%. The relevant exchange rates and cashflows are: Exchange rates Yearspot rate (USD/NZD) forward rate (USD/NZD) 00.5000 10.4700 f (0,1) 0.4773 20.4500 f (0,2) 0.4556 30.4400 f (0,3) 0.4349 where f (0,1) is the forward rate at year 0 for delivery in year 1 Cashflows YearUSD cashflowsanticipated NZD cashflows 1 actual NZD cashflows 2 0-10000.00-20000.00-20000.00 1500.001047.561063.83 2500.001097.451111.11 310500.0024143.4823863.64 The anticipated New Zealand dollar income is spread over the term of the arrangement on a yield to maturity (YTM) basis following the methodology set out in Determination G3. In addition, the difference between the spot rate value of the cashflows and their expected value (as measured by the forward rate from year 0) is a realised foreign exchange gain or loss when the cashflows are received. These realised gains or losses are to be brought to tax as the “realisation adjustment”. Yield to maturity The yield on the cashflows converted into New Zealand dollars using the forward rates is 10.0%. This yield is used to calculate the New Zealand dollar income.

Forward contracts and the accrual rules 8.18 The treatment of forward contracts is currently dealt with by Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities. The scheme of the determination is to treat the difference between the forward value and the spot value of the commodity or currency at the start of the contract as a premium or discount. This is spread over the term of the contract. At subsequent balance dates, the change in the spot value of the commodity or currency is brought to tax as a gain or a loss. 8.19 This treatment is largely driven by the tax treatment of foreign currency denominated loans. It was because of the need to ensure a match between a fully hedged foreign loan and a domestic loan that the treatment of foreign currency forward contracts brings to tax spot changes in the currency. Changing the treatment of foreign exchange loans to spread anticipated gains as measured by the forward rate will mean this “mark-to-spot” treatment of forward contracts is no longer necessary. 48 8.20 We agree that a fully hedged foreign currency loan should be treated in the same way as a domestic loan. However, Determination G14 will not necessarily provide a match between the tax treatment of the loan and the forward contract because some taxpayers may use a mark-to-market approach. Practical difficulties 8.21 The expected gain or loss on a forward contract is the difference between the expected spot rate when the contract is to be settled and the rate specified in the contract. For most forward contracts, the expected gain or loss at the time they are written is zero. This is why most forward contracts change hands for no consideration. 8.22 We consider that the current treatment under Determination G14 is inappropriate. The spot value of the currency on balance date does not represent a gain or loss to the holder of a forward contract since the contract could only be settled by entering an equal and opposite forward contract, not a spot transaction. Options for change 8.23 The taxation of forward contracts for commodities and foreign currency should be consistent with the overall scheme of the accrual rules. All gains and losses should be taxable, with the anticipated yield spread over the life of the arrangement. 8.24 We propose that forward contracts for foreign exchange that are written at an arm’s length rate should have any gains or losses taxed on realisation. This is because there is no anticipated yield on this type of arrangement. This arm’s length rate is likely to be the rate quoted by Reuters or Telerate with some allowance for dealers’ margins, credit risk and so on. If a rate is not quoted and cannot be calculated from cross-rates, it will be the rate calculated using a commercially acceptable method and verifiable interest rates. The exchange of consideration at the outset of the arrangement is likely to indicate a non-market rate. 8.25 Where a forward contract is not written at the market rate or is later sold when forward rates have changed, the contract contains an embedded debt instrument. Consideration is likely be paid for such an arrangement. The expected gain or loss on this embedded debt will be spread over the life of the arrangement in a manner consistent with other debt instruments. 8.26 Just as with foreign exchange loans, those taxpayers who meet the requirements of the Act can continue to spread gains and losses using a market valuation approach. THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOANS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS 49 Examples Example 1 Taxpayer A enters into a forward contract to sell US$100,000.00 in 90 days at the “market” forward rate of 0.6367 (call this rate f (0,90) ). This means the taxpayer will exchange US$100,000.00 for NZ$157,059.84 in 90 days. No consideration changes hands when Taxpayer A enters the contract since the right to buy or sell something at the market rate has no value, and at the time it enters the contract it has no expectation that US$100,000.00 will be worth any more or less than the NZ$157,059.84 it will receive under the contract. There is no expected gain or loss to be spread under the contract. In 90 days the spot rate turns out to be 0.6407. This means US$100,000.00 is worth only NZ$156,079.29. The difference between this amount and the rate in the forward contract (NZ$980.55) is a foreign exchange gain to Taxpayer A and will be income under the BPA. Example 2 Consider the case where Taxpayer A sells the forward contract set out in Example 1 to Taxpayer B on day 45. The market forward rate for delivery on day 90 (f (45,90) ) has changed to 0.6592. This means US$100,000.00 will be exchanged for NZ$151,699.03. The contract held by Taxpayer A, however, will guarantee payment of NZ$157,059.84. The contract is equivalent to a zero coupon bond paying $5,360.81 (being the difference between NZ$157,059.84 and NZ$151,699.03) on day 90 and a forward contract to sell US$100,000.00 at today’s forward rate. With a 10% p.a. yield over 45 days the market price of the contract would be NZ$5,295.52. 1 The anticipated gain on this “bond” (NZ$65.29) should be spread by Taxpayer B over the term of the arrangement. The NZ$5,298.19 will be income to Taxpayer A under the BPA. Taxpayer B has paid NZ$5,295.52 at the start of the arrangement plus US$100,000.00 at the end (worth NZ$156,079.29 at the spot rate of .6407) for a total of NZ$161,374.81. In return Taxpayer B has received the NZ$157,059.84 set out in the contact for a total loss of NZ$4,314.97. 1 Since $5,295.52(1+0.0123) = $5,360.81 8.27 One of the consequences of these changes is that where a forward contract is being used to hedge a risk that is not subject to the accrual rules, the tax effect will more closely reflect the economic reality. Specific issues for consultation •What criteria should be considered in determining whether a forward exchange rate is “arm’s length”? •Will it be necessary to maintain the current “mark-to-spot” treatment described in Determination G9A for some arrangements? 50 Draft legislation These changes should not require legislative amendment and can be achieved through Determinations issued by the Commissioner. The Commissioner expects to issue drafts for discussion shortly. 51 CHAPTER 9 ASSIGNMENTS OF INCOME AND DEBT DEFEASANCES Proposed policy • Recognise that absolute assignments and legal defeasances of financial arrangements do not create a new financial arrangement for the assignor or defeasor and that an absolute assignment of a financial arrangement will terminate that financial arrangement for the assignor. Similarly, a legal defeasance of obligations under an arrangement will terminate that financial arrangement for the defeasor. • Treat arrangements other than legal defeasances or absolute assignments as creating new financial arrangements subject to the accrual rules, including the situation where the underlying arrangement is an excepted financial arrangement. • Treat absolute assignments or legal defeasances of excepted financial arrangements as having no accrual consequences. Payments in relation to such transactions will be taxable under ordinary income tax rules. • Amend section DJ 1(c) to ensure that deductions for “insubstance” defeasances that may be characterised as an indemnity are not restricted. Assignments of income and defeasances of debt and the accrual rules 9.1 A debt defeasance is an arrangement whereby one party pays another money in return for the promise to repay over time the obligations of the first party under a particular agreement. A debt defeasance can be a legal defeasance (or novation) or an economic or “insubstance” defeasance, the difference being: •Under a legal defeasance the debtor is released by the creditor from the obligation to repay the debt. •An economic, or insubstance, defeasance is a process of extinguishing debt by, for example, setting aside sufficient risk-free investments to cover all remaining debt repayments. The debtor is not released from the principal obligation to repay the creditor. 9.2 An assignment of income, on the other hand, occurs when persons receive money in consideration of relinquishing a future income stream to which they are otherwise entitled. 52 9.3 Debt defeasances and assignments of income are included explicitly in subparagraph (iii) of the current definition of financial arrangement, as arrangements of a substantially similar nature to those identified by the core definition. Practical difficulties 9.4 The accrual rules fail to distinguish adequately between assignments and defeasances that are essentially financing arrangements which should be subject to the accrual rules, and those that are merely absolute transfers, which should not. This leads to uncertainty in the application of the law and to compliance and administrative costs. Proposed reform 9.5 Arrangements with similar effects should be treated consistently under the accrual rules. Arrangements that create new financial arrangements should be subject to the accrual rules. Arrangements that merely transfer existing rights and obligations and do not create new financial arrangements should not. 15 9.6 There are four types of arrangements to be considered: •absolute assignments; •non-absolute assignments; •legal defeasances; •insubstance defeasances. 9.7 Under an absolute assignment or legal defeasance, the assigner or defeasor has completely transferred all of its rights or obligations in relation to the underlying arrangement. The assignor or defeasor has no continuing rights or obligations to the assignee or defeasance counterparty. Because of this, an absolute assignment or legal defeasance should not be a financial arrangement. 9.8 Under a non-absolute assignment or insubstance defeasance, the assignor or defeasor will continue to have rights or obligations in relation to the underlying arrangement. A consequence of this is that the assignor or defeasor will have continuing rights or obligations to the assignee or defeasance counterparty. Thus a non-absolute assignment or insubstance defeasance creates a new financial arrangement between the assignor or defeasor and the assignee or defeasance counterparty. 15 This approach was recommended by the Valabh Committee, Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime: Discussion Paper, October 1991, pages 22 – 25. ASSIGNMENTS OF INCOME AND DEBT DEFEASANCES 53 Debt defeasances 9.9 A taxpayer can extinguish a liability in several ways. These include maturity and repayment of the debt, repurchasing debt in the market, refinancing, or legal defeasance of a debt to a third party. These events terminate a taxpayer’s obligation in relation to an arrangement and should be treated on a consistent basis under the accrual rules as dispositions of financial arrangements. 9.10 An insubstance defeasance is a means by which the taxpayer reduces the risk associated with a liability and is similar, in effect, to a taxpayer investing funds to generate sufficient income to offset payment obligations as they arise. An insubstance defeasance will not be treated as a disposition of a financial arrangement. This is because at law the original obligation of the defeasor is not terminated, and the defeasance in fact creates a new financial arrangement, which is an asset that offsets the original obligation. 9.11 Further, insubstance defeasances should be accounted for under the accrual rules because they could be used to create arrangements that can be substituted for debt or affect the return on debt instruments. An example is an interest rate swap, the effect of which can be replicated using defeasances. 9.12 We consider the appropriate boundary between insubstance and legal defeasance is determined by the legal arrangements entered into. An arrangement will be treated as having been terminated only if a person’s obligations under an arrangement are legally extinguished. 9.13 Financial Reporting Standard 26 defines a legal defeasance as an arrangement in which it is virtually certain that the debtor will not be required to assume the primary obligation or satisfy secondary obligations for the debt servicing requirement. 16 Extinguishments of liabilities also occur under those rules if a risk-free entity assumes responsibility for debt servicing. 9.14 Although harmonisation of tax and financial accounting rules is desirable in terms of compliance costs, it is inappropriate in this case. The concept of virtual certainty would be a less clear boundary than the jurisprudential concept of an absolute release from obligations under an arrangement. In addition, the treatment of insubstance defeasances for accounting purposes is not a settled issue. In contrast to FRS 26, a recent US Statement, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, 17 allows a liability to be extinguished only if the debtor repays the creditor and is relieved of the obligation for the liability, or the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor, either judicially or by the creditor. 16 Accounting for the Defeasance of Debt, Financial Reporting Standard No 26, 1995. 17 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125, Financial Accounting Standards Board, June 1996. 54 Assignments of income 9.15 An assignment of income occurs when an assignee pays money in order to receive a cashflow stream in the future. 9.16 Transfers of the benefits of contracts or other arrangements can be any of legal, equitable or statutory assignments. Historically, legal assignments relate to those choses in action (including debts and other financial arrangements) which were enforceable in the common law courts; equitable assignments (such as transfers of interests in a trust fund) were enforceable in the courts of equity. 9.17 Statutory assignments are those for which the transfer mechanism is specified in legislation (for example, by section 130 of the Property Law Act 1952). Statutory rules arose in order to overcome problems of enforcement. Even if an assignment is not made according to the statute, it may still be valid as an equitable assignment. However, for the purposes of determining the effects of assignments under the accrual rules, the distinctions between legal, equitable and statutory assignments are not necessarily helpful. 9.18 We agree with the Valabh Committee’s view that anything other than an absolute assignment should be treated as a financial arrangement. This is because the assignor has continuing rights in relation to the underlying arrangement, and the other parties to the underlying arrangement will continue to have obligations to the assignor. Assignments and defeasances of excepted financial arrangements 9.19 The Act contains a list of excepted financial arrangements, and only those transactions that fall within the definition can be excluded from the accrual rules. Therefore while excepted financial arrangements are excluded, an assignment or defeasance of an excepted financial arrangement is not. 9.20 The same problem in determining whether an assignment or defeasance creates a new financial arrangement applies equally if the original asset or liability is an excepted financial arrangement. 9.21 If an assignment or defeasance of cashflows from an excepted financial arrangement constitutes a termination of legal rights or obligations of the transferor, no accrual implications should arise. There will be no base price adjustment because there is no underlying financial arrangement to terminate. The assessability and deductibility of payments will be subject to general income tax rules. 9.22 If an assignment or defeasance does not result in an absolute termination of rights or obligations, the analogy with a loan is more convincing. The accrual rules should apply to such transactions. ASSIGNMENTS OF INCOME AND DEBT DEFEASANCES 55 Practical application of these proposals 9.23 The following section provides examples of the application of the proposals to different types of arrangements. Legal defeasance of a debt 9.24 A legal defeasance effects a disposal of the liabilities arising under a financial arrangement. A base price adjustment will be required, therefore, for the defeasor of the debt (borrower). The total expenditure arising as a result of the defeasance will be the difference between what was received under the loan and what was paid by the defeasor to the creditor and the defeasance counterparty. 9.25 The defeasance counterparty will receive consideration in exchange for its agreement to assume the obligations of the defeasor. The difference between the amount received and the amount payable in the future to the original creditor will be accounted for on an accrual basis. 9.26 The creditor will be treated as a party to a continuing arrangement and will continue to calculate income under the financial arrangement as if the defeasance had not occurred. This minimises compliance costs associated with terminating the liability and entering into a new financial arrangement on similar terms. This approach accords with the substance of the transaction because, from the creditor’s point of view, the only change is in the party making the payments. Example: Legal defeasance On 3 May 1993 Company A issued a debenture for $7000. It has a face value of $7000, a term of 5 years, pays interest annually in arrears (coupon rate 10%) and requires the repayment of principal in one lump sum together with the final interest payment. Cashflows and accrual expenditure under the debenture for Company A are: DateCashflowTax yearExpenditureTotal Expenditure 3/5/937,000.0031/3/94636.37636.37 3/5/94- 700.0031/3/95699.581335.95 3/5/95- 700.0031/3/96701.462037.41 3/5/96- 700.0031/3/97699.662737.07 3/5/97- 700.0031/3/98699.663436.73 3/5/98-7,700.0031/3/9963.25 3499.98 On 4 May 1995, Company A enters into a legal defeasance of its obligation to pay interest and redeem the debenture. The cost to the defeasor of the defeasance is $6,663.74 (the present value of the future cashflows at the interest rate at the time of the defeasance - 12%). The defeasance terminates the original financial arrangement. 56 Step 1: Company A is obliged to perform a base price adjustment to determine the gain or loss on the financial arrangement. a= the amount of all consideration paid to the person = $7000 b = the amount of all consideration paid by the person = $6,663.74 + 700 + 700 = $8,063.74 c= income derived in prior years = 0 d = expenditure incurred in prior years = 1,335.95 e= amounts remitted by the person = 0 a - b - c + d + e= 272.21 income derived. Step 2: The defeasance counterparty becomes obligor under a financial arrangement as a result of the defeasance. The cashflows and accrual expenditure are: DateCashflowTax yearExpenditureTotal Expenditure 3/5/956,663.7431/3/96728.81728.81 3/5/96- 700.0031/3/97809.861538.67 3/5/97- 700.0031/3/98823.062361.73 3/5/98-7,700.0031/3/9974.532436.26 Expenditure must be accrued over the term of the arrangement. At maturity the defeasance counterparty performs a base price adjustment. a = the amount of all consideration paid to the person = $6,663.74 b = the amount of all consideration paid by the person = $7,700 + 700 + 700 = $9,100 c = income derived in prior years = 0 d= expenditure incurred in prior years = $2,361.73 e= amount remitted by the person = 0 a – b – c + d + e = -74.53 expenditure incurred in the final year. Step 3: The rights of the original creditor do not change. Income derived from the original financial arrangement is accrued over its term. Income derived is $3500. Step 4: Outcomes DefeasorOriginal arrangement1,063.74expenditure Defeasance counterpartyNew arrangement2,436.26expenditure CreditorOriginal arrangement3,500.00income Overall tax outcomeNil Insubstance defeasance of a debt 9.27 The creditor may not be involved with the arrangements made between the original debtor (the defeasor) and the counterparty. Since the obligations under the original financial arrangement do not change, the arrangement continues to be subject to the accrual rules. In order to put our proposal into operation, an amendment is required to make it clear that amounts paid on behalf of the defeasor to the original lender are included in accrual calculations for both the original financial arrangement and the defeasance. ASSIGNMENTS OF INCOME AND DEBT DEFEASANCES 57 9.28 The defeasance counterparty will receive consideration in exchange for its agreement to make payments to the original creditor. This arrangement is equivalent to a loan from the defeasor to the defeasance counterparty. The income or expenditure arising from the loan between the defeasance counterparty and the defeasor will be subject to the accrual rules. 9.29 The rights of the original creditor do not change. The creditor remains the holder of the financial arrangement and will continue to calculate gains and losses under it as if the defeasance had not occurred. Section DJ (1)(c) 9.30 Section DJ 1(c) provides that no deduction is allowed for any expenditure or loss recoverable under any insurance or right of indemnity. Under an insubstance defeasance, the defeasor may still be liable to make payments to the creditor. Payments made by the defeasance counterparty may be an indemnity for those payments made to the creditor. As a policy matter, section DJ 1(c) should not unnecessarily restrict the defeasor’s deduction for those payments. Example: Insubstance defeasance On 3 May 1993 Company A issued a debenture for $7000. It has a face value of $7000, a term of 5 years, pays interest annually in arrears (coupon rate 10%) and requires the repayment of principal in one lump sum together with the final interest payment. Cashflows and accrual expenditure under the debenture for Company A are: DateCashflowTax yearExpenditureTotal Expenditure 3/5/937,000.0031/3/94636.37636.37 3/5/94- 700.0031/3/95699.581335.95 3/5/95 - 700.0031/3/96701.462037.41 3/5/96- 700.0031/3/97699.662737.07 3/5/97- 700.0031/3/98699.663436.73 3/5/98-7,700.0031/3/9963.253499.98 On 4 May 1995, Company A enters into an insubstance defeasance of its obligation to pay interest and redeem the debenture. The cost to the defeasor of the defeasance is $6,663.74 (the present value of the future cashflows at the interest rate at the time of the defeasance - 12%). Because the obligations of Company A still exist the defeasance does not terminate the original financial arrangement. Expenditure continues to accrue over the term of the arrangement. A new debt is created between Company A and the defeasance counterparty. Step 1: Expenditure accrues on the original financial arrangement. The base price adjustment will be calculated when the debenture matures, 3/5/98. a = amount of all consideration paid to the person = $7,000 b = amount of all consideration paid by (or on behalf of) the person = $7,000 + $3,500 = $10,500 c = income derived in prior years = 0 d= expenditure incurred in prior years = 3436.73 e= amounts remitted by the person = 0 a – b – c + d +e = -63.25 expenditure incurred. 58 Step 2: A new financial arrangement arises between Company A and the defeasance counterparty. The original creditor is not a party to the arrangement. The cashflows and accrual income and expenditure are: DateCashflowTax yearIncome/Total Income/ ExpenditureExpenditure 3/5/956,663.7431/3/96728.81728.81 3/5/96- 700.0031/3/97809.861538.67 3/5/97- 700.0031/3/98823.062361.73 3/5/98-7,700.0031/3/9974.532436.26 Income (for Company A) and expenditure (for the defeasance counterparty) must be accrued over the term of the arrangement. At maturity a base price adjustment calculation occurs. Company A a = amount of all consideration paid to the person = $7,700 + 700 + 700 = $9,100 b = amount of all consideration paid by the person = $6,663.74 c = income derived in prior years = $2,361.73 d= expenditure incurred in prior years = 0 e= amounts remitted by the person = 0 a – b – c + d + e = +74.53 income derived The defeasance counterparty a = amount of all consideration paid to the person = $6,663.74 b = amount of all consideration paid by the person = $7,700 + 700 + 700 = $9,100 c = income derived in prior years = 0 d= expenditure incurred in prior years = $2,361.73 e= amounts remitted by the person = 0 a – b – c + d + e = -74.53 expenditure incurred. Step 3: The rights of the original creditor do not change. Income derived from the original financial arrangement is accrued over its term. Income derived is $3500.

ASSIGNMENTS OF INCOME AND DEBT DEFEASANCES 59 9.32 The tax consequences, given the model proposed for taxing assignments or defeasances, are that neither the assignor nor the assignee has accrual income or expenditure in relation to the assignment. Any amount received by the assignor or paid by the assignee for transfer of the debts is determined under general income tax principles. Insubstance defeasance of rental payments 9.33 A person obliged to make rental payments may enter into an insubstance defeasance of its rental obligations. This arrangement would be treated as a financial arrangement. The tax consequences should be that the defeasor continues to be treated as paying rent. The amounts are deductible if the ordinary rules are satisfied. 9.34 The defeasor is treated as having lent an amount equal to the defeasance payments to the defeasance counterparty and receives over time an amount equal to the rental obligation. This will result in income under the accrual rules. 9.35 For the defeasance counterparty, expenditure will be deemed to be incurred under the accrual rules. 60 CHAPTER 10 PARTIAL ASSIGNMENTS AND DEFEASANCES Proposed policy Account for partial assignments and defeasances of the cashflows under a financial arrangement as a variation to a financial arrangement. The accrual rules and partial assignments and defeasances 10.1 In some circumstances a party to a financial arrangement will assign or defease only part of its rights or obligations under a financial arrangement. For example, a holder of government stock may assign the coupon payment rights while retaining the principal repayment rights. There is no provision under the current legislation to allow recognition of income or expenditure from partial assignments or defeasances. Practical difficulties 10.2 The lack of certainty about which rules apply can create difficulties for taxpayers who transfer part of a financial arrangement. Options for change Proposed treatment – Determination G25: Variations in the terms of a Financial Arrangement 10.3 If the original parties to a financial arrangement agree to vary the terms, Determination G25 requires them to recalculate income or expenditure from the beginning of the arrangement as if the varied cashflows had been known from inception. The calculation required in the year of variation is a catch-up adjustment for the prior years. 10.4 The application of Determination G25 could be extended to cover partial assignments and defeasances involving a third party. Under this option, a partial assignment or defeasance is treated as a variation in the terms of the financial arrangement. PARTIAL ASSIGNMENTS AND DEFEASANCES 61 10.5 The effect for the assignor or defeasor would be to spread the gain or loss realised on the relevant part of the financial arrangement, over the life of the financial arrangement. The one-off adjustment in the year in which the partial assignment or defeasance occurs would pick up this gain or loss for prior years. The remainder of the gain or loss is then spread over the remaining years of the financial arrangement. No adjustment would be required for the party to the financial arrangement not participating in the assignment or defeasance. 10.6 We prefer this method because it adequately reflects income measurement and avoids the need for further legislation to deal specifically with partial transfers of arrangements. The method is easy to apply and fits in with the current legislative framework. 10.7 The differences between this and the other methods discussed below are differences of timing. They reflect the extent to which the financial arrangement is effectively revalued in the year of partial assignment or defeasance, and the period over which any resulting income or expenditure is spread. Other options considered Partial base price adjustment 10.8 An alternative to using Determination G25 is to use the base price adjustment mechanism. The essence of this method is to split the original financial arrangement into two parts, and perform a base price adjustment on the part that is defeased or assigned. There are two possible approaches: •splitting the original acquisition price and allocating any accrued income or expenditure from the beginning of the arrangement to the date of partial disposition; or •valuing the cashflows retained by the transferor at the rate inherent in the original financial arrangement for the purpose of the base price adjustment and determining the acquisition price of the “new” financial arrangement to which the transferor becomes a party. 10.9 We use the term “partial base price adjustment” to describe either method. 10.10 The partial base price adjustment treatment brings to tax the gain or loss resulting from changes in value on the part of the financial arrangement disposed of in the year of partial disposition. Changes in the value of the financial arrangement could result from, for example, changes in market interest rates. The part of the financial arrangement that has been retained is not revalued. 62 10.11 This method may give a more accurate measure of accrual income or expenditure in the event of an absolute transfer of part of a financial arrangement, but would mean introducing considerable additional complexity into the accrual rules. Full base price adjustment 10.12 Another option we considered is to perform a full base price adjustment in the year of partial assignment or defeasance. This would require deeming a disposition of the entire financial arrangement and acquisition of a new financial arrangement. A market valuation would be required, both to carry out the base price adjustment on the original financial arrangement and to ascertain the acquisition price of the new financial arrangement. 10.13 The full base price adjustment approach can be compared to a full mark-to- market adjustment at the time of the partial assignment or defeasance. Our view is that this is not appropriate if the market valuation method is not the spreading method used for that financial arrangement. This is because a portion of the gain or loss will not have been realised and may never be realised (for example, when interest rate movements reverse before maturity). Further, such treatment could distort the market by encouraging partial transfers when a loss is triggered, and discouraging them when gains arise. Accounting treatment 10.14 The method of accounting for partial defeasances required for financial accounting purposes is set out in Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 26. Paragraph 5.8 of FRS 26 is consistent with the second partial base price adjustment method described in paragraph 10.6. That standard provides: Where there is a partial extinguishment of a debt, the outstanding liability shall be determined by discounting the remaining debt servicing requirements at the original interest rate or original interest rates implicit in the original debt arrangement. 10.15 Although not our preferred option, the partial base price adjustment method available under FRS 26 may, in any event, be available to taxpayers as an alternative method under the proviso to section EH 1(5)(a). Specific issues for consultation Does the approach in Determination G25 involve lower compliance costs than the partial base price adjustment approach? 63 CHAPTER 11 DEBT REMISSION Proposed policy •Continue to tax income arising from the forgiveness of a debt under the accrual rules subject to the exclusion for natural love and affection. •Treat amounts remitted on the winding up of a company as having been deemed to be remitted before the winding up to ensure the Commissioner is treated on the same footing as other creditors. •Exempt amounts remitted amongst members of a consolidated group from remission income only if the arrangement was held by members of the same group at all times during the term of the arrangement. Debt remission and the accrual rules 11.1 The accrual rules, through the operation of the base price adjustment, bring to tax as income for the holder any amounts forgiven under a financial arrangement. 11.2 A financial arrangement is deemed to be remitted under section EH 4(9)(c) if: (i)The issuer has been discharged from making all remaining payments under that financial arrangement without fully adequate consideration; or (ii)The issuer has been released from making all remaining payments under that financial arrangement by the operation of the Insolvency Act 1967 or the Companies Act 1955 or the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of any country or territory other than New Zealand, or by any deed or agreement of composition with its creditors; or (iii)All of the remaining payments under the financial arrangement have become irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through the lapse of time: 11.3 The purpose of the debt remission rules is to recognise the fact that the forgiveness of a debt increases the wealth of the debtor. This should, as with all other gains under a financial arrangement, be brought to tax. The accrual rules try to do this as consistently and comprehensively as possible to minimise the impact of the tax system on the way debt instruments are structured. 64 Criticisms of the current rules 11.4 Some argue that the economic income arising from debt forgiveness should not be assessable unless taxpayers are also able to claim a deduction for associated capital losses. The classic example cited is of a taxpayer who borrows to buy shares. The value of the shares subsequently falls to zero and the lender forgives the debt in recognition of the fact that the borrower is now unable to pay. In this case the taxpayer incurred a capital loss in the form of the fall in the value of the shares, and a gain in the form of the forgiven debt. Under the current tax rules, the gain resulting from debt forgiveness is assessable, whereas the loss on the shares is not generally deductible (unless the shares were bought for the purpose of resale). The argument is made that the gain should not be assessable unless the loss is deductible. 11.5 This argument ignores the fact that the deductibility of the loss on the shares is denied on the basis that gains on the shares would not have been assessable had they increased in value. The non-deductibility of the loss on the shares is not determined by whether gain on the loan is assessable. Such mismatches are an inevitable consequence of maintaining a capital- revenue boundary. As long as the income tax system continues to exclude certain capital gains from tax it is necessary to deny deductions for certain capital losses in order to reduce the extent to which these omissions influence business decisions. 11.6 A further criticism is that the rules discourage commercially desirable debt restructuring. In particular, concerns focus on the desirability of taxing debt remission in cases of insolvency or commercial restructuring. While we recognise this concern, we consider the distortions that would be built into the tax system if remission income were not taxed would be greater than the costs of the present regime. The Valabh Committee proposal 11.7 Given the concerns of some taxpayers about the effect of the rules, the Valabh Committee recommended significant changes. The Committee presented two options: 18 •Retain the present debt remission rules but allow a deduction for principal losses. This was rejected by the Committee on the grounds that it would encourage parent companies to finance subsidiaries through debt rather than equity, in the expectation that should the operations of the borrowing subsidiary not be profitable, the parent might obtain a deduction for loss of principal when no deduction for equity loss would be available. 18 Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime: Discussion Paper, October 1991, pages 27-38. DEBT REMISSION 65 •Abolish remission income (except in the limited cases where remission of principal could constitute assessable income under the general law) but claw back any deductions arising from the use of remitted funds. This is the approach preferred by the Valabh Committee, given the large expected revenue loss from a generally available deduction for principal losses. 11.8 The Committee accepted, however, that because money is fungible, it would be nearly impossible to trace the application of particular borrowed amounts. The general provision dealing with amounts remitted, section 78 of the 1976 Act, was based on such a claw-back principle, and it was the shortcomings of this approach that created the need for specific treatment under the accrual rules. As a proxy for complex tracing rules, the Committee proposed: •There should be a claw-back of deductions where there was a link between borrowed funds and any deductible expenditure or depreciation deduction. If no deduction was obtained there would be no claw-back. •If no clear link existed, current year losses, or losses carried forward to the year in which the remission of principal occurs would be forfeited to the extent of the principal remitted. No claw-back would generally occur if no losses were available (except for related party losses). 11.9 Taxpayers would be exempt from this claw-back: •if the debt remission constitutes a gift; •if the amount is taxable under another provision of the Act; or •if the taxpayer can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the borrowed funds were used for private or domestic purposes or to acquire a non-depreciable capital asset. Problems with the Valabh Committee approach 11.10 We see several problems with the approach recommended by the Valabh Committee. 11.11 First, the committee’s proposals would both create a preference, and add complexity to the law: •The timing of the recognition of any remission income would depend on previous tax losses and the amount and timing of future deductions. Linking the recognition of remission income to the timing of deductions would favour taxpayers who incur relatively few deductions as a proportion of total revenue over those whose deductions represent a high proportion of total revenue. 66 •The extent to which the amount remitted is subject to future tax depends on the extent and timing of future deductions by the borrower. This causes a lock-in distortion that would encourage taxpayers to defer transactions that would trigger the tax liability. •Unlike existing rules that tax remission income directly, the committee's claw-back rules rely on complex tracing provisions. These would be difficult both to administer and comply with. 11.12 Second, we have concerns as to their impact on the integrity of the tax base, especially on the winding up of a company or where there are limited recourse loans. 11.13 Finally, the proposal does not appear to achieve the symmetry of treatment of non-business lenders and their debtors hoped for by the committee. Options for change 11.14 We believe the best approach is to maintain the current treatment of amounts forgiven under a financial arrangement. We propose to address some issues that are causing concern, including the transfer of debts between associates (“debt parking”), and issues arising on insolvency and consolidation. Debt parking 11.15 Figure 1 shows an example of how “debt parking” has been used in the past to circumvent the rules. A owes money to B which it cannot repay. Rather than forgiving the debt (which would give rise to remission income for A) B sells the debt, at a discount, to an associate of A (in this case C). FIGURE 1: DEBT PARKING A (borrower) B (lender) C (associate of A) $100 loan to A C buys debt from B for $60 A acknowledges the debt but C never calls the loan DEBT REMISSION 67 11.16 B has received $60 for A’s debt and extinguished its rights under the arrangement. Had this money come direct from A (as full and final settlement of the debt) remission income of $40 would have arisen to A. However, because C is an arm’s length party from B, no remission income arises under current law. The difference between this type of arrangement and the sale or assignment of the debt from B to an unrelated third party is that, while A’s debt under the arrangement is still outstanding, A no longer expects to have to repay the loan. 11.17 The $40 loss to B will be deductible if B can account for the debt on a mark-to-market basis or obtain a deduction under section EH 4(5) as a dealer in this type of financial arrangement. 11.18 Because of the association between A and C this arrangement is, in effect, a settlement of the debt. We propose to treat it as such. This would mean that both A and B would carry out a base price adjustment. A would derive $40 of remission income, since the arrangement has been settled on its behalf for $60. 11.19 A new financial arrangement will be deemed to have been created between A and C. The consideration for this new debt will be the $60 paid by C for the debt. 11.20 This approach relies on two thresholds: the extent of common ownership between the borrower and the purchaser of the debt, and the level of discount at which the debt is purchased. In Canada, similar rules apply if the debt is sold at a 20% or greater discount, and the two parties (in this case A and C) are under common control or the purchaser owns 25% or more of the debtor. A similar approach has been implemented in Australia. We propose a common ownership threshold in line with other associated persons tests in the Act. Broadly, this would mean 50% common ownership between companies covering arrangements sold at a discount of 20% or greater of their face value. Technical issues 11.21 The remainder of this chapter is devoted to some technical problems in the current rules that are of concern to both the Government and taxpayers. We welcome comment from taxpayers on the practicality of our proposed solutions. Company liquidations 11.22 Section EH 4(9)(c) deems an amount to be remitted if the issuer has been released from making all remaining payments under the financial arrangement by the operation of the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1955 or the Companies Act 1993. 68 11.23 Taxpayers are released from all remaining payments only when they have been discharged from bankruptcy or on the winding up of the company. In the case of individuals, it was felt that it would be inconsistent with the aims of the bankruptcy rules if a taxpayer was discharged from bankruptcy only to face new debts to the Commissioner. With this in mind, section 64F(7C) \[now section EH 4(7)\] was enacted so that, on release from bankruptcy, an individual is deemed to have paid those amounts, and no remission income arises. 11.24 This change was not made in the case of companies. Since a company will be wound up, there is no need for it to emerge from bankruptcy with a “clean slate”. The problem, however, is that the tax liability for amounts forgiven arises only after the company is wound up. At this point it is not possible to collect the tax that is due on the amounts remitted 11.25 Amounts that are forgiven through the operation of the liquidation provisions could be treated as having been remitted immediately before the winding up of the company. This would put the Commissioner in the same position as other unsecured creditors. One concern we have with this is that the Commissioner’s debt arises only as a result of the liquidation. Unless the liquidation is part of a group restructuring this may not be appropriate. Problem of circularity 11.26 Unless an arbitrary line is drawn, the calculation of the amount of remission income becomes circular: the imposition of tax reduces the amount that can be paid to other creditors, leading to further remission and an increase in the tax liability, which in turn requires further remission, and so on. The rules would require the remission of all debts, including the income tax liability, to occur only once, at the point of bankruptcy. Further amounts remitted to creditors because of this new liability to the Commissioner would not give rise to a tax liability. Example AssetsLiabilities Cash100.00Creditor A30.00 Creditor B30.00 Creditor C30.00 Creditor D30.00 $100.00$120.00 Deem remission of $20 Tax liability = $20 x 0.33 = $6.60 Tax liability6.60 $100.00$126.60 The taxpayer pays 78.9 cents in the dollar to all creditors, including the Commissioner ($100.00/$126.60). This means the Commissioner would receive $6.60 x 0.789 = $5.21. DEBT REMISSION 69 “Financial arrangement remitted” or “amounts remitted”? 11.27 Item “a” of the current base price adjustment formula in section EH 4(1) refers to “any amounts that have been remitted by the person”. This wording poses two problems. The first is that, if the debt has been forgiven by operation of statute, it has not been forgiven “by the person”. In this case the base price adjustment may not give the correct answer. This should be corrected. 11.28 The second problem is that the terminology is inconsistent with that of section EH 4(9)(c), which provides when “a financial arrangement shall be deemed remitted”. It is possible that there is a difference between a “financial arrangement” remitted and an “amount” remitted under a financial arrangement. Because of this inconsistent terminology, amounts that would otherwise be income under the base price adjustment could be excluded. An amendment to the definition of “remitted by the person” in section EH 4(9) should deal with both issues. Remission income for consolidated groups 11.29 The treatment of remission income is inconsistent for corporate groups. For a wholly owned group, remission income is taxable. 19 For a consolidated group, remission income is ignored. 20 On an amalgamation remission income is recognised if the issuer of the debt is insolvent. 21 However, if amalgamating companies are members of a consolidated group prior to amalgamation, the income will not be recognised. 11.30 The amalgamation provisions for insolvent companies were introduced to buttress the accrual rules for remission income. In the absence of such provisions, the amalgamation rules could be used to avoid remission income. 11.31 The justification for providing a concession for remission income within a consolidated group is that the consolidation rules treat a group of companies comprehensively as one economic entity and one taxpayer. In effect, this means payments or receipts associated with financial arrangements between group members are offset and ignored for tax purposes. Applying the same logic, any economic gain such as remission income attributed to an issuer should be offset by an economic loss for the holder, resulting in neutral tax outcomes. 11.32 This treatment of remission income is a substantial concession to the general rule. The consolidation rules could be used to avoid remission income. Taxpayers seeking to restructure can benefit by consolidating before amalgamating companies. 19 Either under the accrual rules or as a dividend under section CF 2(1)(b). The dividend arising from remission income is excluded from the intercorporate dividend exemption. 20 Section HB 2(1)(a). 21 Section FE 10(4). 70 11.33 Therefore we propose that the exception for remission income be more tightly targeted. Remission income will be disregarded within a consolidated group only if a financial arrangement has been issued and held by members of a consolidated group during the whole term of the arrangement. This will prevent taxpayers entering consolidated groups purely to benefit from the remission concession. Specific issues for consultation •To what extent will the proposed treatment of debt parking arrangements interfere with legitimate commercial sales of debt to associated persons? •Should the remission rules for bankrupts and companies in liquidation be aligned? If the amounts were deemed to be remitted when a taxpayer was declared bankrupt the Commissioner could “join the queue” with other creditors, but any unpaid tax amounts would be forgiven when the taxpayer was discharged from bankruptcy. This would not disadvantage the insolvent taxpayer. •Should the treatment of company liquidations be different if the liquidation is part of a group restructuring? 71 CHAPTER 12 SPECIFIED OR FINANCE LEASES Proposed policy •Include leases that are financing arrangements entered into on or after 1 April 1999 within the scope of the accrual rules. •Refer to leases that fall within the accrual rules as “finance leases” to avoid confusion with those leases entered into before 1 April 1999. •Define the term “finance lease” more narrowly than “specified lease”. Specified leases and the accrual rules 12.1 At present, all leases are excepted financial arrangements. When the accrual rules were introduced, in 1987, those leases that are financing arrangements (specified leases) were included in the list of excepted financial arrangements because they already had their own “accrual type” rules. 12.2 A specified lease effectively transfers ownership of the lease asset to the lessee, and provides loan finance to the lessee to “buy” the asset. The Act recognises this, and treats a specified lease as a sale of the lease asset to the lessee at the beginning of the lease term. At the expiry of the lease term there is a deemed resale of the lease asset to the lessor for consideration equal to the guaranteed residual value, or if there is no guaranteed residual value, for no consideration. The Act specifically denies a deduction to the lessor for depreciation. Practical difficulties 12.3 There are several problems with the application of the current specified lease rules as identified by the Valabh Committee. 22 One is that many leases that neither transfer economic ownership nor provide finance fall into the definition of a specified lease. This happens, for example, when a lessee is responsible for the repairs and maintenance of a lease asset (and the title remains with the lessor). 22 Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime: Discussion Paper, October 1991, pages 70-81. 72 12.4 Further, the current rules require the lessor to advise the lessee of the cost price of the lease asset. This is information that is often commercially sensitive, and may in any case be inappropriate because an asset can be used for many years by the lessor before it is leased. Compliance problems result, particularly in cases where the lessor is a non-resident, because it may be difficult to obtain information as to the cost price of the lease asset. 12.5 In addition, there are no clear statutory guidelines as to the method to be used by lessees to spread the interest component of lease payments. Options for change 12.6 Leases that are financing arrangements are essentially similar to deferred property settlements and, therefore, should be within the accrual rules. In 1991 the Valabh Committee proposed that specified leases be brought within the scope of the accrual rules. It also proposed that amendments be made to the definition of specified lease to ensure that only those leases which are truly financing transactions are included in the accrual rules. We agree with the Valabh Committee’s proposals on this matter, and set out in this chapter some specific rules showing how we consider the proposals could be applied in a practical sense. Definitions 12.7 Under the current rules, a specified lease is a lease of personal property (excluding bloodstock and livestock) that effectively has one or more of the following features: •It has a guaranteed residual value. •The lease term is more than 36 months, and -the lessee has the option to acquire the lease asset at lower than market price at the end of the lease term; or -the sum of the lease payments and the guaranteed residual value is greater than the cost price of the leased asset; or -the lessee is liable for the repairs and maintenance of the leased asset. •The lessee, or an associate of the lessee, becomes the owner of the leased asset at the expiry of the lease term. 12.8 The current definition of specified lease is too wide. The definition encompasses many operating leases such as leases of more than three years that place responsibility for repairs to and maintenance of the lease asset on the lessee. SPECIFIED OR FINANCE LEASES 73 12.9 We propose that the term “specified lease” be changed to “finance lease” and the definition be amended so that a lease would be a finance lease if it meets either of the following criteria: •The lease provides for ownership of the lease asset to transfer to the lessee, or an associate of the lessee, whether at the option of the lessee or not, for no, or concessional, consideration at the expiry of the lease term. For example, a leased asset purchased by a lessee at the end of the lease term for no consideration would be a finance lease under the amended legislation. •An asset is leased for a major portion, 75% or more of its economic life. The economic life of an asset would be determined using the “estimated useful life” used for depreciation purposes. For example, the estimated useful life of a personal computer is four years, so if the computer were leased for more than three years (being 75% of four years) the lease would be a finance lease. 12.10 The lease term would be the period from the beginning of the lease to the expiry of the lease. Expiry would be defined as the earlier of the date stated in the lease agreement or the date the lessee is entitled to terminate the lease without being required to pay the outstanding balance. The current provisions that treat consecutive leases as one lease will be retained. 12.11 The current definition of specified lease refers only to personal property. We consider that the definition of finance lease should include the lease of land, which would, by definition, include buildings, fixtures and fittings. It is appropriate that leases of fixtures and fittings be subject to the same rules as leases of other assets. We recognise that this may cause increased compliance costs for normal commercial or residential tenancies. However, because of the requirement in the definition that an asset be leased for at least 75% of its useful life, it is unlikely that normal commercial or residential tenancies would be classified as finance leases. Consideration for the lease asset 12.12 A finance lease is in substance a sale of the lease asset to the lessee. Therefore the consideration for the lease asset should be close to the market value at the beginning of the lease term. In line with the rules for hire purchase agreements and agreements for the sale and purchase of property, we suggest that the consideration be set at one of the following: •the cash price at which the property could have been purchased from the lessor; •the lowest price at which the asset could be purchased under a short- term agreement for the sale or purchase of property; •the discounted value of amounts payable under the lease calculated in accordance with a determination made by the Commissioner; or 74 •if the lessee or lessor apply for a specific determination, an amount determined by the Commissioner (the amount determined would apply to both the lessee and the lessor). Application of proposals 12.13 A finance lease will be treated as a sale of the lease asset from the lessor to the lessee, possibly with a resale back at the end of the term. The lessor will be treated as having made a loan to the lessee of an amount equal to the consideration for the asset. The lessee will be treated as having used the loan to purchase the asset. 12.14 The lessor will account for any profit on that sale in the year of sale. The interest on the deemed loan will be recognised by both parties over the term of the loan on an accrual basis. The interest will be equal to the instalments and any guaranteed residual value, less the consideration for the asset. 12.15 A yield to maturity calculation will be applied to the cashflows of the lease transaction, with a base price adjustment at the end of the lease term. The yield to maturity calculation will be relatively straightforward, since the cashflows from the lease are usually set out in the lease agreement. If the cashflows are not known, the method to be used for spreading the interest will be dealt with under a determination. Guaranteed residual value clauses 12.16 Many finance lease agreements contain a residual value clause. This is effectively a “guarantee” to the lessor that the lease asset will have a certain value at the end of the lease term. Some clauses require the lessor to sell the lease asset when it is returned. If the proceeds from the sale are less than the guaranteed residual value, the lessee must pay the lessor the shortfall. Depending on the terms of the lease agreement, the lessor may be required to return any excess to the lessee. The guaranteed residual value is another element of the consideration passing under the arrangement and, therefore, should be included as a cashflow in accrual calculations. Depreciation and expiry of lease term 12.17 For depreciation purposes the lessee will be considered to have purchased the asset (and possibly to have sold it back to the lessor at the end of the lease term). As happens now for specified leases, the lessor will not be allowed a deduction for depreciation. 12.18 If there is a resale arrangement at the end of the lease term, the lessee will calculate any loss or gain on the sale of the lease asset, being the difference between the book value of the lease asset and the deemed sale price. SPECIFIED OR FINANCE LEASES 75 12.19 The deemed sale price on any sale back will be the guaranteed residual value or, if there is no guaranteed residual value, for no consideration. This deemed sale price may be adjusted for any payments required to be made to or from the lessee. That is, the deemed sale price would be increased by any payment to the lessee (for example, if the lease asset is sold to a third party for an amount greater than the guaranteed residual value and the lessor is required to pay the excess to the lessee). The price would be decreased by any payment from the lessee (for example, if the lease asset is sold to a third party for an amount less than the guaranteed residual value and the lessee is required to pay the shortfall to the lessor). Termination of the lease before the end of the lease term 12.20 Sometimes finance leases are terminated before the lease term expires. If the lease asset is re-acquired by the lessor, it will be deemed to be sold back to the lessor for an amount equal to the outstanding balance and a base price adjustment performed. The outstanding balance is the amount of the principal outstanding and any interest due at the termination, adjusted for early termination payment to or from the lessee. For example, any early termination penalty paid by the lessee would be deducted. 12.21 If the payment from the lessee to the lessor exceeds the outstanding balance, the lease asset will be deemed to have been sold to the lessor for no consideration. Any payments to or from the lessee would be included in the base price adjustment calculations (see example 3). Implementation 12.22 We propose that the new rules take effect for leases entered into on or after 1 April 1999. Thus the Act will deal with three types of lease: those within the current specified lease definition entered into before 1 April 1999, which will remain subject to the existing specified lease rules; those within the amended definition entered into on or after 1 April 1999 (“finance leases”), which will be subject to the accrual rules; and all others. 12.23 The following examples illustrate the proposed approach. The examples use the proposed base price adjustment formula as set out in chapter 6. 76 Example On 6 December 1996 a taxpayer leases computer equipment. The cash price at which the equipment could have been purchased from the lessor is $15,000. For the purposes of the example, assume there is no loading, and the equipment is depreciating at 40% diminishing value. The following table illustrates the amount of depreciation claimed by the lessee over the term of the lease. Tax year Opening book Depreciation Closing book valuevalue 31/03/9715,000.002,000.0013,000.00 31/03/9813,000.005,200.007,800.00 31/03/997,800.00 3,120.004,680.00 10,320.00 Instalments of $6,032 are paid annually for three years (75% of the equipment’s economic life), and the equipment has no guaranteed residual value. Using yield to maturity, the interest (being the three instalments of $6,032 ($18,096) and the guaranteed residual value (in this case 0) less the consideration of $15,000) is allocated as follows: Tax yearLessor’s Income/Lessee’s expenditure 31/03/97431.62 31/03/981,369.99 31/03/99903.68 31/03/00 390.71 3,096.00 Lessee The lessee uses the computer for the three years and then returns it to the lessor. The base price adjustment would, therefore, be: a= 15,000 b = 3 x 6,032 = 18,096 c =0 d =431.62 + 1,369.99 + 903.68 = 2,705.29 e =0 Base price adjustment 15,000 - 18,096 - 0 + 2,705.29 + 0 = (390.71) The base price adjustment gives a negative result, making it accrual expenditure incurred by the lessee. The lessee would also have a loss on sale of $4,680, being the book value of the asset ($4,680) and any guaranteed residual value payment (in this case zero) less the guaranteed residual value (in this case also zero). The following table sets out the expenditure incurred by the lessee over the term of the lease. The expenditure incurred for tax purposes, $18,096, equals the lease payments made of $18,096 (item “b” in the base price adjustment calculation).

Interest from the loan is spread under the accrual rules on a yield to maturity basis, with a base price adjustment in the final year. a = 3 x 6,032 = 18,096 b = 15,000 c = 431.62 + 1,369.99 + 903.68 = 2,705.29 d = 0 e = 0 Base price adjustment 18,096 – 15,000 - 2,705.29 + 0 + 0 = 390.71 The base price adjustment gives a positive result, making it accrual income derived by the lessor. The lessor is deemed to have purchased the lease asset for no consideration (that is, no guaranteed residual value was agreed between the lessor and the lessee). This table shows that interest and principal repaid under the deemed loan equal the lease payments.

At the end of the lease term the computer equipment is returned to the lessor, who then sells it for $2,000. Under the terms of the lease the lessee is required to pay the lessor $13,000. Using yield to maturity, the interest (being the three instalments of $1,500 and the guaranteed residual value of $15,000 less the consideration of $15,000) is allocated as follows: Tax yearLessor’s Income/Lessee’s expenditure 31/03/97431.51 31/03/981,500.00 31/03/991,500.00 31/03/001,068.49 4,500.00 Lessee Therefore the base price adjustment in the final year would be: a =15,000 b = (3 x 1,500) + 2,000 +13,000 =19,500 c = 0 d = 431.51 + 1,500.00 + 1,500.00 = 3,431.51 e = 0 Base price adjustment 15,000 – 19,500 - 0 + 3,431.51 + 0 = (1,068.49) The base price adjustment gives a negative result, making it accrual expenditure incurred by the lessee. The lessee would also have a loss on sale of the lease asset of $2,680 ($4,680 + $13,000 – $15,000, being the book value and the guaranteed residual value payment less the guaranteed residual value). The following table shows that the expenditure incurred by the lessee for tax purposes, $17,500, equals the lease payments of $4,500 and the payment made under the guaranteed residual value clause of $13,000.

In this example the sale price of $15,000 would be reduced by the payment from the lessee of $13,000, which means the lessor is treated as having purchased the asset for $2,000. Therefore there would be no loss or gain on the sale for the lessor. Example This example illustrates an early termination of a finance lease. On 4 December 1996 a taxpayer leases a computer. The lease is for three years, and the purchase price of the computer is $15,000. Lease instalments of $608.36 are paid monthly. The lessee returns the computer system on 2 January 1999 (after the 25th lease instalment). The lessee is required to pay a penalty of $1,200. Lessee The principal and interest outstanding when the lease is terminated have been calculated as $5,883.99. Therefore the outstanding balance would be $4,683.99 ($5,883.99, less the payment of $1,200). a = 15,000 b = (25 x 608.36) + 1,200 + 4,683.99 = 21,092.99 c = 0 d = 1,277.65 + 3,199.35 = 4,477 e = 0 Base price adjustment 15,000 – 21,092.99 - 0 + 4,477 + 0 = (1,615.99) The base price adjustment gives a negative result, making it accrual expenditure incurred by the lessee. The lessee also claims a loss on sale of the lease asset of $3,116.01 ($7,800 -$4,683.99, being the book value of the asset less the deemed sale price). Lessor The lessor would be deemed to acquire the computer for $4,683.99 (the outstanding balance). The interest from the deemed loan in the year the computer was returned would be: a = (25 x 608.36) + 1,200 + 4,683.99 = 21,092.99 b = 15,000.00 c = 1,277.65 + 3,199.35 = 4,477.00 d = 0 e = 0 Base price adjustment 21,092.99 – 15,000 - 4,477 + 0 + 0 = 1,615.99 The base price adjustment gives a positive result, making it accrual income of the lessee. 80 CHAPTER 13 SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS Proposed policy •Exclude security arrangements relating to credit risk from the accrual rules. •Keep security arrangements relating to prices and interest rates as substitutes for derivative transactions such as forward contracts within the rules. •Retain the prohibition on deductions for expenditure incurred by a surety in section EH 4, in which the surety and the principal debtor are related parties. •Repeal section EH 5(3), which provides a deduction for creditors who are unable to deduct losses arising from financial arrangements for which they are indemnified. Security arrangements and the accrual rules 13.1 A guarantee or other security arrangement for which a fee is paid to the guarantor will fall squarely within the definition of a financial arrangement adopted by the accrual rules. It is an arrangement whereby a person (the surety) obtains money (the fee) in consideration for a promise by any other person (the surety) to provide money to any person (the creditor) at some future time or times, or upon the occurrence of some future event (default by the debtor). 13.2 There has been doubt whether guarantees for which no fee is paid could also pass the financial arrangement test. A recent case heard in the High Court, McElwee v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 23 , established that personal guarantees when there is no fee are not financial arrangements. Practical difficulties 13.3 Many problems with the application of the accrual rules to security arrangements have been identified. They include: •the scope of the definition of financial arrangement in relation to guarantees and security arrangements; •uncertainties as to how income or expenditure should be recognised on an accrual basis given the contingent nature of the cashflows; 23 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,288. SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS 81 •whether the existence of a guarantee should always mean there is a wider financial arrangement; •the calculation of the acquisition price for the surety when no fee is paid, but the consideration for the guarantee is the provision of financial accommodation to a third party; and •how to treat any debt outstanding between the guarantor and the debtor if the rights of the original creditor are subrogated to the guarantor. 13.4 A guarantee generally enables a third party to be provided with credit. It reduces the credit risk and affects the pricing of an associated financial transaction for the lender of funds. A guarantee or indemnity is analogous to a collateral security for a primary financing arrangement. It can also be used in the same way as a derivative over foreign exchange or interest rates. These features make the distinction between guarantees and other debt substitutes somewhat arbitrary. 13.5 The distinction between security arrangements and insurance contracts is even more difficult to draw. Guarantees, security arrangements and insurance contracts are able to be substituted because all may reduce the credit risk faced by the lender of funds. Since contracts of insurance are excepted financial arrangements, and security arrangements are included in the accrual rules, different tax results could arise depending on the form of arrangement used. Proposed reform Removal of security arrangements relating to credit risk from the accrual rules 13.6 Many of the difficulties described above could be resolved by removing security arrangements from the ambit of the accrual rules. The Valabh Committee recommended this course of action for two reasons: because of uncertainty arising from the issues mentioned above; and on policy grounds, since guarantees are not debt or debt substitutes but more akin to insurance contracts (which are excluded from the accrual rules). 13.7 We agree with this approach if the security arrangement enables a third party to be provided with credit. This type of security arrangement is ultimately closer to an insurance contract than to a derivative financial arrangement. 82 13.8 An amendment to the definition of excepted financial arrangement is the best way to legislate for this because guarantees and security arrangements cannot be easily removed from the core definition of financial arrangement. They exhibit the fundamental feature of a financial arrangement – an exchange of money for a promise to pay money on the happening of a future event. Guarantees as substitutes for derivative financial arrangements 13.9 Some security arrangements indemnify or secure a person against foreign exchange fluctuations or other changes in market prices such as interest rate changes. These arrangements are capable of having the same effect as a derivative such as a forward contract for foreign exchange. Derivative contracts are included in the accrual rules because they can be used as debt substitutes and can alter the income or expenditure profile of a debt instrument denominated in a foreign currency. Security arrangements, apart from those insuring against credit risk, will continue to be taxed under the accrual rules. 13.10 If all security arrangements were excepted financial arrangements it might be possible to avoid the application of the accrual rules by structuring or writing derivative contracts in the form of an indemnity. Effect of removing security arrangements from the accrual rules The creditor 13.11 For the creditor, a base price adjustment will result in expenditure incurred 24 equal to the difference between the amount lent and the amount repaid by the borrower. Expenditure, which is currently deemed to be interest for the purposes of the accrual rules, will be deductible under section DD 1(b) if it is payable in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or in the course of business. 13.12 However, the deduction will be restricted by section DJ 1(c) if the creditor is indemnified against losses on a loan. That section prohibits deductions for amounts recoverable under a contract of insurance or right of indemnity unless expressly provided for in the Act. 13.13 Recoveries under any guarantee will be determined according to non- accrual income recognition rules. Generally, recoveries will not be gross income except to the extent that payment represents compensation of a revenue nature. This “non-deductible – non-assessable” approach should achieve a correct and symmetrical result for the creditor. 24 Note that we are proposing that the automatic deduction be repealed for holders. SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS 83 The debtor 13.14 For the debtor, the timing of the base price adjustment in relation to a financial arrangement is significant because at that point remission income on amounts not repaid will arise. The base price adjustment of the loan will occur when the debtor is discharged from making any remaining payments under the financial arrangement. The effect of the base price adjustment will be to bring to account as remission income amounts owed and not repaid by the debtor. 13.15 Guarantee fees paid by a debtor may be deductible under section DJ 11. That section allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the derivation of gross income. The guarantor 13.16 A deduction for an amount paid by a guarantor under a security arrangement will be dependent on the deductibility tests in section BD 2. Assuming the guarantee is on revenue account and the expenditure or loss is not recoverable under any right of indemnity, a deduction will be available. 13.17 A recovery made by the guarantor which is compensation for the payment made under the guarantee should have the character of income if the recovery replaces a loss previously deducted as a cost of deriving income. 13.18 Guarantee fees will be assessable when derived. Other proposals in relation to guarantees Deductions for expenditure incurred by a surety where the surety and the principal debtor are related parties 13.19 The Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure 25 (the Brash Committee) was concerned that if a financial arrangement is guaranteed, the base price adjustment can be deferred indefinitely, particularly between related parties. This could allow more than one deduction for the cost of borrowing: the debtor gets a deduction for the cost of borrowing, and the guarantor pays the principal and claims a deduction on the basis that giving guarantees is part of its business. The debt is left outstanding, so no remission income arises. The Committee considered this inappropriate if the parties were related. 13.20 As a result, section EH 4(8) was enacted to disallow a deduction for losses incurred by a surety as a result of the actions of, or events under the control of, a related party. 25 Supplementary report to the Minister of Finance, 9 June 1987, pages 13, 14. 84 13.21 The Valabh Committee recommended that the pre-accrual law which would have allowed deductions to associates if the surety was in the business of giving guarantees should be retained because guarantees by related parties are common commercial practice. 13.22 We do not agree with the Valabh Committee on this point because we consider that the original concerns of the Brash Committee are valid. In addition, any change in the current policy could undermine the restrictions on bad debt deductions between associates by shifting the deduction for what is effectively a capital loss to an associated company that is in the business of providing guarantees. 13.23 The Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 introduced a new section 64G (EH 5) which clearly provides that bad debt deductions in respect of financial arrangements are governed solely by section EH 5, which limits bad debts between associated parties. 13.24 The policy behind the restrictions on bad debt deductions for associates is that the absence of such restrictions would encourage businesses to fund subsidiaries through debt in order to allow losses to be deductible if they arose. Gains, on the other hand, would be exempt, assuming the shares in the subsidiary were held on capital account. 13.25 We therefore propose retaining the current policy restrictions on deductions for losses under guarantees provided by associates. Repeal section EH 5(3) 13.26 Section EH 5(3) allows a deduction, up to the amount of the security payment made, if the holder has not been able to take a deduction for losses on the secured arrangement under any other provision of the Act. 13.27 This provision will no longer be necessary because the inclusion or otherwise of security payments in income will be determined according to its character as compensation for a capital or revenue item. 85 CHAPTER 14 TRUSTS AND ESTATES Proposed policy Transfer of a financial arrangement on death Establish that transfer of a financial arrangement, necessitating a base price adjustment, will occur: •on the death of a party to a financial arrangement; and •on the distribution of a financial arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. Natural love and affection Clarify section EH 4(6) to make it clear that: • if a creditor forgives a debt (whether in a will or otherwise) because of the natural love and affection that the creditor has for the debtor, and • if a creditor forgives a debt owing by a trust because of natural love and affection that the creditor has for the beneficiaries of that trust, amounts forgiven will be deemed to have been paid for the purpose of the accrual rules and will not give rise to income to the debtor. Accrued beneficiary income Continue to treat accrued income arising to a trust not paid or applied to a beneficiary as trustee income. Application of the accrual rules to non-resident trustees who derive New Zealand sourced income Require non-resident trustees who derive New Zealand sourced income from a financial arrangement if a trust settlor is resident in New Zealand to account for this income and expenditure under the accrual rules. Deceased estates and the accrual rules 14.1 The accrual rules require a base price adjustment to be carried out when a financial arrangement matures or is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred. There is uncertainty as to if and when this should be done on the death of a party to a financial arrangement. 86 14.2 A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate. 14.3 Legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property vests in the executors. The same rights will vest in an administrator on the grant of letters of administration, and this vesting will relate back to the time of death. Since legal and beneficial ownership vests in the personal representatives during the period of administration, a beneficiary under the will or on intestacy will merely have an inchoate right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this time. 14.4 The duties of the deceased’s representative are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the remaining assets in accordance with the terms of the will or, in the absence of a will, with the laws on intestacy. Generally, executors have one year in which to complete these duties. 14.5 Once an executor or administrator has taken possession of the assets of the deceased person, paid debts and testamentary and administrative expenses, and distributed the legacies in accordance with the terms of the will, the administration of the estate is complete. At this stage the personal representative becomes a trustee of the net residue for the persons beneficially entitled. Transfers of property for an intestate estate are subject to the Administration Act 1969, and statutory trusts may be constituted under that Act in favour of beneficiaries. 14.6 Property that has been bequeathed under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. A specific legacy constitutes an identifiable part of the estate, whereas a general legacy is a gift which the personal representative is bound to provide out of the deceased’s general estate but in relation to which the testator has given no indication as to which part of the estate should be used to satisfy the legacy. A residuary gift is generally all property left over in the estate that has not been specifically disposed of. 14.7 Under the “doctrine of relation back”, specific legacies take effect from the date of death. Thus once an executor has given his or her assent to a specific legacy, legal and beneficial title vests in the specific legatee, and such vesting relates back to the time of death of the deceased. As a consequence, a legatee of such a gift has claim to all rights and benefits that have accrued to the subject matter of the legacy from the date of death. The legatee must bear all expenses over this period in relation to the asset in question. General and residuary legacies vest in the beneficiary at the time of distribution (when assent is given by the executor). TRUSTS AND ESTATES 87 14.8 Once the executor assents to hold the assets of the deceased on the trusts created by the will, the beneficial ownership of the assets subject to these trusts pass to the beneficiaries entitled. The exception is discretionary trusts, under which beneficiaries cannot obtain beneficial title until the trustee has exercised discretion in their favour. Practical difficulties 14.9 Uncertainty and confusion surround the application of the accrual rules to financial arrangements on the death of a taxpayer through to final distribution of the deceased’s assets. In particular, uncertainty exists over the requirement to perform a base price adjustment in relation to financial arrangements held by the executor or trustee of a deceased. Options for change 14.10 Where a financial arrangement is held by a deceased estate, a base price adjustment will be required as at the date of death, and on distribution of the financial arrangement to a beneficiary. Base price adjustment on death 14.11 The transfer on death should be deemed to be a disposal at market value. The Act recognises that there is a change of ownership of a taxpayer’s assets at death. A requirement for a base price adjustment to occur on death in relation to financial arrangements held is consistent with other provisions in the Act. 26 In the absence of a base price adjustment on the death of a taxpayer, it would be possible: •for assets to move from an accrual basis holder to a cash basis holder and vice versa; or •for assets to be gifted to beneficiaries who were tax exempt. 14.12 A requirement to carry out a base price adjustment at the date of death should not lead to added compliance costs because the estate is in an ascertainable form, and a tax return must be filed at this date. Base price adjustment on distribution 14.13 A requirement for taxpayers to perform a base price adjustment on a distribution of a financial arrangement by a trustee to a beneficiary would be consistent with the fact that the income tax system treats trustees and beneficiaries as separate taxable entities. 26 See, for instance, section FB 3 - Disposal of Trading stock, section EL 1(3) - Valuation of livestock on death of a taxpayer, and section CG 23(4) - Interest in a foreign investment fund deemed to be disposed of at death. 88 14.14 This is the correct treatment for residuary beneficiaries. Any income arising from the financial arrangement between death and distribution will be taxed to the estate, and the beneficiary will take the financial arrangement at its market value on the day it is transferred to the beneficiary. 14.15 If a financial arrangement is transferred to a beneficiary under a specific legacy, the doctrine of relation back (see paragraph 14.7) means that the beneficiary takes the financial arrangement at its market value at the date of death. This suggests that the beneficiary should take the financial arrangement at that date (along with any corresponding tax obligations). However, we are not proposing to take this approach for the purposes of the accrual rules. 14.16 Requiring a base price adjustment on death and distribution for both specific legatees and residuary beneficiaries will result in the residuary estate meeting the cost of any tax payable over that period. This will include tax on an increase in value of the financial arrangement that is the subject of a specific legacy. Thus a specific legatee of a financial arrangement may be advantaged over the residuary beneficiaries, depending on the value of the financial arrangement. Although we acknowledge this as a drawback to our proposal, we consider the compliance costs of the alternatives (discussed below) to be prohibitive. In any event, we understand that it is rare for a will to provide that income arising during the period of administration of the estate from a financial arrangement that is the subject of a specific legacy belongs to the specific legatee. 14.17 We note that our proposal accords with the recommendations of the Valabh Committee as set out in its final report. Other options considered 14.18 Theoretically, a base price adjustment should be performed every time there is a change of beneficial ownership. This could include the point at which assets are transferred from an executor to a trustee of a testamentary trust at the end of an administration period, and in some cases, on each distribution to a beneficiary. The vesting of legacies can occur at different times for different beneficiaries. For example, specific legacies vest in the specific legatee from the date of death, while residuary beneficiaries will only take from the date of actual distribution. 14.19 However, we acknowledge that to require a base price adjustment on all three events may significantly increase compliance costs. The Valabh Committee was also of the view that such a requirement would be excessive and would create unnecessary complexity in income tax law. We also acknowledge that to require a base price adjustment at the change from executor to trustee may create difficulties, since it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the precise time at which an executor assents to hold assets of the estate on trust. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 89 14.20 We have also considered an option that would require only one base price adjustment at the time of death. Thereafter a beneficiary would acquire the financial arrangement at the market value as at the date of death. This market value would be adjusted to take account of any income or expenditure accounted for by the personal representatives in respect of the financial arrangement during the period of administration of the estate. 14.21 However, this proposal would require the introduction of additional rules for the calculation of the adjusted acquisition cost for the beneficiary (or person entitled on intestacy), which would increase the complexity of the rules and add to compliance costs. Specific issues for consultation We prefer the approach of base price adjustments on death and distribution over that of one base price adjustment on death, with an adjustment (if necessary) on distribution, for tax paid by the estate. Do the compliance costs associated with the latter approach outweigh the potential effect on the value of the gift to specific legatees associated with the former approach? Forgiveness of debt in consideration of natural love and affection and the accrual rules 14.22 Under the accrual rules a debt that is remitted or forgiven will give rise to assessable income to the debtor. However, if a debt is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection, section EH 4(6) treats the amount forgiven as if it had been paid for the purposes of the accrual rules. Thus the amount will not give rise to income to the debtor. 14.23 The Commissioner has issued a public binding ruling which states that section EH 4(6) can apply to: 27 •a debt forgiveness between near relatives such as a father and child, brother and sister, husband and wife and de facto parents; •a debt forgiven in a will; and •a debt forgiveness by a trust settlor or creditor to a family trust where the creditor has or would have had a relationship of natural love and affection with the trust beneficiaries. (Depending on the particular case, this may also apply to debts owing by discretionary trusts.) 27 BR Pub 96/4 published in Volume Seven, No. 10 of the Tax Information Bulletin. 90 14.24 Under this interpretation the section does not apply to: •a forgiveness of debt owing by a company; or •a debt owing by the beneficiaries to a trust if it has been forgiven by a trustee, irrespective of the trustee’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. Practical difficulties 14.25 The lack of clarity as to the scope of the section leads to uncertainty for taxpayers, particularly in its application to debt forgiveness by or to trusts. Options for change 14.26 We propose that section EH 4(6) apply to: •a creditor forgiving a debt owing by a debtor because of the natural love and affection that the creditor has for the debtor (which would also include the situation where the forgiveness of debt occurs in the creditor’s will in consideration of natural love and affection for the debtor); and •a trust settlor or creditor forgiving a debt owing by a trust because of natural love and affection that the creditor has for the beneficiaries of that trust. Other options considered Forgiveness of debt owing to the estate or trust 14.27 We are not proposing to extend section EH 4(6) to apply to a trustee, executor or administrator who forgives a debt owing by beneficiaries to a trust or estate in consideration of the natural love and affection the settlor has or had for the beneficiaries of the trust. 14.28 A trustee can be taxed as a separate tax entity from a settlor who holds the property subject to the trust on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the beneficiaries of that trust. Therefore we consider that extending section EH 4(6) to include forgiveness by an executor or trustee would not be acceptable. In relation to the forgiveness of debts owed to a testamentary trust, under this option the subjective intention of the deceased settlor would have to be considered. This would be difficult in practice. Forgiveness of company debt obligations 14.29 Section EH 4(6) should not be extended to include forgiveness of debts owing by companies whose shareholders were persons for whom the creditor had natural love and affection. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 91 14.30 A company has a separate legal identity from its shareholders. In contrast, a trust is a form of relationship in which one person (the trustee) holds property in his or her own ownership for the benefit of a second party (the beneficiary). The property is held according to terms that are dictated by the person who constituted the trust (the settlor). The function of trust law is to enforce the duties implicit in the trust relationship that exists between the trustee and the beneficiary and to provide remedies for a breach of those duties. 14.31 A forgiveness of a debt owing by a trust will benefit the beneficiaries of that trust. However, there may be situations where a loan to a company that is subsequently remitted does not beneficially flow through to shareholders – for example, if a company is insolvent, or in loss. 14.32 If section EH 4(6) were extended to the forgiveness of debts owing by companies, proximity problems could arise if the shareholders were not ordinary persons but were other entities (such as trusts or companies) controlled by natural persons for whom there was natural love and affection. 14.33 We note that the Valabh Committee, in its 1991 report, was also opposed to extending section EH 4(6) to cover forgiveness of debts owing by companies. Extending section EH 4(6) to financial arrangements other than debts 14.34 We have also considered whether section EH 4(6), which refers to the forgiveness of “debt”, should be extended to include a forgiveness of an obligation under all financial arrangements. 14.35 Section EH 4(6) is a concession intended to apply to simple family transactions. To extend its scope could mean that it is used in complicated forms of tax planning. Altering the tax treatment of creditors 14.36 We have also considered the argument that section EH 4(6) is unfair in that it imposes a tax liability on a creditor for interest income that has never been paid by the debtor. However, we agree with the Valabh Committee that the policy behind the provision was that a remission of a debt in consideration of natural love and affection should be no different from a repayment having been made by the debtor, and the creditor subsequently gifting the payment back to the debtor. The tax consequences in each situation should be the same, and on this basis the creditor would be taxable on interest income. Therefore we do not propose altering the tax treatment of creditors under section EH 4(6). 92 Accrued beneficiary income and the accrual rules 14.37 The term “beneficiary income” is defined in the Act as income derived by a trustee during an income year which vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary, or is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of a beneficiary during or within six months after the end of that income year. Practical difficulties 14.38 It is not clear whether the definition of beneficiary income includes income considered to be derived in relation to a financial arrangement. 14.39 Gross income, under the accrual rules, can include income that has not been received by the trust. Accordingly, the income cannot be paid or applied to, or vested absolutely in interest in a beneficiary. That income must, therefore, be taxed as trustee income at 33%, whereas the beneficiary who ultimately receives the income may be on a lower rate. Options for change 14.40 If the Commissioner could be satisfied that the income from a particular financial arrangement would eventually be paid or applied to a particular beneficiary on a lower tax rate, it might be possible to tax that gross income as beneficiary income. However, there appears to be no workable and practical test that could be applied to classify income arising from a financial arrangement as beneficiary income. Reliance on trustees’ resolutions and accounts would be unacceptable from the Government’s point of view because of the opportunity it presents for subsequent reversal. Accordingly, we do not propose any change. Specific issues for consultation Is there a satisfactory and irreversible way to clarify income accruing from financial arrangements as beneficiary income? Non-resident trustees holding financial arrangements and the accrual rules 14.41 Trusts are generally taxed on the basis of the residence of the settlor. The residence of the trustee is disregarded for New Zealand tax purposes. A trustee, whether resident or non-resident, is liable to income tax on all trustee income that the trustee derives from New Zealand. 28 28 Section AA 2 refers. TRUSTS AND ESTATES 93 Practical difficulties 14.42 Part H of the Act specifically provides a mechanism for non-resident trustees who derive foreign sourced income to be subject to the accrual rules. Because there is no such specific rule for New Zealand sourced income, the accrual rules do not apply to income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to financial arrangements held or issued by non-resident trustees. 14.43 Thus there is inconsistent treatment between: •non-resident trustees deriving foreign sourced income from financial arrangements; and •non-resident trustees deriving New Zealand sourced income from financial arrangements, who may not be subject to the accrual rules (if the financial arrangement does not relate to a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand). Proposed reform 14.44 There is no justifiable policy reason for this difference in treatment. Section EH 9 should be amended to clarify that non-resident trustees (where a settlor is resident in New Zealand) who derive New Zealand sourced income from a financial arrangement are subject to the accrual rules. 94 CHAPTER 15 AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES Proposed policy •Amalgamate the rules applying to trade credits into the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property. •Extend the rules relating to agreements for the sale and purchase of property to apply to the provision of services. •Introduce accumulation provisions to enable the accrual rules to apply to prepayments. •Extend the definition of property (which currently includes trading stock) to include revenue account property that is not trading stock. Agreements for sale and purchase of property and the accrual rules 15.1 The accrual rules were intended to bring to tax on an accrual basis amounts associated with charges for the use of money. The rules were to cover interest, whether explicit or implicit, on exchanges with deferred payment. 15.2 The rules were not intended to bring to tax changes in the value of property, goods or services that are the subject of an agreement for the sale and purchase of property between the date the parties agreed to a future price and the settlement date. The “lowest price” concept in determining the consideration for trade credits and property transactions (including specified options) ensures this effect is achieved. Practical difficulties 15.3 A number of problems have arisen relating to the application of these rules: •Problems arise because the property and trade credit rules overlap. For example, the period between the date of delivery of property and the date on which the purchase price is paid (settlement) can sometimes constitute a trade credit for the purposes of the accrual rules. This creates uncertainty as the core acquisition price is defined differently for trade credits and property agreements. AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES 95 •The rules do not cater for payment for the use of money over time in a contract for services. •A prepayment for services is not within the trade credit or property agreement rules, so paragraph (e) of the definition of core acquisition price applies. This means that movement in the value of the services is brought to tax. •There are no interest accumulation rules to deal with prepayments generally. •The current definition of “core acquisition price” deals only with the original parties to the financial arrangement and does not deal with the on-selling of the financial arrangement. •The definition of property may not be comprehensive enough to cover all situations in which the rules should be applied. Proposed reform Agreements for the sale and purchase of property and services 15.4 The first three of these problems can be addressed by amalgamating the trade credit rules to the property rules, and applying the rules for property agreements to services. 15.5 A trade credit is defined as a debt for goods or services, and therefore those rules have a wider scope than the rules for property agreements, which do not currently apply to services. 15.6 If the property rules are applied to services, the two sets of rules can be integrated and the concept of a trade credit will be redundant. This means that there will be no question as to whether an agreement for the sale and purchase of property becomes a trade credit at any point. 15.7 At present there are no rules relating to prepayments for services. The trade credit rules apply to debts for goods and services. It appears that a prepayment is not a trade credit or short-term trade credit as currently defined because these refer to payments after the supply of goods or services. Integrating trade credits and the property rules (which will cover services) overcomes this problem. 96 Integrating agreements for the sale and purchase of property with trade credits: consequential issues Definition of excepted financial arrangements 15.8 As a result of the proposed changes, the definition of short-term trade credits will also be amalgamated with short-term property agreements. However, the measurement periods for short-term property agreements and short-term trade credits are not consistent. For property agreements the measurement period runs from the date the agreement was entered into. For trade credits the relevant date is the date that the goods and services are supplied, or for continuous supplies (such as electricity) the date of invoice. 15.9 The rules for the measurement period for property agreements are broader. This is because an agreement for the sale and purchase of property can result in a loan from the buyer to the seller of property (if there is a prepayment) or a loan from the seller to the buyer (if payment is deferred). The date of supply of property is, therefore, an inappropriate point from which to measure the term of an arrangement. 15.10 We propose bringing the trade credit rules into line with those for property agreements except if the supply of goods or services is continuous. In that case the period will run from the date of invoice. Aligning the measurement periods means that the measurement period for trade credits now runs from the date the agreement was entered into. As a result, some short-term trade credits may become financial arrangements because agreements are entered into before the supply of goods or services. To alleviate the effect of this we will increase the term of short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property and services to 93 days. Short-term excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements by election 15.11 For the purposes of the accrual rules, taxpayers are allowed to treat short- term trade credits as financial arrangements provided notice in writing is given to the Commissioner. This flexibility is required because many taxpayers include all income or expenditure from trade credits in income for accounting and tax purposes. Separating out the short-term from the long-term trade credits can be a compliance burden. 15.12 The election will be extended to short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property. Determination of acquisition price 15.13 There are differences in the rules specifying the core acquisition price for deferred settlement sales. The core acquisition price of a trade credit can be the cash price of the goods under the Credit Contracts Act 1981. AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES 97 15.14 We intend to retain this option in determining the consideration paid under an agreement where the disclosure requirements of the Credit Contracts Act 1981 apply. 15.15 The new rules for determining the consideration paid under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services will be: •the cash price determined under the Credit Contracts Act 1981 where that Act applies; or •the lowest price the parties would have agreed on the basis of full payment when the first right in the property is transferred or the services are provided; or •the discounted value of the amounts payable using a method determined by the Commissioner under a determination issued under the Tax Administration Act 1994; or •if there is a combination of payments before and after the first right in the property is transferred or services are provided, the aggregate of the future value of the payments made before the transfer of the property and the discounted value of the amounts payable after transfer of the property (see below). Bad debts 15.16 A deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a trade credit is available to taxpayers who carry on the business of dealing in goods or services. If the distinction between agreements for the sale and purchase of property and trade credits is removed, the deduction will also be available in respect of those agreements, as long as the taxpayer is a dealer in the goods or services that are the subject of the agreement. Interest accumulation 15.17 In some circumstances all or part of the purchase price of a property is paid before the transfer of any right in the property. This means that the seller has the use of the buyer’s money while retaining the use of the property and the benefits that flow from the property. The buyer, on the other hand, may require compensation for not being able to use the money or the property. 15.18 The price agreed to be paid for the property is likely to reflect these costs and benefits. Any interest element contained in the valuation of the property should be subject to the accrual rules. The rules should isolate that element and spread recognition of the associated income or expense over the term of the arrangement. 98 15.19 We propose amending the accrual rules to include a provision allowing an adjustment to the consideration if the purchaser of the property pays in advance and obtains a reduction of the purchase price by doing so. 15.20 The Tax Administration Act 1994 would also be amended to give the Commissioner power to make determinations setting out how and when accumulation rules will apply. The definition of consideration if a property agreement is on-sold 15.21 If an agreement for the sale and purchase of property (or a specified option) is on-sold, the income or expenditure as calculated under the base price adjustment is incorrect. This is because the core acquisition price is designed for situations where the arrangement is held to maturity. It does not deal with situations where the arrangement is sold for a price that reflects the change in the underlying value of the property. 15.22 The rules for valuing consideration under a property agreement should be limited to the parties who originally entered into the arrangement. If the agreement is on-sold, the consideration should be calculated by reference to what the acquiring party actually pays. 15.23 The hire purchase rules have made this distinction by applying the core acquisition price rules to the “first holder” only. The integration of the hire purchase and agreement for the sale and purchase of property rules will deal with this problem. The definition of property 15.24 In its final report the Valabh Committee recommended that the definition of “agreement for the sale and purchase of property” be amended by widening the definition of “property”. It was concerned that the existing definition would not cover all assets held on revenue account. This is because the definition of “trading stock” depends on the circumstances of the taxpayer, and a particular revenue asset may not qualify if the asset is not held as trading stock. 15.25 The Committee recommended that the definition of property for the accrual rules be extended to cover property of any kind, whether real or personal, legal or equitable, tangible or intangible, and modified to exclude foreign exchange and financial arrangements. The separate definition of “trading stock” for accrual purposes can be repealed. We agree with these recommendations and propose to make the changes. 99 CHAPTER 16 DEFINITIONS Proposed policy Clarify the definition of agreements for the sale and purchase of property, forward contracts and futures contracts so that: • The rules for valuing consideration under a property agreement will only apply if the agreement must be settled by physical delivery of property. • A futures contract is a forward contract traded on a recognised futures exchange. Distinctions in the accrual rules between agreements for the sale and purchase of property, forward contracts and futures contracts 16.1In 1988 special rules for the taxation of agreements for the sale and purchase of property were introduced. The purpose of the new rules was to ensure that for agreements where the main purpose is the transfer of property, only that part of a deferred settlement which can be substituted for debt, the financing element, is subject to the accrual rules. Changes in the value of the underlying property are not treated as accrual income or expenditure. 16.2For forward contracts, on the other hand, movement in the value of the underlying property is brought to tax. For this reason, the distinction between property agreements and forward contracts is important. 16.3A distinction can be drawn between an agreement for the sale and purchase of property under which the property will pass to the purchaser, with an interest component that compensates the vendor for deferred payment, and an agreement that is effectively a “bet” as to the value of a commodity in the future. 16.4In the first case, any movement in the value of the property concerned is not brought to tax under the accrual rules. The second is an example of a forward contract that uses a particular commodity as a pricing index, and that should be subject to the same tax rules as other forward contracts. 16.5Yet both can be written as an agreement for the sale and purchase of property since the definitions of these agreements and of forward contracts are not sufficiently clear. 100 16.6Futures contracts are not defined in the legislation. The distinction between forward and futures contracts is important in the accrual rules because under the spreading provisions in section EH 1(6), the market valuation method is available for all futures contracts, but only for forward contracts for foreign exchange. Proposal 16.7The rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property were intended to deal with actual transfers of property. They were not intended to apply if the property is being used only as a pricing index. If there is a cash settlement option in a property agreement, this is an indication that the property is being used as a pricing index. The agreement should then be treated as a forward contract. 29 16.8Current practice is to treat forward contracts as futures contracts only where they are traded on a recognised exchange. The policy rationale behind this is that the market valuation method available for futures contracts is restricted to recognised markets where the risk of default is low. Our proposal is that this be made explicit in the legislation. 29 We note that this is consistent with the approach suggested by the International Accounting Standards Committee in its discussion paper Accounting for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, March 1997. 101 CHAPTER 17 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Proposed policy •Repeal the disclosure requirements contained in section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. •Amend section GD 11(1) by removing the reference to a connection between the parties, and by extending it to apply if a financial arrangement is issued, acquired, varied, sold or otherwise transferred. •Remove non-contingent fees from the scope of the accrual rules. •Treat a distribution of a financial arrangement in specie by a company in liquidation as a disposition requiring a base price adjustment. •Replace the word “comprises” in provisions in the accrual rules with the word “includes”. •Remove the necessity for a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement if a New Zealand resident becomes non-resident and still carries on business through a fixed establishment. •Exempt temporary residents from the requirement to calculate a base price adjustment under section EH 4(9)(d) provided they become non-resident for tax purposes within three years of initially obtaining tax residence. This applies only to financial arrangements to which they were a party before first becoming a New Zealand resident. Disclosure of financial arrangements 17.1 The definition of financial arrangement includes composite arrangements. 17.2 Disclosure provisions for interrelated arrangements (under section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) were introduced to assist the Commissioner in identifying composite arrangements. Subsidiary objectives were the provision of information for general purposes, such as to assist with audit targeting, and the specific purpose of determining a taxpayer’s liability to tax. 102 Practical difficulties 17.3 The Valabh Committee noted the following problems with the disclosure provisions: •The Commissioner can already request information from specific taxpayers under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. •The provision is poorly targeted, resulting in burdensome compliance obligations on taxpayers. •Acceptability of non-compliance with the provision by taxpayers and Inland Revenue undermines the credibility of the accrual rules. •Circularity inherent in the drafting of the section, on a strict interpretation, makes it redundant. 17.4 Commentators have described the disclosure requirements as unwieldy because it is difficult to determine if constituent parts of a financial arrangement are “related”, and disclosure may result in breach of confidentiality. Proposed reform 17.5 We propose the repeal of section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recent reforms, such as the new compliance and penalties legislation and changes to the international tax rules, have resulted in a more robust tax system. That fact, coupled with a commitment to compliance cost reduction and the failure of the disclosure rules to operate as an effective deterrent to tax avoidance, support this approach. 17.6 We considered whether the information gathering powers of the Commissioner should be strengthened in the absence of the general accrual disclosure provisions. This would enable Inland Revenue to seek information on particular transactions as required, rather than receive information as a matter of course. 17.7 The Valabh Committee acknowledged that Inland Revenue may need to require disclosure of particular arrangements or types of arrangements, from certain groups of taxpayers, or perhaps all taxpayers, and that the existing section 17 may not authorise that level of disclosure. 17.8 Changes to the general information gathering powers of the Commissioner, however, are beyond the scope of the accruals review. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 103 Non-market transactions 17.9 Section GD 11 is aimed at transactions that attempt to defeat the intent and application of the accrual rules. The provision allows the consideration agreed between the parties to be replaced with arm’s length consideration. 17.10 We propose to extend the scope of the provision to ensure that it does not set unnecessary limitations on the power of Inland Revenue to set independent or market related prices. 17.11 First, the requirement of a connection between the parties will be removed. Taxpayers, whether associated persons or not, may act in concert to manipulate their income tax liabilities. 17.12 Second, the current provision is limited to the issue or transfer of a financial arrangement, which is too narrow. The section will be extended to apply where an arrangement is issued, acquired, varied, sold or otherwise transferred. The treatment of fees Current treatment 17.13 Currently, the treatment of fees incurred in relation to a financial arrangement is dependent upon whether the fees are contingent or non- contingent. Contingent fees must be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Non-contingent fees up to 2% of the core acquisition price do not have to be spread. 17.14 The policy behind this treatment is that the fees should be taken into account as a cashflow in calculating income or expenditure, since the fees of a financial arrangement affect the cost of funds. Non-contingent fees are deductible immediately only up to 2%, as an anti-avoidance measure. 17.15 The Valabh Committee could not find a substantive justification for distinguishing between different classes of fees. The Committee also noted that taxpayers often had difficulty determining whether a fee was contingent or non-contingent. For example, brokerage payable in connection with the issue of debt securities may or may not be a contingent fee, depending on whether the brokerage is payable on applications received or applications accepted. Proposed reform 17.16 Our proposal is that all contingent fees will be spread because they can be substituted for interest. Non-contingent fees will not be spread. 104 17.17 The difficulty of determining whether brokerage is contingent or non- contingent can be overcome by referring to the specific agreement or contract. If the brokerage is payable on applications received, and is non- refundable, it is non-contingent. If it is payable on applications accepted, it is contingent. 17.18 However, we consider the avoidance problem to have been overstated. Accordingly, the 2% threshold for non-contingent fees will be removed for two reasons. First, taxpayers have commented on the complexity of complying with the requirements of this threshold, and the removal of the distinction between holder and issuer and the introduction of the new base price adjustment will not alleviate this. Second, we consider that non- contingent fees, regardless of the amount involved, should not be spread, since they cannot readily be substituted for interest. Distributions by companies 17.19 A distribution in specie of a financial arrangement by a company in liquidation should occur at market value, requiring a base price adjustment. This is consistent with the Act’s approach to the distribution of other assets such as those governed by: •section GD 2, which considers a distribution of trading stock to shareholders to be a sale for market value; and •section GD 11(3), which considers a financial arrangement distributed for a non-market value consideration (if the transferor is a dealer or acquired it for the purpose of sale or disposal) to be a sale at market value. 17.20 This is also consistent with the Valabh Committee’s proposal and with our recommendations in chapter 14. “Comprises” 17.21 Various provisions in the accrual rules refer to a taxpayer whose business “comprises” dealing in financial arrangements. 30 The question is whether the word “comprises” in these provisions has an exhaustive or inclusive meaning and whether that meaning is consistent with the intended policy. The provision was intended to apply even if only part of the taxpayer’s business, such as the treasury function within a company, involves dealing in financial arrangements. 31 Even so, the specific financial arrangement, which is the subject of the provisions, must arise as part of that business of dealing. 30 Sections EH 1(6)(c)(i), EH 4(5), EH 5(2)(a) and GD 11(3)(b). 31 In the context of bad debts, “comprise” has an inclusive meaning. See Tax Information Bulletin, No. 3, September 1989, Appendix C. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 105 17.22 To apply the exhaustive meaning would be too restrictive. We propose to replace “comprises” with “includes”. Change of residence 17.23 Section EH 4(9)(d) requires that when persons becomes non-resident (even if they continue to carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment) they are required to perform a base price adjustment for any financial arrangement to which they are a party. 17.24 We consider that if a taxpayer continues to carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, a base price adjustment should not be required, because the taxpayer continues to be taxed according to the accrual rules. 17.25 Section EH 4(9)(d) will be amended to reflect this. Temporary residents with financial arrangements denominated in foreign currencies 17.26 Under the current accrual rules, temporary residents may be taxed on foreign exchange gains and losses on mortgages denominated in a foreign currency even though those gains and losses may never be realised. This is because section EH 4(9)(d) requires persons to calculate a base price adjustment at the date they cease to be a New Zealand resident. The problem is most evident with expatriate employees on short-term assignments in New Zealand who have mortgages denominated in the currency of their country of origin. 17.27 In the case of loans, some taxpayers will be relieved from complying with the accrual rules because the loans are for private and domestic purposes. Other taxpayers will be relieved from accounting for foreign exchange gains and losses during the term of an arrangement on other assets and liabilities under the new cash basis rules, but will still be subject to section EH 4(9)(d). 17.28 We propose introducing further relief for temporary residents who are able to claim cash basis status, in order to ease compliance burdens. They will be exempt from section EH 4(9)(d) provided they become non-resident for tax purposes within three years of initially obtaining tax residence. 17.29 This relief will apply to financial arrangements to which the person was a party before first becoming a New Zealand resident. The three-year term is consistent with the exemption in the foreign investment fund rules for temporary residents. 106 CHAPTER 18 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACCRUAL RULES AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX ACT Proposed policy •Retain section EH 8(1) to clarify that the accrual rules determine the amount and the timing of income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements. •Recognise that the core provisions of the Act determine assessability or deductibility of income or expenditure. •Ensure the transfer pricing rules override the accrual rules to determine the amount of consideration paid or received in applicable cross-border financial arrangements. •Clarify that income or expenditure of a financial arrangement issued or held by a controlled foreign company is to be determined under the accrual rules except in the first year in which attributed foreign income is calculated. Section CG 11(5)(b) will apply in that case, to deem the consideration for the financial arrangement to be the market value (or adjusted base price under that section). •Repeal section CE (3)(1)(b) but retain a targeted non-resident withholding tax anti-avoidance provision. The accrual rules and other provisions of the Act 18.1 Section EH 8 governs the relationship between the accrual rules and the rest of the Act. Section EH 8(1) is the general provision. It provides that: Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, gross income or expenditure in an income year in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified accrual rules shall be calculated under those rules. 18.2 The phrase “notwithstanding any other provision in this Act” inadequately deals with the relationship between the accrual rules and the rest of the Act. The way the provision is drafted implies a broader application than may have been intended. For example, an extreme interpretation may be that the provision overrides the application of the general anti-avoidance provision. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACCRUAL RULES AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 107 18.3 Section EH 8(2) relates to property that is transferred under financial arrangements. The purpose of section EH 8(2) is to ensure consistency between the price at which property is transferred under a financial arrangement and the price used as a basis for applying other provisions of the Act (for example, the cost basis for depreciation purposes). No changes are recommended to the provision other than to include reference to services as well as property, an amendment that arises as a result of our proposals in chapter 15. Practical difficulties 18.4 Section EH 8(1) is capable of being misconstrued, thus producing uncertainty as to the application of provisions outside the accrual rules. Examples of such provisions are the anti-avoidance provision and the transfer pricing provisions. Options for change 18.5 The role of section EH 8(1), in our view, should be to deal with conflicting rules in the Act regarding the amount of accrual income or expenditure to be taken into account for tax purposes and the allocation of that amount to income years. The provision should apply when another section of the Act dealing with the amount or timing of income or expenditure from financial arrangements dictates a result different from that under the accrual rules. The general rule is that in the absence of any indication to the contrary, the accrual rules should apply. 18.6 The provision should not override the core assessability and deductibility provisions in the Act except by explicit amendment of the deductibility or assessability provisions. An example of this type of amendment is our proposal to allow a deduction for expenditure under a base price adjustment if the general deductibility provisions do not apply but a loss arises under a financial arrangement because of income that is taxed, but unrealised, in earlier years. 18.7 Section EH 8(1) should more clearly reflect this purpose. We also intend to clarify problematic relationships between particular provisions. 18.8 The Valabh Committee recommended that section EH 8(1) be repealed because its role seemed to be merely declaratory as to the primacy of the accrual rules for calculating income or expenditure. The Committee believed that conflicts between the accrual rules and other provisions of the Act could be resolved by taking a scheme and purpose approach to interpreting the Act. However, simply repealing the provision would, in our view, create more uncertainty because the scheme and purpose of the Act, and the primacy of conflicting policy intents may not be readily evident. 108 Specific issues Section GD 13 18.9 Commentators have in the past raised the issue of whether section EH 8(1) precludes the transfer pricing provisions from applying. 18.10 The transfer pricing provisions aim to stop manipulation of income by the payment of inadequate or excessive consideration for the transfer of goods, services, intangibles and loans between jurisdictions. Section GD 13(3) and (4) deems an amount of consideration payable or receivable by a taxpayer under an arrangement to be equal to an arm’s length amount for all purposes of the Act. 18.11 The transfer pricing rules are intended to have overriding effect and should determine the appropriate cashflows used to calculate income or expenditure under the accrual rules as well as any other provisions of the Act. Any redraft of section EH 8(1) should ensure this outcome continues. Section CG 11(5) 18.12 The controlled foreign company rules attribute income derived by non- resident companies to New Zealand resident owners of that company. 18.13 The amount attributed is the income or loss of the controlled foreign company that would be calculated in accordance with the Act (modified by any rules detailed in section CG 11) as if the company were resident in New Zealand. 18.14 Section CG 11(5) provides rules for calculating the acquisition price of a financial arrangement held by a controlled foreign company. There are two problems with this provision. First, given the wording of section CG 11(2), it is not clear whether the controlled foreign company rules or the accrual rules take precedence in determining the acquisition price of an arrangement. 18.15 The income or expenditure of a controlled foreign company is intended to be calculated as if the company was a New Zealand resident, but subject to the special rules provided in section CG 11. This relationship will be clarified. 18.16 Secondly, the definition of “acquisition price” in section CG 11(5)(a) does not give the correct result, so we propose repealing the section. It provides that the acquisition price of a financial arrangement is the value of that arrangement at the end of the immediately preceding period. This means the acquisition price will fluctuate from year to year as the value of the arrangement changes, and will give incorrect results in the year that the base price adjustment applies. The appropriate acquisition price, if a person has had attributed foreign income in a previous period, is that calculated under the accrual rules or section CG 11(5)(b). RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACCRUAL RULES AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 109 18.17 Section CG 11(5)(b) applies if no attributed foreign income is calculated in the previous period. The acquisition price is the market value of the instrument or the adjusted acquisition price. This is appropriate because it is analogous to a taxpayer entering the tax base. Section CE 3(1)(b) 18.18 Section CE 3(1)(b) includes in assessable income of residents the amount of the redemption payment received by a person on a commercial bill if that bill was held at any time by a non-resident. A redemption payment is defined in the Act as the difference between the amount paid to the holder of a bill upon redemption and the amount received by the original issuer of the bill. Section CE 3(1)(b) is designed to prevent non-residents avoiding non-resident withholding tax on the redemption payment by disposing of the bills to a resident immediately before maturity of the bills. 18.19 A resident taxpayer who redeemed such a bill is subject to tax on the full amount of the difference between the face value of the bill and the issue price, even though the real gain may be considerably less. (For example, the taxpayer might have purchased it for considerably more than the original issue price.) 18.20 Section CE 3(1)(b) is an anti-avoidance provision which could render the entire redemption payment assessable, whereas a base price adjustment under the accrual rules would give only the difference between the purchase price paid by the person redeeming the bill and the redemption value (assuming no interest coupons are paid). This difference in outcome raises the issue of the compatibility of section CE 3(1)(b) with the accrual rules, and whether section EH 8 effectively makes section CE 3(1)(b) redundant as a charging provision. 18.21 The Valabh Committee, in its final report, recommended the repeal of section CE 3(1)(b) because it was a crude anti-avoidance provision. It mentioned the fact that with bearer instruments, unless they were directly acquired from non-residents, ownership cannot be traced. 32 The Committee also considered that with the introduction of the approved issuer levy for registered securities and the zero rating of non-resident withholding tax on such securities, the retention of the provision could not be justified. Proposed reform 18.22 We consider that the accrual provisions and section CE 3(1)(b) can be made compatible. The purpose behind section CE 3(1)(b), to prevent a non- resident selling commercial bills to residents to avoid non-resident withholding tax, remains relevant, although we agree the current provision is too broad. In open capital markets, a broad-brush anti-avoidance provision such as section CE 3(1)(b) is not appropriate or feasible because the tax residence of the bearer of traded bonds is unknown to the purchaser. 32 The Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income Capital, The Valabh Committee, October 1992, page 100. 110 18.23 The accrual rules should be the main provision used to calculate income or expenditure from all financial arrangements, including commercial bills. The anti-avoidance flavour of section CE 3(1)(b) should be retained but it need not remain in its present form. The provision could be moved to Part G of the Act and apply only where an arrangement exists to defeat the application of the non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy rules.
